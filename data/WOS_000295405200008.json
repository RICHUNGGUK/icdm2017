An important aspect of interpolation is accurate estimation of edge orientations. This work introduces contour stencils, a new method for estimating the image contours based on total variation along curves. Contour stencils are able to distinguish lines of different orientations, curves, corners, and other geometric features with a computationally efficient formula. Contour stencils are applied in designing an edge directed color interpolation method. The method incorporates an efficient approximation of deconvolution. Although most interpolation methods that involve deconvolution require either solving a large linear system or running many iterations, this method has linear complexity in the number of pixels and can be computed in one or a small number of passes through the image. Comparisons show that the proposed interpolation is competitive with existing methods.", "paper_title": "Contour Stencils: Total Variation along Curves for Adaptive Image Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000295405200008"}
