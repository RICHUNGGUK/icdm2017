By appropriately modifying the Shannon capacity formula, an analytical expression for the capacity of M-ary pulse position modulation (PPM) signals in the presence of`NBI is obtained. Performance evaluation results for the capacity of such signals as a function of the NBI carrier frequency and power are also presented.", "paper_title": "Capacity Performance Analysis of M-ary PPM TH-UWB Systems in the Presence of Narrowband Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000260128500007"}
