Recent studies focus on the deployment of throwboxes to maximize data delivery opportunities. However, as a storage device, the storage usage of throwboxes has seldom been addressed by existing work. In this paper, the storage allocation of throwboxes is studied as two specific problems: (1) if throwboxes are fixed at particular places, how to allocate storage to the throwboxes; and (2) if throwboxes are deployable, how to conduct storage allocation in combination with throwbox deployment. Two optimization models are proposed to calculate the optimal storage allocation with a knowledge of the contact history of users. Real trace based simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to not only decrease data loss on throwboxes but also improve the efficiency of data delivery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
