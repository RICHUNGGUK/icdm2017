More precisely, we demonstrate how this approach can support the rescheduling process in enterprise resource planning (ERP)-controlled environments. Our demonstrative example, based on a real scenario in the aluminum industry, illustrates how a genetic algorithm and a real-time discrete event simulation model can be integrated within the common enterprise information systems.
