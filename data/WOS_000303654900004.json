Our analysis relies on a stochastic model of the noise without assuming a specific form of distribution. We use this model to derive theoretical bounds for the errors in the difference estimates and obtain an easily computable difference parameter that is provably near-optimal. Numerical results closely resemble the theory and show that we obtain accurate derivative estimates even when the noisy function is deterministic.", "paper_title": "Estimating Derivatives of Noisy Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000303654900004"}
