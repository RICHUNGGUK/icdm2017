Motivated by the application of recognition of human motion in image sequences, we consider a class of models that include linear dynamics, both stable and marginally stable ( periodic), both minimum and nonminimum phases, driven by non-Gaussian processes. This requires extending existing learning and system identification algorithms to handle periodic modes and nonminimum-phase behavior while taking into account higher order statistics of the data. Once a model is identified, we define a kernel-based cord distance between models, which includes their dynamics, their initial conditions, and input distribution. This is made possible by a novel kernel defined between two arbitrary (non-Gaussian) distributions, which is computed by efficiently solving an optimal transport problem. We validate our choice of models, inference algorithm, and distance on the tasks of human motion synthesis ( sample paths of the learned models) and recognition (nearest-neighbor classification in the computed distance). However, our work can be applied more broadly where one needs to compare historical data while taking into account periodic trends, nonminimum-phase behavior, and non-Gaussian input distributions.", "paper_title": "Classification and recognition of dynamical models: The role of phase, independent components, kernels, and optimal transport", "paper_id": "WOS:000249343900007"}
