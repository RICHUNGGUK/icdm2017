Using this model, the performance merits of the OTIS-hypercube are discussed. We also compare the performance of the OTIS-hypercube with that of equivalent hypercube network under different implementation constraints. Compared to pure simulation results, the presented model can serve as a more appropriate and compact method to display the performance characteristics of OTIS-hypercube networks.
