It is highly influenced by the management techniques of available resources in these cyber-physical environments. We consider QoS and resource management influenced by two most important resources; the computing (CPU) and networking resources. In this paper, we survey existing DIME-relevant QoS and resource management techniques for these two resources, present their taxonomy, compare them, and show their impacts on DIMEs. Finally, we discuss appropriateness of those techniques in a sample DIME scenario.", "paper_title": "QoS and resource management in distributed interactive multimedia environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000286103800005"}
