A problem for gate-size optimization under coupling-noise and timing constraints is formulated, and is broken down into two subproblems of gate-size optimization under noise and timing constraints, respectively. The subproblem of gate-size optimization under noise constraints is solved as a fixpoint computation problem on a complete lattice. The proposed algorithm to solve this problem is guaranteed to yield the optimal solution, provided it exists. The subproblem for circuit optimization under timing constraints is considered as a geometrical programming problem. The solutions to the two problems are finally combined to solve the original problem in a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) framework. Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithms are reported for the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) benchmarks and larger circuits. The obtained results are compared to the approach where successive iterations of gate sizing are performed for timing and for noise reduction independently. This alternative design approach is driven by the algorithms used to solving the mentioned subproblems, respectively.", "paper_title": "Gate-size optimization under timing constraints for coupling-noise reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000237956000009"}
