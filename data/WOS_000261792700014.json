We show that every network running a greedy scheduling policy is universally stable at any injection rate r < 1/(Cd), where d is the largest number of links crossed by any packet and C is the maximum link capacity. We also show that system-wide time priority scheduling policies are universally stable at any injection rate r < 1/(C(d - 1)). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
