This paper proposes a technique for efficiently and accurately detecting occurrences of design patterns included in source codes. We use both static and dynamic analyses to achieve the detection with high accuracy. Moreover, to reduce computation and maintenance costs, detection conditions are hierarchically specified based on Pree's meta patterns as common structures of design patterns. The usage of Prolog to represent the detection conditions enables us to easily add and modify them. Finally, we have implemented an automated tool as an Eclipse plug-in and conducted experiments with Java programs. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Design pattern detection by using meta patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000255648700007"}
