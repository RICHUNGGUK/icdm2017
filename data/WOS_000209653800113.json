Miniaturization and beamwidth enhancement of a patch antenna are the two main areas to be discussed. By folding the edge of the radiating patch with loading slots, the size of the patch antenna is 44.8% smaller than a conventional half wavelength patch, which allows it to be accommodated inside handsets easily. Wide beamwidth is obtained by surrounding the patch with a dielectric substrate and supporting the antenna by a metallic block. A measured half power beamwidth of 124 is achieved. The impedance bandwidth of the antenna is over 10%, and the 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth is 3.05%. The proposed antenna covers a wide elevation angle and complete azimuth range. A parametric study of the effect of the metallic block and the surrounding dielectric substrate on the gain at a low elevation angle and the axial ratio of the proposed antenna are presented.", "paper_title": "Circularly Polarized Patch Antenna for Future 5G Mobile Phones", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800113"}
