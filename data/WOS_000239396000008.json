The trade-off between these two fidelities is investigated, and numerous examples of optimal N --> M-A + M-B cloning machines are exhibited using a generic method. A generalisation to more than two sets of clones is also discussed. Finally, an optical implementation of some such machines is proposed. This paper is an extended version of [Phys. Rev.
