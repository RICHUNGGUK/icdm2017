SPS achieves the first criterion using a novel technique whereby the M2M device captures incoming or outgoing moments of timing messages. The second criterion is achieved by adaptively adjusting the resynchronization interval. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of SPS.
