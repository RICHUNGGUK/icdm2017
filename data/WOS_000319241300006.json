However, the traditional histogram equalization (HE) method usually results in extreme contrast enhancement, which causes an unnatural look and visual artifacts of the processed image. In this paper, we propose a novel histogram equalization method that is composed of an automatic histogram separation module and an intensity transformation module. First, the proposed histogram separation module is a combination of the proposed prompt multiple thresholding procedure and an optimum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) calculation to separate the histogram in small-scale detail. As the final step of the proposed process, the use of the intensity transformation module can enhance the image with complete brightness preservation for each generated sub-histogram. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only retains the shape features of the original histogram but also enhances the contrast effectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
