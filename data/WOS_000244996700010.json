Here, a shape is defined by a parameterised cross-section that is placed at several positions along a trajectory lying on a freeform surface. The shape is determined in such a way that a seamless connection is established with the existing shape. The mapping between the parameters and the eventual shape is achieved by specifying combinations of geometric and algebraic constraints in a generic shape definition. Specific properties of the wrap shape can be declared in this definition. Parameterised, contraint-based wrapping provides a way of defining freeform geometry in a more intuitive and controlled way than previously possible for similar shapes. It can be applied in a wide variety of areas, and provides an important addition to the collection of existing modelling techniques. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
