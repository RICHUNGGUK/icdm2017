The generalized exponential function is employed to describe Integral Absolute Error (IAE) performance versus sampling period by Truetime toolbox under Matlab environment. and the sampling periods are scheduled to obtain the optimal integrated performance based on Kuhn-Tucker Theorem, which are subject to the stability of every control loop and the bandwidth on available network resource. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our method. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
