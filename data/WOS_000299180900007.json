This multiobjective line search procedure exploits the structure of the line-constrained efficient set, presenting a faster compression rate of the search segment than single-objective golden section line search. The proposed multiobjective optimization algorithm converges to points that satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker first-order necessary conditions for efficiency (the Pareto-critical points). Numerical results on two antenna design problems support the conclusion that the proposed method can solve robustly difficult nonlinear multiobjective problems defined in terms of computationally expensive black-box objective functions.", "paper_title": "Multicriteria optimization with a multiobjective golden section line search", "paper_id": "WOS:000299180900007"}
