It is assumed that the Bernoulli random variables characterizing delay measurements are correlated in consecutive time instants. The marginal distribution of each of these variables, specified by the probability of a delay in the measurement, as well as their correlation function, are known. Using an innovation approach, the filtering, fixed-point and fixed-interval smoothing recursive algorithms are obtained without requiring the state-space model generating the signal; they use only the covariance functions of the signal and the noise, the delay probabilities and the correlation function of the Bernoulli variables. The algorithms are applied to a particular transmission model with stand-by sensors for the immediate replacement of a failed unit.", "paper_title": "Least-squares linear smoothers from randomly delayed observations with correlation in the delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508900019"}
