Using an axiomatic characterisation of a Noether class, we prove that if a poset belongs to a Noether class, then so does the poset of the finite descending chains. When applied to the poset of finitely generated ideals of a ring, this helps towards a unified constructive proof of the Hilbert basis theorem for all Noether classes.", "paper_title": "Noetherian orders", "paper_id": "WOS:000287547400004"}
