This paper presents development of an electrically powered small air vehicle prototype based on aerodynamic analysis in wind tunnel and water tunnel tests. Firstly, two airframe models in triangle and Square wing planforms, each with a wingspan of 100 mm, are analyzed with a small-scale low speed wind tunnel. The purpose of the wind tunnel test is to examine the practical characteristics such as lift and drag coefficients. The test in a water tunnel is further carried Out to investigate the relationship between the vortex aerofoil design and turbulences created. In both wind tunnel and water tunnel tests, the airframe models, apparatus and the methodology are discussed, and the testing results Show that the triangle wing aerofoil appears greater maximum lift coefficient and little occurrence of vortex and turbulences. Secondly, based on the verified wing planform in the tunnel tests, a small air vehicle prototype was designed and fabricated. The ground and onboard subsystems or components, such as flight Control unit, vision system, and propulsion system etc., are Studied. The materials and fabrication processes are also presented in the paper. Finally, the developed air vehicle prototype is Successfully tested in the real flight. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
