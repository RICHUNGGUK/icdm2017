Frequently, separate resource control schemes are adopted to meet network availability and QoS objectives, respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-path transmission scheme that employs network coding technique to benefit both on QoS and availability. With the design of multiple disjoint paths from source to destination, where each path carries encoded data stream and the number of paths is greater than the number of original data streams, it is illustrated that not only the resilience to network failure can be achieved but also the end-to-end QoS is improved. The proposed scheme can be properly designed to meet the most stringent QoS and availability requirements while efficiently utilizing the network resource.", "paper_title": "An Integrated Failure and QoS Recoverable Transmission Scheme Based on Multi-path Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000268197700003"}
