We propose a novel feature fusion concept for plate extraction. The image-feature extraction process is modeled as a feature-detection problem in noise. The geometric features are probabilistically modeled and detected under various detection thresholds. These detection results are then fused within the Bayesian framework to obtain the features for further processing. Along with a probabilistic model, a pixels voting algorithm is also tested through threshold variation.", "paper_title": "License plate localization based on a probabilistic model", "paper_id": "WOS:000276149200010"}
