Our simulation method is able to achieve these goals in an emergent way by using a variant of avalanching, which is a principle followed by many physical self-organized systems. We also use the same approach to generate initial conditions for the erosion, so that the combined algorithm is a complete terrain modeling method based only on self-organization.
