If the existing multidimensional indices are employed to evaluate partially-dimensional range queries, then a great deal of information that is irrelevant to the queries also has to be read from disk. A modification of R*-tree is described in this paper to ameliorate such a situation. Discussions and experiments indicate that the proposed modification can clearly improve the performance of partially-dimensional range queries, especially for large datasets.", "paper_title": "Efficient evaluation of partially-dimensional range queries using adaptive R*-tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000241155300067"}
