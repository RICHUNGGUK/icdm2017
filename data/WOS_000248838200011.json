This paper focuses on the aggregation of fuzzy preference relations and presents two optimization aggregation approaches to determine the relative weights of individual fuzzy preference relations so that they can be aggregated into a collective fuzzy preference relation in an additively optimal manner. Multiplicative preference relations can also be incorporated into the two optimization aggregation approaches, but need to be transformed into fuzzy format using appropriate transformation techniques. The proposed two approaches are tested and examined with two numerical examples and prove to be simple, effective and practical. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
