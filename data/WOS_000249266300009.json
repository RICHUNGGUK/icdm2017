It was found that the effects on synchronizing ability of the two different structures by cutting a link are completely opposite. The synchronizing ability will decrease if the change is from bidirectional ring to bidirectional chain. Moreover, the change on synchronizing ability will be four times if the number of N is large enough. However, it will increase obviously from unidirectional ring to unidirectional chain. It will be N21(2W) times if the number of N is large enough. The numerical simulations confirm the conclusion in quality. This paper also discusses the effects on synchronization by adding one link with different length d to these two different structures. It can be seen that the effects are different. Theoretical results are accordant to numerical simulations. Synchronization is an essential physics problem. These results proposed in this paper have some important reference meanings on the real world networks, such as the bioecological system networks, the designing of the circuit, etc.", "paper_title": "The changes on synchronizing ability of coupled networks from ring networks to chain networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249266300009"}
