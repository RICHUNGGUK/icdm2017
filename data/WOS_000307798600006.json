The soil model used for the applications can be derived from a potential energy function and is thermodynamically consistent. The Galerkin method is used to obtain a weak form of the governing equations and a \"stress-suction coupling matrix\" is derived in the discretization in space by finite element method. The implicit integration algorithm is incorporated in a code for partially saturated soil dynamics. The framework of generalized plasticity is presented and examples are shown including subsidence above a model gas reservoir. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
