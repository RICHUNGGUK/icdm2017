By making use of the information on the channel conditions and the queue lengths, the proposed CQAF packet scheduling scheme efficiently allocates the subcarriers, transmission power and modulation level to users under the constraints of total transmission power, the number of subcarriers, bit-error-rate (BER) requirement and generalized processor sharing (GPS)-based fairness requirement. The numerical results show that the proposed CQAF packet scheduling scheme can reduce the transmission delay and queue length significantly while maximizing system throughput and maintaining fairness among users.", "paper_title": "Cross-layer packet scheduling for downlink multiuser OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273575000015"}
