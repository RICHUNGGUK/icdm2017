We first use a numerical analytical approach to extract the shape information from each mesh triangle in a better way than the sparse sampling approach. These measurements are then combined to build a probability density descriptor via kernel density estimation techniques, with a rule-based bandwidth assignment. Finally, we explore descriptor fusion schemes. Our analytical approach reveals the true potential of density-based descriptors, one of its representatives reaching the top ranking position among competing methods.", "paper_title": "Density-based shape descriptors for 3D object retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800042"}
