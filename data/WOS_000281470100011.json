The methodology is based on a hierarchical scheme of partitional clusterings fusing information represented by non-negative intensity and textural image features. Partitional clustering is realized by factorization of the feature matrices under non-negativity constraints. In order to enhance its clustering performance a dyadic cluster merging approach has been devised. The spatial distribution of the mined radiographic patterns comprises a cue for the assessment of the extent of an infection. The results of the comprehensive experimentation performed show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 94.1%, outperforming both representative unsupervised and supervised mining approaches.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised mining of radiografic pulmonary infection patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000281470100011"}
