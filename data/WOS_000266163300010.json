The goal is to determine in successive frames the region which best matches, in terms of a similarity measure, a ROI defined in a reference frame. Some tracking methods define similarity measures which efficiently combine several visual features into a probability density function (PDF) representation, thus building a discriminative model of the ROI. This approach implies dealing with PDFs with domains of definition of high dimension. To overcome this obstacle, a standard solution is to assume independence between the different features in order to bring out low-dimension marginal laws and/or to make some parametric assumptions on the PDFs at the cost of generality. We discard these assumptions by proposing to compute the Kullback-Leibler divergence between high-dimensional PDFs using the kth nearest neighbor framework. In consequence, the divergence is expressed directly from the samples, i.e., without explicit estimation of the underlying PDFs. As an application, we defined 5, 7, and 13-dimensional feature vectors containing color information (including pixel-based, gradient-based and patch-based) and spatial layout. The proposed procedure performs tracking allowing for translation and scaling of the ROI. Experiments show its efficiency on a movie excerpt and standard test sequences selected for the specific conditions they exhibit: partial occlusions, variations of luminance, noise, and complex motion.", "paper_title": "High-Dimensional Statistical Measure for Region-of-Interest Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000266163300010"}
