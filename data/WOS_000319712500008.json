Our main results are alternate proofs that deciding whether a no-communication classical winning strategy exists for certain games (called forbidden-edge and covering games) is NP-complete, while the problem of deciding if these games admit a nonsignalling winning strategy is in P. We discuss relations between quantum winning strategies and orthogonality graphs. We also show that every pseudotelepathy game yields both a proof of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem and an instance of a two-prover interactive proof system that is classically sound, but that becomes unsound when provers use shared entanglement.
