We point out that the existing theory of motor control fails to provide viable solutions. However, by adopting a generalized approach to the nonconvex optimization problem with the Young measure theory, we show that a precise movement control is possible even with stochastic control signals. Numerical results clearly demonstrate that a considerable significant improvement of movement precisions is achieved. Our generalized approach proposes a new way to solve optimization problems in biological systems when a precise control is needed.", "paper_title": "Controlling precise movement with stochastic signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000276605200006"}
