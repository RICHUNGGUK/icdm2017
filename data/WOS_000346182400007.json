Two groups of metadata records were included in an experimental study: an experimental group composed of 300 XML-based records without XML declarations and with file extensions according to the name of related metadata standards, and a control group composed of 300 XML-based records with the normal XML structure. These were analysed through an experimental approach. The two sets of records were published on two separate websites and then the sites were introduced to Google and Yahoo!. Findings showed that Google and Yahoo! indexed and retrieved all the tag names relating to the experimental group. However they did not index the tag names in the control group's records. Based on the findings, some patterns are suggested to metadata creators and Web search engine developers.", "paper_title": "Does discarding XML declarations and changing file extensions improve the indexability and visibility of metadata tag names in web search engines?", "paper_id": "WOS:000346182400007"}
