The asynchronous switching considered here means that the switching instants of the candidate controllers lag behind those of the system modes. The concept of mismatched control rate is introduced. By using the multiple Lyapunov function approach and the average dwell time technique, a sufficient condition for the existence a stabilising switching law is first derived to guarantee the regularity, causality and exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of asynchronous switching. The stabilising switching law is characterised by a upper bound on the mismatched control rate and a lower bound on the average dwell time. Then, the corresponding solvability condition for a set of mode-dependent state feedback controllers is established by using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Control discrete-time switched singular systems with state delays under asynchronous switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000320356300008"}
