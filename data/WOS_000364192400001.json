In estimating interaction effects, the inverse of the propensity weighting (IPW) method has been widely advocated despite the immediate availability of other competing methods such as G-computation estimates. This paper compares the advocated IPW method, the G-computation method, and our new Tree-based standardization method, which we call the Interaction effect Tree (IT). The IT procedure uses a likelihood-based decision rule to divide the subgroups into homogeneous groups where the G-computation can be applied. Our simulation studies indicate that the IT-based method along with the G-computation works robustly while the advocated IPW method needs some caution in its weighting. We applied the IT-based method to assess the effect of being overweight or obese on coronary artery calcification (CAC) in the Chicago Healthy Aging Study cohort.
