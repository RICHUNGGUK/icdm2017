Thereafter, the surrogate model can be employed to reduce the computational cost of a variance-based sensitivity analysis (VBSA) of the model output. Here, we draw attention to a procedure in which an adaptive sequential design is employed to derive surrogate models and estimate sensitivity indices for different sub-groups of inputs. The results of such group-wise VBSAs are then used to select inputs for a final VBSA. Our procedure is particularly useful when there is little prior knowledge about the response surface and the aim is to explore both the global variability and local nonlinear features of the model output. Our conclusions are based on computer experiments involving the process-based river basin model INCA-N, in which outputs like the average annual riverine load of nitrogen can be regarded as functions of 19 model parameters.
