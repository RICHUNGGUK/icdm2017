The evaluation of NCS properties such as stability and performance is very important given that these systems are typically deployed in critical settings. This paper presents the Networked Control Systems Wind Tunnel (NCSWT), an integrated modeling and simulation tool for the evaluation of Networked Control Systems (NCS). NCSWT integrates Matlab/Simulink and ns-2 for modeling and simulation of NCS using the High Level Architecture (HLA) standard. The tool is composed of two parts, the design-time models and the run-time components. The design-time models use Model Integrated Computing (MIC) to define HLA-based model constructs such as federates representing the simulators and interactions representing the communication between the simulators. MIC techniques facilitate the modeling and design of complex systems by using abstractions defined in domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) to describe the systems. The design-time models represent the control system dynamics and networking system behaviors in order to facilitate the run-time simulation of a NCS. The run-time components represent the main software components and interfaces for the actual realization of a NCS simulation using the HLA framework. Our implementation of the NCSWT based on HLA guarantees accurate time synchronization and data communication. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the tool as well as evaluate the impact of network effects on NCS. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
