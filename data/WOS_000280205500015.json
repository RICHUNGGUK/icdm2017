Visual word weighting scheme has critical impact to the performance of BoW method. In this paper, we propose a new visual word weighting scheme which is referred as emerging patterns weighting (EP-weighting). The EP-weighting scheme can efficiently capture the co-occurrence relationships of visual words and improve the effectiveness of video annotation. The proposed scheme firstly finds emerging patterns (EPs) of visual keywords in training dataset. And then an adaptive weighting assignment is performed for each visual word according to EPs. The adjusted BoW features are used to train classifiers for video annotation. A systematic performance study on TRECVID corpus containing 20 semantic concepts shows that the proposed scheme is more effective than other popular existing weighting schemes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
