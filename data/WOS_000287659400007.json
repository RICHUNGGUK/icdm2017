In this article, we first present an overview of the interference coordination strategies in OFDM-based multihop cellular networks. Then, based on the framework of third-generation LTE-Advanced networks with multihop relaying, several typical static or semi-static interference coordination schemes are proposed to improve the coverage and increase the cell edge data rate. By applying these schemes, the radio resources can be reused with certain limitations on either the frequency or time domain, or even both of them. Dynamic system-level simulations are also carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed interference coordination schemes.", "paper_title": "INTERFERENCE COORDINATION FOR OFDM-BASED MULTIHOP LTE-ADVANCED NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287659400007"}
