The moves of the games are higher-order functionals in the language of finite types. All interpretations discussed treat the exponential-free fragment of linear logic in a common way. They only differ in how much advantage one idle players has in the exponential games. We discuss how the several choices for the interpretation of the modalities correspond to various well-known functional interpretations of intuitionistic logic, including Coders Dialectica interpretation and Kreisel's modified realizability.
