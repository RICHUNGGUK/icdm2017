Specifically, the factors are analyzed from a cost and benefit perspective grounded in social exchange theory. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory study using semi-structured interviews is conducted first to explore context-specific cost and benefit factors. Based on the exploratory study results and TRA, a research model and hypotheses are developed. A questionnaire survey is then conducted among professionals working in contractors in Hong Kong. The quantitative data are analyzed using structural equation modelling. Findings - The research results indicate that individuals' attitudes toward knowledge sharing are positively affected by knowledge self-efficacy and knowledge feedback, while negatively affected by losing face. Further, it is revealed that attitude toward knowledge sharing significantly determines intention to share knowledge, which then determines knowledge sharing behavior. Originality/value - The paper is one of the first to employ existing theories in social psychology to examine knowledge sharing behavior in the construction sector. The research results provide important implications for construction companies to promote knowledge sharing in project teams.", "paper_title": "Attitude toward knowledge sharing in construction teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000311815400010"}
