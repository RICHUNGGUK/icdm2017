However most unstructured grid rendering algorithms only employ one-dimensional transfer functions. This paper proposes a novel pre-integrated Projected Tetrahedra (PT) rendering technique that applies bivariate transfer functions on unstructured grids. For each type of bivariate transfer function, an analytical form that pre-integrates the contribution of a ray segment in one tetrahedron is derived, and can be precomputed as a lookup table to compute the color and opacity in a projected tetrahedron on-the-fly, Further, we show how to approximate the integral using the pre-integration method for faster unstructured grid rendering. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach with a variety of examples and comparisons with one-dimensional transfer functions.", "paper_title": "Bivariate Transfer Functions on Unstructured Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000268217500011"}
