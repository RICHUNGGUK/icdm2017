For the development of the RICA, a top-down software driven approach was taken and revealed as one of the key design decisions for a flexible, easy to program, low-power architecture. These features make RICA an architecture that inherently solves the main design requirements of modern low-power devices. Results show that it delivers considerably less power consumption when compared to leading VLIW and low-power digital signal processors, but still maintaining their throughput performance.", "paper_title": "The reconfigurable instruction cell array", "paper_id": "WOS:000251952100009"}
