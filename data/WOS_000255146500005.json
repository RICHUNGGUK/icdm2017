The slope of the backfill, wall friction and wall inclination were taken into account in the calculation. Two solutions were proposed and a computer program was coded for each one. By parametric study, it is observed that, the slope of the backfill, wall friction and wall inclination influences the results greatly, especially for the wall inclination. The comparison with existing solutions was made and a good agreement was observed. The generalized slip line solution is found useful in determining the active earth pressure in general cases, and can be referred to for design purpose. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
