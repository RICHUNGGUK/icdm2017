Three indicators, namely the concentration index, the Matthew index and the coefficient of variation, are adopted to measure the uneven distribution of academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences among different regions and disciplines. The empirical analysis demonstrates the existence of the Matthew effect in China's science for the above two dimensions. Yet, this effect has weakened for all regions with the exception of Beijing. We argue that this uneven distribution of the nation's brightest minds makes scientifically competitive regions and disciplines even more competitive while putting those less developed regions and research domains at further disadvantage.", "paper_title": "The Matthew effect in China's science: evidence from academicians of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "paper_id": "WOS:000350337000014"}
