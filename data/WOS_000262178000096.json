Although the use of Fuzzy Logic partially reduces the software systems maintenance problems associated to vagueness modelling, it introduces other problems in tuning the numbers used by the system to model such vagueness. On the other hand, Ripple Down Rules (RDR) provide for easy maintenance when dealing with Knowledge-based systems but it does not allow to model terminological vagueness. The work presented in this paper shows the fundamentals of a theoretical approach that combines both methodologies RDR and Fuzzy Logic into a semantics-driven, this framework arc clear, although a number research issues remain framework.
