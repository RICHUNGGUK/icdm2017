We present a quantitative argument which shows that Searle's thought experiment is not relevant to Turing's Test for intelligence. Instead, we consider a narrower form of Turing's Test, one that is restricted to the playing of a chess endgame, in which the equivalent of Searle's argument does apply. An analysis of time/space trade-offs in the playing of chess endgames shows that Michie's concept of Human Window offers a hint of what a machine's mental representations might need to be like to be considered equivalent to human cognition.", "paper_title": "FROM CHINESE ROOM TO HUMAN WINDOW", "paper_id": "WOS:000285373900002"}
