We propose an optimisation scheme during underload scenarios where proxy groups are dynamically formed exploiting both interfaces. The scheme integrates a reward mechanism that compensates a proxy while carrying other group members' traffic, and deals with churn (joining and leaving of nodes) in a cell area. For traffic flows that approximate knowledge about current services we show that the scheme can achieve energy savings of 60% for all mobile nodes as whole. We also demonstrate the impact on disruption-sensitive flows as a function of the traffic mix, and that the use of rewards for selection of proxies is a fair mechanism in the long term.
