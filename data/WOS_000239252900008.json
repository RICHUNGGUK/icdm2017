Design/methodology/approach - Three-dimensional transient heat conduction in homogeneous materials using different time-stepping methods such as finite difference (Theta explicit, implicit and Crank-Nicolson) and finite element (weighted residual and least squared) methods. Iterative solvers used in the paper are conjugate gradient (CG), preconditioned gradient, least square CG, conjugate gradient squared (CGS), preconditioned CGS, bi-conjugate gradient (BCG), preconditioned BCG, bi-conjugate gradient stabilized (BCGSTAB), reconditioned BCGSTAB and Gaussian elimination with incomplete Cholesky factorization. Findings - Provides information on which time-stepping method is the most accurate, which solver is the fastest to solve a symmetric and positive system of linear matrix equations of all those considered. Practical implications - Fortran 90 code given as an abstract can be very useful for graduate and postgraduate students to develop their own code. Originality/value - This paper offers practical help to an individual starting his/her research in the finite element technique and numerical methods.", "paper_title": "Finite element solution of transient heat conduction using iterative solvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000239252900008"}
