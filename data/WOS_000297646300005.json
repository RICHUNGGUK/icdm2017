A major problem in MFA is how to select appropriate parameters, k (1) and k (2), to construct the respective intrinsic and penalty graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method called nearest-neighbor (NN) classifier motivated marginal discriminant projections (NN-MDP). Motivated by the NN classifier, NN-MDP seeks a few projection vectors to prevent data samples from being wrongly categorized. Like MFA, NN-MDP can characterize the compactness and separability of samples simultaneously. Moreover, in contrast to MFA, NN-MDP can actively construct the intrinsic graph and penalty graph without unknown parameters. Experimental results on the ORL, Yale, and FERET face databases show that NN-MDP not only avoids the intractability, and high expense of neighborhood parameter selection, but is also more applicable to face recognition with NN classifier than other methods.", "paper_title": "Nearest-neighbor classifier motivated marginal discriminant projections for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000297646300005"}
