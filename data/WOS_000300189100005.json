Two schemes for pipelining particles under high performance computing environment, including an alternative Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) resampling algorithm and kernel function, are proposed so as to improve tracking performance and minimize execution time. Experimental results on a network of workstations composed of simple off-the-shelf hardware components show that global parallelizable scheme provides a promising resolution to clearly reduce execution time with increasing particles, compared with generic particle filtering.", "paper_title": "Distributed Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel based particle filtering for object tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000300189100005"}
