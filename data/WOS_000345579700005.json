In the present article, we propose the usage of open source GNU radio tools to build a full-software-defined radio implementation of cooperative relaying for an LTE-A downlink connection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, tested in open field, of the cooperative relaying in terms of augmented coverage and improved throughput, with a substantial added value provided by the SDR implementation in terms of both algorithmic flexibility and network reconfigurability.", "paper_title": "Open-Field Emulation of Cooperative Relaying in LTE-A Downlink Using the GNU Radio Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000345579700005"}
