The researchers have also built several prototype systems running on modern phone platforms and have evaluated their performance in experimental testbeds, in some cases organizing field trials for more extensive evaluations. Based on these experiences, they have identified several middleware research challenges along with possible solutions.", "paper_title": "Challenges and Lessons in Developing Middleware on Smart Phones", "paper_id": "WOS:000259922300013"}
