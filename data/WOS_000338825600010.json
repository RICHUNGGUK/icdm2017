This is applied to the genome of Nelumbo nucifera, the sacred lotus, which is the descendant of a duplicated basal eudicot genome. In concert with the reconstructed ancestor of the grape, we investigate early events in eudicot evolution and show that the chromosome number of the common ancestor of lotus and grape was likely between 5 and 7. We show that the duplication of the ancestor of lotus and the triplication of the ancestor of grape were not closely preceded by any additional such event before the divergence of their two lineages.
