This protocol comprises three steps: (1) detection of contaminant presence, (2) source identification and (3) consequence management. This paper intends to explore consequence management under source uncertainty, applying Minimize Maximum Regret (MMR) and Minimize Total Regret (MTR) approaches. An ant colony optimization algorithm is coupled with the EPANET network solver for structuring the MMR and MTR models to present a robust method for consequence management by selecting the best combination of hydrants and valves for isolation and contamination flushing out of the system. The proposed models are applied to network number 3 of EPANET to present its effectiveness and capabilities in developing effective consequence management strategies.", "paper_title": "Consequence management of chemical intrusion in water distribution networks under inexact scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000333684100012"}
