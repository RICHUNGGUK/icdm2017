The normal modeling simulation is investigated on specific test functions, and experimental results illustrate that the normal model is able to describe exactly the dynamics of the fitness sharing EAs and is a good platform to study the behavior of the fitness sharing EAs with regard to niching radius. The experimental results of the normal modeling simulation and the fitness sharing EAs verify the dilemma in finding optimal niche radius to achieve both good niching convergence and niching efficiency, for which a hybrid scheme is proposed to carry out the niching task.
