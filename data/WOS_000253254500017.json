Different from other ACO-based algorithms applied to MKP, BAS uses a pheromone laying method specially designed for the binary solution structure, and allows the generation of infeasible solutions in the solution construction procedure. A problem specific repair operator is incorporated to repair the infeasible solutions generated in every iteration. Pheromone update rule is designed in such a way that pheromone on the paths can be directly regarded as selecting probability. To avoid premature convergence, the pheromone re-initialization and different pheromone intensification strategy depending on the convergence status of the algorithm are incorporated. Experimental results show the advantages of BAS over other ACO-based approaches for the benchmark problems selected from OR library. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
