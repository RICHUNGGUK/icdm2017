Jobs running on multiclusters and, more generally, in grids, may require (processor) coallocation, i.e., the simultaneous allocation of resources (processors) in different clusters or subsystems of a grid. In this paper, we propose four scheduling policies for processor coallocation in multiclusters, and we assess with simulations their performance under a wide variety of parameter settings. In particular, in our simulations we use synthetic workloads and workloads derived from the logs of actual systems and from runtime measurements. We conclude that although coallocation makes scheduling more difficult and the wide-area communication critically impacts the performance, there is a wide range of realistic applications that may benefit from coallocation. However, unrestricted coallocation is not recommended: Limiting the total job size or the number or the sizes of their components improves performance.", "paper_title": "Scheduling policies for processor coallocation in multicluster systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247474500008"}
