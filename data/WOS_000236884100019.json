Presented in this paper is a cross-analysis of two languages for enterprise modelling and information systems development. The languages are the Unified Enterprise Modelling Language (UEML) and ISO/DIS 19440. The purpose of this cross-analysis is to make the languages more complete and well defined. The analysis includes a mapping between the languages. The results of the analysis can be used for further development of the languages which in the long run will beneficial for the interoperability of enterprises modelled in them.", "paper_title": "Facilitating interoperability: A cross-analysis of the language UEML and the standard ISO/DIS 19440", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100019"}
