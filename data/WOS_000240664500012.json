Despite recent advances in infrastructure to support these applications through the acquisition, interpretation and dissemination of context data from sensors, they remain prohibitively difficult to develop and have made little penetration beyond the laboratory. This situation persists largely due to a lack of appropriately high-level abstractions for describing, reasoning about and exploiting context information as a basis for adaptation. In this paper, we present our efforts to address this challenge, focusing on our novel approach involving the use of preference information as a basis for making flexible adaptation decisions. We also discuss our experiences in applying our conceptual and software frameworks for context and preference modelling to a case study involving the development of an adaptive communication application.
