Most of existing blind signal separation and extraction methods such as independent component analysis have constraints such as statistical independence, non-Gaussianity, and underdetermination, and they are not suitable for global signal extraction problem from noisy observations. We developed an estimation algorithm based on alternating iteration and the smart weighted averaging. The proposed method does not have strong assumptions such as independence or non-Gaussianity. Experimental results using a musical signal and a real electroencephalogram demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Blind Extraction of Global Signal From Multi-Channel Noisy Observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000283231200008"}
