In order to plan paths for pursuers to capture an evader in the pursuit-evasion game, a novel multi-step cooperative strategy is presented. Under this strategy, the pursuit-evasion game is studied in two stages. In the first stage we assume that the evader is always static in the workplace, and in the second stage the evader will move once it senses the existence of pursuers. A Daisy-Chain Formation algorithm and a sliding mode-based method are presented to control the pursuit. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed algorithm is proved to be convergent. At last, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
