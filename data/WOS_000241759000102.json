In the first stage, a genetic algorithm is used to identify good quality assets in terms of asset ranking. In the second stage, investment allocation in the selected good quality assets is optimized using a genetic algorithm based on Markowitz's theory. Through the two-stage genetic optimization process, an optimal portfolio can be determined. Experimental results reveal that the proposed double-stage genetic optimization algorithm for portfolio selection provides a very feasible and useful tool to assist the investors in planning their investment strategy and constructing their portfolio.", "paper_title": "A double-stage genetic optimization algorithm for portfolio selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000102"}
