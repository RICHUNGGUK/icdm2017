When an interface is personalized to make useful features more accessible for it user's current task, however, there may be it negative impact on the user's awareness of the full set of available features, making future tasks more difficult. To assess this tradeoff we introduce awareness as an evaluation metric to be used in conjunction with performance. We then discuss three studies we have conducted, which show that personalized interfaces tradeoff awareness of unused features for performance gains on core tasks. The first two studies, previously published and presented only in summary, demonstrate this tradeoff by measuring awareness using a recognition test of unused features in the interface. The studies also evaluated two different types of personalized interfaces: it layered interfaces approach and an adaptive split menu approach. The third study, presented in full, focuses on adaptive split Menus and extends results from the first two studies to show that different levels of awareness also correspond to an impact on performance when users are asked to complete new tasks. Based on all three studies and a survey of related work, we outline it design space of personalized interfaces and present several factors that could affect the tradeoff between core task performance and awareness. Finally, we provide a set of design implications that should be considered for personalized interfaces. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
