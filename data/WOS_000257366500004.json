Based on an LMI approach, we develop a state-feedback controller that guarantees the L-2-gain of the mapping from the exogenous input noise to the regulated output is less than some prescribed value and the closed-loop system is D-stable. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the design developed in this paper. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
