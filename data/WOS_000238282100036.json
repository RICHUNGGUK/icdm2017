Takagi and Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models are used for the uncertain nonlinear systems. By utilizing the concept of the so-called parallel distributed compensation (PDC) method, solutions to the problem are derived in terms of a family of linear matrix inequalities and are numerically tractable via LMI techniques.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity control with pole placement constraints for T-S fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100036"}
