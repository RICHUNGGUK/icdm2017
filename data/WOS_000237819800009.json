Agents move randomly except in the case where an attractive site is located in its neighborhood. We find that the transition between an egalitarian society at low population density and a hierarchical one at high population density strongly depends on the distribution and percolation of the valuable sites. We also show how agent diffusivity is closely related to social hierarchy.", "paper_title": "Social hierarchies with an attractive site distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000237819800009"}
