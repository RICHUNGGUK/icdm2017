Despite many WSN programming frameworks have been to date developed and, in some cases, applied to support monitoring of buildings, none of them possesses all the specific features needed to develop WSN-based building applications. In this article a multiplatform domain specific framework based on Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) for enabling efficient and effective management of buildings is presented. The proposed Building Management Framework (BME) provides powerful abstractions that capture the morphology of buildings to allow for the rapid development and flexible management of pervasive building monitoring applications. The functionalities of the framework are shown in an emblematic case study concerning the SmartEnergyLab that is an effective operating scenario related to the monitoring of the usage of workstations in laboratories and offices. Finally, a performance evaluation of a WSAN running the BMF in terms of network usage and system lifetime is shown. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
