In this paper, we analyze the establishment of interdomain MPLS LSPs with QoS constraints. These LSPs cross diverse SP networks that may belong to different companies. We show that using the standard BGP route for the establishment of such LSPs is not sufficient. We propose two path establishment techniques that rely on RSVP-TE and make use of Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Our simulations show that these techniques increase the number of constrained MPLS LSPs that can be established across domain boundaries.", "paper_title": "Path selection techniques to establish constrained interdomain MPLS LSPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800018"}
