This framework facilitates efficient implementation of management of multiple associated graphs with navigation links and nesting of graphs as well as ghosting, folding and hiding of unwanted graph elements. The theoretical analyses show that the involved data structures and operations on them are quite efficient, and an implementation in a graph drawing tool has proven to be successful.
