Some of the attractive properties of one, however, are not found in the other. The Mobius-deBruijn architecture, proposed in this paper, is the product of Mobius cube and deBruijn digraph, which is a combination of the two architectures. It employs the Mobius cube as a unit cluster and connects many such clusters by means of given number of parallel deBruijn digraphs. Consequently, the Mobius-deBruijn provides some of the desirable properties of both the architectures, such as the flexibility in terms of embedding of parallel algorithms, the high level of fault-tolerant, and the efficient inter-cluster communication. The proposed architecture also possesses the logarithmic diameter, the optimal connectivity, and the simple routing mechanism amenable to network faults. The methodology to construct the Mobius-deBruijn can apply to the product of deBruijn digraph and other hypercube-like networks, and also applies to the product of Kautz digraph and hypercube-like networks.
