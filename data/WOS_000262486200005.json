Observe paths whose end-vertices form pairs in S (called S-paths). The following path packing problem for graphs is fundamental: what is the maximal number of S-paths in G? In this paper this problem is studied under two assumptions: (a) the node degrees in Na-T are even, and (b) any three distinct pairwise intersecting maximal stable sets A,B,C of (T,S) satisfy Aa (c) B=Ba (c) C=Aa (c) C (this condition was defined by A. Karzanov in Linear Algebra Appl. 114-115:293-328, 1989). For any demand graph violating (b) the problem is known to be NP-hard even under (a), and only a few cases satisfying (a) and (b) have been solved. In each of the solved cases, a solution and an optimal dual object were defined by a certain auxiliary \"weak\" multiflow optimization problem whose solutions supply constructive elements for S-paths and concatenate them into an S-path packing by a kind of matching. In this paper the above approach is extended to all demand graphs satisfying (a) and (b), by proving existence of a common solution of the S-path packing and its weak counterpart. The weak problem is very interesting for its own sake, and has connections with such topics as Mader's edge-disjoint path packing theorem and b-factors in graphs.", "paper_title": "Path packing and a related optimization problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000262486200005"}
