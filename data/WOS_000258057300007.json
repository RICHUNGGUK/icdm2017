Specialized modulation of the pulse train provides an effective communication medium with inherent advantages of an UWB system. The multiple frequency nature of the non-traditional \"pulse\" formation provides a means of implementing UWB without the necessity of complex pulse formation of the classical UWB. The particular example of the research implemented in this paper allows explicit user choice of the specific UWB frequencies, e.g., ISM frequencies, to avoid current restrictions of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The reported method also contains an implicit property to support secure information transmission to receivers at known distances. The objective of this technique is an easy to form communication pulse having UWB low energy advantages along with the freedom of implementation without license requirements from regulating authorities, while adhering to the set limits of intentional radiators. The method chosen in this case was based on having the sum of energies from multiple frequencies remain within the restricted radiation limits at the correlated receiver. Included in the implementation technique is the inclusion of the signal fading effect as part of the modulation technique. The relevance of this pulse forming technique is in the simplicity of spreading the transmitted power among multiple frequencies without the issue of decay factor in the current methods. The result presented gives two sets of relative amplitudes of the transmitted frequencies identifying the transmitted character, e.g., 0 or 1. A form of amplitude encryption, due to the RF signal fading effect was also presented as advantage in the technique. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
