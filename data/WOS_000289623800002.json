In this paper we investigate how this approach can be applied also in the presence of imperative features. This is made possible by considering a natural translation of Static Single Assignment intermediate form programs into Horn formulas, where. functions correspond to union types.", "paper_title": "IDEALIZED COINDUCTIVE TYPE SYSTEMS FOR IMPERATIVE OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289623800002"}
