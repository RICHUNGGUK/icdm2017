A novel approach is presented, which takes CAD descriptions as input and produces the optimal shape in CAD form using the control points of the Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) boundary representation as design variables. An implementation of the NURBS equations in source allows to include the CAD-based shape deformation inside the design loop and evaluate its sensitivities efficiently and robustly. In order to maintain or establish the required level of geometric continuity across patch interfaces, geometric constraints are imposed on the control point displacements. The paper discusses the discrete adjoint flow solver used and the computation of the complete sensitivities of the design loop by differentiating all components using automatic differentiation tools. The resulting rich but smooth deformation space is demonstrated on the optimisation of a vehicle climate duct.
