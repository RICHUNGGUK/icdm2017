GamField also computes anomaly gradients and remanent magnetization effects. The user inputs Cartesian prisms along with their physical properties to fabricate subsurface sources. Examples illustrating the utility of GamField for synthetic anomaly generation of gravity and magnetic fields are shown. ftp://ftp.ingv.it/pub/alessandro.pignatelli/Pignatelli (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
