This control system is comprised of a recurrent-cerebellar-model-articulation-controller (RCMAC) and an auxiliary compensation controller. RCMAC is utilized to approximate a perfect controller, and the parameters of RCMAC are on-line tuned by the derived adaptive laws based oil a Lyapunov function. The auxiliary compensation controller is designed to suppress the influence of residual approximation error between the perfect controller and RCMAC. Finally, two MIMO uncertain nonlinear systems, a mass-spring-damper mechanical system and a Chua's chaotic circuit, are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The simulation results confirm that the proposed intelligent adaptive control system call achieve favorable tracking performance with desired robustness. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
