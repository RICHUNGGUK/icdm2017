By introducing a set of Lyapunov functionals, several new sufficient conditions guaranteeing the global robust convergence are derived. The results show that the amplification function a (i) (x) is harmless to the robust stability of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Two examples are given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "New results on the robust stability of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000241750900001"}
