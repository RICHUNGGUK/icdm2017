We propose a new approach to provide inter-website recommendation on proxy server based on partial similarity of interests, and construct corresponding user's interest model to realize this method. According to psychological characteristic of interests, this approach divides user's interest into several interest-points, which are correlated each other and farther divided into long-term interest and short-term interest. We mine the interest quality and correlation of interest-points from proxy log to construct user's interest model. This method adopts different recommendation mechanism separately for long-term interests and short-term interests, which provides recommendation to target user's long-term interests based on neighbors with partially similar interests and recommendation to user's short-term interests based on experienced users. Experimental results indicate that this method can recommend interesting and unexpected inter-website pages to target users and improve the precision of personalized recommendation service on proxy server.", "paper_title": "Personalized recommendation based on partial similarity of interests", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200056"}
