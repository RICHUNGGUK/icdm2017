The proposed method reconstructs a target image by retrieving the phase from the magnitude of its Fourier transform and the measured area of the image. In general, the measured area is different from the true area where the target image exists. Thus a snake, which can extract the shape of the target image, is utilized to renew the measured area. By processing this renewal iteratively, the area obtained by the snake converges to the true area and as a result the proposed method can accurately reconstruct a target image even when the measured area is different from the true area. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Phase retrieval based on a snake for image reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703600034"}
