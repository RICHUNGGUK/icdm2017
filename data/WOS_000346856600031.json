This study aims to utilize an architecture of these networks together with the Taylor polynomials, to achieve the approximate solution of second kind linear Volterra integral equations system. For this purpose, first we substitute the Nth truncation of the Taylor expansion for unknown functions in the origin system. Then we apply the suggested neural net for adjusting the numerical coefficients of given expansions in resulting system. Consequently, the reported architecture using a learning algorithm that based on the gradient descent method, will adjust the coefficients in given Taylor series. The proposed method was illustrated by several examples with computer simulations. Subsequently, performance comparisons with other developed methods was made. The comparative experimental results showed that this approach is more effective and robust. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
