Therefore, once an intruder is identified, it should be known to all innocent nodes such that the intruder or its clones can be recognized when appearing elsewhere. However, secure, efficient and scalable sharing of intruder information remains a challenging and unsolved problem. To address this problem, we propose a three-tier framework, consisting of a verifiable intruder reporting (VIR) scheme, a quorum-based caching (QBC) scheme for efficiently propagating intruder reports to the whole network, and a collaborative Bloom Filter (CBF) scheme for handling intruder information locally. Extensive analysis and evaluations are also conducted to verify the efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
