In order to enhance fluid details without introducing unpleasing fluid control effects, we propose a spatial-temporal varying synthesis parameter to control turbulence behaviors and compute it from control force and the vorticity velocity. Our approach can control enhanced turbulence behaviors efficiently and produces visually plausible realistic fine-scale details while reducing artifacts of large-scale noises on fluid control. We compare our algorithm to existing procedural synthesis ones to validate its efficiency and controllability.
