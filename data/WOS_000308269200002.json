The model, which combines two plastic mechanisms, has been reformulated using generalized stress and strain variables accounting for the presence of temperature as an additional variable. Mixed control conditions are introduced to simulate standard thermo-mechanical laboratory tests. An explicit integration scheme is used with an adaptive time-stepping scheme specifically designed for the considered thermo-mechanical model. This sub-stepping procedure enables the constitutive model to be integrated accurately and efficiently by automatically adjusting the size of sub-steps to maintain the local integration error below a specified tolerance. Special attention is paid to the cases where the two yield surfaces are activated simultaneously. The correction of the drift of the stress point from the yield surface is also accounted for. This thermo-elastoplastic model has been implemented in a constitutive driver aiming at simulating thermo-mechanical tests in the triaxial stress space. The efficiency of this integration algorithm is discussed and the clear advantage of using the adaptive sub-stepping procedure is shown. The constitutive model is finally used to simulate thermo-mechanical tests. The results are compared to available experimental data and show the good capabilities of the constitutive model.
