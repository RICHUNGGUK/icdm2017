The parallel cat swarm optimization (PCSO) method is an optimization algorithm designed to solve numerical optimization problems under the conditions of a small population size and a few iteration numbers. The Taguchi method is widely used in the industry for optimizing the product and the process conditions. By adopting the Taguchi method into the tracing mode process of the PCSO method, we propose the EPCSO method with better accuracy and less computational time. In this paper, five test functions are used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed EPCSO method. The experimental results show that the proposed EPCSO method gets higher accuracies than the existing PSO-based methods and requires less computational time than the PCSO method. We also apply the proposed method to solve the aircraft schedule recovery problem. The experimental results show that the proposed EPCSO method can provide the optimum recovered aircraft schedule in a very short time. The proposed EPCSO method gets the same recovery schedule having the same total delay time, the same delayed flight numbers and the same number of long delay flights as the Liu, Chen, and Chou method (2009). The optimal solutions can be found by the proposed EPCSO method in a very short time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
