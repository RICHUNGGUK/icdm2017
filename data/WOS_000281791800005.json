So, semi-supervised learning which tries to exploit unlabeled examples to improve learning performance has become a hot topic. Disagreement-based semi-supervised learning is an interesting paradigm, where multiple learners are trained for the task and the disagreements among the learners are exploited during the semi-supervised learning process. This survey article provides an introduction to research advances in this paradigm.", "paper_title": "Semi-supervised learning by disagreement", "paper_id": "WOS:000281791800005"}
