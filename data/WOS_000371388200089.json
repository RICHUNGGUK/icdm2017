It combines an F-shaped conducting monopole antenna and a water dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) to effectively broaden the antenna bandwidth. The F-shaped monopole is also used to excite the water DRA. The unique features of water, such as transparency and liquidity, allow complex feeding structures to be placed, and tuned inside the water DRA. A comprehensive parametric study is conducted to optimize the antenna performance. The final design is made and tested. A good agreement is obtained between the simulation and the measurement results. Compared with the conventional straight probe, the proposed antenna has a wider bandwidth from 410 to 870 MHz (a fractional bandwidth of 71.8%) for S-11 < -6 dB, with a compact size (52 mm x 51.5 mm x 10 mm, roughly 0.071 lambda, x 0.07), x 0.0136 lambda), at 410 MHz). It is shown that this new antenna is a very good candidate for hand-portable applications such as Digital Video Broadcasting-Handheld.", "paper_title": "A Wideband Hybrid Water Antenna With an F-Shaped Monopole", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200089"}
