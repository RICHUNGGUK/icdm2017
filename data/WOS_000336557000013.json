Objects of interest (vehicles) are represented by using a Minimum Bound Region (MBR) with a reference coordinate. Object appearance is represented by colour-based features computed from the proposed technique. The performance of the object identification based colour features depends on some parameters, which should be determined carefully to locate and identify objects that exists in the images successfully. Experiments have been conducted to determine the efficient parameters that should used and demonstrate that single and multiple known objects in complex scenes can be identified by the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Parameters Selection for Object Recognition Based Colour Features in Traffic Image Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000336557000013"}
