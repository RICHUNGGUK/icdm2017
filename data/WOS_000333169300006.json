The method correlates vectors of parsimony scores on the edges of a graph, averaged over all optimally parsimonious reconstructions of the data. We describe an efficient data structure, and a preprocessing step that allows for rapid, interactive computation of many correlation scores, at the expense of storage space.", "paper_title": "Data Structures for Parsimony Correlation and Biosequence Co-Evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000333169300006"}
