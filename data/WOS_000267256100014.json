However. most studies to date have been concentrated on markets in developed economics such as the stock markets in US or UK, This article aims to investigate the statistical properties of stock return volatility in Hong Kong. Using the sample of constituent stocks of Hang Seng Index (HSI) and Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI or \"H-shares Index\"), we found that the mean daily realized volatilities of HSCEI stocks to be significantly higher than their HSI counterpart, while the correlations between H-shares stay relatively lower than that of HSI stocks. A long-memory effect is also reported for the logarithmic standard deviations of all shares, with most of them showing slow decay over the series. (c) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
