However, virtual desktop solutions introduce the thorny problem of how to deliver a real desktop experience to users, as if they are using it locally, especially when playing video. The SPICE (simple protocol for independent computing environments) virtual desktop solution provides several image compression algorithms to address this problem with the purpose of making virtual desktops as real as possible. Although different compression algorithms can contribute their own abilities to different images to a large extent, switching between them is a big problem that consumes a large amount of resources to detect the different type of image and also causes jitter of the virtual desktop. This paper proposes a new solution, called SPICEx, using the JPEG2000 compression algorithm with dynamic compression ratios to solve the problem and finally validates that the performance is better than that of SPICE. With better quality of user experience and also reducing bandwidth consumption, SPICEx solution is meaningful in virtual desktop fields and can be widely used.", "paper_title": "Research on technology of desktop virtualization based on SPICE protocol and its improvement solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000352068400002"}
