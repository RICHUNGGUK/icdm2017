In this paper, we propose a robust transient detection algorithm using the EVRC noise suppression module. We define new parameters from the outputs of the EVRC noise suppression module for transient detection. Experimental results with various types of underwater transients have shown that the proposed method outperforms the conventional energy-based method and achieved performance improvement of detection rate by 7% to 15% for various types of background noise.", "paper_title": "Robust Detection of Underwater Transient Signals Using EVRC Noise Suppression Module", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342900011"}
