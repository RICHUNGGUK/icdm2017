In our previous work, we proposed a new motion estimation method where motion estimation is formulated as an optimization problem and an adaptive system under the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion is used for motion estimation. In this paper, we develop an adaptive system under the criterion of maximum mutual information to address the motion estimation problem. Our proposed motion estimation algorithms have very low encoding complexity and hence are ideally suited for wireless video sensor networks where limited bandwidth, restricted computational capability, and limited battery power supply impose stringent constraints on the video encoding system.
