However, these existing kernel NMF approaches cannot guarantee the nonnegativity of bases in kernel feature space and thus are essentially semi-NMF methods. In this paper, we show that nonlinear semi-NMF cannot extract the localized components which offer important information in object recognition. Therefore, nonlinear NMF rather than semi-NMF is needed to be developed for extracting localized component as well as learning the nonlinear structure. In order to address the nonlinear problem of NMF and the semi-nonnegative problem of the existing kernel NMF methods, we develop the nonlinear NMF based on a self-constructed Mercer kernel which preserves the nonnegative constraints on both bases and coefficients in kernel feature space. Experimental results in face and expressing recognition show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art kernel methods, such as KPCA, GDA, PNMF and PGKNMF.
