During the last decade, many approaches have been proposed to solve this challenging problem in diverse ways, i.e. different measures or data structures. Unfortunately, experimental reports on existing techniques fell short in validity and integrity since many comparisons were not based on a unified code base or merely discussed in theory. We engage in an in-depth benchmarking study of community detection in social networks. We formulate a generalized community detection procedure and propose a procedure-oriented framework for benchmarking. This framework enables us to evaluate and compare various approaches to community detection systematically and thoroughly under identical experimental conditions. Upon that we can analyze and diagnose the inherent defect of existing approaches deeply, and further make effective improvements correspondingly. We have re-implemented ten state-of-the-art representative algorithms upon this framework and make comprehensive evaluations of multiple aspects, including the efficiency evaluation, performance evaluations, sensitivity evaluations, etc. We discuss their merits and faults in depth, and draw a set of take-away interesting conclusions. In addition, we present how we can make diagnoses for these algorithms resulting in significant improvements.", "paper_title": "Community Detection in Social Networks: An In-depth Benchmarking Study with a Procedure-Oriented Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000362282500004"}
