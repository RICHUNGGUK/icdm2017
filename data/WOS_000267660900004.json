This problem has been tackled before by upgrading the structure-search algorithm initially proposed for Bayesian networks. In this paper we show how to upgrade another algorithm for learning Bayesian networks, namely ordering-search. For Bayesian networks, ordering-search was found to work better than structure-search. It is non-obvious that these results carry over to the relational case, however, since there ordering-search needs to be implemented quite differently. Hence, we perform an experimental comparison of these upgraded algorithms on four relational domains. We conclude that also in the relational case ordering-search is competitive with structure-search in terms of quality of the learned models, while ordering-search is significantly faster.", "paper_title": "Learning directed probabilistic logical models: ordering-search versus structure-search", "paper_id": "WOS:000267660900004"}
