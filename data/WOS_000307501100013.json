AFFPs are allergen-specific peptides panned from irredundant allergens and harbor perfect information with noise fragments eliminated because of their similarity to non-allergens. SORTALLER performed significantly better than other existing software and reached a perfect balance with high specificity (98.4%) and sensitivity (98.6%) for discriminating allergenic proteins from several independent datasets of protein sequences of diverse sources, also highlighting with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as high as 0.970, fast running speed and rapidly predicting a batch of amino acid sequences with a single click.", "paper_title": "SORTALLER: predicting allergens using substantially optimized algorithm on allergen family featured peptides", "paper_id": "WOS:000307501100013"}
