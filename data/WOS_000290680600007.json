It is applied to determine the Bayes premium used in actuarial science and also to compute the regulatory capital in the analysis of operational risk. The results are illustrated with numerous examples and compared with other approaches proposed in the literature for these questions, with considerable differences being observed.", "paper_title": "Collective risk model: Poisson-Lindley and exponential distributions for Bayes premium and operational risk", "paper_id": "WOS:000290680600007"}
