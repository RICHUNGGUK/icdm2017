However, there has been little attention paid to the research of the overshooting effect for multi-input gate in nanometer technologies until now. Therefore, in this paper, an effective model considering the overshooting effect of multi-input gate is presented. The experimental results using 32-nm PTM model reflect that the proposed model is accurate within 3.6% error compared with SPICE simulation results.", "paper_title": "MODELING THE OVERSHOOTING EFFECT OF MULTI-INPUT GATE IN NANOMETER TECHNOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000312458700005"}
