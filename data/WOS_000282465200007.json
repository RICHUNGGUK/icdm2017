We investigate the case of interleaved interpreted systems. These are a particular class of interpreted systems, a mainstream MAS formalism, in which only one action at the time is performed in the system. We present a notion of stuttering-equivalence and prove the semantical equivalence of stuttering-equivalent traces with respect to linear and branching time temporal logics for knowledge without the next operator. We give algorithms to reduce the size of the models before the model checking step and show preservation properties. We evaluate the technique by discussing implementations and the experimental results obtained against well-known examples in the MAS literature.", "paper_title": "Partial Order Reductions for Model Checking Temporal-epistemic Logics over Interleaved Multi-agent Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000282465200007"}
