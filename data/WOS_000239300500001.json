In this paper, we propose a new online preemptive scheduling algorithm, called PRDS that incorporates urgency, data size and number of pending requests for real-time on-demand broadcast system. Furthermore, we use pyramid preemption to optimize performance and reduce overhead. A series of simulation experiments have been performed to evaluate the real-time performance of our algorithm as compared with other previously proposed methods. The experimental results show that our algorithm substantially outperforms other algorithms over a wide range of workloads and parameter settings.", "paper_title": "Scheduling real-time requests in on-demand data broadcast environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000239300500001"}
