In this paper, we present a built-in-self-test (BiST) solution for quadrature modulation transceiver circuits using only transmitter and receiver baseband signals for test analysis. The mapping between transmitter input signals and receiver output signals are used to extract impairment and nonlinearity parameters separately with the help of the NLS method and detailed nonlinear system modeling. Experimental measurement results are in good agreement with the simulations and they confirm the high accuracy of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Detailed Characterization of Transceiver Parameters Through Loop-Back-Based BiST", "paper_id": "WOS:000278435900005"}
