Currently, most of the existing techniques in this area are based on signature training, learning or matching, which may be too complicated to satisfy timely requirements. Other statistical methods including sampling, hashing or counting are all approximate methods and compute an incomplete set of results. Since the main objective of network monitoring is to discover and understand the active events that happen frequently and may influence or even ruin the total network. So in the paper we aim to use the technique of frequent pattern mining to find out these events. We first design a sliding window model to make sure the mining result novel and integrated; then, under the consideration of the distribution and fluidity of network flows, we develop a powerful class of algorithms that contains vertical re-mining algorithm, multi-pattern re-mining algorithm, fast multi-pattern capturing algorithm and fast multi-pattern capturing supplement algorithm to deal with a series of problems when applying frequent pattern mining algorithm in network traffic analysis. Finally, we develop a monitoring system to evaluate our algorithms on real traces collected from the campus network of Peking University. The results show that some given algorithms are effective enough and our system can definitely identify a lot of potentially very valuable information in time which greatly help network administrators to understand regular applications and detect network anomalies. So the research in this paper not only provides a new application area for frequent pattern mining, but also provides a new technique for network monitoring.
