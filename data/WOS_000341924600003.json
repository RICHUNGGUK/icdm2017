This flood makes it increasingly difficult to make sense of the world and arrive at the correct interpretation of events. Design/methodology/approach - Classic narrative literature review applying the dosage metaphor to the growing problem of information overload. Findings - The seven elements of dosage - amount, frequency, sequencing, delivery systems, contraindications, interactions, and dysfunctions - are used to discuss four major coping mechanisms escape, attention, delegation, and creative destruction - for dealing with the flood. Each of the coping mechanisms has different entailments for the dosage elements. Originality/value - This essay develops a guiding principle for thinking about how we should cope with this central problem of the information age: suggesting a minimalist approach that offers the hope of clarity in acting in an age that increasingly overwhelms us.", "paper_title": "Controlling the flood: when more of a dose is less", "paper_id": "WOS:000341924600003"}
