To realize the transition from manual to computer-based detection and maintenance, we focus on dust collector localization under complex conditions in the trouble of moving freight car detection system. Using mid-level features which are also named flexible edge arrangement (FEA) features, we first build the edge-based 2D model of the dust collectors, and then match target objects by a weighted Hausdorff distance method. The difference is that the constructed weighting function is generated by the FEA features other than specified subjectively, which can truly reflect the most basic property regions of the 3D object. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm has better robustness to variable lighting, different viewing angle, and complex texture, and it shows a stronger adaptive performance. The localization correct rate of the target object is over 90%, which completely meets the need of practical applications.", "paper_title": "Dust collector localization in trouble of moving freight car detection system", "paper_id": "WOS:000314751500003"}
