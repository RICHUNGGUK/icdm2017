This measure is based on a specific biological mechanism and on the concept of minimum energy. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in a classification test where leaves taken from plants growing under different stress conditions are classified. Results show that the proposed measure improves classification performance compared to classification based on other leading measures. (C) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
