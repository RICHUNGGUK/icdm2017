To find the most efficient TCP in the scenario of grid over OBS, in this paper, the implementation of a traffic-driven labeled OBS (LOBS) network test bed is presented and the performance of several prominent high-speed TCPs, including HSTCP, TCP Westwood, and FAST TCP, are experimentally compared over the test bed. A modified theoretical model for TCP Reno over OBS is investigated, which is more accurate in modeling TCP Reno throughput compared with previous works and can further verify the experimental results.
