Contour curves, including silhouette curves and cross section curves, are used for garment surface modeling. Style curves, including seam lines, dart lines, notch lines and grain lines, are introduced for designing patterns on the triangular garment surfaces. Contour curves are extracted automatically from the boundaries of garment sub-meshes. The definitions and resolving rules of various constraints are introduced for editing the contour curves conveniently. Style curves are generated by projecting control points onto 3D garment triangular surfaces. In order to draw the style curves validly, some constraints are also introduced according to the craft requirements of pattern design. Furthermore, the effects of style curves in pattern flattening are analyzed, which can guide the designer to draw style curves more reasonably and enhance the pattern design quality. Finally, some examples are given to show that our methods can make the 3D garment design more flexible and friendly, and style curves can be applied into design patterns on 3D triangular surface for shoes, toys and so on.
