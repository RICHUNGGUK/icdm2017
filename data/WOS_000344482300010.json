Experiments are carried out on the basis of response surface methodology technique with different levels of welding parameters of spot welded titanium alloy sheets. Multiple quality characteristics, namely signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios of weld nugget diameter, penetration rate, tensile shear load and the failure energy, are converted into an independent quality index using principal component analysis. The mathematical model correlating process parameters and their interactions with the welding quality is established and discussed. And then this model is used to select the optimum process parameters to obtain the desired welding quality. The verification test results demonstrate that the method presented in this paper to optimize the welding parameters and enhance the welding performance is effective and feasible in the SSRSW process.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective optimal design of small scale resistance spot welding process with principal component analysis and response surface methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000344482300010"}
