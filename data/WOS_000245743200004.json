Many types of information systems can be treated and unified as consistent approximation representation spaces. At the same time, under the framework of this space, the judgment theorem for determining consistent attribute set is established, from which we can obtain the approach to attribute reductions in information systems. Also, the characterizations of three important types of attribute sets (the core attribute set, the relative necessary attribute set and the unnecessary attribute set) are examined.", "paper_title": "A general approach to attribute reduction in rough set theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000245743200004"}
