Contrary to our report that ustiloxin B is ribosomally synthesized in Aspergillus flavus, a recent report suggested that ustiloxins are synthesized by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase in U. virens. Thus, we analyzed the U. virens genome, to identify the responsible gene cluster. Results: The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from the genome of U. virens based on homologies to the ribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene cluster for ustiloxin B identified from A. flavus. It contains a gene encoding precursor protein having five Tyr-Val-Ile-Gly and three Tyr-Ala-Ile-Gly motifs for ustiloxins A and B, respectively, strongly indicating that ustiloxins A and B from U. virens are ribosomally synthesized.", "paper_title": "Ustiloxins, fungal cyclic peptides, are ribosomally synthesized in Ustilaginoidea virens", "paper_id": "WOS:000352269500001"}
