We first consider a 2-queue Markovian system with blocking at the second queue, analyze it, and derive its stability condition. We then study a non-Markovian setting and derive the stability condition for an approximating diffusion, showing its similarity to the former condition. In the Markovian setting, we use probability generating functions and matrix analytic techniques. In the diffusion setting, we consider expectations of the first hitting times of compact sets.", "paper_title": "Queues in tandem with customer deadlines and retrials", "paper_id": "WOS:000312742200001"}
