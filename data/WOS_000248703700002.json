When they are used to perform online reinforcement learning by means of Michigan-style fuzzy rule systems, this issue becomes even more difficult. Indeed, rule generalization (description of state-action relationships with rules as compact as possible) has received a great attention in the nonfuzzy evolutionary learning field (e.g., XCS is the subject of extensive ongoing research). However, the same issue does not appear to have received a similar level of attention in the case of Michigan-style fuzzy rule systems. This may be due to the difficulty in extending the discrete-valued system operation to the continuous case. The intention of this contribution is to propose an approach to properly develop a fuzzy XCS system for single-step reinforcement problems.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-XCS: A Michigan genetic fuzzy system", "paper_id": "WOS:000248703700002"}
