Furthermore, it is easier to understand the structures of graphs from the mixed-style drawings. The basic idea is to cover a layered graph by complete bipartite subgraphs (bicliques), then replace bicliques with tree-like structures. The biclique cover problem is reduced to a special edge-coloring problem and solved by heuristic coloring algorithms. Our method can be extended to obtain multi-depth confluent layered drawings.", "paper_title": "Confluent layered drawings", "paper_id": "WOS:000245123200007"}
