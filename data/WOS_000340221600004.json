One rule is to minimize the distance between the original opinions and adjusted opinions, and the other one seeks to minimize the number of adjusted preference values. Then, we develop an interactive consensus reaching process for MAGDM problems based on the two consensus rules. In the consensus reaching process, decision makers can adjust their opinions flexibly within the suggested adjustment intervals guided by the consensus rules with minimum adjustments. Furthermore, we provide the convergence proof of the consensus reaching process, and present one example to show the application of the consensus reaching process. Finally, a detailed comparison analysis is conducted to show the advantage of the proposed consensus rules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
