The peer-to-peer architecture, which is suitable for massive multiplayer online games, is being considered as the replacement for traditional client-server architecture. Because the current solutions cannot prevent the cheating problems to gain unfair advantages in these games completely, we summarize the problems existing in some event signature protocols for peer-to-peer online games and propose a new secure event signature protocol. The security basis of the proposed protocol is the discrete logarithms and bilinear pairing. Our protocol provides higher security than some current protocols on secure event signature, although the efficiency of our protocol is lower than theirs.
