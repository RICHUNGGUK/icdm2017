For the characterisation of the inductor behaviour the double pi-model is used. The use of this model is twofold. On one hand it enables the generation of the inductor characterisation in a few seconds. On the other hand its integration into the optimization procedure is straightforward. For the evaluation of the model element values analytical expressions based on technology parameters as well as on the device geometric characteristics are used. The use of a technology-based methodology for the evaluation of the model parameters grants the adaptability of the model to any technology. The inductor analytical characterization is integrated into an optimization-based tool for the automatic design of RF integrated inductors. This tool uses a modified genetic algorithm (MGA) optimization procedure, which has proved its validation in previous work. Due to the design parameter constraints nature as well as the topology constraints, discrete variables optimization techniques are used. The accuracy of the results is checked against a non-commercial software.", "paper_title": "RF integrated inductor modeling and its application to optimization-based design", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700006"}
