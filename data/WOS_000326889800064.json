Actual laboratory measurements were used for the model development. The scour depth was formulated in terms of several influencing parameters. The results indicate that GEP is a very promising approach to predict the river pipeline scour depth.", "paper_title": "Soft computing for prediction of river pipeline scour depth", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800064"}
