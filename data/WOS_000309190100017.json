The proposed scheme exhibits improved performance in terms of blocking probability compared to other traditional segment-based multicast protection schemes, especially when sharing techniques are also utilized. Furthermore, when physical layer impairments are also taken into account for the calculation of the working and protection light-trees, it is shown that the LP technique presents significant improvement in performance compared to the other commonly used protection techniques.", "paper_title": "Segment-Based Protection of Multicast Connections in Metropolitan Area Optical Networks With Quality-of-Transmission Considerations", "paper_id": "WOS:000309190100017"}
