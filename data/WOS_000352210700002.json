In this paper, we explore the use of fuzzy logic for modeling concept polarities, and the uncertainty associated with them, with respect to different domains. The approach is based on the use of a knowledge graph built by combining two linguistic resources, namely WordNet and SenticNet. Such a knowledge graph is then exploited by a graph-propagation algorithm that propagates sentiment information learned from labeled datasets. The system implementing the proposed approach has been evaluated on the Blitzer dataset. The results demonstrate its viability in real-world cases.", "paper_title": "Propagating and Aggregating Fuzzy Polarities for Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000352210700002"}
