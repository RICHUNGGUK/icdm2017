In this paper, a novel power assisted steering technology and its torque distribution control system were proposed, due to the independent driving characteristics of four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicle. The first part of this study deals with the full description of the basic theory of differential drive assisted steering system. After that, 4-wheel-drive (4WD) electric vehicle dynamics model as well as driver model were built. Furthermore, the differential drive assisted steering control system, as well as the drive torque distribution and compensation control system, was also presented. Therein, the proportional-integral (PI) feedback control loop was employed to track the reference steering effort by controlling the drive torque distribution between the two sides wheels of the front axle. After that, the direct yaw moment control subsystem and the traction control subsystem were introduced, which were both employed to make the differential drive assisted steering work as well as wished. Finally, the open-loop and closed-loop simulation for validation were performed. The results verified that, the proposed differential drive torque assisted steering system cannot only reduce the steering efforts significantly, as well as ensure a stiffer steering feel at high vehicle speed and improve the returnability of the vehicle, but also keep the lateral stability of the vehicle.
