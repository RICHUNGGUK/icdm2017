Since microaneurysms are regarded as the first signs of DR, there has been extensive research on effective detection and localization of these abnormalities in retinal images. In contrast to existing algorithms, a new approach based on multi-scale correlation filtering (MSCF) and dynamic thresholding is developed. This consists of two levels, microaneurysm candidate detection (coarse level) and true microaneurysm classification (fine level). The approach was evaluated based on two public datasets-ROC (retinopathy on-line challenge, http://roc.healthcare.uiowa.edu) and DIARETDB1 (standard diabetic retinopathy database, http://www.it.lut.fi/project/imageret/diaretdb1). We conclude our method to be effective and efficient. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
