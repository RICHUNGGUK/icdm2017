The development of these information infrastructures often has a technological focus and the concurrent social innovation is ill understood. To address this gap, we study public-private information infrastructure developments at three layers over a prolonged period of time. Stakeholders have to alter existing social practices to realize the potential of information infrastructures. New social practices need to be developed and sustaining innovations requires new governance mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Developing Multi-Layer Information Infrastructures: Advancing Social Innovation through Public-Private Governance", "paper_id": "WOS:000340092000006"}
