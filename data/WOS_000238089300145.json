The guidelines stems directly from our experience in designing, implementing and validating an AR based contents for teaching the concept of \"circulation of water.\" We describe the production and validation process that starts with a careful analysis of whether AR is (can be) appropriate for the target educational material. In particular, where possible, the direct tangible 3D manipulation is applied to the important interaction points to imbue the \"hands-on\" experience. The resulting contents were successfully put to use in real classrooms and usability and educational effects study is under way.", "paper_title": "Designing interactions for augmented reality based educational contents", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300145"}
