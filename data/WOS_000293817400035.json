Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that some kinds of symmetry may exist in data clusters. The most common type of symmetry is line symmetry. In this paper, we propose a line symmetry distance measure. Based on the proposed line symmetry distance, a modified version of the K-means algorithm can be used to partition data into clusters with different geometrical shapes. Several data sets are used to test the performance of the proposed modified version of the K-means algorithm incorporated with the line symmetry distance.", "paper_title": "DETECTION OF LINE-SYMMETRY CLUSTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293817400035"}
