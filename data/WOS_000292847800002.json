MIA is a type of data mining methods that is based on data sets obtained from 2D images. The purpose of this study is to construct a relationship between pixels of images of investigated compounds as independent and their bioactivities as a dependent variable. Partial least square (PLS) and principal components-radial basis function neural networks (PC-RBFNNs) were developed to obtain a statistical explanation of the activity of the molecules. The performance of developed models were tested by several validation methods such as external and internal tests and also criteria recommended by Tropsha and Roy. The resulted PLS model had a high statistical quality (R(2)=0.991 and R(CV)(2) = 0.993) for predicting the activity of the compounds. Because of high correlation between values of predicted and experimental activities, MIA-QSAR proved to be a highly predictive approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
