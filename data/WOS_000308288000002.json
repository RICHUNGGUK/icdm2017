Both techniques introduce errors which have to be compensated to minimize quality degradation. To handle the errors due to bit truncation, we propose a compensation scheme based on unbiased estimation of the truncation noise. For 4-bit truncation, such a scheme achieves 23% power savings for DCT with only 0.6dB drop in PSNR. To compensate for errors due to aggressive voltage scaling, we introduce an algorithm-specific technique which is based on exploiting the characteristics of the quantized coefficients after zig-zag scan. This technique is very effective in improving the PSNR performance with a small circuit overhead. A combination of the two techniques help achieve even higher power savings with only a modest increase in PSNR. For instance, a combination of 4-bit truncation and operating voltage of 0.78V results in 44% power reduction for DCT with a 1.8dB drop in PSNR performance of the JPEG codec.", "paper_title": "Quality-Aware Techniques for Reducing Power of JPEG Codecs", "paper_id": "WOS:000308288000002"}
