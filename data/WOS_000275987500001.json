Some new delay-dependent stochastic stability criteria are derived based on a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) approach. These new criteria based on the delay partitioning idea prove to be less conservative, since the conservatism could be notably reduced by thinning the delay partitioning. It is shown that the addressed stochastic BAM neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters are stochastically stable if three linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. The feasibility of the LMIs can be readily checked by the Matlab LMI toolbox. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed technique. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
