Given that smart home applications are based on the integration of many heterogeneous devices in the same network, the lack of interoperability can become a major issue in the development of advanced services. In this paper we tackle this issue developing an adapter to integrate the service robot Rovio into a smart home by means of Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Different advanced services are designed to explore the possibilities derived from the integration of service robots in the smart home. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
