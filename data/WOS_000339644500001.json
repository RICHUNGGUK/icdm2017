Factoring out symmetries, we obtain a synunetiy-type graph, which may be interpreted as a surface with boundary plus an additional combinatorial structure, which is then used to partition benzenoids into 14 classes, thereby re-interpreting in a purely combinatorial way the classification proposed by Gutman and Cyvin. Formulations in terms of automorphism groups or point groups (which are exactly twice as large for benzenoids) are equivalent. A boundary-edges code is used to describe benzenoids: combinatorial properties, including assignment to the 14 classes, can be recoverd from this code.", "paper_title": "On Symmetries of Benzenoid Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000339644500001"}
