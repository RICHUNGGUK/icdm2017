A sufficient condition is derived for the infinite horizon H-infinity control of such systems in terms of a set of coupled second-order Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities (HJIs). In general, it is difficult to solve these coupled HJIs. By using fuzzy approach, the infinite horizon H-infinity control design for nonlinear stochastic Markov jump systems is developed via solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) instead of HJIs. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
