The variational Bayes (VB) approach, a tractable alternative, has recently shown good performance in the automatic relevance determination model (ARD), a kind of hierarchical Bayesian learning, in brain current estimation from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, an ill-posed linear inverse problem. On the other hand, it has been proved that, in three-layer linear neural networks (LNNs), the VB approach is asymptotically equivalent to a positive-part James-Stein type shrinkage estimation. In this paper, noting the similarity between the ARD in a linear problem and an LNN, we analyze a simplified version of the VB approach in the ARD. We discuss its relation to the shrinkage estimation and how ill-posedness affects learning. We also propose the algorithm that requires simpler computation than, and will provide similar performance to, the VB approach.", "paper_title": "Analytic solution of hierarchical variational Bayes in linear inverse problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200025"}
