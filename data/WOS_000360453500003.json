We extend this result to a new characterization result on weighted {delta upsilon(mu+1),delta upsilon(mu); k - 1, q}-minihypers. We prove that such minihypers are sums of p-dimensional subspaces and of (projected) (2 mu + 1)-dimensional Baer subgeometries.", "paper_title": "ON WEIGHTED MINIHYPERS IN FINITE PROJECTIVE SPACES OF SQUARE ORDER", "paper_id": "WOS:000360453500003"}
