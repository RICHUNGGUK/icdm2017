The brilliant successes of probability theory are visible to all. What is problematical relates to the basic question: What is probability? There are many answers but no unanimity. What is suggested in this note are definitions of possibility and probability which are based on fuzzy logic. More concretely, the definitions are based on the concept of similarity. Similarity-based definition of probability reduces to the traditional frequency-based definition of probability when similarity is exact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
