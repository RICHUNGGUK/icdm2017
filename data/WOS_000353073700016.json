To assist the modeler to choose a relevant pool of efficiency criteria, a method is proposed to identify dissimilar criteria. A total of 30 efficiency criteria used in environmental modeling are critically reviewed and classified into six groups according to different modeling objectives. After accounting for equivalence of functional form 18 criteria remain for further analysis. To quantify the dissimilarity for the remaining criteria a methodology based on the ratio of shared parameter sets in regions of good performance is proposed. Then, for a wastewater treatment plant case-study the dissimilarity of efficiency criteria is analyzed as a function of target variables and operating conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
