In our proposed algorithm, the rotation and translation process from a frontal-view face image to a nonfrontal-view face image is at first formulated as a constrained independent component analysis (cICA) model. Then, the overcomplete ICA problem is converted into a normal ICA problem by incorporating a prior from the CANDIDE 3-D face model. Furthermore, the CANDIDE model is employed to construct a reference signal that is used in both the initialization and the objective function of the cICA model. Moreover, a model-integration method is proposed to improve the depth-estimation accuracy when multiple nonfrontal-view face images are available. An important advantage of the proposed algorithm is that no frontal-view face image is required for the estimation of the corresponding 3-D face structure. Experimental results on a real 3-D face image database demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Depth Estimation of Face Images Based on the Constrained ICA Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000290737100010"}
