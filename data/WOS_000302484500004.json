More specifically, we associate various sound parameters with the internal state of an agent at a given time (position, orientation, internal variables, etc.), and therefore the evolution of an agent during the simulation will modify the corresponding soundscape. The sound sources are dynamically spatialized in the actual installation space through several loudspeakers (24 loudspeakers+1 subwoofer) and modified in real-time, providing thus an ever-changing ambient soundscape. This generative music installation uses Nature-inspired simulations to drive the musical processes, and in particular the swarm intelligence metaphor.", "paper_title": "Ambient sound spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000302484500004"}
