Do these two important issues also relate one to another, and how? Can some lessons be learned that are important not only to security professionals but also to organizational and other important systems managing decision makers? Assuming that the answer is yes, how can we deploy innovation techniques to further improve IS security? Because this interdisciplinary area has not been addressed so far, this article presents one of the first attempts to address it on the basis of statistically relevant data on a national and international scale. It provides experimental results that imply some important statistical interdependencies that call for further study and also identifies systemic limitations, including those that exist on the European Union scale, that should be addressed to enable progress in this area.", "paper_title": "Driving Information Systems Security through Innovations-First Indications", "paper_id": "WOS:000329154400004"}
