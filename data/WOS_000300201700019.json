The relationship between the similarity measure and the entropy of IFS is investigated in detail. Six theorems on how the similarity measure could be transformed into the entropy for IFS and vice versa are proposed based on their axiomatic definitions. Some formulas have been proposed to calculate the similarity measure and the entropy of IFS. Finally, sufficient conditions to transform the similarity measures to the entropy for IFS and vice versa are given. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
