However, currently used fusion strategies do not evaluate the importance degree of the output of individual component SVM classifier when combining the component predictions to the final decision. A SVMs ensemble method based on fuzzy integral is presented in this paper to deal with this problem. This method aggregates the outputs of separate component SVNls with importance of each component SVM, which is subjectively assigned as the nature of fuzzy logic. The simulating results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a single SVM and traditional SVMs aggregation technique via majority voting in terms of classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Support vector machines ensemble based on fuzzy integral for classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000143"}
