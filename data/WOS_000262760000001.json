Three field studies were conducted with knowledge workers who have used avatar and traditional e-mail. This Study demonstrates that overall perception toward avatar c-mail is significantly different from traditional c-mail with respect to media richness and social presence characteristics. In addition, this study found individuals used different e-mail selection approaches when conducting tasks with different equivocality (high versus low equivocal tasks) and tasks for different communication direction (lateral versus upward). Avatar e-mail users also sent lengthier messages than traditional e-mail users when conducting it highly equivocal task. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
