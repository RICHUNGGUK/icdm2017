A kit (Map Database Manager) is developed and described in detail. The kit can convert GIS data of commercial formats such as ArcGIS and Mapinfo into Geospatial data in GML, and provide Geospatial data for handheld devices freely without commercial plug-in software. A peer to peer multi-agents mechanism on mobile GIS services is the main subject of this paper. According to user's requirement and known buffer area radius on map, agent can define the factors to calculate the optimal path from one node to target node in a map, which considers not only the length of the road but also traffic flow, road cost, and other factors. We use the integrated cost to re-define the road path weights, and select the optimal path among the road based on the minimum weight. The actual experimental results shown that in the quantified traffic flow and road condition, from node to other target nodes, we can get an optimal path on map, which satisfies the condition mostly. The results can greatly assist the searching of the optimal path in GIS services.
