Both the traditional statistical methods and neural networks are looked upon as competing model-building techniques in literature. This paper carries out a comprehensive review of articles that involve a comparative study of feed forward neural networks and statistical techniques used for prediction and classification problems in various areas of applications. Tabular presentations highlighting the important features of these articles are also provided. This study aims to give useful insight into the capabilities of neural networks and statistical methods used in different kinds of applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
