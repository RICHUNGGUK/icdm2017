Consequently, techniques have been developed to estimate diffusion parameters from partial and discrete observations. Likelihood-based inference can be problematic as closed form transition densities are rarely available. One widely used solution involves the introduction of latent data points between every pair of observations to allow a Euler-Maruyama approximation of the true transition densities to become accurate. In recent literature, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been used to sample the posterior distribution of latent data and model parameters; however, naive schemes suffer from a mixing problem that worsens with the degree of augmentation. A global MCMC scheme that can be applied to a large class of diffusions and whose performance is not adversely affected by the number of latent values is therefore explored. The methodology is illustrated by estimating parameters governing an auto-regulatory gene network, using partial and discrete data that are subject to measurement error. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
