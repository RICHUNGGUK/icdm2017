Experience has showed that despite some impediments, this has become a valuable change to both the organization and its development process. The aim of this study is to identify and understand enabling factors of a combined process, and to understand their subsequent effects. Qualitative data are summarized and analyzed, giving insight into the actions taken, their effects that have emerged over time, and the enabling and contextual factors. The study concludes that a combined process is feasible, that the simplified approach makes the organization more flexible and thus capable of serving a volatile market with fast-changing technologies. This has also enabled the organization to collaborate better with external actors.
