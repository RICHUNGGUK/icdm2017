Resolutions to these problems are time consuming and expensive. This paper discusses the use of data mining in solving some of these problems to improve the system development life cycle process. A case study of applying data mining to the software problem report management data is also presented. The empirical results demonstrate the capability and benefit of data mining analysis in systems development life cycle.", "paper_title": "Use of data mining in system development life cycle", "paper_id": "WOS:000236545100009"}
