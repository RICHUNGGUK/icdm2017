These claims have been tested and found to be unsupported by MATLAB code supplied to the author by Wang and Ma. The author's tests are presented, and test code made available as supplementary material. It is found that not only is the QTFM code faster, but that Wang and Ma's algorithm has run-time that scales with the square of the size of the matrix, whereas the algorithm in QTFM has run time approximately linear in matrix size. These findings are consistent with an inspection of the code. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
