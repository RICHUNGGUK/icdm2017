We follow the approach in Xia et al. (2009) on combining the multifrontal method with hierarchical matrices. We present a variant of that approach with additional hierarchical structure, extend it to quasi-uniform meshes, and detail an adaptive decomposition procedure for general meshes. Linear time complexity is shown for a quasi-regular grid and demonstrated via numerical results for the adaptive algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
