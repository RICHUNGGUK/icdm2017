Experimental results show that the leakage power of the proposed flip flops can be reduced more than an average of 59% in standby mode and in active mode the total power consumption can be reduced more than an average of 53% while the delay time stays the same. It is also show that the proposed D flip-flops can work even when the clock swing is nearly as low as V-dd/3, though the delay time is much increased.", "paper_title": "Low clock swing D flip-flops design by using output control and MTCMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600047"}
