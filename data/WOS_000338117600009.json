Viewed as functions, skew polynomials have a well-defined evaluation map; however, little is known about skew-polynomial interpolation. In this work, we apply Kotter's interpolation framework to free modules over skew polynomial rings. As a special case, we introduce a simple interpolation algorithm akin to Newton interpolation for ordinary polynomials.", "paper_title": "Kotter interpolation in skew polynomial rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000338117600009"}
