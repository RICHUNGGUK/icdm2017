Based on this, we present a concrete approximation procedure to show the capability of four-layer regular fuzzy neural networks to perform approximation on the set of all d(p) continuous fuzzy-valued functions. This approach can also be used to approximate d(infinity) continuous fuzzy-valued functions. An example is given to illustrate the approximation procedure. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
