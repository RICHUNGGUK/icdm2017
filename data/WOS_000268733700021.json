According to the hazard extents and the occurrence frequencies of different faults, the faults are divided into different grades. The higher the fault grade, the larger the number of the used sub neural networks is. Experimental results show that our approach makes the correctness rate of the fault diagnosis rise greatly (from less than 95.0% to 99.5%) and the performance of the whole fault diagnosis system gets much better especially for the online complex systems. The approach proposed in this paper also can be extended to other complex fault diagnosis systems, such as mechanical systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
