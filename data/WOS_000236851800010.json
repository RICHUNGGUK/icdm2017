Fuzzy logic can be incorporated to ontology to represent uncertainty information. Typically, fuzzy ontology is generated from a predefined concept hierarchy. However, to construct a concept hierarchy for a certain domain can be a difficult and tedious task. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes the FOGA ( Fuzzy Ontology Generation frAmework) for automatic generation of fuzzy ontology on uncertainty information. The FOGA framework comprises the following components: Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis, Concept Hierarchy Generation, and Fuzzy Ontology Generation. We also discuss approximating reasoning for incremental enrichment of the ontology with new upcoming data. Finally, a fuzzy-based technique for integrating other attributes of database to the ontology is proposed.", "paper_title": "Automatic fuzzy ontology generation for Semantic Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000236851800010"}
