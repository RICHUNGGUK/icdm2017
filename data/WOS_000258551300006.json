The parareal algorithm was pioneered by Lions et (it. (C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser I Math. 2001; 332:661-668) and later improved in a paper by Bill and Maday, (Proceedings ( of the Workshop) mi Domain Decomposition, Zurich, Switzerland, Lecture Notes in Computer Science and Engineering Series, vol. 23. Springer: Berlin, 2002). Alternative formulations have also been presented,,here the parallel in time algorithm proposed by Farhat and Chandesris (Int. J. Numer Methods Eng, 2003; 58:1397-1434) is the most important one. This algorithm enables parallel computation Using a decomposition of the interval of time integration. Solutions are obtained sequentially oil the coarse time grid and on the fine time grid in parallel. A practical problem for the Bohai Sell is calculated on the supercomputer cluster Nankai Stars. The properties of the modified propagators are analyzed in (his paper.
