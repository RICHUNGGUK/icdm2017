To consider a complete model of the plant, the quadratic derivative of state variables is added to the conventional model which causes an extra weighting. The aim of the controller designed is to keep the load angle (I center dot) zero, all the time, which means no physical swinging in the load's position. The results obtained are compared with the optimal control method, as one of the well-known control techniques, to verify the designed controller. The results show that the designed fuzzy controller is able to dampen the oscillations in the load swing angle and load's angular velocity, in a reasonable time.", "paper_title": "Designing precision fuzzy controller for load swing of an overhead crane", "paper_id": "WOS:000360005900004"}
