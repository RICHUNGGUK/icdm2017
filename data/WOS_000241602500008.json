In principle, deformations based on B-splines are not invertible. The consistency term overcomes this limitation and allows registration of two images in a completely symmetric way. This extension of the elastic registration method simplifies the search for the optimum deformation and allows registering with no information about landmarks or deformation regularization. This approach can also be used as the first step to solve the problem of group-wise registration....y", "paper_title": "Consistent and elastic registration of histological sections using vector-spline regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241602500008"}
