It is an active research area in the domain of document analysis and recognition. Literature is replete with several document skew detection and correction techniques. The focus of this article is to present, compare, and analyze techniques for two subareas of document image analysis: skew angle estimation and correction. Several algorithms proposed in the literature are synthetically described. Accordingly, document skew estimation and correction techniques are broadly divided into several categories. Critical discussions are observed about the current status of the field and persistent problems of each category are highlighted. Finally, possible solutions are recommended.", "paper_title": "DOCUMENT SKEW ESTIMATION AND CORRECTION: ANALYSIS OF TECHNIQUES, COMMON PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296541800001"}
