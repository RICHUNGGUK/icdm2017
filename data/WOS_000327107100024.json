This paper focuses on the problem of direct generation of line-based sunken relief from a 3D mesh. We show how to extract, post-process and organize the messy feature lines in regular forms, applicable for lines engraving on the sculpture surfaces. We further describe how to construct a smooth height field from the input object, and derive a continuous pitting corrosion method to generate the cutting paths. The whole framework is conducted in object-space, making it flexible for stroke stylization and depth control of the engraving lines. We demonstrate the results with several impressive renderings and photographs used to illustrate the paper itself. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
