Staging information is critical for diagnosing the extent of cancer in a patient and for planning individualised treatment. Extracting such information into more structured form saves time, improves reporting, and underpins the potential for automated decision support. Methods and material: We investigate the portability of a text mining model constructed from records from one health centre, by applying it directly to the extraction task over a set of records from a different health centre, with different reporting narrative characteristics. Other than a simple normalisation step on features associated with target labels, we apply the models from one system directly to the other. Results: The best F-scores for in-hospital experiments are 81%, 85%, and 94% (for staging T, N, and M respectively), while best cross-hospital F-scores reach 84%, 81%, and 91% for the same respective categories. Conclusions: Our performance results compare favourably to the best levels reported in the literature, and most relevant to our aim here the cross-corpus results demonstrate the portability of the models we developed.
