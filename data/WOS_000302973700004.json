Automatic systems for pattern recognition may be designed on a structural description derived from sensor observations. Alternatively, training sets of examples can be used in statistical learning procedures. They are most powerful for vectorial object representations. Unfortunately, structural descriptions do not match well with vectorial representations. Consequently it is difficult to combine the structural and statistical approaches to pattern recognition. Structural descriptions may be used to compare objects. This leads to a set of pairwise dissimilarities from which vectors can be derived for the purpose of statistical learning. The resulting dissimilarity representation bridges thereby the structural and statistical approaches. The dissimilarity space is one of the possible spaces resulting from this representation. It is very general and easy to implement. This paper gives a historical review and discusses the properties of the dissimilarity space approaches illustrated by a set of examples on real world datasets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
