This paper introduces a notion of substitution acting on multi-dimensional words, namely local rule substitutions. Roughly speaking, local rules play for multi-dimensional words the role played by the concatenation product for substitutions on words. We then particularly focus on the local rule substitutions which act on the two-dimensional words coding stepped surfaces, and we show that a wide class of them can be derived from generalized substitutions.
