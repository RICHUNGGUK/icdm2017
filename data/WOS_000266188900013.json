This method is unique in its ability to handle images taken from unconstrained perspective viewpoints and unconstrained illumination directions. The correspondence between such images is hard to compute and no other known method can handle this problem locally from a small number of images. Our method combines geometric and photometric information in order to recover dense correspondence between the images and accurately computes the 3D shape. Only a single pass starting at one point and local computation are used. This is in contrast to methods that use the occluding contours recovered from many images to initialize and constrain an optimization process. The output of our method can be used to initialize such processes. In the special case of fixed viewpoint, the proposed method becomes a new perspective photometric stereo algorithm. Nevertheless, the introduction of the multiview setup, self-occlusions, and regions close to the occluding boundaries are better handled, and the method is more robust to noise than photometric stereo. Experimental results are presented for simulated and real images.", "paper_title": "3D Shape Recovery of Smooth Surfaces: Dropping the Fixed-Viewpoint Assumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000266188900013"}
