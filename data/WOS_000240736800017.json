The key idea of this paper is to define both measurements and reconstructions as point clouds and describe all statistical assumptions in terms of this finite dimensional representation. This yields a discretization of the problem that can be solved using numerical optimization techniques. The resulting algorithm reconstructs both topology and geometry inform of a well-sampled point cloud with noise removed. In a final step, this representation is then converted into a triangle mesh. The proposed approach is conceptually simple and easy to extend. We apply the approach to reconstruct piecewise-smooth surfaces with sharp features and examine the performance of the algorithm on different synthetic and real-world data sets.", "paper_title": "Bayesian point cloud reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000240736800017"}
