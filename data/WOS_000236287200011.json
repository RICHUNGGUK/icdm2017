In this paper, the authors propose a technique that can handle the antenna problem during the layer-assignment (LA) stage, which is an important step between global routing and detailed routing. The antenna-avoidance problem is modeled as a tree-partitioning problem with a linear-time-optimal-algorithm solution. This algorithm is customized to guide antenna avoidance in the LA stage. A linear-time optimal,jumper-insertion algorithm is also derived. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed techniques can lead to an average of 76% antenna-violation reduction and 99% via-violation reduction.", "paper_title": "Antenna avoidance in layer assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000236287200011"}
