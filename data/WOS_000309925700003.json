Obtaining text-based representation from quantization of mocap data turned out to be efficient. It becomes a fundamental step of many researches in human motion analysis. Geometric features are one of these techniques, which involve much prior knowledge and reduce data redundancy of numerical data. We describe geometric features as basic unit to define human motions (also called mo-words) and view a human motion as a generative process. Therefore, we obtain topic motions, which possess more semantic information using latent Dirichlet allocation by learning from massive training examples in order to understand motions better. We combine probabilistic model with human motion retrieval and come up with a new representation of human motions and a new retrieval framework. Our experiments demonstrate its advantages, both for understanding motions and retrieval.
