Based on performance analysis of the system, an optimal operating system with maximum-likelihood decoding is demonstrated. Surprisingly, this operation reveals that the optimal way for the system to transmit signals needs to invoke the multimode scheme. We propose designing criteria for this scheme and methods for pre-codebooks, and a method to determine the number of modes for any specific channel. Furthermore, to reduce encoding complexity at the receiver side, we also develop a fast encoding algorithm. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the proposed systems offer considerable gain over existing systems. Moreover, these systems also have much lower encoding complexity. Indeed, for the case of a MIMO system with two pairs of transmitting and receiving antennas, a properly designed system with a transmission rate of 8 bits per channel use and with 6-bit feedback can provide about a 1.5 dB performance gain over a beamforming system.", "paper_title": "A MIMO system with finite-bit feedback based on fixed constellations", "paper_id": "WOS:000320077800003"}
