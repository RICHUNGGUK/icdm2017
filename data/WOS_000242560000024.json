It proposes and validates an architecture that explores the joint use of packet prioritization and scalable video coding together with the appropriate mapping of UMTS traffic classes to the DiffServ traffic classes. A set of simulation scenarios, involving eight different video sequences, demonstrates the quality gains of both scalable video coding and prioritized packetization.", "paper_title": "End-to-end QoS issues of MPEG4-FGS video streaming traffic delivery in an IP/UMTS network", "paper_id": "WOS:000242560000024"}
