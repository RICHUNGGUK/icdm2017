Existing logical inconsistency detection methods usually focus on information stored in a knowledge base by using a well-defined general purpose knowledge representation approach, and therefore cannot fulfill the demands of a domain-specific situation. This paper first proposes a state-based knowledge representation approach, in which domain-specific knowledge is expressed by combinations of the relevant objects' states. Based on this approach, a method for information logical inconsistency detection (ILID) is developed which can flexibly handle the demands of various domain-specific situations through reducing part of restrictions in existing methods. Finally, two real-case based examples are presented to illustrate the ILID method and its advantages. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
