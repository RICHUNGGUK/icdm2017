Its performance is validated by in vivo experiments, in which rats are trained to run down a maze to respond to auditory instruction cues by turning right or left in order to get an electrical stimulation 'virtual reward', and by comparing spikes recorded from the brain of rats between our device and a commercially available device (Spike2, Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd.). Results show that our device can work reliably and stably, and with notable characteristics of light weight (9g, without battery), simplicity and practicality.", "paper_title": "A wireless miniature device for neural stimulating and recording in small animals", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100113"}
