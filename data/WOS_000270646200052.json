However, the category-based service discovery, such as UDDI, is clearly insufficient. Semantic web services, augmenting web service descriptions using semantic web technology, were introduced to facilitate the publication, discovery, and execution of web services at the semantic level. Semantic matchmaker enhances the capability of UDDI service registries in the semantic web services architecture by applying some matching algorithms between advertisements and requests described in OWL-S to recognize various degrees of matching for web services. Based on semantic web service framework, semantic matchmaker and probabilistic matching approach, this paper proposes a weighted ontology-based semantic similarity algorithm for web service to support a more automated and veracious service discovery and rank process in the semantic web service framework.
