Although near-to-optimal solutions based on Turbo and LDPC codes exist for this problem, in most cases the proposed techniques do not scale to networks of hundreds of sensors. We present a scalable solution based on the following key elements: (a) distortion-optimized index assignments for low-complexity distributed quantization, (b) source-optimized hierarchical clustering based on the Kullback-Leibler distance and (c) sum-product decoding on specific factor graphs exploiting the correlation of the data.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Coding and Source-Optimized Clustering for Large-Scale Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000267018200006"}
