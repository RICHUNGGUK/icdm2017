In implementing such networks, efficient bandwidth allocation schemes are essential to satisfy quality of service (QoS) and fairness requirements of various traffic classes. Existing proposals for solving the bandwidth allocation problem in EPON/WiMAX networks neglect interactions between the self-interested EPON and WiMAX service providers (WSPs). Accordingly, this study proposes a two-stage game-theoretic framework for the intra-ONU bandwidth allocation process where the interactions between the EPON and WSPs are taken into account. In the first stage of the proposed framework, a fair and efficient sharing of the available upstream bandwidth between the EPON and WiMAX networks is determined using two market models (i.e., noncooperative and cooperative). In the second stage, the bandwidth allocation obtained from the first stage is distributed among the different traffic classes within the Ethernet and WiMAX networks in accordance with their QoS requirements by means of a Nash bargaining game. Simulation results show that the proposed game-theoretic framework efficiently allocates bandwidth under different market models while simultaneously ensuring proportional fairness among the various traffic classes for the corresponding networks.", "paper_title": "Intra-ONU Bandwidth Allocation Games in Integrated EPON/WiMAX Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320671300007"}
