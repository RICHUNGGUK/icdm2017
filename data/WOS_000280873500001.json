Utilizing a common computational framework, diverse theoretical descriptions can be used to provide the best solution for a given scientific problem. Scalable parallel implementations and modular software design enable efficient utilization of current computational architectures. This paper provides an overview of NWChem focusing primarily on the core theoretical modules provided by the code and their parallel performance. Program summary Program title: NWChem Catalogue identifier: AEGI_v1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEGI_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Open Source Educational Community License No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 11 709 543 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 680 696 106 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 77, C Computer: all Linux based workstations and parallel supercomputers. Windows and Apple machines Operating system: Linux, OS X, Windows Has the code been vectorised or parallelized?: Code is parallelized Classification: 2.1, 2.2, 3, 7.3, 7.7, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.10, 16.13 Nature of problem: Large-scale atomistic simulations of chemical and biological systems require efficient and reliable methods for ground and excited solutions of many-electron Hamiltonian, analysis of the potential energy surface, and dynamics. Solution method: Ground and excited solutions of many-electron Hamiltonian are obtained utilizing density-functional theory, many-body perturbation approach, and coupled cluster expansion. These solutions or a combination thereof with classical descriptions are then used to analyze potential energy surface and perform dynamical simulations. Additional comments: Full documentation is provided in the distribution file. This includes an INSTALL file giving details of how to build the package. A set of test runs is provided in the examples directory. The distribution file for this program is over 90 Mbytes and therefore is not delivered directly when download or Email is requested. Instead a html file giving details of how the program can be obtained is sent. Running time: Running time depends on the size of the chemical system, complexity of the method, number of cpu's and the computational task. It ranges from several seconds for serial OFT energy calculations on a few atoms to several hours for parallel coupled cluster energy calculations on tens of atoms or ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation on hundreds of atoms.
