Because the object sizes within regions can only be changed in discrete units, we refer to them as quantum content. Our real-time algorithms enable a compelling interactive display as users resize the canvas, or move and resize the primary region.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical layouts for photo libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241195300013"}
