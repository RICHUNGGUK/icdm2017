The scheme allocates a pertinent number of cores to the task execution, inactivates unused cores, and assigns the lowest frequency meeting the deadline. For a periodic real-time task with consecutive real-time instances, the scheme prepares the minimum-energy solutions for all input cases at off-line time, and applies one of the prepared solutions to each real-time instance at runtime.", "paper_title": "Minimum-Energy Semi-Static Scheduling of a Periodic Real-Time Task on DVFS-Enabled Multi-Core Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304900012"}
