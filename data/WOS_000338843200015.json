In all these systems, the computational parallelism is obtained from multiple processors. Multistage interconnection networks (MINs) play a vital role on the performance of these multiprocessor systems. This paper introduces a new fault-tolerant MIN named as improved extra group network (IEGN). IEGN is designed by existing extra group (EGN) network, which is a regular multipath network with limited fault tolerance. IEGN provides four times more paths between any source-destination pairs compared with EGN. The performance of IEGN has been evaluated in terms of permutation capability, fault tolerance, reliability, path length, and cost. It has also been proved that the IEGN can achieve better results in terms of fault tolerance, reliability, path length and cost-effectiveness, in comparison to known networks, namely, EGN, augmented baseline network, augmented shuffle-exchange network, fault-tolerant double tree, Benes network, and Replicated MIN.", "paper_title": "Improved extra group network: a new fault-tolerant multistage interconnection network", "paper_id": "WOS:000338843200015"}
