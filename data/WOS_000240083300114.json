An affective speech corpus is first built up. It contains passages read in neutral state and ten typical emotional states selected in Pleasure Arousal Dominance (PAD) space. Physiological data, including electrocardiogram, respiration, electro dermal data, and finger pulse, are also collected synchronized with speech. Then, based on the corpus, the relationship between emotional categories\\dimensions and acoustic\\physiological features is analyzed in three methods: average, correlation and co-clustering. The analysis results show that most acoustic features and physiological features are significantly correlated with the arousal dimension, whereas respiration features are more correlated with the pleasure dimension.", "paper_title": "Acoustic and physiological feature analysis of affective speech", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300114"}
