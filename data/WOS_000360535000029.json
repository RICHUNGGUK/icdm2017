Yet despite considerable effort invested in optimizing work stealing task queues, existing algorithms issue a costly memory fence when removing a task, and these fences are believed to be necessary for correctness. This paper refutes this belief, demonstrating work stealing algorithms in which a worker does not issue a memory fence for microarchitectures with a bounded total store ordering (TSO) memory model. Bounded TSO is a novel restriction of TSO-capturing mainstream x86 and SPARC TSO processors-that bounds the number of stores a load can be reordered with. Our algorithms eliminate the memory fence penalty, improving the running time of a suite of parallel benchmarks on modern x86 multicore processors by 7% 11% on average (and up to 23%), compared to the Cilk and Chase-Lev work stealing queues.", "paper_title": "Fence-Free Work Stealing on Bounded TSO Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000360535000029"}
