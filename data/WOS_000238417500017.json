EAPS is easy to be hardware-implemented and scalable for high-speed networks. Additionally, EAPS is automatically adaptive to traffic rate under resource constrains, thus it is convenient to be used by network operators. Experiments are conducted with the real network traces. Results show that EAPS is more accurate than ANF over links with light load or traffic fluctuations.", "paper_title": "Easily-implemented Adaptive Packet Sampling for high speed networks flow measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500017"}
