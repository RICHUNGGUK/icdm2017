The timely physiological self-inhibitory function they may serve, indicated by the spike-timing dependent plasticity rule, provides a potential negative feedback mechanism to control the dynamical properties of neurons. The model autapse is applied to a neuron with conductance-based minimal model to construct a fast-slow buster. Three types of bursting that the burster exhibits are analyzed geometrically through phase portraits to illustrate the modulation competence of the autapse model on bursting.", "paper_title": "Autapse modulated bursting", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000052"}
