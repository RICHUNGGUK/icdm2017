We consider three types of individual models (independent model, retailer's point of view model, and supplier's point of view model). The focus of this model is minimization of the coordinated total relevant cost, and then we apply the compensation policy for the benefits and losses to our coordinated inventory model. The optimal solution procedure for the developed model is derived and the effects of the compensation policy on the optimal results are studied with the help of numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Coordinated inventory models with compensation policy in a three level supply chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300064"}
