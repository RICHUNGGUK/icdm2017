A k-regular Hamiltonian and Hamiltonian connected graph G is optimal fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and Hamiltonian connected if G remains Hamiltonian after removing at most k-2 vertices and/or edges and remains Hamiltonian connected after removing at most k-3 vertices and/or edges. In this paper, we investigate in constructing optimal fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and optimal fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected graphs. Therefore, some of the generalized hypercubes, twisted-cubes, crossed-cubes, and Mobius cubes are optimal fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and optimal fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected.", "paper_title": "A family of Hamiltonian and Hamiltonian connected graphs with fault tolerance", "paper_id": "WOS:000282225700005"}
