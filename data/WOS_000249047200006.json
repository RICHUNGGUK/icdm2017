It outperforms existing ones on important criteria while keeping the same computation time: accuracy on smooth or polygonal shapes, isotropy, preservation of inflexion points and convexity, asymptotic behaviour. Its asymptotic convergence (sometimes called multigrid convergence) is proved in the case of convex shapes with C-3 boundary. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
