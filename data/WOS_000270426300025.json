By employing new Lyapunov functions and free-weighting matrix technique, some new delay-dependent sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are established for the addressed neural networks to be robustly globally exponentially stable in the mean square sense. The convexities of certain matrix equations are utilized when estimating the upper bound of the Lyapunov functional's derivative, which may results in less conservative criteria, To show the effectiveness of our methods, three examples are presented.", "paper_title": "NOVEL ROBUST DELAY-DEPENDENT EXPONENTIAL STABILITY CRITERIA FOR STOCHASTIC DELAYED RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300025"}
