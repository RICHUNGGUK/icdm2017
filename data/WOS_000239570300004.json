Due to the uncertainties in execution time of some tasks, this paper models each varied execution time as a probabilistic random variable and incorporating applications' performance requirements to solve the MAP (Mode Assignment with Probability) problem. Using probabilistic design, we propose an optimal algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption while satisfying the timing constraint with a guaranteed confidence probability. The experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy saving than previous work. For example, our algorithm achieves an average improvement of 32.6% on total energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Efficent algorithm of energy minimization for heterogeneous wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300004"}
