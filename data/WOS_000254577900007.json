The technology for art belongs to the last one. The technology to access human emotion cannot be evaluated in the same way as the one for industrial applications. We need a sort of multilateral standard method to evaluate technical research on music and art that requires both universal and individual viewpoints. This paper begins with the evaluation issue of KANSEI technology related to music. Then our recent projects on music computing promoted by the Japan Science and Technology Agency are introduced.", "paper_title": "Evaluation issue of KANSEI technology and sound and music computing projects at Waseda University", "paper_id": "WOS:000254577900007"}
