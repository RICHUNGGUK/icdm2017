We present a discriminative learning algorithm which simultaneously learns the DNA binding site motifs as well as the logical structure and spatial aspects of CRMs. Results: Our results on yeast datasets show better predictive accuracy than a current state-of-the-art approach on the same datasets. Our results on yeast, fly and human datasets show that the inclusion of logical and spatial aspects improves the predictive accuracy of our learned models.", "paper_title": "Learning probabilistic models of cis-regulatory modules that represent logical and spatial aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000243992400025"}
