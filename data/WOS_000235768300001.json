The contest. was held on the publically available XM2VTS database [4] according to a, defined protocol [15]. The aim of the competition was to assess the advances made in face recognition since 2003 and to measure the sensitivity of the tested algorithms to severe changes in illumination conditions. In total, more than 10 algorithms submitted by three groups were compared(1). The results show that the relative performance of some algorithms is dependent on training conditions (data, protocol) as well as environmental changes.", "paper_title": "Performance characterisation of face recognition algorithms and their sensitivity to severe illumination changes", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300001"}
