Significant focus within computer science and engineering has therefore been placed upon developing methods by which task-relevant information can be made as accessible as possible within the interface, thus reducing operator workload - a goal of traditional human factors approaches to interface design. Recent theoretical perspectives of adaptive human cognition [ Gray, W. D. and Fu, W.-T. (2004). Soft constraints in interactive behaviour: the case of ignoring perfect knowledge in the world for imperfect knowledge in the head. Cogn. Sci., 28, 359 - 383] suggest that there is a delicate balance and a series of trade-offs between information access at the interface and resulting human interactive behaviour. A distinction has been drawn between display- and memory-based strategies. Two experiments are reported that investigated the relationship between information access and the selection of cognitive strategy, particularly the effect on learning and memory. Experiment 1 varied the cost of accessing information in a routine copying task, and found that higher access costs (e.g. mouse movement plus 1-s delay) led to the adoption of a memory-based strategy, and better retention of visual-spatial information. Experiment 2 manipulated the availability of fused information in a low-fidelity flight simulation task. Temporarily removing onscreen information similarly improved recall of site location information. The potential benefits are discussed of a novel approach to display design that manipulates information access depending on task performance criteria.", "paper_title": "Influencing cognitive strategy by manipulating information access", "paper_id": "WOS:000250676500006"}
