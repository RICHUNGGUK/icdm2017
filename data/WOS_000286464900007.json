The genus of an oriented chord diagram is the minimal genus of an oriented surface in which it may be realized. Let g(n) denote the expected genus of a randomly chosen oriented chord diagram of order n. We show that g(n) satisfies: gn = n/2 = Theta(ln n). I.c., there exist 0 < c(1) < c(2) and n(0) such that c(1) ln n <= n/2 - g(n) <= c(2) ln n for all n >= n(0).", "paper_title": "The Expected Genus of a Random Chord Diagram", "paper_id": "WOS:000286464900007"}
