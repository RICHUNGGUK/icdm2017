This is mainly due to the lack of quantified and reliable data on the human aspects of product/service development: usability, ecology, ethics, product experience, perceived quality and the like. Even if these data are available, consistent decision support tools are not ready available. Based on the findings from an industry review, a DEA model has been developed that permits to support strategic R&D portfolio management. The usability of this approach is underscored with real life examples from two different industries: consumables and materials manufacturing (polymers). (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
