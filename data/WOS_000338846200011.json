The authentication code is generated by using the random number generator with a seed, and the size of the authentication code is based on the user's requirement, with each BTC-compressed image block being used to carry the authentication code using the data hiding method. In the proposed scheme, to obtain a high-quality embedded image, a reference table is used when the authentication code is embedded. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves high-quality embedded images and guarantees the capability of tamper detection.", "paper_title": "A Tamper-Detection Scheme for BTC-Compressed Images with High-Quality Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000338846200011"}
