The methodology uses a combination of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Zero-One Goal Programming (ZOGP) to address not only the selection problem from the point of view of an individual stakeholder but also from that of multiple stakeholders, by aggregating different outcomes obtained by the stakeholders. The methodology then can simultaneously account for: minimisation of undesirable intangible and tangible criteria; resource limitations and goal constraints; the view of more than one stakeholder; and it can suggest a single, aggregated, go or no-go decision.
