Most research works focus on maximizing network throughput (NT), rather than NC, under specific traffic load. In our observation, these algorithms may limit NC. In the paper, we develop channel assignment algorithms for improving NC. We first model the optimizing NC problem of M-3 wireless networks and reduce the problem to the maximum weight independent set problem, which is proved to be NP-hard. Then, we propose two novel heuristic algorithms toward maximizing NC for high density network. From the simulation results, our algorithms outperform many in both computing efficiency and solution quality.", "paper_title": "Maximizing Capacity Channel Assignment in Multi-Rate Multi-Channel Multi-Hop Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000334146400009"}
