This is due to the cost-effectiveness of GPUs together with their potential capability of parallel processing. This paper presents an implementation of the widely employed fixed-complexity sphere decoder on GPUs, which allows to considerably decrease the computational time required for the data detection stage in multiple-input multiple-output systems. Both, the hard- and soft-output versions of the method have been implemented. Speedup results show the proposed GPU implementation boosts the runtime of the parallel execution of the methods in a high performance multi-core CPU. In addition, the throughput of the algorithm is evaluated and is shown to outperform other recent implementations and to fulfill the real-time requirements of several LTE configurations.", "paper_title": "An efficient GPU implementation of fixed-complexity sphere decoders for MIMO wireless systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000309510300003"}
