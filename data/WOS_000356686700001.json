According to RSSI data in the greenhouse, the parameters of the path-loss model are modified. Besides, least square estimation is used to filter RSSI data to eliminate random disturbance. Based on RSSI, the blind node is positioned by triangle centroid location method. Finally, to lessen the negative influence of steel pillars in the greenhouse, a region segmentation mechanism is introduced to the system. Experiments prove that our positioning system has higher accuracy in the greenhouse.", "paper_title": "Design of a RSSI Location System for Greenhouse Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000356686700001"}
