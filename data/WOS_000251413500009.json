An IFS is created based on an arbitrary seed and a set is constructed using the deterministic iteration algorithm (DIA). From this set pseudo random numbers have been constructed. The generators have big periods and pass all major statistical tests, indicating that they can be used in any application requiring random numbers, such as cryptography.", "paper_title": "Pseudo random number generation with the aid of iterated function systems on R-2", "paper_id": "WOS:000251413500009"}
