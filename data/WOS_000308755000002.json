To address this problem, we propose a CONcatenational GRaph Evolution (CONGRE) aging model, which adopts decomposition strategy in both spatial and temporal aspects to learn long-term aging patterns from partially dense aging databases. In spatial aspect, we build a graphical face representation, in which a human face is decomposed into mutually interrelated subregions under anatomical guidance. In temporal aspect, the long-term evolution of the above graphical representation is then modeled by connecting sequential short-term patterns following the Markov property of aging process under smoothness constraints between neighboring short-term patterns and consistency constraints among subregions. The proposed model also considers the diversity of face aging by proposing probabilistic concatenation strategy between short-term patterns and applying scholastic sampling in aging prediction. In experiments, the aging prediction results generated by the learned aging models are evaluated both subjectively and objectively to validate the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A Concatenational Graph Evolution Aging Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000308755000002"}
