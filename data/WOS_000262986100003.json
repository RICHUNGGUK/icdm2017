This assumption holds well for rigid objects with a Lambertian surface, but it is less appropriate for fluid and gaseous materials. For these materials an alternative assumption is required. This work examines three possible alternatives: gradient constancy, color constancy and brightness conservation (under this assumption the brightness of an object can diffuse to its neighborhood). Brightness conservation and color constancy are found to be adequate models. We propose a method for detecting regions of dynamic texture in image sequences. Accurate segmentation into regions of static and dynamic texture is achieved using a level set scheme. The level set function separates each image into regions that obey brightness constancy and regions that obey the alternative assumption. We show that the method can be simplified to obtain a less robust but fast algorithm, capable of real-time performance. Experimental results demonstrate accurate segmentation by the full level set scheme, as well as by the simplified method. The experiments included challenging image sequences, in which color or geometry cues by themselves would be insufficient.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Texture Detection Based on Motion Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000262986100003"}
