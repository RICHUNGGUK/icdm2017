However, the existing overlay networks have two problems: (1) performance degradation due to full-mesh tunneling and (2) increase in development cost due to the tightly coupled control and data planes. To solve these problems, we introduce a new abstraction layer for overlay networks in the existing network layering model. Based on the layering model, we designed and implemented a protocol stack, called ovstack, as a common data plane for overlay networks. In this manuscript, we describe the details of ovstack and of two control plane systems as a proof-of-concept. We evaluate the forwarding performance of ovstack and demonstrate the control plane systems. The results of the performance evaluation show that the average delay of packet forwarding is decreased by 12% and that jitter is 8% lower than one of the existing overlays. Our evaluations confirm that ovstack can contribute to the construction of overlay networks for each requirement on current networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
