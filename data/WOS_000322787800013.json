In this system, the management of a computer's input and output information is handled appropriately by the program language. The scheduling policies control design is used in the robotic arm's tracking system. The advantage of this control design is to activate each procedure running simultaneously when the transient overload of the information's input and output in the control system occurs. Therefore, the time run in the scheduling policies control system will be shorter than that of a traditional control system in which each procedure is lined up for running. In this paper, case studies of the scheduling police control application used in image tracking vision control are introduced. The results reveal that the speed of the tracking system can be improved by using the scheduling police technique under an immediate procedure plan.", "paper_title": "Design and application of the stereo vision manipulator with novel scheduling policies control", "paper_id": "WOS:000322787800013"}
