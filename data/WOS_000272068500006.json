Because crime is thriving, avoiding malicious behavior and protecting property becomes an important issue. To prevent malicious behavior, many proposals have been put forth. The subliminal channel is the most popular method, which notifies the designated receiver to transmit secret messages. Simmons was the first to propose this concept in 1983. Now, more and more digital signature applications use a subliminal channel to transfer secret messages. In this paper, we propose a traceable E-cash transfer system against blackmail via subliminal channel. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
