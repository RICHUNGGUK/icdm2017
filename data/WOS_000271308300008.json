A bladed rotor composed of equally spaced flexible blades mounted on a flexible ring is considered. The blades are equipped with piezoelectric devices that convert vibrational energy into electrical energy, which is in turn dissipated by suitable electric shunts comprising resistive components. The optimization of these shunts, aimed at maximizing the vibration damping, is achieved by employing a simple and accurate dynamical model, derived via a homogenization procedure.", "paper_title": "Optimization of a passive vibration control scheme acting on a bladed rotor using an homogenized model", "paper_id": "WOS:000271308300008"}
