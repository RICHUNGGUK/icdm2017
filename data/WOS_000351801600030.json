The systems involve stochastic disturbances and nonlinearities that can be described by T-S fuzzy models. The problem to be solved in the paper is to find a reduced-order model, which is able to approximate the original T-S fuzzy Markov jump system with comparatively small and acceptable errors. Specifically, the corresponding error system is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable in the mean square with a prescribed H-infinity performance index. By using convex optimization approach and projection approach, respectively, sufficient conditions on the existence for such model with reduced-order are obtained and presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
