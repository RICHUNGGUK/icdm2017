First we look at the semi-discrete boundary value problem as a Cauchy problem and use spectral decomposition of self adjoint operators to arrive at the temporal error estimates both in L-2 and energy norms. Later, following the wavelet approximation theory, we propose spatial error estimates in L-2 and energy norms. And finally arrive at a priori estimates for the fully discrete problem.", "paper_title": "Error estimates for time accurate wavelet based schemes for hyperbolic partial differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000251284800009"}
