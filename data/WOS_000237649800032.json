The operation of RFID systems in advanced applications may pose security and privacy risks to both organizations and individuals. In this paper, using randomly Key-Changed Identification, we propose an eavesdropping-proof security protocol based on cryptographic one way hash functions for passive RFID tags. Compared with several existing methods, our proposed protocol shows some security improvements as well as gives a reasonable and compatible approach that could be easily employed in practical situations. Finally, an illustration is also given to show clearly the whole operating procedure of the proposed procedure.", "paper_title": "Hash-based RFID security protocol using randomly key-changed identification procedure", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800032"}
