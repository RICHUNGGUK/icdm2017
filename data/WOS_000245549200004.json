Computing power has increased since the first such systems were developed, and the general methodology has changed from the use of hand-encoded knowledge bases about simple domains to the use of text collections as the main knowledge source over more complex domains. Still, many research issues remain. The focus of this article is on the use of restricted domains for automated question answering. The article contains a historical perspective on question answering over restricted domains and an overview of the current methods and applications used in restricted domains. A main characteristic of question answering in restricted domains is the integration of domain-specific information that is either developed for question answering or that has been developed for other purposes. We explore the main methods developed to leverage this domain-specific information.", "paper_title": "Question answering in restricted domains: An overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000245549200004"}
