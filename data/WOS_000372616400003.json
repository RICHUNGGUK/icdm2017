We use this meta result to obtain simple, near-optimal mechanisms for a broad range of optimization problems such as combinatorial auctions, the maximum traveling salesman problem, and packing integer programs. In each case the resulting mechanism matches or beats the performance guarantees of known mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Algorithms as Mechanisms: The Price of Anarchy of Relax-and-Round", "paper_id": "WOS:000372616400003"}
