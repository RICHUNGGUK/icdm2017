In the present paper, we determine the combinatorial properties of these hyperplanes. Specifically, for each such hyperplane H we calculate the number of quads Q for which Q boolean AND H is a certain configuration of points in Q and the number of points x epsilon H for which x(perpendicular to) boolean AND H is a certain configuration of points in x(perpendicular to). By purely combinatorial techniques, we are also able to show that the set of hyperplanes of DW(5, q), q odd, which arise from its Grassmann-embedding can be divided into six subclasses if one takes only into account the above-mentioned combinatorial properties. A complete classification of all hyperplanes of DW(5, q), q odd, which arise from its Grassmann-embedding, i. e. the division of the above-mentioned six classes into isomorphism classes, will unlike in De Bruyn (to appear) most likely need a group-theoretical approach.", "paper_title": "The combinatorial properties of the hyperplanes of DW(5, q) arising from embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000253199200005"}
