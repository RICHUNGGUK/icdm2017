We show that this conjecture is true when - 1 is a correlation value. In other words, if C-1,C-k is the cyclic code of length 2(m) - 1 with two zeros alpha, alpha(k), where alpha is a primitive element of F-2m and gcd(k, 2(m) - 1) = 1, then its dual C-1,k(perpendicular to) can not have three weights when m is a power of 2.", "paper_title": "On cyclic codes of length 2(2r)-1 with two zeros whose dual codes have three weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000300321900001"}
