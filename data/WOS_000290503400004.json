In both works a distinct counterexample is given for which this inequality is false in general. Here, we present some classes of graphs with prescribed degrees, that satisfy M-1/n <= M-2/m. Namely every graph G whose degrees of vertices are in the interval [c, c+ inverted right perpendicular root c inverted left perpendicular] for some integer c, satisfies this inequality. In addition, we prove that for any Delta >= 5, there is an infinite family of connected graphs of maximum degree Delta, such that the inequality is false.", "paper_title": "Graph Classes (Dis)satisfying the Zagreb Indices Inequality", "paper_id": "WOS:000290503400004"}
