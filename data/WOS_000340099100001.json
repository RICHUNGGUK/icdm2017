In contrast to nearly all of the previously proposed approaches where ratio of the ASIP speed to layout area is used as a merit function to select the candidate custom instructions (CIs), we show that a merit function based on normalized cycle saving and area function can result in better CI selections in terms of the achievable speedup under a given area budget for both greedy and branch-and-bound techniques. The efficacy of the proposed approach is assessed by comparing the results of using the proposed and conventional merit functions for different benchmarks. The comparison points toward an average (maximum) speed enhancement of 3.65 % (27.4 %) for the proposed merit function compared to the conventional merit functions.", "paper_title": "A new merit function for custom instruction selection under an area budget constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000340099100001"}
