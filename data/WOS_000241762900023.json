We extend the SVR along the first direction in several ways: (i) We study the reconstruction of curved surfaces under perspective projection rather than orthographic projection. (ii) We illustrate that the horizontally flipped image of the reflective symmetric objects is equivalent to an image photographed from another position under the simplified perspective projection. So the traditional structure from motion techniques can be used to recover the 3D feature points on them. They can be used to create the planar model of the object and be used as position constraints to generate curved surfaces. (iii) New linear constraints, such as perspective projection, are exploited to the linearly constrained quadratic optimization to finding the smoothest surface. We demonstrate these advances in reconstructing real symmetric curved surfaces and objects.", "paper_title": "Reconstructing symmetric curved surfaces from a single image and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900023"}
