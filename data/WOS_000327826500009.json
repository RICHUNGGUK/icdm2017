Different from the classical NUM framework, our model considers the queueing stability. We propose a distributed iterative prices and link probabilities adaption algorithm by using dual decomposition techniques, which only requires limited message passing, but converges to the global optimum of the total network utility. Numerical results and simulation comparison validate our conclusion.", "paper_title": "Utility-optimal random access control in wireless multi-hop networks with queuing constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500009"}
