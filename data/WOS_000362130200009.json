In particular, for comparison, we consider some statistical tests to check temporal and distributional properties of the two models. We show that the fit between the two models is very good even for quite strong values of phase noise. The main result is that when the standard deviation of the discrete-time Wiener phase noise increment sigma(PN) is below a threshold of approximately (sigma) over bar (PN) similar or equal to 0.1 rad, the discrete-time Wiener model provides a good approximation to the actual symbol-spaced sampled filtered signal affected by continuous-time Wiener phase noise. We show that when sigma(PN) is below (sigma) over bar (PN) the ratio between the power of the signal and the power of the model mismatch is greater than 20 dB. Simulation results are also presented to compare bit error rates of the two models in case of QPSK and 16-QAM transmission and to compare the power spectral densities of their associated complex exponential phase noises. Our results suggest that the discrete-time Wiener phase noise model can be adopted for many real-world systems, where, according to experimental results available in the literature, sigma(PN) in the order of 0.1 rad is rarely found even when the nonlinearity of the optical channel is deeply stressed.
