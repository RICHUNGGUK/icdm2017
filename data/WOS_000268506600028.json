In this paper, we mainly explore the problem of precisely estimating observation likelihoods of particles in the joint feature-spatial space. For this purpose, a mixture Gaussian kernel function based similarity is presented to evaluate the discrepancy between the target region and the particle region. Such a similarity can be interpreted as the expectation of the spatial weighted feature distribution over the target region. To adapt outburst of object motion, we also present a method to appropriately adjust state transition model by utilizing the priors of motion speed and object size. In comparison with the standard particle filter tracker, our tracking algorithm shows the better performance on challenging video sequences.", "paper_title": "Measuring Particles in Joint Feature-Spatial Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506600028"}
