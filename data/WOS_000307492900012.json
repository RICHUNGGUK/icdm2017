We apply our technique to replicate (yet extend) existing results for hypercubes and k-ary n-cubes before going on to obtain new results as regards folded hypercubes, pancake graphs and augmented cubes. In particular, we show that the asymptotic conditional diagnosability of: folded hypercubes {FQ(n)} is 3n - 2, pancake graphs {P-n} is 3n - 7, and augmented cubes {AQ(n)} is 6n - 17. We demonstrate how our technique is independent of structural properties of the interconnection network G in question and essentially only dependent upon the minimal size of the neighbourhood of a path of length 2 in G, the number of neighbours any two distinct vertices of G have in common, and the minimal degree of any vertex in G.
