A number of software tools adapted for building domain ontologies of most wide spread natural languages are available, but accomplishing that for any given natural language presents a challenge. Here we propose a semi-automatic procedure to create ontologies for different natural languages. Our approach utilizes various software tools available on the Internet most notably DODDLE-OWL - a domain ontology development tool implemented for English and Japanese languages. By using this tool, Word Net, Prot g and XSLT transformations, we propose a general procedure to construct domain ontology for any natural language.", "paper_title": "Building ontologies for different natural languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000340077000011"}
