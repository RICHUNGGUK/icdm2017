The proposed model can update its parameters online according to the statistical properties of the training samples. Further, in order to improve the prediction precision, each sample is weighted with a dynamic penalty factor that considers the effect of each sample on the prediction model accuracy. Moreover, a customized procedure is introduced to handle large training sets. After having been convincingly evaluated on benchmark data, effectiveness and performance of our approach for plant-wide production indices is demonstrated using industrial data from an operating ore dressing plant over a range of scale in training data set size. The higher accuracy and shorter computation times than existing methods suggest that it may prove advantageous in actual application to dynamic production processes.", "paper_title": "Data-based adaptive online prediction model for plant-wide production indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000344000200008"}
