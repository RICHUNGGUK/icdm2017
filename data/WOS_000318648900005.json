The networked-induced delay, data packet dropouts, and signal quantization effects are simultaneously considered in the synchronization controller design. A new closed-loop coupled dynamic system is constructed, where both the interval time-varying delays and quantized parameters are taken into account. By using Kronecker product technique and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, a stability criterion is obtained for the closed-loop CDNs, which also guarantees that the CDNs are synchronized. Then, both the networked controller and the quantized parameters can be designed. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Quantized Control Design for Coupled Dynamic Networks with Communication Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000318648900005"}
