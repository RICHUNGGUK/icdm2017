In this paper, we propose and develop a framework to monitor on-bed range of motion exercises that allows physical therapists to evaluate patient adherence to set exercise programs. Using a dense pressure sensitive bedsheet, a sequence of pressure maps are produced and analyzed using manifold learning techniques. We compare two methods, Local Linear Embedding and Isomap, to reduce the dimensionality of the pressure map data. Once the image sequences are converted into a low dimensional manifold, the manifolds can be compared to expected prior data for the rehabilitation exercises. Furthermore, a measure to compare the similarity of manifolds is presented along with experimental results for five on-bed rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of this framework shows that exercise compliance can be tracked accurately according to prescribed treatment programs.", "paper_title": "Using Pressure Map Sequences for Recognition of On Bed Rehabilitation Exercises", "paper_id": "WOS:000332987400003"}
