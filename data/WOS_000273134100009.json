It is shown that within the random ensembles of such codes based on s-partite, s-uniform hypergraphs, where depends only on the code rate, there exist codes satisfying the Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) and the Costello lower bound on the minimum distance and the free distance, respectively. A connection between regular bipartite graphs and tailbiting (TB) codes is shown. Some examples of woven graph codes are presented. Among them, an example of a rate R-wg = 1/3 woven graph code with d(free) = 32 based on Heawood's bipartite graph, containing n = 7 constituent rate R-c = 2/3 convolutional codes with overall constraint lengths nu(c) = 5, is given.", "paper_title": "Woven Graph Codes: Asymptotic Performances and Examples", "paper_id": "WOS:000273134100009"}
