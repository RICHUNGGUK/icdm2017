Heat transfer to the reactor tubes is mostly due to radiation from the furnace refractory walls and the flue gas. A three-dimensional (3-D) simulation of the flow in an industrial scale steam cracking furnace is performed. The renormalization group (RNG) k - epsilon turbulence model is used. The combustion kinetics is modeled by a three-step reaction mechanism, while turbulence-chemistry interaction is taken into account through the Finite Rate/Eddy-Dissipation model. The Discrete Ordinates model (DOM), the P-1 and the Rosseland Radiation model are used for modeling of the radiative heat transfer. The results of using the different radiation models are compared mutually with adiabatic simulation results. The absorption coefficient of the gas mixture is calculated by means of a Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gas model (WSGGM). The effect is discussed of the use of different radiation models on the predicted wall, tube skin and flue gas temperature profiles and heat fluxes towards the reactor tubes, as well as on the predicted species concentration profiles and structure of the fumace flames under normal firing conditions.
