In the context of model-based clustering analysis with a common diagonal covariance matrix, which is especially suitable for \"high dimension, low sample size\" settings, we propose a penalized likelihood approach with an L-1 penalty function, automatically realizing variable selection via thresholding and delivering a sparse solution. We derive an EM algorithm to fit our proposed model, and propose a modified BIC as a model selection criterion to choose the number of components and the penalization parameter. A simulation study and an application to gene function prediction with gene expression profiles demonstrate the utility of our method.", "paper_title": "Penalized model-based clustering with application to variable selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000248351700009"}
