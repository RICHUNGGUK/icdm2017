It is found that for both benchmark test cases, small-scale turbulence fluctuations can be largely suppressed by high level of scheme dissipation, while the appearance of numerical errors in terms of high-frequency oscillations could destabilize the computation if the dissipation is reduced to a very low level. Numerical studies show that reducing the bandwidth dissipation to 70% of the conventional seventh-order upwind scheme can maximize the efficiency of the MP7-LD scheme in resolving small-scale turbulence fluctuations and, in the meantime preventing the accumulation of non-physical numerical errors. By using the optimized MP7-LD scheme, DNS of an impinging oblique shock-wave interacting with a spatially-developing turbulent boundary layer is conducted at an incoming free-stream Mach number of 2.25 and the shock angle of 33.2 degrees. Simulation results of mean velocity profiles, wall surface pressure, skin friction and Reynolds stresses are validated against available experimental data and other DNS predictions in both the undisturbed equilibrium boundary layer region and the interaction zone, and good agreements are achieved. The turbulence kinetic energy transport equation is also analyzed and the balance of the equation is well preserved in the interaction region. This study demonstrates the capability of the optimized MP7-LD scheme for DNS of complex flow problems of wall-bounded turbulent flow interacting with shock-waves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
