Mobile Grid Services, the extension of the original static Grid services, are characterized by the ability of moving from nodes to nodes during execution. By combining an existing mobile agent system (JADE) and a generic grid system toolkit (Globus), the Mobile Grid Services framework is constructed. The API consisting of the AgentManager class, Task Agent template and configurable Monitor Agent is used to provide both an easy and flexible environment for Mobile Grid Services development.", "paper_title": "MGS: An API for developing Mobile Grid Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318600023"}
