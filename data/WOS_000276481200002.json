We study the relationship between resonant properties of neurons and network oscillations in a computational model of neocortex. Our findings suggest that resonance is associated with subthreshold oscillation of neurons. This subthreshold behavior affects spike timing and plays a significant role in the generation of the network's extracellular currents reflected in the EEG. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
