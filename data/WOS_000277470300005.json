This method is demonstrated by applying it to the study of a human-computer interaction task. The task that has been selected is typical for users who interact with computers. One of the basic methods of SSAT called morphological analysis of activity has been used to examine and describe the computer-based task that was the object of study. Cognitive and behavioral actions and members of human algorithm have been utilized as main units of analysis. Suggested method provides analytical description of activity during task performance. It allows to determine the reliability of task performance and to find more reliable performance methods.", "paper_title": "A Method of Human Reliability Assessment Based on Systemic-Structural Activity Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000277470300005"}
