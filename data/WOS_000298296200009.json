The value of this extension, which we show to work well with simulations as well as real-life measurements, is its practical applicability. Thus, in the second part of this paper, we present its application in MulTFRC, a TCP-friendly rate control (TFRC)-based congestion control mechanism that is fair to a number of parallel TCP flows while maintaining a smoother sending rate than multiple real TFRC flows do. MulTFRC enables its users to prioritize transfers by controlling the fairness among them in an almost arbitrary fashion.", "paper_title": "An Extension of the TCP Steady-State Throughput Equation for Parallel Flows and Its Application in MulTFRC", "paper_id": "WOS:000298296200009"}
