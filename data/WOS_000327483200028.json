This grid must be sufficiently large and fine to describe the distribution functions at every space position in the computational domain. For 3-dimensional hypersonic flows, like in re-entry problems, this induces much too dense velocity grids that cannot be practically used, for memory storage requirements. In this article, we present an approach to generate automatically a locally refined velocity grid adapted to a given simulation. This grid contains much less points than a standard Cartesian grid and allows us to make realistic 3-dimensional simulations at a reduced cost, with a comparable accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
