In this paper, we propose a new widely linear recursive C-ELM algorithm for nonlinear channel equalizer. The proposed algorithm improves its performance especially in case of real valued modulation such as BPSK and PAM. The computer simulation results demonstrate the improvement in performance achievable with the proposed equalization algorithm.", "paper_title": "Recursive complex extreme learning machine with widely linear processing for nonlinear channel equalizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300019"}
