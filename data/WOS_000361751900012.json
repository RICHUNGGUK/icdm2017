We propose a solution based on the knowledge of the coordinates of 3-D straight lines (expressed in the world coordinate frame) and their corresponding image pixels. Previous approaches used the knowledge of the coordinates of 3-D points (zero dimensional elements) and their corresponding images (zero dimensional elements). In this paper, pixels belonging to the image of 3-D lines are used. There is no need to establish correspondences between pixels and 3-D points. Correspondences are established between 3-D lines and their images. There is no need to identify individual pixels. The use of correspondences between pixels (that belong to the images of the 3-D lines) and 3-D lines facilitates the correspondence problem when compared to the use of world and image points. This is one of the contributions of this paper. The approach is both evaluated and validated using synthetic data and also real images.", "paper_title": "Pose Estimation for General Cameras Using Lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751900012"}
