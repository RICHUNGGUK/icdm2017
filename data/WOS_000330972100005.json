We determine both the temporal period of the interaction and also spatially localize the relevant people. We make the following four contributions: (i) head detection with implicit coarse pose information (front, profile, back); (ii) continuous head pose estimation in unconstrained scenarios (TV video) using Gaussian process regression; (iii) propose and evaluate several methods for assessing whether and when pairs of people are looking at each other in a video shot; and (iv) introduce new ground truth annotation for this task, extending the TV human interactions dataset (Patron-Perez et al. 2010) The performance of the methods is evaluated on this dataset, which consists of 300 video clips extracted from TV shows. Despite the variety and difficulty of this video material, our best method obtains an average precision of 87.6 % in a fully automatic manner.", "paper_title": "Detecting People Looking at Each Other in Videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000330972100005"}
