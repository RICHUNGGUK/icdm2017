The exact unconditional test requires an ordering statistic, which is usually the z-pooled statistic, to be defined. The paper gives the definition of 10 new ordering statistics with a similar computational time, and compares the number of points which each introduces into the critical region obtained to error alpha = 5%. The article reaches the conclusion that the most generally powerful statistics are: the z-pooled one with a small continuity correction (c = 1/N if n(1) not equal n(2) or c = 2/N if n(1) = n(2), where N = {n(1)+1} {n(2) +1} and n(i) are the sample sizes) and those z-pooled with Yates' continuity correction (c = {n(1) +n(2)}/{2n(1)n(2)}). In this paper the author also showed that Barnard's two classic convexity conditions are redundant, because when one of them is verified the other is also verified.
