Metastable hydrogen hydrate structures are generated using the LAMMPS software. Different binding energies and radial distribution functions provide important insights into the behavior of the various types of hydrogen and oxygen atoms present in the system. Clathrate hydrate cages become more stable in the presence of guest molecules like hydrogen.", "paper_title": "A molecular dynamics study on sI hydrogen hydrate", "paper_id": "WOS:000320954600012"}
