This paper investigates a nonlinear malware propagation model in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based on SIR epidemic model. Sufficient conditions for the local stability of the positive equilibrium point and the existence of Hopf bifurcation are obtained by analyzing the associated characteristic equation. Moreover, formulas for determining the properties of the bifurcating periodic oscillations are derived by applying the normal form method and center manifold theorem. Furthermore, with the help of the Maximum Principle of Pontryagin, we design an optimal control strategy for the previous model to extend the region of stability and reduce the density of infected nodes in WSNs. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed model. Numerical evidence shows that the dynamic characteristics of malware propagation in WSNs are closely related to the immune period of a recovered node and the rate constant for nodes becoming susceptible again after recovered. Besides, we obtain that the optimal control strategy effectively improves the performance of the networks. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
