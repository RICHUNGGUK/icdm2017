In previous work, the authors showed that GPUs may be integrated into real-time systems by treating GPUs as shared resources, allocated to real-time tasks through mutual exclusion locking protocols. In this paper, an asymptotically optimal k-exclusion locking protocol is presented for globally-scheduled job-level static-priority (JLSP) systems. This protocol may be used to manage a pool of resources, such as GPUs, in such systems.", "paper_title": "An optimal k-exclusion real-time locking protocol motivated by multi-GPU systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314060100002"}
