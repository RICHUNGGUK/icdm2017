These matrices are studied for small orders and weights in both the real and complex setting. Our results make use of and examine the sharpness of a very important existing upper bound for the number of mutually unbiased weighing matrices.", "paper_title": "Mutually unbiased weighing matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000356360000006"}
