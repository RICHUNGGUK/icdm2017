They are responsible for the selection and allocation of Grid resources to current and future applications. Thus, they are important building blocks for making Grids available to user communities. In this paper we briefly analyze the requirements of Grid resource management and provide a classification of schedulers. Then, we define an extensible formal model for Grid scheduling activities, and characterize the general Grid scheduling problem. Finally, we provide a reference architecture for the support of our model and discuss different aspects of architectural implementations.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Supporting Grid Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000272084300005"}
