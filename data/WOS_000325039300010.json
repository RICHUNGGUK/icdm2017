Design/methodology/approach - Rough set and fuzzy set are two different but complementary theories for expressing uncertainty information, and based on the combination of these two uncertainty theories of expressing and handling uncertainty information, the rough fuzzy set model and uncertainty measure based on general relation are discussed. Findings - This paper reveals the intrinsic of the uncertainty for rough fuzzy set based on general relation and presents a new measure method by introducing the Shannon entropy to generalized approximation space. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the discussion on the research of rough set and fuzzy set. The conclusions are useful in information processing with uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty measure for general relation-based rough fuzzy set", "paper_id": "WOS:000325039300010"}
