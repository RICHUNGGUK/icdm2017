Clustering algorithms have been extensively applied to this problem. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective CQ method based on divisive hierarchical clustering. Our method utilizes the commonly used binary splitting strategy along with several carefully selected heuristics that ensure a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency. We also propose a slightly computationally expensive variant of this method that employs local optimization using the Lloyd-Max algorithm. Experiments on a diverse set of publicly available images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some of the most popular quantizers in the literature.", "paper_title": "An effective real-time color quantization method based on divisive hierarchical clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000354715300010"}
