Gaud.]"], "paper_abstract": "Two varieties of Bechmeria nivea (L.) Gaud. (Ramie), namely, triploid Tri-2 and diploid Xiangzhu-3, were potted with soils from Guangdong for fifteen weeks and treated with 10 mmol.kg-1 EDTA or EGTA before harvest at seventeenth week. Lead, Zn and Cd in plant and soil materials were analyzed and their potential ecological risk in soils was simultaneously evaluated. These three metals in soils was found to be above 14.4, 3.0 and 29.9 times higher than the national (China) background value, 10.9, 6.19 and 96.7 times higher than the local (Guangdong) background value and 1.25, 1.20 and 9.67 times higher than the maximum permissible concentration for soils, respectively. An ecological risk analysis of metals using Hakanson's method indicated an extremely high contamination and a significantly high potential ecological risk by these three metals in soils. The both ramie varieties contained respective concentration exceeding the concentration of < 10, < 80 and < 0.27 mg.kg-1 respectively for Pb, Zn and Cd in normal plants, suggesting they were multi-metal tolerant. Tri-2 generally contained higher Pb, Zn and Cd than Xiangzhu-3. Treatment with EDTA or EGTA applied at 10 mmol.kg-1 generally promoted Pb or Cd concentration in both plants while the uptake of Zn was depressed. The ramie variety of Tri-2 and Xiangzhu-3 could extract 0.161 and 0.147 t.ha-1 of Cd, respectively, equalling to the 0.17 t Cd ha-1 by Cd-hyperaccumulating species Viola baoshanensis. Therefore, two ramie varieties in this study had a higher extracting potential for removal of Cd from contaminated soils.", "paper_title": "PLANT-BASED REMEDIATION OF HEAVY-METAL-CONTAMINATED ROADSIDE SOILS OF GUANGDONG, CHINA", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468700024"}
