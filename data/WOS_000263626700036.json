Some approaches exist that try to correct this instability. However, their benefits can, at present, be appreciated only qualitatively. A similarity measure between two classification trees is introduced that can measure their closeness. Its usefulness is illustrated with synthetic data on the impact of radioactivity deposit through the environment. In this context, a modified node level stabilizing technique, referred to as the NLS-REP method, is introduced and shown to be more stable than the classical CART method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
