However, the factors important for RFID's adoption in supply chains have not been well understood. Many organizations are reluctant to participate in supply-chain level RFID projects because of this lack of understanding. Drawing on innovation diffusion theory and technology-organization-environment framework, we developed a conceptual model for RFID adoption in supply chains. Survey data were collected worldwide and included different players in supply chains, such as manufacturers, transporters, wholesalers, and retailers. Our analysis based on logistic regression demonstrated that technology complexity, technology maturity, top management support, trading partner power, and trading partner readiness were significant predictors for RFID adoption in supply chain activities. This study is the first empirical study to test and validate technology maturity as an important factor for technology adoption. We conclude the article by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our research findings.", "paper_title": "UNDERSTANDING AND PREDICTING RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID) ADOPTION IN SUPPLY CHAINS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299775900006"}
