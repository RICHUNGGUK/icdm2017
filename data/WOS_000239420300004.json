One important goal in video analysis is to group the shots into temporal scenes, such that all the shots in a single scene are related to the same subject, which could be a particular physical setting, an ongoing action or a theme. In this paper, we present a general framework for temporal scene segmentation in various video domains. The proposed method is formulated in a statistical fashion and uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to determine the boundaries between video scenes. In this approach, a set of arbitrary scene boundaries are initialized at random locations and are automatically updated using two types of updates: diffusion and jumps. Diffusion is the process of updating the boundaries between adjacent scenes. Jumps consist of two reversible operations: the merging of two scenes and the splitting of an existing scene. The posterior probability of the target distribution of the number of scenes and their corresponding boundary locations is computed based on the model priors and the data likelihood. The updates of the model parameters are controlled by the hypothesis ratio test in the MCMC process, and the samples are collected to generate the final scene boundaries. The major advantage of the proposed framework is two-fold: 1) it is able to find the weak boundaries as well as the strong boundaries, i.e., it does not rely on the fixed threshold; 2) it can be applied to different video domains. We have tested the proposed method on two video domains: home videos and feature films, and accurate results have been obtained.", "paper_title": "Video scene segmentation using Markov chain Monte Carlo", "paper_id": "WOS:000239420300004"}
