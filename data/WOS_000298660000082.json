Due to the convolution properties of stable-Paretian laws, the unconditional distribution of the observations is also stable-Paretian, and therefore its characteristic function is expressed as a simple exponential-type function incorporating the parameters. Exploiting this feature of the stochastic volatility model considered, methods of estimation are proposed employing the empirical characteristic function. The proposed procedures are applied with simulated data but also with some real data from the financial markets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
