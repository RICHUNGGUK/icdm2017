We obtain a deterministic algorithm that can be seen as a sparse version of an algorithm of Lecerf, with a polynomial complexity in the volume of the Newton polytope. We adopt a geometrical point of view, the main tool being derived from some algebraic osculation criterion in toric varieties. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
