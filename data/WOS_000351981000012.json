The fracture model considers both elastic and inelastic (decomposed to fracture and plastic) displacements. The norm of the effective inelastic displacement is used to control the fracture behaviour. Three numerical examples, including Mode-I, Mode-II and Mixed-mode tests, are conducted to verify the model and its implementation in UDEC. The model is subsequently applied to simulate uniaxial compression and Brazilian disc tests on soft rocks and the results are compared with experimental results. The results indicate that the cohesive fracture model is capable of realistically simulating the combined tensile, shear and mixed-mode failure behaviour applicable to geomaterials.
