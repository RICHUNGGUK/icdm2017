Firstly, a criterion of exponential stability with H-infinity performance for switched nonlinear systems with time delay is proposed. Then, a design methodology of the robust 1100 reliable control for switched nonlinear systems with time delay and parameter uncertainties is presented. The proposed state feedback controller, which can guarantee exponential stability of the resulting closed-loop system., can be obtained using a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "ROBUST H-infinity RELIABLE CONTROL FOR A CLASS OF SWITCHED NONLINEAR SYSTEMS WITH TIME DELAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400001"}
