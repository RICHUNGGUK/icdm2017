Let G be a graph of n vertices. The two-dimensional bandwidth B(2)(G) of G is the minimum value of the maximum distance between adjacent vertices when G is embedded into an n x n grid in the plane. As a discrete optimization problem, determining B(2)(G) is NP-hard in general. However, exact results for this parameter can be derived for some special classes of graphs. This paper studies the \"square-root rule\" of the two-dimensional bandwidth, which is useful in evaluating B(2)(G) for some typical graphs.", "paper_title": "SQUARE-ROOT RULE OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL BANDWIDTH PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000298824000004"}
