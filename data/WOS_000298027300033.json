Some operational laws, score function and accuracy function of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are introduced at first. Then a new aggregation operator called induced generalized intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (IG-IFOWA) operator is proposed, which extend the induced generalized ordered weighted averaging (IGOWA) operator introduced by Merigo and Gil-Lafuente [Merigo, J. M., & Gil-Lafuente, A. M. (2009). The induced generalized OWA operator. Information Sciences, 179, 729-741] to accommodate the environment in which the given arguments are intuitionistic fuzzy sets that are characterized by a membership function and a non-membership function. Some desirable properties of the IG-IFOWA operator are studied, such as commutativity, idempotency, monotonicity and boundary. And then, an approach based on the IG-IFOWA and IFVVA (intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging) operators is developed to solve MAGDM problems with intuitionistic fuzzy information. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate the developed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
