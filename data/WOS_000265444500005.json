There are proposed methods of parallelizing the criterion function calculations for a single solution and a group of concentrated solutions (local neighborhood) dedicated to being used in metaheuristic approaches. Also a parallel scatter-search metaheuristic is proposed as a multiple-thread approach. Computational experiments are done for the flow shop, the classic NP-hard problem of the combinatorial optimization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
