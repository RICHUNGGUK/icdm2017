This paper proposes a group-based VQ codebook generation method (GBVQCG method) to build a codebook It classified the image blocks of an image into groups and determines the number of desired codewords which will be extracted from the image blocks in each group according to the standard deviation and the number of image blocks in the group. The experimental results show that the GBVQCG method generally performs much better in. terms of the running, time and the quality of the decompressed image, compared with the LBG compression method", "paper_title": "A VQ COMPRESSION METHOD BASED ON THE VARIATIONS OF THE IMAGE BLOCK GROUPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400019"}
