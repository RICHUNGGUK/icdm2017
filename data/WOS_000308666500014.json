This problem aims to choose an optimal combination of components and redundancy levels for a system with a series-parallel configuration that maximizes the overall system reliability. PSO is a population-based meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the social behavior of the biological swarms that is designed for continuous decision spaces. As a local search engine (LSE), the proposed APSO employs the Metropolis-Hastings strategy, the key idea behind the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. In APSO, the best position among all particles in each iteration is dynamically improved using the inner loop of the SA (i.e., equilibrium loop) while the temperature is updated in the main loop of the PSO algorithm. The well-known benchmarks are used to verify the performance of the proposed APSO. Even though APSO fails to outperform the best solution obtained in the literature, the contribution of this paper is comprised of the implementation of APSO as a hybrid meta-heuristic as well as the effect of Metropolis-Hastings strategy on the performance of the classical PSO.
