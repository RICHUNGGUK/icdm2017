To realize DSA, new technologies that enable fast discovery of the unused spectrum along with efficient spectrum management must be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel scanning algorithm and access etiquette to provide secondary devices differentiated spectrum access in a fully distributed manner. The proposed solution does not use any common control channel or require any a prior knowledge of primary devices' usage pattern. More importantly, hardware limitation such as imperfect sensing or lack of strict synchronization between secondary devices are taken into account in our design. A mathematical model and an Opnet-based implementation are also developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution in DSA networks.", "paper_title": "Proportional Sharing in Distributed Dynamic Spectrum Access-Based Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345990600012"}
