This paper presents an approach of back propagation neural network with rough set (RSBP) for complicated STLF with dynamic and non-linear factors to develop the accuracy of predictions. Through attribute reduction based on variable precision with rough set, the influence of noise data and weak interdependency data to BP is avoided so the time taken for training is decreased. Using load time series from a practical power system, we tested the performance of RSBP by comparing its predictions with that of BP network. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
