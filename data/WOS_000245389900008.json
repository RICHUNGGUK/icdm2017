In order to reduce the calculation time of the interval and fuzzy analyses, these non-probabilistic methods are combined with the component mode synthesis technique. Special attention is paid to the effect of uncertainties on the mathematical description of this substructuring technique. All concepts are illustrated through a benchmark structure example.
