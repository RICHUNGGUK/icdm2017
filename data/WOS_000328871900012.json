In order to increase energy efficiency, chip manufacturers are developing heterogeneous CMP chips. We present analytical models based on an energy consumption metric to analyze the different performance gains and energy consumption of various architectural design choices for hybrid CPU-GPU chips. We also analyzed the power consumption implications of different processing modes and various chip configurations. The analysis shows clearly that greater parallelism is the most important factor affecting energy saving. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
