Two models of the system are presented, a reagent-centric view and a pathway-centric view. The models capture functionality at the level,of subpathway, rather than at a molecular level. Each model affords a different perspective of the pathway and analysis. We demonstrate the two models to be formally equivalent using the timing-aware bisimulation defined over PEPA models and discuss the biological significance.", "paper_title": "Modelling the influence of RKIP on the ERK signalling pathway using the Stochastic process algebra PEPA", "paper_id": "WOS:000243595000001"}
