Our scenario is an important special case of some general probabilistic logic problems that are known to be intractable. We show that despite the limitations our problems are also intractable, namely, we show that checking whether the maximal consistent frequency of a query is larger than a given threshold is NP-complete and that evaluating the Maximum Entropy estimate of a query is PP-hard. We also prove that checking consistency is NP-complete. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
