The large number of transistors available today enables the development of chip multiprocessors that include many cores on one die communicating through an on-chip interconnect. As the number of cores increases, scalable communication platforms, such as networks-on-chip (NoCs), have become more popular. However, as the sole communication medium, these interconnects are a single point of failure so that any permanent fault in the NoC can cause the entire system to fail. Compounding the problem, transistors have become increasingly susceptible to wear-out related failures as their critical dimensions shrink. As a result, the on-chip network has become a critically exposed unit that must be protected. To this end, we present Vicis, a fault-tolerant architecture and companion routing protocol that is robust to a large number of permanent failures, allowing communication to continue in the face of permanent transistor failures. Vicis makes use of a two-level approach. First, it attempts to work around errors within a router by leveraging reconfigurable architectural components. Second, when faults within a router disable a link's connectivity, or even an entire router, Vicis reroutes around the faulty node or link with a novel, distributed routing algorithm for meshes and tori. Tolerating permanent faults in both the router components and the reliability hardware itself, Vicis enables graceful performance degradation of networks-on-chip.", "paper_title": "A Reliable Routing Architecture and Algorithm for NoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000303205900007"}
