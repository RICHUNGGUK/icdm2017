We first prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point under mild conditions, assuming neither differentiability nor strict monotonicity for the activation function. Then, by employing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to establish sufficient conditions for the RNNs to be globally exponentially stable. Therefore, the global exponential stability of the delayed RNNs can be easily checked by utilizing the numerically efficient Matlab LMI toolbox, and no tuning of parameters is required. A simulation example is exploited to show the usefulness of the derived LMI-based stability conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
