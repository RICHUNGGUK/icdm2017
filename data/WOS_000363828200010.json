In addition to the LES subgrid scale model sensitivity study, two additional simulations were carried out in order to understand the roles of the intake and the in-cylinder residual turbulence to the flow statistics. Altogether 12 cycles were computed for each simulation on a grid with 5 million cells and requiring over a month of wall-clock time per simulation on a supercomputer. Analysis of velocity statistics revealed that the results were not very sensitive to the LES model type. However, the residual turbulence was noted to have a clear impact on the velocity statistics. In particular, the simulations revealed that removing the residual turbulence from the intake region at the top-dead-centre has a clear impact on the overall velocity statistics. In many cases the cycle-to-cycle variation (CCV) increased. In a respective numerical test, where only the in-cylinder turbulence was removed at top-dead-centre, weaker sensitivity was observed. In addition, the CCV relative to the mean velocity was in some cases as high as 30% even in such a non-reactive case. The present study complements previous studies on the same set-up by investigating the sensitivity of three LES models on flow statistics, quantifying CCV using three different LES approaches in the standard set-up, and assessing the role of residual turbulence on the flow statistics via modified flow cases.
