Streets are characterized by their traffic direction, number of lanes, etc. Specialized behavior is included to model traffic lights, trucks, traffic signs, railways, etc. The models ire formally specified as DEVS and Cell-DEVS models, avoiding a high number of errors in the developed application. As the modelers can focus in the problem to solve, development times for the simulators can be highly reduced. We present the Formal definitions for the language, and its translation into discrete-event models.", "paper_title": "Defining a traffic modeling language using cellular discrete-event abstractions", "paper_id": "WOS:000252145200002"}
