Small area estimation is an important area in survey sampling because of the growing demand for better statistical inference for small areas in public or private surveys. In small area estimation problems the focus is on how to borrow strength across areas in order to develop a reliable estimator and which makes use of available auxiliary information. Some traditional methods for small area problems such as empirical best linear unbiased prediction borrow strength through linear models that provide links to related areas, which may not be appropriate for some survey data. In this article, we propose a stepwise Bayes approach which borrows strength through an objective posterior distribution. This approach results in a generalized constrained Dirichlet posterior estimator when auxiliary information is available for small areas. The objective posterior distribution is based only on the assumption of exchangeability across related areas and does not make any explicit model assumptions. The form of our posterior distribution allows us to assign a weight to each member of the sample. These weights can then be used in a straight forward fashion to make inferences about the small area means. Theoretically, the stepwise Bayes character of the posterior allows one to prove the admissibility of the point estimators suggesting that inferential procedures based on this approach will tend to have good frequentist properties. Numerically, we demonstrate in simulations that the proposed stepwise Bayes approach can have substantial strengths compared to traditional methods.", "paper_title": "An objective stepwise Bayes approach to small area estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000349087400011"}
