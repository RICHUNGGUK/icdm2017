The approach is novel in the sense that it applies knowledge of motion planning and optimization techniques used in robotics. As an example, we consider the case of operating a forestry crane. To that end, we use motion data that has been recorded during standard operation with the help of sensors and a data acquisition unit. The data backs up the notion that operators work by performing repeatable patterns observed in the trajectories of the manipulator's joints. We show how this nominal behavior is computed, and consequently, this allows us to present the following: 1) an analytical procedure to analyze motions, 2) how to represent the \"performance\" of the operator in a 2-D plot, 3) an example of how to use this information to suggest customized control settings, and 4) some complementary ideas needed for improving efficiency through automation.", "paper_title": "Path-Constrained Motion Analysis: An Algorithm to Understand Human Performance on Hydraulic Manipulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000351468500004"}
