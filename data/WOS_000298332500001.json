TS helps users manage the vast amount of information available, by condensing documents' content and extracting the most relevant facts or topics included in them. The rapid development of emerging technologies poses new challenges to this research field, which still need to be solved. Therefore, it is essential to analyse its progress over the years, and provide an overview of the past, present and future directions, highlighting the main advances achieved and outlining remaining limitations. With this purpose, several important aspects are addressed within the scope of this survey. On the one hand, the paper aims at giving a general perspective on the state-ofthe- art, describing the main concepts, as well as different summarisation approaches, and relevant international forums. Furthermore, it is important to stress upon the fact that the birth of new requirements and scenarios has led to new types of summaries with specific purposes (e. g. sentiment-based summaries), and novel domains within which TS has proven to be also suitable for (e. g. blogs). In addition, TS is successfully combined with a number of intelligent systems based on HLT (e. g. information retrieval, question answering, and text classification). On the other hand, a deep study of the evaluation of summaries is also conducted in this paper, where the existing methodologies and systems are explained, as well as new research that has emerged concerning the automatic evaluation of summaries' quality. Finally, some thoughts about TS in general and its future will encourage the reader to think of novel approaches, applications and lines to conduct research in the next years. The analysis of these issues allows the reader to have a wide and useful background on the main important aspects of this research field.", "paper_title": "Text summarisation in progress: a literature review", "paper_id": "WOS:000298332500001"}
