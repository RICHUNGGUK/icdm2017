Thus a novel clustering approach, namely the genetic K-means algorithm, is proposed to detect fMRI activation. It is more likely to find a global optimal solution to the K-means clustering, and is independent of the initial assignments of the cluster centroids. The experimental results show that the proposed method recognizes fMRI activation regions with higher accuracy than ordinary K-means clustering.", "paper_title": "Unifying genetic algorithm and clustering method for recognizing activated fMRI time series", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100025"}
