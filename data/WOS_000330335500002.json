They are, however, typically confined to simple motion tasks owing to their control complexity. Leveraging on a sliding mode based control strategy, the authors have shown in previous works that good tracking and positioning results can be achieved using off-the-shelf servopneumatics. This paper extends the previously mentioned works by applying a modified version of the control law to a new experimental setup comprising different valves and actuators and a better resolution encoder. The modification of the control law involves the use of a new boundary layer thickness variation law, different from the one previously used. Experimental results show that the modified control law leads to very accurate motion control. The positioning error from a control perspective is only limited by the encoder resolution, 1 pm, in any position of the piston stroke and when carrying loads of 3 kg and 8 kg, without any controller retuning. Good results in the micrometer range are also obtained when tracking sinusoidal and triangular references. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
