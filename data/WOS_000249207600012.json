It is based on an adaptive substitutive blind procedure in the spatial domain. We use angle features to remove all restrictions of fixed embedding size in each vertex to provide larger embedding capacity and to minimize the distortion by minimum distortion distance estimation. This method exploits the correlation between neighboring polygons with respect to the human visual system to estimate the degree of smoothness or roughness properties. If the vertex is located on a rough surface, then it may tolerate larger position changes by embedding more messages than those on smooth surfaces. Our method provides an easy way to produce a more imperceptible result. In addition, a simple contagious diffusion technique is devoted to improving performance for polygonal meshes traversal. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is adaptive, simple, efficient, general, and secure. This technique has high capacity and low distortion, and it is robust against affine transformations. Our technique provides an adaptive method and has proven feasible in steganography.", "paper_title": "An adaptive steganographic algorithm for 3D polygonal meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000249207600012"}
