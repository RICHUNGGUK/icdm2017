This study proposes an RFID-enabled real-time advanced production planning and scheduling shell (RAPShell, in short) to coordinate different decision makers across production processes. RAPShell has several key innovations. First, it uses RFID technology for enhancing information sharing, which provides the basis for coordinating decisions and operations of different parties involved in production planning, scheduling, execution and control. Second, it adopts Software as a Service (SaaS) model and a standard service-oriented architecture (SOA) with key modules, adaptive optimisation models, solution algorithms as well as scheduling rules developed and deployed as web services. Finally, extensible makeup language (XML)-based data models are utilised to achieve easy-to-deploy and simple-to-use system customisation and implementation. A case study demonstrates how RAPShell is customised and deployed in a small- and medium-sized company to facilitate the operations of typical production decision makers and operators. Benefits from qualitative and quantitative are discussed from the case study to show RAPShell's practical effectiveness and efficiency on production decision making.", "paper_title": "RFID-enabled real-time advanced planning and scheduling shell for production decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000322616400004"}
