In this paper, crowd sensing based burst computation algorithm of a web event is developed in order to let the people know a web event clearly and help the social group or government process the events effectively. Different temporal features of web events are developed to provide the basics for the proposed computation algorithm. The burst power is presented to integrate the above temporal features of an event. Empirical experiments on real datasets including Google Zeitgeist and Google Trends show that the number of web pages and the average clustering coefficient can be used to detect events. The evaluations on real dataset show that the proposed function integrating the number of web pages and the average clustering coefficient can be used for event detection efficiently and correctly.", "paper_title": "Crowd Sensing Based Burst Computing of Events Using Social Media", "paper_id": "WOS:000356685200001"}
