However, it suffers from phase ambiguity problem because of the periodicity of phase, which makes it hard to determine the actual distance difference only from a single phase measurement. To solve the problem, RIPS makes multiple measurements at different frequencies so as to determine the distance difference from multiple phases. However, this is a computationally intensive searching process and not suitable for energy-constrained wireless sensor nodes. In this paper, we introduce the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) to RIPS to solve the phase ambiguity problem. Meanwhile, we utilize some properties of the coefficients in the CRT algorithm to avoid the over-sensitivity of the traditional CRT, which increases the robustness of the algorithm. We apply this robust CRT algorithm to the ranging process which calculates the distance difference directly from a closed-form equation and therefore reduces the response time and the energy consumption of the ranging procedure.", "paper_title": "An efficient ranging method based on Chinese remainder theorem for RIPS measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000278159000013"}
