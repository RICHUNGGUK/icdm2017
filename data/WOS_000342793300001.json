After reformulating the original boundary value problem by introducing new additional control variables, the unknown traces of the solution at internal subdomain interfaces; the latter are determined by requiring that the (a priori) independent solutions in each subdomain undergo the minimization of a suitable cost functional.We provide an abstract formulation for coupled heterogeneous problems and a general theorem of well-posedness for the associated ICDD problem. Then, we illustrate and validate an efficient algorithm based on the solution of the Schur-complement system restricted solely to the interface control variables by considering two kinds of heterogeneous boundary value problems: the coupling between pure advection and advection-diffusion equations and the coupling between Stokes and Darcy equations. In the latter case, we also compare the ICDD method with a classical approach based on the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman conditions.
