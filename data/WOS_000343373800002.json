Let F/k be function field over a field k, and let k(0) be the full constant field of F/k. By using lattices over subrings of F, we can express the genus g of F in terms of [k(0) : k] and the indices of certain orders of the finite and infinite maximal orders of F. If k is a finite field, the Montes algorithm computes the latter indices as a by-product. This leads us to a fast computation of the genus of global function fields. Our algorithm does not require the computation of any basis, neither of finite nor infinite maximal order. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
