The examined factors are among those determinants which comprise different aspects of knowledge sharing behaviour in an organisational context. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the widely accepted theory of planned behaviour (TPB), we tried to develop a comprehensive model. The model covered different individual and organisational factors. Responses to a total of 502 questionnaires were considered. Structural equation modelling was then used to test the research model and hypotheses. Findings - This research evaluated the influence of a series of potential factors on knowledge sharing behaviour. While perceived self-efficacy and anticipated reciprocal relationships had a positive impact on attitude toward knowledge sharing, expected extrinsic rewards did not show a significant relationship with this variable. Organisational climate had a positive impact on subjective norms about knowledge sharing. In addition, the level of information and communication technology usage reflected a positive effect on knowledge sharing behaviour. Finally, significant relationships were found between the TPB elements. Originality/value - This paper has tried to provide a comprehensive understanding about knowledge sharing facilitators in the oil industry. Since there was a lack of such research in an Iranian context, this paper can provide theoretical basis for future researches as well as practical implications for managers and practitioners.", "paper_title": "Knowledge sharing behaviour and its predictors", "paper_id": "WOS:000278279300016"}
