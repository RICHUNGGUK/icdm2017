Dynamic FTs extend FTs with support for expressing dynamic dependencies among components. The standard analysis vehicle for DFTs is state-based, and treats the model as a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). This is not always possible, as we will explain, since some DFTs allow multiple interpretations. This paper introduces a rigorous semantic interpretation of DFTs. The semantics is defined in such a way that the semantics of a composite DFT arises in a transparent manner from the semantics of its components. This not only eases the understanding of how the FT building blocks interact. It is also a key to alleviate the state explosion problem. By lifting a classical aggregation strategy to our setting, we can exploit the DFT structure to build the smallest possible Markov chain representation of the system. The semantics-as well as the aggregation and analysis engine is implemented in a tool, called CORAL. We show by a number of realistic and complex systems that this methodology achieves drastic reductions in the state space.", "paper_title": "A Rigorous, Compositional, and Extensible Framework for Dynamic Fault Tree Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000277888200002"}
