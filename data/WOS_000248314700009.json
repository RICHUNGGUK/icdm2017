Martini is designed to provide high-bandwidth and low-latency communication with a small overhead. To obtain high-performance communication, protected user-level zero-copy remote direct memory access (RDMA) communication functions are completely implemented by a hardwired logic. Also, to reduce the communication latency efficiently, we have proposed programmed I/O (PIO)-based communication mechanisms called \" On the fly (OTF)\" and have implemented them on Martini. The evaluation results show that Martini connected to a 64-bit/66-MHz peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus achieves a 470-Mbyte maximum bidirectional bandwidth and a 1.74-mu sec minimum latency on host-to-host memory copying.", "paper_title": "Martini: a network interface controller chip for high-performance computing with distributed PCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000248314700009"}
