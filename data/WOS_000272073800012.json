The ensemble is then sparsified using quadratic regression with l(1) regularization such that the final classifier generalizes reliably to data of subjects not included in the ensemble Our offline results indicate that BCI-naive users Could start real-time BCI use Without any prior calibration at only very limited loss of performance (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Subject-independent mental state classification in single trials", "paper_id": "WOS:000272073800012"}
