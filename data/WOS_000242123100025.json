In order to get the connection information easily, we use QR-Code to provide connection information such as IP address, position information and password to users. When users are connected to the large screen, the system will provide a part of the large screen to a user as his personal space at right in front of him, so that the user can display the information in his PDA and manage the information on the large screen. The user can exchange the data with the large screen and the other users through the personal space on the large screen. We keep developing the prototype system according to this approach.", "paper_title": "Interaction between small size device and large screen in public space", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100025"}
