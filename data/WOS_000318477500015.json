In particular, vehicle verification is especially challenging on account of the heterogeneity of vehicles in color, size, pose, etc. Imagebased vehicle verification is usually addressed as a supervised classification problem. Specifically, descriptors using Gabor filters have been reported to show good performance in this task. However, Gabor functions have a number of drawbacks relating to their frequency response. The main contribution of this paper is the proposal and evaluation of a new descriptor based on the alternative family of log-Gabor functions for vehicle verification, as opposed to existing Gabor filter-based descriptors. These filters are theoretically superior to Gabor filters as they can better represent the frequency properties of natural images. As a second contribution, and in contrast to existing approaches, which transfer the standard configuration of filters used for other applications to the vehicle classification task, an in-depth analysis of the required filter configuration by both Gabor and log-Gabor descriptors for this particular application is performed for fair comparison. The extensive experiments conducted in this paper confirm that the proposed log-Gabor descriptor significantly outperforms the standard Gabor filter for image-based vehicle verification.", "paper_title": "Log-Gabor Filters for Image-Based Vehicle Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000318477500015"}
