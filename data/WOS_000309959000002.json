Bodyprints are obtained using calibrated depth-colour cameras such as kinect. The author's results on a database of 40 people show that bodyprints are very robust to changes of pose, point of view and illumination. Potential applications include tracking people with networks of non-overlapping cameras.", "paper_title": "Who is who at different cameras: people re-identification using depth cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000309959000002"}
