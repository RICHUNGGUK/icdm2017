Our semantic-map is organized by using SIFT feature-based object representation. In addition to semantic map, a vision-based relative localization is employed as a process model of extended Kalman filters, where optical flows and Levenberg-Marquardt least square minimization are incorporated to predict relative robot locations. Thus, robust SLAM performances can be obtained even under poor conditions in which localization cannot be achieved by classical odometry-based SLAM.", "paper_title": "Vision-based semantic-map building and localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000068"}
