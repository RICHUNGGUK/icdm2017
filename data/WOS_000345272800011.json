The methodology is based on the use of metadata to analyze similarity between the data characteristics and the user's needs or expectations for several quality indicators. Additionally, the concept of 'critical factors' is introduced in this framework, allowing users to define which quality indicators have greater importance given their own requirements or expectations and the specified application contexts. The proposed methodology further allows integrating and interconnecting the spatial data quality (SDQ) evaluation methodology with metadata geoportals in WebGIS platforms, facilitating its operation by users from non-spatial disciplines and with often limited expertise on this subject. Examples of the evaluation of fitness for use for specific application contexts within the project BIO_SOS ('Biodiversity Multi-SOurce Monitoring System: From Space To Species' FP7 project) are presented. By providing a prompt and straightforward evaluation tool, the proposed methodology can encourage the implementation of SDQ evaluation routines in ecological assessment and monitoring programs, promoting a more adequate use of geospatial data and ultimately contributing to well-supported policy and management decisions.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the fitness for use of spatial data sets to promote quality in ecological assessment and monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000345272800011"}
