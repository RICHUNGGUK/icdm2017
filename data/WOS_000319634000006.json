Since the epsilon-insensitive loss function cannot reduce noise, a novel support vector regression machine: g-SVRM, is proposed, then a chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm developed to estimate its unknown parameters. Finally, a hybrid-forecasting model combining g-SVRM with the CPSO is proposed to forecast a multi-dimensional time series. The results of two experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
