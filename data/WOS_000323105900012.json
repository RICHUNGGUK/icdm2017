A Tverberg partition is a partition of into sets such that the convex hulls have non-empty intersection. A point in is called a Tverberg point of depth for . A classic result by Tverberg shows that there always exists a Tverberg partition of size , but it is not known how to find such a partition in polynomial time. Therefore, approximate solutions are of interest. We describe a deterministic algorithm that finds a Tverberg partition of size in time . This means that for every fixed dimension we can compute an approximate Tverberg point (and hence also an approximate centerpoint) in linear time. Our algorithm is obtained by combining a novel lifting approach with a recent result by Miller and Sheehy (Comput Geom Theory Appl 43(8):647-654, 2010).", "paper_title": "Approximating Tverberg Points in Linear Time for Any Fixed Dimension", "paper_id": "WOS:000323105900012"}
