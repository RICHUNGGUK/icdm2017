Additionally, the potentials of statistical methods are often overlooked and seldom used among structural engineers. In this paper, factorial experimentation in simulating railway bridge dynamics was exemplified by screening the individual and joint effect of several modelling factors. The statistical theory proved to be relevant and meaningful, easy to implement but still very powerful. The concept of factorial experimentation was believed to provide the engineer with important indications of the effects of several possible updating parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
