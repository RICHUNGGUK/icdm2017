It follows that the convergence of the Newton method for the problem is at least of order 1 + 2/2m, where m is the order of the trigonometric bases. This result theoretically confirms the numerical observation by Potter (1990) and Cole and Goodrich (1993).", "paper_title": "Convergence rate of Newton's method for L-2 spectral estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236418400011"}
