The GENE code, which solves the gyrokinetic equations, has been coupled to the SLEPc package for an efficient iterative, matrix-free, and parallel computation of rightmost eigenvalues. This setup is presented, including the preconditioner which is necessary for the newly implemented Jacobi-Davidson solver. The fast computation of instabilities at a single parameter set is exploited to make parameter scans viable, that is to compute the solution at many points in the parameter space. Several issues related to parameter scans are discussed, such as an efficient parallelization over parameter sets and subspace recycling. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
