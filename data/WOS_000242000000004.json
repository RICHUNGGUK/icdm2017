Many properties for this transform are already known, but the convolution theorems, similar to the version of the Fourier transform, are still to be determined. In this paper, the authors derive the convolution theorems for the LCT, and explore the sampling theorem and multiplicative filter for the band limited signal in the linear canonical domain. Finally, the sampling and reconstruction formulas are deduced, together with the construction methodology for the above mentioned multiplicative filter in the time domain based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), which has much lower computational load than the construction method in the linear canonical domain.", "paper_title": "Convolution theorems for the linear canonical transform and their applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000242000000004"}
