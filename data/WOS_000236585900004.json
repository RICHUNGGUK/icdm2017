We present a decomposition approach that allows us to assign a priori the bays of a containership to the set of containers to be loaded according to their final destination, such that different portions of the ship are independently considered for the stowage. Then, we find the optimal solution of each subset of bays by using a 0/1 Linear Programming model. Finally, we check the global ship stability of the overall stowage plan and look for its feasibility by using an exchange algorithm which is based on local search techniques. The validation of the proposed approach is performed with some real life test cases.", "paper_title": "A decomposition heuristics for the container ship stowage problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000236585900004"}
