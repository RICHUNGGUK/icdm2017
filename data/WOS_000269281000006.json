The server helps the users share a cryptographic secure session key by using their different passwords. We propose a light-weight password-based authenticated key exchange protocol with different passwords, i.e., it requires only 2 rounds and 4 modular exponentiations per user. The protocol provides forward secrecy, known-key secrecy, key secrecy against the curious server, and security against undetectable attacks without random oracles.", "paper_title": "Light-Weight Key Exchange with Different Passwords in the Standard Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000269281000006"}
