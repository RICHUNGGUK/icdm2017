Construction and management costs of information provision systems with low computational-ability devices, such as RFID devices, are low so lightweight authentication protocols are required for information security. In this paper, two lightweight authentication protocols are proposed for reliable information provision systems with low computational-ability devices. The first protocol is for public information, and the other ensures that only authorized users can get information.", "paper_title": "Authentication Protocols for Reliable Information Provision Systems with Low Computational-Ability Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000317997900001"}
