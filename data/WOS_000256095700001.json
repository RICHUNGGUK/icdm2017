Giant magnetoresistive and giant magnetoimpedance sensors provide high sensitivity and reduced size with GMI sensors also adding capabilities of high frequency range of measurements. Being produced with thin film processing techniques, the manufacturing cost of these sensors is low. An example is considered of detecting defects in printed circuit boards. System details and experimental results are provided. Computational modeling validation is introduced based on finite element as well as method of moments analysis.", "paper_title": "GMR- and GMI-based systems for nondestructive evaluation of printed circuit board", "paper_id": "WOS:000256095700001"}
