The framework uses random binning arguments and is based on a duality between channel and source coding problems. Furthermore, the framework uses pmf approximation arguments instead of counting and typicality. This allows for proving coordination and strong secrecy problems, where certain statistical conditions on the distribution of random variables need to be satisfied. These statistical conditions include independence between messages and eavesdropper's observations in secrecy problems and closeness to a certain distribution (usually, i.i.d. distribution) in coordination problems. One important feature of the framework is to enable one to add an eavesdropper and obtain a result on the secrecy rates for free. We make a case for generality of the framework by studying examples in a variety of settings including channel coding, lossy source coding, joint source-channel coding, coordination, strong secrecy, feedback, and relaying. In particular, by investigating the framework for the lossy source coding problem over broadcast channel, it is shown that the new framework provides a simple alternative scheme to the hybrid coding scheme. In addition, new results on secrecy rate region (under strong secrecy criterion) of wiretap broadcast channel and wiretap relay channel are derived. In a set of accompanied papers, we have shown the usefulness of the framework to establish achievability results for coordination problems, including interactive channel simulation, coordination via relay and channel simulation via another channel.", "paper_title": "Achievability Proof via Output Statistics of Random Binning", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100003"}
