In water resources management problems where numerous qualitative criteria exist, use of such interactive optimization methods can facilitate in the search for comprehensive and meaningful solutions for the decision maker. The decision makers using such a system are, however, likely to go through their own learning process as they view new solutions and gain knowledge about the design space. This leads to temporal changes (nonstationarity) in their preferences that can impair the performance of interactive optimization algorithms. This paper proposes a new interactive optimization algorithm Case-Based Micro Interactive Genetic Algorithm that uses a case-based memory and case-based reasoning to manage the effects of nonstationarity in decision maker's preferences within the search process without impairing the performance of the search algorithm. This paper focuses on exploring the advantages of such an approach within the domain of groundwater monitoring design, though it is applicable to many other problems. The methodology is tested under non-stationary preference conditions using simulated and real human decision makers, and it is also compared with a non-interactive genetic algorithm and a previous version of the interactive genetic algorithm.
