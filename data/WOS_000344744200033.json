The proposed model is able to be adaptive in each region depending on the information of the image. More precisely, the model performs more diffusion in the flat areas of the image, and less diffusion in the edges of the image. And so we can get rid of the noise, and preserve the edges of the image simultaneously. To verify that, we did several experiments, which showed that our algorithm is the best method for edge preserving and noise removing, compared with the isotropic diffusion, anisotropic diffusion, and total variation methods.", "paper_title": "A blending method based on partial differential equations for image denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200033"}
