For coherent detection, channel estimation is essential for receiver design. Channel estimation is also necessary for diversity combining or interference suppression where there are multiple receive antennas. In this paper, we will present a survey on channel estimation for OFDM. This survey will first review traditional channel estimation approaches based on channel frequency response (CFR). Parametric model (PM)-based channel estimation, which is particularly suitable for sparse channels, will be also investigated in this survey. Following the success of turbo codes and low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, iterative processing has been widely adopted in the design of receivers, and iterative channel estimation has received a lot of attention since that time. Iterative channel estimation will be emphasized in this survey as the emerging iterative receiver improves system performance significantly. The combination of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and OFDM has been widely accepted in modern communication systems, and channel estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems will also be addressed in this survey. Open issues and future work are discussed at the end of this paper.", "paper_title": "Channel Estimation for OFDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000345570200006"}
