For the problem at hand, the decision variables are of integer-type, the servicelevel is a chance constraint for each product, and the space limitation is another constraint of the problem. Furthermore, shortages are allowed in the forms of fuzzy random quantities of lost sale that are backordered. The developed mathematical formulation of the problem is shown to be a fuzzy random integer-nonlinear programming model. The aim is to determine the maximum level of inventory for each product such that the total profit under budget and service level constraints is maximized. In order to solve the model, a hybrid method of fuzzy simulation, stochastic simulation, and particle swarm optimization approach (Hybrid FS-SS-PSO) is used. At the end, several numerical illustrations are given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology and to compare its performances with the ones of another hybrid algorithm as a combination of fuzzy simulation, stochastic simulation, and genetic algorithm (FS-SS-GA). The results of the numerical illustrations show that FS-SS-PSO performs better than FS-SS-GA in terms of both objective functions and CPU time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
