Firstly, the essential design of the model is described systemically. Then the fuzzy membership functions of all factors which affect compressed video quality are determined. And the factor weights are also estimated by approximate algorithm. This model highlights a comprehensive evaluation by taking account of multiple properties of the compressed video which affect the whole video sequence, such as quality, fluency and motion info. On the other side, this model has well capability of compatibility with other evaluation models or standards. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the fuzzy objective video quality evaluation model especially in comprehensive judgment of the whole video.", "paper_title": "Objective evaluation for compressed video quality based on fuzzy synthetic judgment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000092"}
