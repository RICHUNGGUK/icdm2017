It is shown that for any sequence of increasing block-length decoder circuits implemented according to this model, if the probability of block error is asymptotically less than 1/2 then the energy of the computation scales at least as Omega(n(log n)(1/2)), and so the energy of decoding per bit must scale at least as Omega (log n)(1/2). This implies that the average energy per decoded bit must approach infinity for any sequence of decoders that approaches capacity. The analysis techniques used are then extended to show that for any sequence of increasing block-length serial decoders, if the asymptotic block error probability is less than 1/2 then the energy scales at least as fast as Omega (n log n). In a very general case that allows for the number of output pins to vary with block length, it is shown that the energy must scale as Omega (n(log n)(1/5)). A simple example is provided of a class of circuits performing low-density parity-check decoding whose energy complexity scales as O(n(2) log log n).", "paper_title": "Energy Consumption of VLSI Decoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600015"}
