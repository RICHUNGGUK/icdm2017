Through the discussions on the solutions of certain equations and the newly developed theory of Z(4)-valued quadratic forms, the distribution of the exponential sum is completely determined. As its applications, we can determine the Lee weight and Hamming weight distributions of a class of codes C-k over Z(4) and the correlation distribution of a quaternary sequence family U-k, respectively. Furthermore, the Hamming weight distributions of the binary codes obtained from C-k under the most significant bit (MSB) and Gray maps are also determined. For the MSB map sequences of U-k, the nontrivial maximal correlation value is given and the correlation distribution is determined for the Gray map sequences of U-k. It should be noted that the distribution of the exponential sum for the case gcd(m,k) not equal 1 is obtained for the first time, and then the corresponding codes and sequences are novel.", "paper_title": "Several Classes of Codes and Sequences Derived From a Z(4)-Valued Quadratic Form", "paper_id": "WOS:000297046100030"}
