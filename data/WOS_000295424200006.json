Proposed representation relies on a new shape basis which we refer to as the conic basis. The conic basis takes conic-section coefficients as its dimensions and represents the object as a convex combination of conic-sections. Pairs of conic-sections in this new basis and their projective invariants provides the proposed view invariant representation. We hypothesize that two projectively transformed versions of an object result in the same representation. We show that our hypothesis provides promising recognition performance when we use the nearest neighbor rule to match projectively deformed objects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
