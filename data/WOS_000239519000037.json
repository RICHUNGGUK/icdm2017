The project initiated and conducted a CEN workshop which produced a CEN Workshop Agreemeent (CWA) identifying three possible schemes for Web accessibility certification, namely inspection according to the ISO/IEC 17020, certification according to the EN 45011 and Supplier's Declaration of Conformity according to the ISO/IEC 17050. The CEN workshop also recommended the creation of an Institute whose objective would be to harmonise the interpretation and implementation of the W3C/WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in Europe. The Institute would create, promote and maintain a Quality Mark.", "paper_title": "Towards web accessibility certification: The findings of the Support-EAM project", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000037"}
