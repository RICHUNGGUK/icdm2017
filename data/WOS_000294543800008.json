The method generates the link states one by one, using a sampling strategy that approximates an ideal zero-variance importance sampling scheme. The approximation is based on minimal cuts in subgraphs. In an asymptotic rare-event regime where failure probability becomes very small, we prove that the relative error of our estimator remains bounded, and even converges to 0 under additional conditions, when the unreliability of individual links converges to 0. The empirical performance of the new sampling scheme is illustrated by examples.", "paper_title": "Approximate Zero-Variance Importance Sampling for Static Network Reliability Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000294543800008"}
