Computers and Operations Research 2005;32(4):727-47] develop a model for the single machine capacitated lot-sizing and scheduling problem (CLSP) with sequence dependent setup times and setup costs, incorporating all the usual features of setup carryovers. In this note we show that this model does not avoid disconnected subtours. A new set of constraints is added to the model to provide an exact formulation for this problem. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
