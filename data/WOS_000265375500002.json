First, the JBL coder is introduced, and several of its shortcomings are identified. Then, to address these shortcomings, three modifications to this coder are proposed, namely, the use of a data-dependent base mesh, an integer representation for normal/vertical offsets, and a different scan-conversion scheme based on bicubic interpolation. Experimental results show that these proposed changes lead to improved coding performance in terms of both objective and subjective image-quality measures. In particular, the use of a data-dependent base mesh helps to locate horizons more quickly and preserve image edges better. ne number of bits required to encode the normal/vertical offsets is reduced by representing this information with integers (as opposed to real numbers). Lastly, bicubic interpolation is found to yield higher-quality image reconstructions, while still maintaining sharp edges.", "paper_title": "An improved normal-mesh-based image coder", "paper_id": "WOS:000265375500002"}
