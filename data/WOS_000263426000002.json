Instead, causal relations of a specific kind between properties and our dispositions to token a concept are claimed to do so. Fodor does admit that there needs to be some psychological mechanisms mediating the property-concept tokening relations, but argues that they are purely accidental for reference. In contrast, I argue that the actual mechanisms that sustain the reference determining concept tokening relations are necessary for reference. Fodor's atomism is thus undermined, since in order to refer with a concept it is necessary to possess some specific psychological capacities.", "paper_title": "Why Fodor's Theory of Concepts Fails", "paper_id": "WOS:000263426000002"}
