This paper presents a low-latency parallel Huffman decoding technique with efficient memory usage for multimedia standards. First, the multi-layer prefix grouping technique is proposed for sub-group partition. It exploits the prefix characteristic in Huffman codewords to solve the problem of table size explosion. Second, a two-level table lookup approach is introduced which can promptly branch to the correct sub-group by level-1 table lookup and decode the symbols by level-2 table lookup. Third, two optimization approaches are developed; one is to reduce the branch cycles and the other is parallel processing between two-level table lookup and direct table lookup approaches to fully utilize the advantage of VLIW parallel processing. An AAC Huffman decoding example is realized on the Parallel Architecture Core DSP (PAC DSP) processor. The simulation results show that the proposed method can further improve about 89% of decoding cycles and 33% of table size comparing to the linear search method.", "paper_title": "A Low-Latency Multi-Layer Prefix Grouping Technique for Parallel Huffman Decoding of Multimedia Standards", "paper_id": "WOS:000259920500007"}
