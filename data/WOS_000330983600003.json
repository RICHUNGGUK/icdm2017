We carry out a sample-path analysis to derive an exact relation between the set of system size values and the set of waiting time values over a busy period of a given sample path. This sample-path relation is then applied to a discrete-time queue with constant service times of one slot, yielding a sample-path version of the steady-state distributional relation between system size and waiting time as derived earlier in the literature. The sample-path analysis of the discrete-time system is further extended to the continuous-time counterpart, resulting in a similar sample-path relation in continuous time.", "paper_title": "Sample-path analysis of general arrival queueing systems with constant amount of work for all customers", "paper_id": "WOS:000330983600003"}
