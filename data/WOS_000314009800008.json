The joint configurations are drawn from a previous experimental study, with good prediction shown by the finite element model. Failure of the joint is confined to the end plate and is predicted by means of micromechanical models based on void growth mechanisms and coalescence, which are practical to apply to finite element analyses without additional modelling effort. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate the structural behaviour with variations in beam depth and thickness of the end plate. Quantitative assessments of resistance and rotation capacity are undertaken. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
