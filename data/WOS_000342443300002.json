Despite the breadth and variety of tools available for elicitation of user requirements, no single tool adequately provides the needed information to develop such a specialized system for a unique user population where the understanding of user behaviors is limited. This article explores the state-of-art of requirements engineering, discusses the challenges in developing a haptic assistive system, and proposes a methodology of combining a controlled observation in a naturalistic setting with scenario-based design for effective and efficient user requirements elicitation. A case study of developing a haptically enhanced, collaborative learning-by-feeling science education system for visually impaired students was conducted to show validity and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The case study showed that the methodology has a variety of benefits including the reduced uncertainty and a better fit to the natural behaviors of the user population.", "paper_title": "Scenario-Based Observation Approach for Eliciting User Requirements for Haptic User Interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000342443300002"}
