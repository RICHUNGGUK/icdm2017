The first step of this method is to investigate the impact of long term mental arithmetic task on psychology and physiology of subjects by subjective self-reporting measures, action performance test, power spectral indices of HRV and wavelet packet parameters of EEG. The second step is to calculate the wavelet packet features of all EEG data segments, including relative wavelet packet energy parameters in four frequency bands, wavelet packet entropy and three ratio indices. Finally, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and support vector machine (SVM) are jointly applied to differentiate two mental fatigue states. The investigation suggests that the joint KPCA-SVM method is able to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors, speed up the convergence in the training of SVM and achieve higher classification accuracy (88%) of the mental fatigue state. Hence KPCA-SVM could be a promising model for the estimation of mental fatigue.", "paper_title": "ESTIMATION OF MENTAL FATIGUE BASED ON WAVELET PACKET PARAMETERS AND KERNEL LEARNING ALGORITHMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261734700005"}
