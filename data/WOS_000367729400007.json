Moreover, the infrastructure of wireless communications today will not meet the requirements of a 5G environment because a large number of traffic flows will be generated between a large number of heterogeneous devices. The deployment strategy is one of the promising solutions to meet the expected demands of 5G. This article begins with a brief review of the deployment problem of wireless communication and a hyper-dense deployment problem (HDDP) definition for the requirements of 5G. A simple example for illustrating how a metaheuristic algorithm can be used to solve the HDDP is then given. Finally, some open and possible research issues are discussed to suggest future research trends on this problem.", "paper_title": "METAHEURISTICS FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF 5G", "paper_id": "WOS:000367729400007"}
