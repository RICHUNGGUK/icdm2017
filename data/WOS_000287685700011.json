Agonists/antagonists of ecdysteroid receptor are predicted to disrupt normal growth, providing good candidates of new insecticides. A database of over 2 million compounds was subjected to a shape-based virtual screening cascade to identify novel nonsteroidal hits similar to the known EcR ligand ponasterone A. Testing revealed micromolar hits against two strains of insect cells. Docking experiments against EcR were used to support the predicted binding mode of these ligands based on their overlay to ponasterone A.", "paper_title": "Virtual Screening for Ligands of the Insect Molting Hormone Receptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000287685700011"}
