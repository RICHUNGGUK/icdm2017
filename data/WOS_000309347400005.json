A properly colored graph is defined as a graph G whose vertex set is partitioned into stable subsets, where denotes the chromatic number of G. We show that to find a simple path that meets all the colors in a properly colored directed graph is NP-complete, and so are the problems of finding a shortest and longest of such paths between two specific nodes.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of path problems in properly colored directed graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000309347400005"}
