When the number of moving objects is large and the task of monitoring is carried out on mobile devices, the monitoring service suffers from constraints of screen size, computing speed, and network bandwidth. In the present paper, a two-phase scale-based reduction method (SRM) consisting of a zoom phase and a mosaic phase, is proposed to overcome these constraints. The zoom phase reduces the original monitoring area which, in turn, undergoes further reduction in the mosaic phase. The performance was measured with the use of two ratios: the reduction ratio (RRatio) and the transmission ratio (TRatio). From the experimental results, the lowest RRatio was 52%, i.e. almost half of the original data size was reduced. The lowest average TRatio was also 52% for the worst case, i.e. the entire original monitoring area was displayed on the mobile device. Moreover, the display time was shortened from 14.3 to 0.7 s. These results show that the use of the two-phase SRM is practical and efficient when applied to the monitoring service on mobile devices.
