This model is relatively easy to construct and implement in CAD software since it requires only DC and S-parameter measurements. The modeling procedure was applied to a 4-W packaged GaN-on-Si HEMT, and the developed model is validated by comparing its small-and large-signal simulation to measured data. The model has been employed for designing a switching-mode inverse class-F PA. Very good agreement between the amplifier simulation and measurement shows the validity of the model.
