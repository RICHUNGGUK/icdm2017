Firstly, the influence of a single dimple imperfection on the load-carrying capacity of cylindrical shells is investigated by varying the amplitudes, directions and positions of the dimple imperfection. Then a single delta function is introduced to describe the profile of the dimple imperfection in a more general form, which enables to analyze conveniently the effect of the imperfect zone area on the load-carrying capacity of cylindrical shells. Thereafter, a surrogate-based optimization framework of determining the worst realistic imperfection is proposed to study the reduction of the buckling load of cylindrical shells based on a finite number of dimple imperfections. The possible dimple imperfections may be introduced during the service of cylindrical shells. Finally the effectiveness of the present method is demonstrated by an illustrative example.", "paper_title": "Determination of realistic worst imperfection for cylindrical shells using surrogate model", "paper_id": "WOS:000325080700007"}
