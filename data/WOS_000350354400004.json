We show that, for any constant dimension and any set of points in , there exists a geometric graph with vertex set that has edges and that has average stretch factor . More precisely, the average stretch factor of this graph is . We complement this upper bound with a lower bound: There exist -point sets in for which any graph with edges has average stretch factor . Bounds of this type are not possible for the more commonly studied worst-case stretch factor. In particular, there exist point sets such that any graph with worst-case stretch factor has a superlinear number of edges.", "paper_title": "Average Stretch Factor: How Low Does It Go?", "paper_id": "WOS:000350354400004"}
