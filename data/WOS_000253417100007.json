Beta-binders, a language with a quantitative stochastic extension, is chosen for the translation. The proposed translation focuses on the main components of SBML models, as species and reactions. Furthermore, it satisfies the compositional property, that is, the translation of the whole model is obtained by composing the translation of the subcomponents. An automatic translator tool of SBML models into Beta-binders has been implemented as well. Finally, the translation of a simple model is reported.", "paper_title": "An automatic translation of SBML into Beta-binders", "paper_id": "WOS:000253417100007"}
