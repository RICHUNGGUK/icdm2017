We propose a method for symbolic trajectory description in unknown indoor environments. The chosen form uses a panoramic description called fresco. The method uses distance measurements from a 2D laser range finder, digitises the robot's visibility area, eliminates superfluous data and reorients their presentation. The landmarks are then extracted and organised into the fresco which is validated by means of neighbourhood rules. As the robot moves in the environment, the frescoes are created and both the amount of new information a fresco carries out and its position in relation to the preceding ones are evaluated by means of two criteria. Only frescoes selected as enough informative are stored to describe the robot's route.", "paper_title": "Symbolic trajectory description in mobile robotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000238326000004"}
