Being a Lagrangian-Eulerian Approach, this method determines the vorticity field through studying the vortex/circulation's generalized transport in an artificial velocity (generalized velocity) field of Lagrangian frame. The velocity field is then determined through the use of Poisson's equation in Eulerian frame. The \"generalized transport process\" refers the movement and area variation of vortex/circulation, which takes consideration of both diffusion and convection processes. Comparing with traditional vortex-in-cell methods and hybrid vortex methods, it does not use splitting algorithm in math, instead, handle diffusion as a part of the convection process. There is no region decomposition issue in the computation, and its expression is rather simple and easy to realize numerically. Being a numerical application, the present method is used to compute flow past one impulsively started circular cylinder. It is capable of calculating the evolution of the fine structure of the flow field with time precisely. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
