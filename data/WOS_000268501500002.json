This paper introduces new analysis techniques that allow for similar results to be derived for task systems in which individual tasks are not constrained in this manner. For tasks with deadlines greater than their minimum inter-arrival separation, two models are considered, with and without an implicit intra-task job precedence constraint. The new analyses yield schedulability conditions that strictly dominate some previously proposed tests that are generally accepted to represent the current state of the art in multiprocessor edf schedulability analysis, and permits the derivation of an improved speed-up bound.", "paper_title": "An analysis of global edf schedulability for arbitrary-deadline sporadic task systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000268501500002"}
