After ST's subordination to narrow specialists using it inside traditional disciplines, if at all, humankind needs a new innovation of ST. An option is offered. Design/methodology/approach - Mulej's Dialectical ST is applied as worldview and methodology of requisite holism using Mulej's Dialectical System concept. Findings - Mulej's Dialectical System concept applies to synergies of several STs, not only viewpoints. Here, six soft STs and the social responsibility (SR) concept are combined around human subjective starting points aimed at holism and innovation, including ethics of interdependence. Combination offers new insights. Research limitations/implications - Research is limited to soft STs and implies knowledge of more STs and SR as well as participants' readiness for creative interdisciplinary co-operation. Practical implications - The new concept offers a new step toward increased innovation capacity, especially toward innovation of culture toward requisite holism and innovation. This is a crucial precondition for survival in the modem global society and economy. Originality/value - The authors know neither books nor articles presenting synergies of several STs and SR nor their application to preconditions of innovation.", "paper_title": "Interdependence of systems theories - potential innovation supporting innovation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241260500003"}
