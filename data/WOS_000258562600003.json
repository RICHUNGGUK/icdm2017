In order to improve the performance of the complete system, the discontinuity in the control law must be smoothed out to avoid the undesirable chattering effects. The adoption of a properly designed thin boundary layer has proven effective in completely eliminating chattering, however, leading to an inferior tracking performance. This paper describes the development of a depth control system for remotely operated underwater vehicles. The adopted approach is based on the sliding mode control strategy and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm for uncertainty/disturbance compensation. The stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system are analytically proved using Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat's lemma. Numerical results are presented in order to demonstrate the control system performance. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
