The proof of the existence of solutions follows the Faedo-Galerkin method. For the simulation of a jet diffusion flame the governing equations were integrated using the explicit Runge-Kutta multistage scheme and numerical tests were carried out for Sandia Flame D. The results are in agreement with data found in the literature. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
