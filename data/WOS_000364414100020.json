The constructed set is optimal or almost optimal with respect to the theoretical bound in different conditons. The set can be used in multi-carrier code division multiple access communication systems. The designed sequence has periodic complementary characteristics, which lead to a strong ability to resist multi-path interference and multiple access interference.", "paper_title": "Construction of Z-Periodic Complementary Sequence Based on Interleaved Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414100020"}
