Given a linear system Ax = b (the rows of A are r-sparse), it has been shown by Damaschke [1] that enumerating nonnegative k-sparse solutions is fixed-parameter tractable. They present an algorithm reaching an O*(r(2k)) time bound. Since this problem is closely related to the hitting set problem, they raise the question whether it is possible to improve this time bound to O*(r(k)). This paper investigates this problem and discovers that a refined analysis of a modified version of their algorithm leads to a smaller time bound O*((4r)(k)). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
