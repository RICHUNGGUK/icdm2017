After identifying the weakness and strength of each technique, a new classifier called the kNN model-based classifier (kNN Model) is proposed. It combines the strength of both kNN and Rocchio. A text categorization prototype, which implements kNN Model along with kNN and Rocchio, is described. An experimental evaluation of different methods is carried out on two common document corpora: the 20-newsgroup collection and the ModApte version of the Reuters-21578 collection of news stories. The experimental results show that the proposed kNN model-based method outperforms the kNN and Rocchio classifiers, and is therefore a good alternative for kNN and Rocchio in some application areas.", "paper_title": "Using kNN model for automatic text categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000234145500004"}
