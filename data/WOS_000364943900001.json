In this paper, we first derive a gas diffusion model under windy conditions based on the gas diffusion theory. Because of the nonlinearity of the gas diffusion model under windy conditions, the traditional weighted centroid algorithm for gas source localization produces very inaccurate estimation of the source location. To address this problem, we propose a novel gas source localization algorithm which combines the weighted centroid method and particle filter. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our algorithm under unknown gas source strength. Compared to weighted centroid method alone, our algorithm shows a higher accuracy in location. Moreover, its convergence rate is improved by the preestimation of initial value.", "paper_title": "A Gas Source Localization Algorithm Based on Particle Filter in Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000364943900001"}
