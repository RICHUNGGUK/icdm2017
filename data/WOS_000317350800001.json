In this paper, we survey existing works on active learning from an instance-selection perspective and classify them into two categories with a progressive relationship: (1) active learning merely based on uncertainty of independent and identically distributed (IID) instances, and (2) active learning by further taking into account instance correlations. Using the above categorization, we summarize major approaches in the field, along with their technical strengths/weaknesses, followed by a simple runtime performance comparison, and discussion about emerging active learning applications and instance-selection challenges therein. This survey intends to provide a high-level summarization for active learning and motivates interested readers to consider instance-selection approaches for designing effective active learning solutions.", "paper_title": "A survey on instance selection for active learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000317350800001"}
