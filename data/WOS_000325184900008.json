Coordination and longevity of the members of the marsupial robotic team can quickly become burdensome as the scope of the scenario changes. To facilitate large scale operations, robotic teams must be able to function continuously with limited to no human intervention for scenarios which may not have a pre-determined length at onset. An end-to-end design and implementation of a novel marsupial system where a multi-level hierarchy allows larger robots to transport, deploy, coordinate, recover, and resupply large numbers of smaller deployable systems is outlined. The design and implementation of hardware systems for performing these actions is discussed. In addition, the algorithms which coordinate the team members are presented. Simulation illustrating the scalability of the approach is presented including experiments illustrating a light-weight vision-based autonomous docking capability.", "paper_title": "Coordination and Longevity in Multi-Robot Teams Involving Miniature Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000325184900008"}
