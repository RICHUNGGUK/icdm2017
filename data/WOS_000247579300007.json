In particular, coding over the space, time, and frequency domains provided by MIMO-OFDM will enable a much more reliable and robust transmission over the harsh wireless environment. In this article we provide an overview of space-time (ST) coding, space-frequency (SF) coding, and space-time-frequency (STF) coding for MIMO-OFDM systems. Performance results show that STF coding can achieve the maximum diversity gain in an end-to-end MIMO-OFDM system over broadband wireless channels. Furthermore, for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), we propose a multiuser SF coding scheme that can achieve the maximum diversity for each user while minimizing the interference introduced from all the other users.", "paper_title": "Space-time/frequency coding for MIMO-OFDM in next-generation broadband wireless systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247579300007"}
