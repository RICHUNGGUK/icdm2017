Then, we analyze how to combine the STR method with the cross antenna rotation and inversion method to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system. To validate the analytical results, extensive simulations are conducted and the numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed schemes including the PAPR reduction and low computational complexity for MIMO-OFDM system.
