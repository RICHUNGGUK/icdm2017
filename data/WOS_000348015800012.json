One of the most difficult problems in SR is to preserve the edges while removing the noise. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel l(mix) model, which combines the total variation model and the H-1 model by using a pair of different weighting parameters. Also, a hierarchical Bayesian framework is used and the weighting parameters can be modeled together with the HR image and other parameters. Thus the weighting parameters are updated according to the global features of the HR image in iterations. In this way, the proposed l(mix) model can not only preserve the edges but also it can remove the noise. Our experimental results show that the proposed method has much improvement over the existing methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
