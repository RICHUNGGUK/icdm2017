According to organizational rules temporal constraints, like deadlines, must be defined for processes. Violation of these constraints usually results in increased cost and reduced quality of service. Advanced workflow time management approaches allow the prediction of eventually arising time constraint violations and enables proactive initiation of evasive \"self healing\" actions. This saves time, avoids unnecessary task-compensations and therefor decreases costs. In this paper we present an architecture for Web Service Composition environments which enables the usage of advanced predictive and proactive time management features.", "paper_title": "An architecture for proactive timed web service compositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241427500027"}
