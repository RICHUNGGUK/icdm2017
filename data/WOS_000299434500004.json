The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is simulated explicitly as a hydrostatic fluid by using a surface-based fluid modelling method, which allows fluid and structure interaction. It is found that the modified model yields smoother pressure responses in a head impact simulation. The baseline model underestimated the peak von Mises stress in the brain by 15% and the peak principal stress in the skull by 33%. The increase in the maximum principal stress in the skull is mainly caused by the updation of the material's viscoelasticity, and the change in the maximum von Mises stress in the brain is mainly caused by the improvement of the CSF simulation. The study shows that the viscoelasticity of the head tissue should be considered, and that the CSF should be modelled as a fluid, when using FE analysis to study head injury due to impact.", "paper_title": "A modified human head model for the study of impact head injury", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434500004"}
