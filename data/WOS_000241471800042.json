Role association is defined and used which set up the foundation for our approach. Each domain unifies the management of shared resources via role associations. A new sharing security domain is established, which is based on the extended hierarchy of roles in the root organization domain. The formation rules of the roles and the way of construction of the roles hierarchy in sharing security domain are also introduced. The role association conflicting issues and rules for role maintenance are also analyzed. Our approaches have enhanced the security measures of shared resources and resolved the problems of the domain crossing and covert promotion which exist in other approaches.", "paper_title": "An access-control policy based on sharing resource management for a multi-domains environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800042"}
