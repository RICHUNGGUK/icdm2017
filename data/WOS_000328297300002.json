Such problems have a rich dynamics and besides classical solutions can have weak solutions in the sense of Utkin. Both of the presented techniques permit the numerical solution of such problems with the code RADAR5, which is designed to compute classical solutions of stiff and differential-algebraic (state-dependent) delay equations.
