This issue deserves our investigation. The current study aims to discover the factors in distinguishing bottle packaging and the formula for displayability (ability to display). The research process is divided into two stages. Stage One covers the \"grounded concept of package design differentiation,\" whereas Stage Two covers the \"statistical tests for packaging factors.\" We have two findings. First, the participants' design differentiation of packages is focused on the three differentiation factors: properties of commodity, label design, and design of bottle shape. Second, completed regression analysis proves that their significant levels are all p < .05. We therefore propose a regression model for the assessment of differentiation design for bottle packaging = 0.717 x properties of commodity + 0.708 x design of bottle shape + 0.795 x label design - 2.857. The three factors rank in importance as properties of commodity > design of bottle shape > label design. These results can help marketing and design personnel compare the difference in the package design of competitive products before they enter the market in order to create differentiation and build brand identity.
