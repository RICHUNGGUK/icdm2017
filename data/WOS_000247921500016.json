The active estimation problem (AEP) is formulated as a stochastic optimal control one, in which the minimization of a suitable uncertainty measure is carried out. Toward this end, the use of the Renyi entropy as an information measure is proposed and motivated. A neural control scheme, based on the application of the extended Ritz method (ERIM) and on the use of a Gaussian sum filter (GSF), is then presented. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Active state estimation for nonlinear systems: A neural approximation approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000247921500016"}
