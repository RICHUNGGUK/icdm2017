Through a spectral analysis of the projection operator's SIP-DG discretization, we demonstrate that the eigenfunctions of the operator do not form a basis that allows for the correct enforcement of the incompressibility constraint. This short-coming can cause numerical instabilities for inviscid, advection-dominated, and density stratified flow simulations, especially for long-time integrations and/or under-resolved situations. To remedy this problem, we propose a local post-processing projection that enforces incompressibility exactly to allow for stable and robust long-time integrations.
