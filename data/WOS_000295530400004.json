The main asset of a software organization consists of its intellectual capital. In this paper we propose KnowBench, a novel knowledge management system that integrates into the daily software development process and can be used for capturing knowledge and experience as soon as it is generated by providing lightweight tools based on Semantic Web technologies. This approach supports developers during the software development process to produce better quality software. The goal of KnowBench is to support the whole knowledge management process when developers design and implement software by supporting identification, acquisition, development, distribution, preservation, and use of knowledge - the building blocks of a knowledge management system.", "paper_title": "LEVERAGING SOFTWARE REUSE WITH KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000295530400004"}
