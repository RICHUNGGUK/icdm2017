Using Delhomme's decomposition technique for tree-automatic structures, we show that the (ordinal) rank of a tree-automatic well-founded tree is strictly below omega(omega). Moreover, we make a step towards proving that the ranks of tree-automatic well-founded partial orders are bounded by omega(omega omega): we prove this bound for what we call upwards linear partial orders. As an application of our result, we show that the isomorphism problem for tree-automatic well-founded trees is complete for level Delta(0)(omega omega) of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy with respect to Turing-reductions.", "paper_title": "TREE-AUTOMATIC WELL-FOUNDED TREES", "paper_id": "WOS:000322537700004"}
