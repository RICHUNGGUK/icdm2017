For the minmax-regret 1-center problem on a general graph, we improve the previous upper bound from O(mn(2) log n) to O(mn log n). For the problem on a tree, we improve the upper bound from O(n(2)) to O(n log(2) n). For the minmax-regret 1-median problem on a general graph, we improve the upper bound from O(mn(2) log n) to O(mn(2) + n(3) log n). For the problem on a tree, we improve the upper bound from O(n log(2) n) to O(n log n).", "paper_title": "Improved Algorithms for the Minmax-Regret 1-Center and 1-Median Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265882100012"}
