However, Geometric Goppa codes that can be represented by this method are mainly those based on just one point. In this correspondence, we introduce the concept of near order function with the aim of generalizing this approach in such a way that a wider family of Geometric Goppa codes can be studied on a more elementary setting.", "paper_title": "Near orders and codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034600028"}
