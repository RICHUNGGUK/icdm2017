It is shown that the class of sets representable by unique solutions of equations using the operations of union and addition, defined as +={+a a pound,a}, and with ultimately periodic constants is exactly the class of hyper-arithmetical sets. Equations using addition only can represent every hyper-arithmetical set under a simple encoding. All hyper-arithmetical sets can also be represented by equations over sets of natural numbers equipped with union, addition and subtraction . Testing whether a given system has a solution is -complete for each model. These results, in particular, settle the expressive power of the most general types of language equations, as well as equations over subsets of free groups.", "paper_title": "Representing Hyper-arithmetical Sets by Equations over Sets of Integers", "paper_id": "WOS:000304154600005"}
