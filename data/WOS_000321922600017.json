We investigated their binding mode to the kappa-receptor via docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The ranking of the predicted binding free energies is consistent with experimental results. Detailed binding free energies between antagonists and individual protein residues were calculated, and key residues involved in binding were identified. Deviation of the active site residues was investigated, and the results show that Gln115, Leu135, Tyr139, Trp287 and Tyr313 deviate greatly from the reference structure. Information obtained from molecular modeling studies will aid in the design of potent kappa receptor antagonists.", "paper_title": "Insight into the binding model of new antagonists of kappa receptor using docking and molecular dynamics simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600017"}
