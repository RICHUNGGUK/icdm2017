The current known universal generating function methods (UGFMs, here called pUGFMs) used to evaluate acyclic MIN (AMIN) reliability are based on the connectedness between node 1 and the targets, i.e. find all possible paths between node 1 and the targets. A novel cut-based UGFM (cUGFM) is proposed for the AMIN reliability problem. The proposed cUGFM is based on the disconnectedness between node 1 and the targets, i.e. find all possible cuts between node 1 and the targets. It provides a flexible, novel method to calculate reliability and unreliability. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is also analyzed and compared with the best-known existing methods. Finally, three benchmark examples are given to illustrate how the exact one-to-all-target-subset AMIN reliability is calculated using the proposed cUGFM.", "paper_title": "A Novel Cut-Based Universal Generating Function Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000324250300008"}
