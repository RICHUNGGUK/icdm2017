This index can satisfactorily deal with clusters with heterogeneous orientations, scales and densities. One of the main advantages of the index is the simplicity of its calculation, which only requires the computation of the log-determinants of the covariance matrices and the prior probabilities of each cluster. The negentropy increment provides validation results which are in general better than those from other classic cluster validity indices. However, when the number of data points in a partition region is small, the quality in the estimation of the log-determinant of the covariance matrix can be very poor. This affects the proper quantification of the index and therefore the quality of the clustering, so additional requirements such as limitations on the minimum number of points in each region are needed. Although this kind of constraints can provide good results, they need to be adjusted depending on parameters such as the dimension of the data space. In this article we investigate how the estimation of the negentropy increment of a clustering partition is affected by the presence of regions with small number of points. We find that the error in this estimation depends on the number of points in each region, but not on the scale or orientation of their distribution, and show how to correct this error in order to obtain an unbiased estimator of the negentropy increment. We also quantify the amount of uncertainty in the estimation. As we show, both for 2D synthetic problems and multidimensional real benchmark problems, these results can be used to validate clustering partitions with a substantial improvement.
