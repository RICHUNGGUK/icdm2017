To make further description of the aforementioned, in this paper we introduce an extended TOPSIS method for multicriteria decision making with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information, where the weighted vector of each alternative is determined by ranking corresponding evaluation information. Meanwhile, we construct a new method to measure the distance between alternatives and positive ideal solution as well as negative ideal solution, which is score distance. Finally, the detailed decision making procedure is proposed and an illustrative example is applied to demonstrate its validity. It is worth while to point out that the weights determination for criteria will be helpful to future research on decision making analysis.", "paper_title": "New approach to MCDM under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204400009"}
