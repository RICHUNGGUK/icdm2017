From a system viewpoint, CMPs provide higher levels of integration, typically including multiple processing cores, caches, memory controllers, and even some I/O processing - all in a single socket. Multiple cores will provide unprecedented compute power on a single chip. However, integration of several components on a chip must be accompanied by features that enable isolation from fault effects, destructive performance interference, and security breaches.", "paper_title": "Benefits from isolation in commodity multicore processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000247247100010"}
