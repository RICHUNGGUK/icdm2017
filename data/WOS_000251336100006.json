Combining the operational definition of graph states and the postulates of entanglement measures, we prove that in connected graph states of N qubits there is no genuine k-qubit entanglement, 2 <= k <= N - 1, among every k cubits. These results about connected graph states naturally lead to the definition of fully multi-qubit entangled states. We also find that the connected graph states of four qubits is one but not the only one class of fully four-qubit entangled states.", "paper_title": "Fully multi-qubit entangled states", "paper_id": "WOS:000251336100006"}
