In these examples only two groups occur: elementary abelian groups of even order and odd order Heisenberg groups of dimension 3. In [2] the authors determined all generalized quadrangles admitting an abelian group with a sharply transitive point action. Here, we classify thick finite generalized quadrangles admitting an odd order Heisenberg group of dimension 3 acting sharply transitively on the points. In fact our more general result comes close to a complete solution of classifying odd order Singer p-groups.", "paper_title": "Generalized quadrangles admitting a sharply transitive Heisenberg group", "paper_id": "WOS:000253199200019"}
