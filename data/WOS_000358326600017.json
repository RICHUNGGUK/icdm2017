To this end, we automatically co-align a collection of images and learn a subspace model of shape and appearance using principal components. As finding perfect image correspondences for general images is not feasible, we build an approximate partial alignment and improve bad alignments leveraging other, more successful alignments. Our system allows the user to change appearance and shape in real-time and the result is \"projected\" onto the subspace of meaningful changes. The change in appearance and shape can either be locked or performed independently. Additional applications include suggestion of alternative shapes or appearance.", "paper_title": "Guiding Image Manipulations using Shape-appearance Subspaces from Co-alignment of Image Collections", "paper_id": "WOS:000358326600017"}
