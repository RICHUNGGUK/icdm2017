Clustering has been proposed as a means to divide large networks into groups of suitably smaller sizes such that prevailing MANET routing protocols can be applied. However, the benefits of clustering come at a cost. Clusters take time to form and the clustering algorithms also introduce additional control messages that contend with data traffic for the wireless bandwidth. In this paper, we aim to analyse a distributed multi-hop clustering algorithm, Mobility-based D-Hop (MobDHop), based on two key clustering performance metrics and compare it with other popular clustering algorithms used in MANETs. We show that the overhead incurred by multi-hop clustering has a similar asymptotic bound as 1-hop clustering while being able to reap the benefits of multi-hop clusters. Simulation results are presented to verify our analysis. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
