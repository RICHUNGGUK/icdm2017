The global positioning system(GPS) is commonly used today and context awareness technologies are often adopted. To support efficient and effective telecommunications between a huge number of devices and the intelligent transport systems (ITS) services, a scalable networking platform is hence demanded. In this study, we present a novel approach to support an open architecture environment for telematics services based on international standards. The proposed core telematics platform (CTP) can optimize the data transmission under linearly increased time complexity by employing a high-scalable architecture design when a large number of devices connect to the application servers. The proposed context awareness application server (CAAS) approach can optimize context awareness features to provide personal tracking services to children and elders for safety purposes. The simulations and experiments in this study have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Practical Context Awareness Information System for Wireless Vehicular Networks Based on a Core Telematics Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000336574100001"}
