That is, this paper deals with secure computations in a minimal model, and gives a protocol which securely computes every function by means of the techniques of ESOP expressions. The communication complexity of our protocol is proportional to the size of an obtained multiple-valued-input ESOP expression. Since the historical research on minimizing ESOP expressions is now still active, our protocol will \"automatically\" turn to an efficient one as this research progresses. Thus, we hope that the existence of our cryptographic protocol would motivate further research on minimizing ESOP expressions.", "paper_title": "An application of ESOP expressions to secure computations", "paper_id": "WOS:000250969900004"}
