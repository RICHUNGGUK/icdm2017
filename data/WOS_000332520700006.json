It is one of only three discrete distributions allowing for bathtub shaped hazard rate functions. We study some of its mathematical properties, discuss estimation by the method of maximum likelihood, and describe applications to four real data sets. The new distribution is shown to outperform at least three other models including those allowing for bathtub shaped hazard rate functions.", "paper_title": "A New Discrete Modified Weibull Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000332520700006"}
