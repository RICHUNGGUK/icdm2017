The nephron fluid dynamics is represented as a crystallizer/separator series with changing volume to allow for water removal along the tubule. The model integrates crystallization kinetics and crystal size distribution and allows the prediction of the calcium oxalate concentration profile and the nucleation and growth rates. The critical supersaturation ratio for the nucleation of calcium oxalate crystals has been estimated as 2 and the mean crystal size as 1 mu m. The crystal growth order, determined as 2.2, indicates a surface integration mechanism of crystal growth and crystal growth dispersion. The model allows the exploration of the effect of varying the input calcium oxalate concentration and the rate of water extraction, simulating real life stressors for stone formation such as dietary loading and dehydration.", "paper_title": "Reverse engineering the kidney: modelling calcium oxalate monohydrate crystallization in the nephron", "paper_id": "WOS:000278896000004"}
