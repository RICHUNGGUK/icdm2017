The objective is to identify data features which help to pinpoint the critical samples that require the most inspection resources, namely time and money. Typically the data available for deriving the optimized inspection schedules in industry include both numeric and nominal features, and most clustering and classification algorithms are tailored for either numeric or nominal data. For this work, we adopt the Similarity-Based Agglomerative Clustering (SBAC) algorithm that has been shown to be effective in clustering data with mixed numeric and nominal features. We present the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to an important problem in the rail road industry, i.e., the inspection of railroad wheels.", "paper_title": "Identification of critical inspection samples among railroad wheels by similarity-based agglomerative clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000292915800002"}
