The test system is an alteration of the Bonneville Power Administration test system constructed to capture transient (angle), frequency and voltage instability phenomena, resulting in system collapse, within one system. The paper describes general overview of the test system and its associated individual devices modelling. These modelling are both customized and adapted from the built-in model developed by PowerFactory simulation software. The paper also provides a description of different instabilities that can be reproduced by this self-contained system. One of the case study is demonstrated in detail with the necessary initialization settings for reproducing instability scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
