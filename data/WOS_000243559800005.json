We show that Parzen window-based estimators for some information theoretic cost functions are also cost functions in a corresponding Mercer kernel space. The Mercer kernel is directly related to the Parzen window. Furthermore, we analyze a classification rule based on an information theoretic criterion, and show that this corresponds to a linear classifier in the kernel space. By introducing a weighted Parzen window density estimator, we also formulate the support vector machine in this information theoretic perspective.", "paper_title": "Some equivalences between kernel methods and information theoretic methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000243559800005"}
