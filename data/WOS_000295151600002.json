In this work the intrinsic complexity of floating-point operators is addressed targeting configurable devices and making design decisions providing the most suitable performance-standard compliance trade-offs. A set of floating-point libraries composed of adder/subtracter, multiplier, divisor, square root, exponential, logarithm and power function are presented. Each library has been designed taking into account special characteristics of current FPGAs, and with this purpose we have adapted the IEEE floating-point standard (software-oriented) to a custom FPGA-oriented format. Extended experimental results validate the design decisions made and prove the usefulness of reducing the format complexity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
