The lattice-Boltzmann model and the structure of the code are discussed. The fluid solver is highly optimized and the resulting computational core is very fast. Furthermore, communication is minimized and the novel topology-aware domain decomposition technique is shown to be very effective for large systems, allowing us to tune code execution in geographically distributed cross-site simulations. The benchmarks presented indicate that very high performance can be achieved. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
