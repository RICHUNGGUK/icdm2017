When one type of seasonal time series is regressed on the other type and they are independent of each other, the phenomenon of spurious regression occurs. Asymptotic properties of the regression coefficient estimator and the associated regression 't-ratio' are studied. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to confirm the phenomenon of spurious regression and spurious rejection of seasonal cointegration for finite samples.", "paper_title": "A note on spurious regression in seasonal time series", "paper_id": "WOS:000259293300005"}
