They have agricultural applications in measuring plant growth rate, tree volume, tree count, 3D imaging, and pattern recognition. Laser scanners are commercially available, but there is very little published information on characteristics and performance of these laser scanners. This study compared two laser scanners, the Sick LMS200 and the Hokuyo URG-04LX, for measurement drift over time, the effect of material and color on measurement accuracy, and the ability to map different surface patterns. Measurement drift over time was studied by determining the distance between the laser scanner sensor and a stationary object at different fixed distances and angles. Distance measurements over time fluctuated with a peak-to-peak value of 10-20mm. The settling time, which is the time required for the averaged distance data to reach a stable level, increased when measurement distance increased but for a given distance, the settling time remained constant for different angles. At the measurement angle of 90 degrees, the settling times for the LMS200 and the URG-04LX for 50% of the maximum scanner measurement distances were 53 min and 70 min, respectively. Therefore, to obtain accurate distance measurements, the laser scanners should be warmed up for the duration of the settling time before recording measurement data. The measured distance for soft material objects, such as a styrofoam plate and a sheet of dry sponge, was longer than the actual distance. For shiny objects, such as orange tree leaves, transparency film, and a stainless steel plate, the measurement distance was shorter than actual distance. At the measurement angle of 90 degrees, the difference between the longest and shortest measured distance (90% of the maximum scanner measurement distance) was 21.3 mm for the LMS200 and 29.7 mm for the URG-04LX. At the measurement angle of 45 degrees, this difference increased to 73.2 mm for the LMS200; the URG-04LX was not able to detect any objects at 45 degrees. The surface shapes of a cylindrical pipe, a folded cardboard plate with a square-shaped valley, and a folded cardboard plate with a V-shaped valley were well-depicted by the laser scanner. For the object with a V-shaped valley with a true depth of 6.1 cm, the averaged depths measured by the LMS200 and URG-04LX were 6.8 cm and 3.6 cm, respectively. The larger discrepancy in the URG-04LX depth measurement may be caused by the relatively lower angular resolution of the URG scanner, compared to that of the LMS scanner. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
