Design/methodology/approach - An electromagnetic macroscopic modelling of CNT is derived. The conduction electrons of the nanotube are considered as a 2D fluid moving on the surface representing the positive ion lattice. The linearized Euler's equation describing the fluid motion is used as a macroscopic constitutive relationship to be coupled to Maxwell's equation. A surface integral formulation coupled to the fluid model is solved numerically using a finite element method. For peculiar configurations, transmission line-like parameters of CNTs are derived. Findings - Single wall CNT interconnects, due to the high resistance and characteristic impedance with respect to ideally scaled silicon technology, should be used in arrays and bundles. Research limitations/implications - Only single wall CNTs are considered. Originality/value - The paper present a novel approach to CNTs and provides a comparison among the behaviour of CNTs with respect to ideally-scaled silicon technology.", "paper_title": "Electromagnetic models for metallic carbon nanotube interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000248369400002"}
