A thorough survey over more than 2 million Bangla words has revealed that there exist around 334 compound characters in Bangla script. Of which, only around 171 character classes form unique pattern shapes, and some of these classes are often written in multiple styles. Altogether, 55,278 isolated character images, belonging to 199 different pattern shapes, are collected using three different data collection modalities. The database is divided into training and test sets in 4:1 ratio for each pattern class, by considering a balanced distribution of shapes from different modalities. A convex hull and quadtree-based feature set has been designed, and the test set recognition performance is reported with the support vector machine classifier. We have achieved a recognition accuracy of 79.35 % on the test database consisting of 171 character classes. The complete compound character image database is freely available as CMATERdb 3.1.3.3 from the website http://code.google.com/p/cmaterdb/, which may facilitate research on handwritten character recognition, especially related to Bangla form document processing systems.", "paper_title": "A benchmark image database of isolated Bangla handwritten compound characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000345094500007"}
