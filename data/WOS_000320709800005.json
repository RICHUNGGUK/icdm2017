In the setting under study, a sender wishes to communicate a message to a receiver by transmitting a codeword x = (x(1), ... , x(n)) symbol-by-symbol over a communication channel. The adversarial jammer can view the transmitted symbols x(i) one at a time and can change up to a p-fraction of them. However, for each symbol x(i), the jammer's decision on whether to corrupt it or not (and on how to change it) must depend only on x(j) for j <= i. This is in contrast to the \"classical\" adversarial jammer which may base its decisions on its complete knowledge of x. More generally, for a delay parameter delta is an element of (0, 1), we study the scenario in which the jammer's decision on the corruption of x(i) must depend solely on x(j) for j <= i - delta n. In this study, the transmitted symbols are assumed to be over a sufficiently large field F. The sender and receiver do not share resources such as common randomness (though the sender is allowed to use stochastic encoding). We present a tight characterization of the amount of information one can transmit in both the 0-delay and, more generally, the delta-delay online setting. We show that for 0-delay adversaries, the achievable rate asymptotically equals that of the classical adversarial model. For positive values of delta, we consider two types of jamming: additive and overwrite. We also extend our results to a jam-or-listen online model, where the online adversary can either jam a symbol or eavesdrop on it. We present computationally efficient achievability schemes even against computationally unrestricted jammers.", "paper_title": "Codes Against Online Adversaries: Large Alphabets", "paper_id": "WOS:000320709800005"}
