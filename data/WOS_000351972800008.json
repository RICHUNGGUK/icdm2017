The method first partitions the dataset into groups of at least k records and then aggregates the group members. Generally, larger values of k provide lower Disclosure Risk (DR) at the expense of increasing Information Loss (IL). Therefore, the data publisher has to set appropriate microaggregation parameters to produce a protected and useful anonymized data. Unfortunately, in the most of the conventional microaggregation methods, the only available parameter of the algorithm, i.e., k does not enable the data publisher to effectively control the trade-off problem between DR and IL. This paper proposes a novel microaggregation method to optimize information loss and disclosure risk, simultaneously. The trade-off problem is expressed and solved within a multi-objective optimization framework. The data publisher can choose a more preferred protected dataset from a set of non-dominated candidate solutions, or even direct the method toward a desired point. Experimental results show that for a fixed value of k, the proposed method can usually produce more protected and useful datasets in comparison with the conventional methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
