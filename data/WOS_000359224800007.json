In this context, integrated circuits proved to be a viable solution with high associated nonrecurring costs and design risks. As an alternative, this article presents a fully autonomous and battery-less circuit solution for piezoelectric energy harvesting based on discrete components in a low-cost PCB technology, which achieves a comparable performance in a 32x43 mm(2) footprint. The power management circuit implements synchronous electric charge extraction (SECE) with a passive bootstrap circuit from fully discharged states. Circuit characterization showed that the circuit consumes less than 1 mu A with a 3V output and may achieve energy conversion efficiencies of up to 85%. In addition, the circuit is specifically designed for operating with input and output voltages up to 20V, which grants a significant flexibility in the choice of transducers and energy storage capacitors.", "paper_title": "A Sub-mu A Stand-By Current Synchronous Electric Charge Extractor for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting", "paper_id": "WOS:000359224800007"}
