The two experiments in this paper examine the mediating role of presence in a 3-D display as compared to a 2-D display with respect to commercials in a public environment. The results show that an autostereoscopic multiview 3-D display enhances the feelings of presence and produces a more positive brand attitude. Hence, autostereoscopic 3-D displays outperform 2-D displays for eye-catching outdoor advertising. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
