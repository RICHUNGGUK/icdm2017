Incorporating the visual saliency measure of a polygonal mesh into the normal enhancement operation, a novel saliency guided shading scheme for shape depiction is developed in this paper. Due to the visual saliency measure of the 3D shape, our approach will adjust the illumination and shading to enhance the geometric salient features of the underlying model by dynamically perturbing the surface normals. The experimental results demonstrate that our non-photorealistic shading scheme can enhance the depiction of the underlying shape and the visual perception of its salient features for expressive rendering. Compared with previous normal enhancement techniques, our approach can effectively convey surface details to improve shape depiction without impairing the desired appearance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
