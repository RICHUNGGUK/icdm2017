Balanced system design is critical for large scale cluster systems to achieve high efficiency. This paper addresses the practice on DeepComp high end computer systems toward a balanced system design. Methodologies of designing balanced large scale cluster systems are given. A method for balancing central processing unit (CPU) and memory hierarchy is addressed. For balancing computing nodes and I/O systems, two approaches are given: maximum bandwidth criterion and maximum number of computing nodes which can concurrently access I/O systems. Experiences of Lenovo high end cluster systems show that above methods are effective. Lenovo strategies toward a balanced system design for both peta and 10 peta scale high productivity computing systems (HPCSs).", "paper_title": "DeepComp: towards a balanced system design for high performance computer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000292505400007"}
