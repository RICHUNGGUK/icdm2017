A new indicator for academic journals, Effectiveness of Peer Review (EPR), is defined for evaluating the effectiveness of peer reviewing. If the assumption is valid, EPR could be a simple indicator of such effectiveness. In a sample experiment, 28 academic journals were tested, and the EPR indicator was able to reflect accurately the academic impact of those journals.", "paper_title": "A quantitative study on the effectiveness of peer review for academic journals", "paper_id": "WOS:000316046000001"}
