One of the most crucial challenges in this field is the design of Protocol Interoperability to achieve the integration of MANET routing protocols and Mobile IP into the IP routing systems. This problem has not been effectively addressed by researches published thus far. This paper contributes solutions to solving this challenge, The protocol architecture and protocol interfaces are designed, which are suitable for gateways and mobile nodes in such Internet integrated MANETs supporting Mobile IP. Propagation methods of Mobile IP signalling messages with MANET routing information piggybacking are designed. Finally, an enhanced Mobile IP protocol suitable for MANET system is contributed. In summary, the contribution of this paper is a thorough scheme for establishing an IP/MIP/MANET integrated system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
