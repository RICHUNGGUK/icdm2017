For practical value, the small format is of special interest. This leads to a combinatorial optimization problem which is unlikely solved in polynomial time. In this paper, we present a method called combining Gaussian eliminations to reduce the number of variables in this optimization problem and use heuristic ant colony algorithm to solve the problem. The results of experiments on 2 x 2 case show that our algorithm achieves significant performance gains. Extending this algorithm from 2 x 2 case to 3 x 3 case is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Ant Colony Optimization With Combining Gaussian Eliminations for Matrix Multiplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000317643500028"}
