Although TCP Veno shows remarkable performance improvement over legacy TCP, namely TCP Reno, Veno has not been utilized at its full potential. In this paper, we study the enhancement of TCP Veno with FACK (forward acknowledgement), called TCP Veno-F. The network simulation results show that, (1) TCP Veno-F improves TCP performance by better utilization of link bandwidth: (2) TCP Veno-F co-exists with legacy TCP harmoniously in the wired networks: (3) TCP Veno-F deals with a large range of network scenarios such as heterogeneous network, RED queue management.
