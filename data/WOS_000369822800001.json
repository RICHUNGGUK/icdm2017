Researching fuzzy rough sets under the framework of residuated lattices is one of the generalizations that broadens the truth values to lattices. This paper studies fuzzy variable precision approximation operators based on residuated lattices and presents the concept of L-fuzzy variable precision rough sets. After the presentation of this concept, we investigate the corresponding properties and some special classes of L-fuzzy variable precision rough sets based on different L-relations. Finally, we study the topological structures of L-fuzzy variable precision rough sets based on alpha-lower sets and alpha-upper sets, and conclude that the family of all alpha-lower exact L-sets and the family of all alpha-upper exact L-sets are L-topologies, for each alpha epsilon L.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy variable precision rough sets based on residuated lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000369822800001"}
