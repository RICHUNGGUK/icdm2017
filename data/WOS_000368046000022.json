The location of some mobile nodes needs to be computed precisely while this may not be essential for the remaining nodes. We have proposed the concept of graded precision localization which allows mobile nodes to localize themselves to heterogeneous precision levels in a common framework With graded precision localization, we define a modular node for the subjects, specify deployment strategies customizable for each site, and propose a framework for evaluating site-specific localization performance. We comprehensively evaluate graded precision localization with experiments and simulation for indoor conditions, and highlight its advantages over similar systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
