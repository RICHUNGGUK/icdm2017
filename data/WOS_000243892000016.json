In this paper, we shall propose a new multidimensional model that can manage imprecision in both dimensions and facts and hide the complexity to the end user. The multidimensional structure is therefore able to model data imprecision resulting from the integration of data from different sources or even information from experts, which it does by means of fuzzy logic.", "paper_title": "A new fuzzy multidimensional model", "paper_id": "WOS:000243892000016"}
