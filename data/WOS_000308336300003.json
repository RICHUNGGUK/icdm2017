Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual research framework is devised from a review of the literature, and case studies are used to investigate the manufacturing strategies and practices in place in the case companies. Data are collected through semi-structured interviews and secondary documentation. Findings - The results show that, with over-capacity in the Chinese bus manufacturing industry, success is no longer determined by high productivity or low price; a quick response to the customers' tailored demands is essential in a climate of fierce competition. The suggested best practices for time-based competitive advantages comprise building technical centers and post-doctoral research stations, applying modularity logic, adopting radio frequency identification (RFID), and optimizing processes by, for example, involving customers and integrating inbound and outbound logistics. Research limitations/implications - The research results are limited within the context of the bus manufacturing industry in China. Practical implications - The research results help both the practitioners and the researchers gain a better understanding of the practices of Chinese bus manufacturers from the perspective of time-based competitive advantage. The proposed strategies and best practices have the potential to improve the manufacturing performance of this type of manufacturer. Originality/value - This paper shows the big picture of manufacturing strategy and practice of bus manufacturers in the Chinese automobile industry. Furthermore, it presents a manufacturing strategy framework with best practice guidance to gain a time-based competitive advantage.", "paper_title": "Manufacturing strategies for time based competitive advantages", "paper_id": "WOS:000308336300003"}
