Thus their development has to take into account DW project actor requirements. While much recent research has been focused on the design of multidimensional conceptual models, only few works were done to develop models and tools to analyze them. Despite specificities (OLAP, historicization,...) of these requirements, most of the previous works used an E/R or UML schemas which do not allow designers to represent these specific principles. A main property of DW is that they are derived from existing data sources. Therefore, Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) processes from these sources to the DW are very useful to define a reliable DW. In this paper, we fill this gap by showing how to systematically derive a conceptual schema of actors requirements using a rule-based mechanism. We provide a conceptual model which tries to be close to user vision of data by extending an object-oriented multidimensional model. Hence, in the early step of DW engineering, designers can formalize actors requirements about information and ETL processes at the same time to make easier understandability, confrontation and validation by all DW actors.", "paper_title": "Towards multidimensional requirement design", "paper_id": "WOS:000241158200008"}
