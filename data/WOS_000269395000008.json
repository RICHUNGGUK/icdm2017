The intrinsic value functions have deduced for the cases of call option. Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing theory, new option pricing models are finally obtained respectively by solving complex integral problems. Furthermore, the relationship and the disparity on the option prices between the new options and the classical ones are discussed.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL BASED ON GENERAL LINEAR INVESTMENT STRATEGY (PART II: CALL OPTION)", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000008"}
