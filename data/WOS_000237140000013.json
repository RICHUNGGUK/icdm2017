It is difficult and burdensome work to unravel the functions of a protein by wet experiments only. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict protein functions by building a \"Protein Interaction Network Dictionary (PIND)\". This method deduces the protein functions by searching the most similar \"words\"(an anagram of functions in neighbor proteins on a protein-protein interaction graph) using global alignments. An evaluation of sensitivity and specificity shows that this PIND approach outperforms previous approaches such as Majority Rule and Chi-Square measure, and that it competes with the recently introduced Random Markov Model approach.", "paper_title": "Computational method for protein function prediction by constructing protein interaction network dictionary", "paper_id": "WOS:000237140000013"}
