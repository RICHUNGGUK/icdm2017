Known to be NP-complete, the MP problem has many applications. This paper introduces a Distance-based Information Preservation (DiBIP) Tree Crossover. Contrary to previous crossover operators, DiBIP uses a distance measure to characterize the semantic information of a phylogenetic tree and ensures the preservation of distance related properties between parents and offspring. The performance of DiBIP is assessed with a mimetic algorithm on a set of 28 benchmark instances from the literature. Comparisons with 3 state-of-the-art algorithms show very competitive results of the proposed approach with improvement of some previously best results found.", "paper_title": "A Distance-based Information Preservation Tree Crossover for the Maximum Parsimony problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400077"}
