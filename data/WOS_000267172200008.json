A set T of vertices of G is a twin dominating set of G if for every vertex v is an element of V \\ T, there exist u, w is an element of T (possibly u = w) such that arcs (u, v), (v, w) is an element of A. The twin domination number gamma* (G) of G is the cardinality of a minimum twin dominating set of G. In this paper we investigate the twin domination number in generalized de Bruijn digraphs G(B)(n, d). For the digraphs G(B)(n, d), we first establish sharp bounds on the twin domination number. Secondly, we give the exact values of the twin domination number for several types of G(B)(n, d) by constructing minimum twin dominating sets in the digraphs. Finally, we present sharp upper bounds for some special generalized de Bruijn digraphs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
