At present, the double quantification regarding precision and grade is a novel and valuable subject, but quantitative information fusion has become a key problem. Thus, this paper constructs the double-quantitative approximation space of precision and grade (PG-Approx-Space) and tackles the fusion problem using normal logical operations. It further conducts double-quantification studies on granular computing and rough set models. (1) First, for quantitative information organization and storage, we construct space and plane forms of PG-Approx-Space using the Cartesian product, and for quantitative information extraction and fusion, we establish semantics construction and semantics granules of PG-ApproxSpace. (2) Second, by granular computing, we investigate three primary granular issues: quantitative semantics, complete system and optimal calculation. Accordingly, six types of fundamental granules are proposed based on the semantic, microscopic and macroscopic descriptions; their semantics, forms, structures, calculations and relationships are studied, and the granular hierarchical structure is achieved. (3) Finally, we investigate rough set models in PG-Approx-Space. Accordingly, model regions are proposed by developing the classical regions, model expansion is systematically analyzed, some models are constructed as their structures are obtained, and a concrete model is provided. Based on the quantitative information architecture, this paper systematically conducts and investigates double quantification and establishes a fundamental and general exploration framework.
