This approach raises two problems. On the one hand, defining manually the agent's knowledge is a heavy and error-prone task that implies the intervention of the animator. On the other hand, the relationship between cognition and intelligence has not been theoretically nor experimentally proven so far. The ecological approaches provide a solution for these problems, by exploring the links between the creature, its body and its environment. Using an artificial life approach, we propose an original model of memory based on the synthesis of several neuroscience theories. The Cortexionist controller integrates cortex-like structure into a connectionist architecture in order to enhance the agent's adaptation in a dynamic environment, ultimately leading to the emergence of intelligent behaviour. Initial experiments presented in this paper prove the validity of the model.", "paper_title": "The Cortexionist architecture: behavioural intelligence of artificial creatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000276978800006"}
