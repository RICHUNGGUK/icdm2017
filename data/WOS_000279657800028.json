An approximation based on efficient importance sampling (EIS) is detailed. Monte Carlo experiments, based on widely used diffusion processes, evaluate its performance against an alternative importance sampling (IS) strategy, showing that EIS is at least equivalent, if not superior, while allowing a greater flexibility needed when examining more complicated models.
