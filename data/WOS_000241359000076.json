A supervised machine learning approach to associate low-level image features with their high level visual and/or semantic categories is investigated. For automatic image annotation, the input images are presented as a combined feature vector of texture, edge and shape features. A multi-class classifier based on pairwise coupling of several binary support vector machine is trained on these inputs to predict the categories of test images. For visual only retrieval, a combined feature vector of color, texture and edge features is utilized in low dimensional PCA sub-space. Based on the online category prediction of query and database images by the classifier, pre-computed category specific first and second order statistical parameters are utilized in a Bhattacharyya distance measure. Experimental results of both image annotation and retrieval are reported in this paper.", "paper_title": "Supervised machine learning based medical image annotation and retrieval in ImageCLEFmed 2005", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000076"}
