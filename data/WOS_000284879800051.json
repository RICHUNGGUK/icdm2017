We formulated a set of hypotheses which attempted to correlate traffic conditions with the ambient traffic noise. We present the evaluation of our hypotheses under various traffic conditions. Our threshold-based-classification yields 70-90% accuracy in distinguishing congested from free-flowing traffic.", "paper_title": "Road Traffic Estimation using In-situ Acoustic Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800051"}
