The key component of any QoS routing algorithm is the route discovery task, where a good route with sufficient radio resources needs to be found, and resource reservation needs to be performed in such a way that the end-to-end QoS requirements are satisfied. The route discovery essentially involves the link and path metric calculation, which depends on many factors such as the physical and link layer designs of the underlying wireless network and transmission errors due to channel fading and interference. The task of link metric calculation basically requires us to solve a tandem queuing problem, which is the focus of this paper. We present a unified tandem queue framework, which is applicable for many different physical layer designs. It considers the multirate transmission feature in the physical layer and automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol for error recovery in the link layer. We present both exact and approximated decomposition approaches. Using the queuing framework, we can derive different performance measures, namely, end-to-end loss rate, end-to-end average delay, and end-to-end delay distribution. The proposed decomposition approach is validated, and some interesting insights into the system performance are highlighted. We then present how we can use the decomposition queuing approach to calculate the link metric and incorporate this into the route discovery process of the QoS routing algorithm. The numerical results for the proposed QoS routing algorithm using the queuing framework are presented, and the impacts of different system and QoS parameters on network performance are investigated. The extension of the queuing and QoS routing framework to wireless networks with class-based queuing for QoS differentiation is also presented.", "paper_title": "Tandem queue models with applications to QoS routing in multihop wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256780400008"}
