In this study, computer-aided molecular modeling and docking techniques have been employed to simulate the theoretical mode of interaction between monoterpenes and Enterobacter cloacae nitroreductase. Enhancement of nitro drug potency in the presence of monoterpenes may be the result of modulation of nitroreductase activity. Binding nitroreductase with monoterpenes may decrease the efficient conversion of toxic reactive intermediates to final products lacking bactericidal activity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
