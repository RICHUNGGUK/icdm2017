An inherent drawback of these approaches is the computational cost of generating and assessing multiple clusterings of the data. In this paper we present an efficient prediction-based validation approach suitable for application to large, high-dimensional datasets such as text corpora. We use kernel clustering to isolate the validation procedure from the original data. Furthermore, we employ a prototype reduction strategy that allows us to work on a reduced kernel matrix, leading to significant computational savings. To ensure that this condensed representation accurately reflects the cluster structures in the data, we propose a density-biased strategy to select the reduced prototypes. This novel validation process is evaluated on real-world text datasets, where it is shown to consistently produce good estimates for the optimal number of clusters.", "paper_title": "Efficient prediction-based validation for document clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000060"}
