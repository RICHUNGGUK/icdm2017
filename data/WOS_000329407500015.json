This problem can be achieved by making use of the time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. However, solving this problem is not a trivial task because the TOA measurements have nonlinear relationships with the source location. This paper adopts an analog neural network technique, namely Lagrange programming neural network, to locate a mobile source. We also investigate the stability of the proposed neural model. Simulation results demonstrate that the mean-square error performance of our devised location estimator approaches the Cram,r-Rao lower bound in the presence of uncorrelated Gaussian measurement noise.", "paper_title": "Lagrange programming neural networks for time-of-arrival-based source localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500015"}
