Optimisation is conducted through maximisation of modal loss factors, using as design variables the viscoelastic core thickness, the constraining elastic layers ply thicknesses and orientation angles, as well as the position of co-located sensor and actuator pairs. Optimal results for passive damping are compared with an alternative optimisation model, based on 3D finite elements included in commercial package ABAQUS. Optimal location for sensor-actuator pairs is also presented and results are discussed. (C) 2010 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
