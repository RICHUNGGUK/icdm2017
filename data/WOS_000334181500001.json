This natural problem occurs in the context of systems analysis and verification. As an example application we discuss how our method can be used to compute template-based quadratic invariants for linear systems with guards. The focus of this article, however, lies on the discussion of the underlying theory and the properties of the algorithm itself.", "paper_title": "Numerical invariants through convex relaxation and max-strategy iteration", "paper_id": "WOS:000334181500001"}
