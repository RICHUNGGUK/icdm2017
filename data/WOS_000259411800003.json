It provides an overview of several application domains and an in-depth presentation of four specific case studies. The presented applications and deployment domains have been analyzed. The analysis indicates that despite strong industrial involvement in this field, the full potential of the agent technology has not been fully utilized yet and that not all of the developed agent concepts and agent techniques have been completely exploited in industrial practice. In the paper, the key obstacles for wider deployments are listed and potential future challenges are discussed.", "paper_title": "Industrial deployment of multi-agent technologies: review and selected case studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000259411800003"}
