For the decimation factor d - (p(m)+1)(p(m)+p-1)/p+1, the cross-correlation between the p-ary m-sequence {tr(1)(n)(alpha(t))] and its all decimated sequences {tr(1)(n)(alpha(dt+l))] is investigated, where 0 <= 1 < gcd(d, p(n)-1) and alpha is a primitive element of Fe. It is shown that the cross-correlation function takes values in {-1, -1 +/- ip(m) vertical bar i = 1,2,... p}. The result presented in this paper settles a conjecture proposed by Kim et al. in the 2012 IF.F.F International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings paper (pp.1014-1018), and also improves their result.", "paper_title": "Cross-Correlation between a p-Ary m-Sequence and Its All Decimated Sequences for d = (p(m)+1)(p(m)+p-1)/p+1", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738500006"}
