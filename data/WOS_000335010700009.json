In our proposed strategy, we consider both the node betweenness centrality (BC) and the shortest path length (L) as two important factors. The overall traffic capacity of a network system can be evaluated by the critical packet generating rate R-c. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can bring better traffic capacity and shorter average shortest path length than the low-degree-first (LDF) strategy and the low-betweenness-first (LBF) strategy. This work is helpful for designing and optimizing of realistic networks.", "paper_title": "Effective strategy of adding links for improving network transport efficiency on complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000335010700009"}
