This approach, called property-based re-representation is based on a new analysis of the structure of refinement graphs used in ILP and relational learning in general. This analysis allows the characterization of relational examples by a set of multi-relational patterns called properties. Using them, we perform a property-based re-representation of relational examples that facilitates the development of relational learning techniques. Additionally, we show the usefulness of re-representation with a collection of experiments in the context of nearest neighbor classification.", "paper_title": "Refinement-based disintegration: An approach to re-representation in relational learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000346283600004"}
