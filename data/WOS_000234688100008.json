A brief introduction presents the characteristics of today's manufacturing environment and the requirements for next generation manufacturing systems. Then, starting with considerations about the origins of the holonic concept and its first applications in manufacturing, the paper presents the advances made in applying the holonic concept to manufacturing systems area. Several considerations for the development of holonic manufacturing systems and specific holonic system requirements are discussed. As holonic concept is considered a solution for next generation manufacturing systems, there is a significant number of applications and implementations of the holonic concept in manufacturing systems domain. The most important and relevant approaches developed so far are presented. Finally, a short conclusion and future research directions in the area are provided", "paper_title": "Development and applications of holonic manufacturing systems: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000234688100008"}
