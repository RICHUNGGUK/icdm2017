The proposed solution explicitly addresses both the robot kinodynamic constraints and the geometric constraints due to obstacles while ensuring the suboptimal performance to a combined performance metric. In particular, the proposed design is based on a family of parameterized trajectories, which provides a unified way to embed the kinodynamic constraints, geometric constraints, and performance index into a set of parameterized constraint equations. To that end, the suboptimal solution to the constrained optimization problem can be analytically obtained. The solvability conditions to the constraint equations are explicitly established, and the proposed solution enhances the methodologies of real-time path planning for mobile robots with kinodynamic constraints. Both the simulation and experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A suboptimal and analytical solution to mobile robot trajectory generation amidst moving obstacles", "paper_id": "WOS:000354267000001"}
