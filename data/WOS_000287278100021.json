The applications in WMSNs have to focus on both energy saving and application-level quality of service (QoS). Due to the characteristics in WMSNs, such as resource constraints and variable channel capacity, efficiently achieving the application-level QoS in WMSNs is a challenging task. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we proposed a new kind of pattern named temporal region requesting pattern (TRRP) and a novel algorithm named TRRP-Mine for mining TRRPs efficiently. We also designed a temporal region requesting cost function of cache replacement, abbreviated as TRRC, for the cooperative caching multimedia content in WMSNs. Empirical evaluations under various simulation conditions showed that the proposed method delivers excellent performance in terms of hit rate and the number of replacements.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL CACHE REPLACEMENT ALGORITHM FOR COOPERATIVE CACHING IN WIRELESS MULTIMEDIA SENSOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287278100021"}
