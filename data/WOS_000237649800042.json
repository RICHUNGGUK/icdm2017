The proposed scheme only uses XOR and hash operations during group key updates. Moreover, the order of the total message size sent during key updates is O(log n), where n is the size of the group. As a result, our scheme is very practical, scalable, and well suited for low-power mobile devices. We have also proved the security of our proposed protocol.", "paper_title": "An efficient hierarchical group key management protocol for a ubiquitous computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800042"}
