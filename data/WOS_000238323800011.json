The authors combine cryptography with watermarking to simultaneously address the problems of protecting the owner's copyright and the legal customer's ownership. The authors propose a robust watermarking scheme based on visual cryptography and a watermarking protocol based on asymmetric cryptography. It is worthwhile to note that the proposed schemes are resistant to counterfeit, collusion, averaging, and copy attacks, while the large majority of robust watermarking schemes are not. Furthermore, the application of digital signature and timestamp makes public verification possible. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
