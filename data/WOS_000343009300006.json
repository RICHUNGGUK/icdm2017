Recently, Das pointed out the security flaws of Li and Hwang's three-factor remote user authentication scheme, and proposed an enhanced biometrics-based three-factor remote user authentication scheme. Das's scheme overcomes the defects of Li and Hwang's scheme, and maintains the advantages of Li and Hwang's scheme at the same time. However, after detailed analysis, we find that Das's scheme remains vulnerable to forgery attack and stolen smart card attack; at the same time, Das's scheme cannot provide the session key agreement after the mutual authentication. To provide more security features, we design a three-factor remote user authentication scheme with key agreement using biometrics.
