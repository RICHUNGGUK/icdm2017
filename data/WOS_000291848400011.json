This kernel system denoting recursively defined objects occurs in several contexts, e.g. it is the framework of recursive types, with F as the function type constructor. For general signatures, this rewriting system is widely used to represent and manipulate infinite regular trees. The main concern of this paper is the convertibility relation for mu-terms as given by the mu-rule, in particular, its decidability. This relation is sometimes called weak mu-equality, in contrast with strong mu-equality, which is given by the equality of the possibly infinite tree unwinding of mu-terms. While strong equality has received much attention, the opposite is the case for weak mu-equality. We present three alternative proofs for decidability of weak mu-equality. The first two proofs build upon an ingenious proof method of Cardone and Coppo. Prior to that, we prepare the way by an analysis of alpha-conversion. We then give a decidability proof in an 'alpha-free' manner, essentially treating mu-terms as first-order terms, and next, a proof in higher-order style, employing alpha-equivalence classes and viewing R(mu) as a higher-order rewriting system. The third decidability proof is also derived in an alpha-free manner, exploiting the regular nature of the set of mu-reducts, enabling an appeal to the theory of tree automata. We conclude with additional results concerning decidability of reachability, and upward-joinability of mu-reduction, and of convertibility by alpha-free mu-reduction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
