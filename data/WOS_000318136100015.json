In all areas of robot work space, image distortion occurs due to imperfect lens curvatures, which in turn induces an inaccurate vision guidance. Non-uniform nature of image distortion is effectively rectified, using the Kalman Filtering technique. Consequently, the robotic positioning accuracy is significantly improved. In recent years, stringent quality standards and intense competition compelled many companies to adopt new, advanced technologies to further enhance their strategic competitiveness. EQM is an emergent technology better suited for today's fast-changing, zero-defect production environment. The proposed methodology has great potential for improving the product quality and operational efficiency of networked robotic production system, which has been vindicated by the statistical analysis.
