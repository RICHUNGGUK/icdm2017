The most important design considerations of MILMON are energy consumption, delay, scalability, and fault tolerance. There are three main components of the system: a new time synchronization schema based on the sink with a high range transmitter, hr-FTSP; data indicator slot mechanism, DISM; and a new distributed time-scheduling mechanism ft_DTSM. An analytic and simulation model has shown that energy consumption and delay performance of the newly proposed system is better than most of the existing WSN systems. Although there may be other architectures which perform better than our system for certain performance metrics, MILMON can operate with a good balance on energy consumption, delay, and fault tolerance.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient, Delay Sensitive, Fault Tolerant Wireless Sensor Network for Military Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000274753300006"}
