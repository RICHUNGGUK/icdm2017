We focus on general, non-uniform versions of message exchange problems in asynchronous systems with a linear cost model and messages of arbitrary sizes. We extend previous complexity results to show that the general asynchronous problems are NP-complete. We present several heuristics and determine which algorithms are best suited to several parallel systems. We propose new algorithms that combine the advantages of some of the heuristics. We conclude with experiments and simulations of the algorithms and analyses of their performances. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
