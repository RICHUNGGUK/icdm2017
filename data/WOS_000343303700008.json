An H-2 criterion of the error signal and the signal of the input channel are used as a measure for the tracking performance. A code scheme is introduced as a means of integrating controller and channel design to obtain the optimal tracking performance. It is shown that the optimal tracking performance index consists of two parts, one depends on the non-minimum phase zeros and zero direction of the given plant, as well as the reference input signal, while the other depends on the unstable poles and pole direction of the given plant, as well as on the bandwidth and additive white noise of a communication channel. It is also shown that when the communication does not exist, the optimal tracking performance reduces to the existing normal tracking performance of the control system. The results show how the optimal tracking performance is limited by the bandwidth and additive white noise of the communication channel. A typical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Optimal tracking performance of MIMO control systems with communication constraints and a code scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303700008"}
