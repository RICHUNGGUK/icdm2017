Such an approach has the advantage of requiring no modification on the client software/hardware compared to other load-balancing techniques. However, its applicability is undermined by the problems of AP service cheating and AP service loophole resulted from coverage adjustment, which significantly affect the AP service availability. Nevertheless, these two problems are largely ignored by the existent research. To tackle this challenge, a variable polyhedron genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed, which not only provides an AP service availability guarantee but also yields a near-optimal beacon range for each AP when the number of evolutions is large enough. Simulation study indicates that our algorithm is superior over the default 802.11 AP association model in terms of load-balancing and network throughput enhancement. In addition, the variable polyhedron GA outperforms the traditional GA in terms of fitness value and convergence speed.", "paper_title": "Coverage adjustment for load balancing with an AP service availability guarantee in WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000332986800009"}
