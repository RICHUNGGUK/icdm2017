The method consists of two \"independent\" parts: the time evolution of the RMHD equations and the mesh iteration redistribution. In the first part, the RMHD equations are solved on a fixed quadrangular mesh by using a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme. The second part is an iterative procedure. In each iteration, the mesh points are first redistributed, and then the cell averages of the conservative variables are remapped onto the new mesh in a conservative way. Several numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
