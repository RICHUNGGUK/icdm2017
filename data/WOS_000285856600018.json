The determination of the deployment quality is hindered by various factors that cause coverage holes, such as the existence of jammers and destruction of sensors. This paper presents an analytical deployment quality measure in terms of network parameters, including the sensor count, sensing coverage, coverage hole count, coverage hole area size and deployment area size. Assuming a random deployment model for both sensors and holes, our method determines the probability of detection of a target following a linear trajectory by a single sensor and generalizes it to derive the probability of detection in a network with coverage holes. The overall probability of detection is used as the network quality measure and is proposed as a suitable metric under sensor loss assumptions. The proposed deployment quality metric (DQM) is based on the shortest path strategy to provide a conservative estimation for the intruder detection performance. We show that it provides a good estimation of the actual deployment quality with given coverage hole and jamming area properties. Our metric is suitable for real life and simulation scenarios and is computationally inexpensive compared to both simulation based and distributed quality measurements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
