Accommodating new knowledge in domain ontology causes the ontology to change from one consistent state to another. This consequently makes existing mappings among ontologies unreliable and stale due to the changes in resources. Mapping evolution eliminates discrepancies in the existing mappings. The proposed approach offers the benefits of re-establishing mappings among the updated ontologies in less time than is required with existing systems. It only considers the changed resources and eliminates staleness from the mappings. This approach uses the change history to drastically reduce the time required for reconciling mappings among ontologies, as shown in the results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
