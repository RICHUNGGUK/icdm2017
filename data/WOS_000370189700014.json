In this paper, a new fuzzy disturbance observer (FDO) is proposed into the SOS-based approach, where the polynomial fuzzy model is used to develop the system controller. Compared with other works published so far, the FDO mainly features two things: 1) the estimation error between the FDO and disturbance shrinks asymptotically to zero if the disturbance has a constant steady-state value; 2) parameters involved in the FDO is adjusted on the basis of the polynomial fuzzy model which is basically nonlinear. Finally, computer simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Polynomial Controller Design Using Disturbance Observer", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189700014"}
