The resulting spherical code can be the image of a lattice restricted to a specific box in R-L in each layer. Group structure and homogeneity, useful for efficient storage and decoding, are inherited from the underlying lattice codebook. A systematic method for constructing such codes are presented as well some examples of constructions. Upper and lower bounds on the performance, the asymptotic packing density and a method for decoding are derived.", "paper_title": "Constructive Spherical Codes on Layers of Flat Tori", "paper_id": "WOS:000324573500032"}
