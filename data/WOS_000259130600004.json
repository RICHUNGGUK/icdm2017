The Takagi and Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to represent a discrete-time nonlinear system with state delay. Based on a non-parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. a new fuzzy LKF is first constructed to derive a delay-dependent condition such that the closed-loop fuzzy system is asymptotically stable and satisfies a prescribed level of H-infinity disturbance attenuation. In the derivation process, two free fuzzy weighting matrices are introduced to express the relationship between the present state and delay state. Then, a novel linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is proposed for the design of a delay-dependent H-infinity fuzzy observer-based controller. The control and observer matrices can be solved directly by using the existing LMI optimization techniques. Finally. a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
