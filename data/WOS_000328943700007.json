The interface includes data and metadata (control and context) packets. The control and context packets describe the entire rf front end. The proposed description has a hierarchical structure and is a hardware abstraction. the interface supports advanced architectures such as sdr clouds. The metadata packets can be represented using formal, computer-processable semantics.", "paper_title": "AN OPEN RF-DIGITAL INTERFACE FOR SOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000328943700007"}
