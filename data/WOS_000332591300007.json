Due to a trade-off between cost, performance, and reliability, radiation hardened PLL design need robust strategy. Thus, evaluation of radiation vulnerability is important to choose the robust strategy. The conventional evaluation-method is however based on brute-force analysis - SPICE simulation and experiment. The presented analysis result eliminates the brute-force analysis in evaluation of the radiation vulnerability. A set of equations enables to predict the radiation-induced clock-perturbation at the every sub-circuits. From a demonstration, the most vulnerable nodes have been found, which are validated using a PLL fabricated with 0.18 mu m CMOS process.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Radiation-Induced Clock-Perturbation in Phase-Locked Loop", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300007"}
