In this paper we provide a framework for analyzing the average case complexity of these algorithms taking into account the statistical dependencies between overlapping q-grams. We apply this to the q-gram Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm adapted to various string matching problems and show that the algorithm is optimal on average. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
