PSXCS uses a history-window approach, but with novel efficiency since the subordinate XCSs, which employ the windows, are only spawned for parts of the state space that are actually aliased. However, because the window lengths are finite and set manually, PSXCS may fail to be optimal in difficult test mazes. This paper introduces Recursive PSXCS (RPSXCS) that automatically spawns windows wherever more history is required. Experimental results show that RPSXCS is both more powerful and learns faster than PSXCS. The present research suggests new potential for history approaches to partially observable environments.", "paper_title": "A Recursive Classifier System for Partially Observable Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000273197900002"}
