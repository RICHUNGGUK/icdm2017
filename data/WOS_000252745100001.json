We propose a methodology based on the construction of real-valued scoring functions. We study empirical risk minimization of dedicated statistics which involve empirical quantiles of the scores. We first state the problem of finding the best instances which can be cast as a classification problem with mass constraint. Next, we develop special performance measures for the local ranking problem which extend the Area Under an ROC Curve (AUC) criterion and describe the optimal elements of these new criteria. We also highlight the fact that the goal of ranking the best instances cannot be achieved in a stage-wise manner where first, the best instances would be tentatively identified and then a standard AUC criterion could be applied. Eventually, we state preliminary statistical results for the local ranking problem.", "paper_title": "Ranking the best instances", "paper_id": "WOS:000252745100001"}
