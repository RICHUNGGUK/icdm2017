Good agreement is obtained between the simulated and measured results for a 130 nm MOSFET in the frequency range of 100 MHz-40 GHz confirming the validity and effectiveness of our approach. In addition, higher accuracy is achieved by our approach in contrast to conventional empirical model. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
