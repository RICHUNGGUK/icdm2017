This paper presents a new analytic approach to representing the relationship between these two characteristics by extending a multi-dimensional approach for predicting resilience into a technique for fitting the resilience function to the preferences and priorities of a given decision maker. This allows for a more accurate representation of the perceived value of different resilience scenarios to that individual, and thus makes the concept more relevant in the context of strategic decision making.
