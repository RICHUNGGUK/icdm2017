In this paper, we devise a self-organized mechanism for cooperation policy setting of the interacting peers based on decision-theoretic analysis. By extensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate that when the proposed mechanism is followed, a Pareto optimal equilibrium emerges in the system from fairly coordinated decisions of the rational peers on their cooperation policies.", "paper_title": "A Self-organized Mechanism of Resource Allocation in P2P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000311119400012"}
