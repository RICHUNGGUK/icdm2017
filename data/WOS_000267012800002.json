This paper describes the key information extraction (IE) challenges that we have run into, and sketches our solutions. We discuss in particular developing a declarative IE language, optimizing for this language, generating IE provenance, incorporating user feedback into the IE process, developing a novel wiki-based user interface for feedback, best-effort IE, pushing IE into RDBMSs, and more. Our work suggests that IE in managing unstructured data can open up many interesting research challenges, and that these challenges can greatly benefit from the wealth of work on managing structured data that has been carried out by the database community.", "paper_title": "Information Extraction Challenges in Managing Unstructured Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000267012800002"}
