These models are based on Self-Organizing Map (SOM) yielding to a Spatio-Temporel Organization Map (STOM). More precisely, the map is trained using two different spatio-temporal algorithms taking their roots in biological researches: The ST-Kohonen and the Time-Organized Map (TOM). These algorithms use two kinds of spatio-temporal data coding. The first one is based on the domain of complex numbers, while the second is based on the ISI (Inter Spike Interval). STOM is experimented in the field of speech recognition in order to evaluate its performance for such time variable application and to prove that biological models are capable of giving good results as stochastic and hybrid ones.", "paper_title": "Comparison between two spatio-temporal organization maps for speech recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241011900002"}
