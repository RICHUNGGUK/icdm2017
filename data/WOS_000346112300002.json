Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted among the users who had experience of participating in a domain knowledge specific online community. A total of 479 valid observations were collected. Structural equation modeling was used to test the research model and hypotheses. Findings - The empirical results show that the fundamental interaction (FI) not only directly affects users' knowledge acquisition (KA) and contribution, but also indirectly affects users' KA and contribution partially through the users' self-efficacy and outcome expectation. While the supplemental interaction (SI) negatively affects users' KA, it positively affects the users' knowledge contribution and this effect is also partially mediated by the users' self-efficacy and outcome expectation. The mediators of self-efficacy and outcome expectation play distinct role on users' KA and contribution in virtual communities (VCs). Originality/value - This research conceptualizes the users' interaction inside and outside of a particular virtual community as FI and SI, respectively, and reveals the mechanism how they affect users' KA and contribution. The results shed light on the literature of KS in VCs and extend social cognitive theory's application into a complex environment with blended interactions in a virtual world. The research also provides insights for virtual community designers, administrators and users.", "paper_title": "How fundamental and supplemental interactions affect users' knowledge sharing in virtual communities?
