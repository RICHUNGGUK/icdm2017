Due to the distributed, multi-hop nature of these networks, as well as limited network resource, wireless capacity and random mobility of nodes, Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning faces severe challenges, especially in multicast scenarios. Resource admission control is one of the most effective methods for resource utilization and QoS guaranteed. In this paper, we combine resource admission control technologies and intelligent methods, propose a fuzzy decision-based resource admission control mechanism for MANETs (FAST), which can fast respond to dynamic topology changes and unstable link status. FAST also supports multicast and destination heterogeneity. Users can choose multiple evaluation parameters with different weights of services in fuzzy decision. Simulation results have proved the efficiency of the mechanism.", "paper_title": "FAST: Fuzzy Decision-Based Resource Admission Control Mechanism for MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000311028300007"}
