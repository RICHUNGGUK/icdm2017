Although the conventional direct BEM has limitations when dealing with thin-body problems, this model overcomes that difficulty. It is formulated in the frequency domain and, taking into account the 2-1/2D configuration of the problem, can be expressed in terms of waves with varying wavenumbers in the z direction, k(z). The elastic medium is homogeneous and unbounded and it should be noted that no restrictions are imposed on the geometry and orientation of the internal crack. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
