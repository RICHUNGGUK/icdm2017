The work assumes the use of the standard IEEE 802.15.4 as wireless control field bus. Throughout the paper different network topologies are analyzed together with the network management algorithms. As a result of this analysis the tree topology is selected and experimentally verified as the most suitable for the vertical transportation system.", "paper_title": "NETWORK MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS FOR WIRELESS FIELD BUS CONTROL OF VERTICAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272111400011"}
