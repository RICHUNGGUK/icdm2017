An optimal reference view selection is first proposed. The paper further includes three modified parts for the DIBRed pixels. First, the missing 1-to-1 pixels are concealed by the pixels from another view. The light differences between views are taken care of by the information of the motion vector of the projected coordination and a reverse DIBR procedure. Second, the generation of the many-to-1 pixels is improved via their depth information. Third, the hole pixels are found using the estimated motion vectors derived efficiently from a weighted function of the neighboring available motion vectors and their distance to the target hole pixel. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art method, the combined system of the four proposed methods is superior and improves the performance by 5.53 dB at maximum.
