Among these effects, sleep disorders, stress, and degradation of school performance are the most frequent. A common reason behind these effects seems to be related with the disruption of the normal relationships and the lack of contact with the different social groups that the children belong to (family, friends, school, etc.). In this paper we present results of the DESEOS research project, which applies the Ambient Assisting Living paradigm to increase the quality of life of health cared children by developing novel devices and applications to enhance the contact with their different daily environments. Security and dependability are central aspects in these scenarios, and consequently are central to the DESEOS solutions. In particular, this paper presents how DESEOS provides a secure solution for one of the project scenarios.", "paper_title": "Security-enhanced ambient assisted living supporting school activities during hospitalisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209331700001"}
