We not only show that the constructed FNNs can approximate any f is an element of L-p[a, b] (1 <= p < +infinity) arbitrarily in the L-p metric as long as the number of hidden nodes is sufficiently large, but also reveal the relation among the approximation speed, the number of hidden nodes and the smoothness of the target function to be approximated by designing a novel method, which is originated from the Steklov mean function and the modulus of smoothness of f. The obtained results are helpful in studying the problem of approximation complexity of FNNs in the L-p metric. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
