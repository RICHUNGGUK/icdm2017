The teams spontaneously created a variety of artifacts to hold and organize problem information, and practices to simplify and regularize their collaborative interactions around these artifacts. In this paper, we analyze the artifacts and practices as a potential source of insight into how this problem solving activity could be supported by an interactive system design. (C) 2013 The Authors.
