Deployment of applications, composed of application components and services available in a distributed, heterogeneous environment, highly increased the complexity of systems offering complete, collaborative, continuous, and constraint-free solutions. The aim of this article is to present a model of complex services composed of atomic services available in different versions and offered in a heterogeneous environment. The purpose of the introduced model is to provide a framework to analyze access limitations, services costs, security, and resource constraints, i.e., tasks that must be proactively monitored and resolved in distributed, networked systems. The introduced model is applied to formulate a complex services selection and optimization tasks taking into account different strategies assuring quality of services.", "paper_title": "MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION OF COMPLEX SERVICES IN SERVICE-BASED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271508400005"}
