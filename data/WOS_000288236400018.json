In this work, based on a dataset composed of 102 tricyclic piperazine/piperidine furnished dual alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(IIb)beta(3) antagonists, a variety of in silico modeling approaches including the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), comparative similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA), and molecular docking were applied to reveal the requisite 3D structural features impacting the biological activities. Our statistical results show that the ligand-based 3D-QSAR models for both the alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(IIb)beta(3) studies exhibited satisfactory internal and external predictability, i.e., for the CoMFA models, results of Q(2) = 0.48, R-ncv(2) = 0.87, R-pred(2) = 0.71 for alpha(v)beta(3) and Q(2) = 0.50, R-ncv(2) = 0.85, R-pred(2) = 0.72 for alpha(IIb)beta(3) analysis were obtained, and for the CoMSIA ones, the outcomes of Q(2) = 0.55, R-ncv(2) = 0.90, R-pred(2) = 0.72 for alpha(v)beta(3) and Q(2) = 0.52, R-ncv(2) = 0.88, R-pred(2) = 0.74 for alpha(IIb)beta(3) were achieved respectively. In addition, through a comparison between 3D-QSAR contour maps and docking results, it is revealed that that the most crucial interactions occurring between the tricyclic piperazine/piperidine derivatives and alpha(v)beta(3)/alpha(IIb)beta(3) receptor ligand binding pocket are H-bonding, and the key amino acids impacting the interactions are Arg214, Asn215, Ser123, and Lys253 for alpha(v)beta(3), but Arg214, Asn215, Ser123 and Tyr190 for alpha(IIb)beta(3) receptors, respectively. Halogen-containing groups at position 15 and 16, benzene sulfonamide substituent at position 23, and the replacement of piperazine with 4-aminopiperidine of ring B may increase the alpha(v)beta(3)/alpha(IIb)beta(3) antagonistic activity. The potencies for antagonists to inhibit isolated alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(IIb)beta(3) are linear correlated, indicating that similar interaction mechanisms may exist for the series of molecules. To our best knowledge this is the first report on 3D-QSAR modeling of these dual alpha(v)beta(3)/alpha(IIb)beta(3) antagonists. The results obtained should provide information for better understanding of the mechanism of antagonism and thus be helpful in design of novel potent dual alpha(v)beta(3)/alpha(IIb)beta(3) antagonists.
