In this paper, we propose novel reversible data hiding scheme that can embed high capacity of secret bits and recover image after data extraction. Our proposed scheme depends on the locally adaptive coding scheme (LAC) as Chang&Nguyen's scheme and SMVQ scheme. Experimental results show that the compression rate of our proposed scheme is 0.33 bpp on average. To embed secret bits we propose the normal-hiding scheme and the over-hiding scheme which have an average embedding rate of 2.01 bpi and 3.01 bpi, more than that of Chang&Nguyen's scheme (1.36 bpi). The normal-hiding scheme and the over-hiding scheme also has high embedding efficiency of 0.28 and 0.36 on average, which are better than that of Chang&Kieu's scherrie (0.12), Chang&Nguyen's scheme (0.18) and Chang&Nguyen's scheme (0.16).
