As network equipment advances to provide improved bandwidth service, security service becomes the more critical problem. However, RSVP doesn't provide a flexible mechanism to support quality of security service (QoSS). Security service RSVP extends RSVP to provide the needed mechanism for dynamically negotiating QoSS among the senders and receivers of multicast applications on the Internet. SSRSVP provides different QoSS resolutions according to receiver nodes' security service needs.", "paper_title": "Extending RSVP for quality of security service", "paper_id": "WOS:000235736000007"}
