However, the widespread deployment of P2P networks are hindered by several issues, especially the ones that influence end-user satisfaction, including reliability. In this paper, we propose a solution for an efficient and user-oriented keyword lookup service on P2P networks. The proposed mechanism has been designed to achieve reliability via index load balancing and address the scalability issues of extremely popular keywords in the index. The system performance have been analytically derived as well implemented using the OpenDHT framework on PlanetLab.", "paper_title": "On index load balancing in scalable P2P media distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000239559600007"}
