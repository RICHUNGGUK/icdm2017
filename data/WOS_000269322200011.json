Electrochemical techniques are powerful tools for evaluating the steel behavior in cementitious materials in laboratory and in the field. However, the number and frequency of measurements, and their accuracy are always a challenge for researchers and engineers. In this project, a measurement unit and a flexible program has been developed with LabVIEW 6.1 to allow automated measurements using a variety of electrochemical techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
