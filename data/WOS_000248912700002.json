A novel control method is given by using the Lyapunov functional method and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Several delay-independent and delay-dependent sufficient conditions are then further derived to ensure the global asymptotical stability in mean square for the uncertain stochastic recurrent neural networks, and the estimation gains can also be obtained. Numerical examples are constructed to verify the theoretical analysis in this paper.", "paper_title": "Robust control of uncertain stochastic recurrent neural networks with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000248912700002"}
