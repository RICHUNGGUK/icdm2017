The purpose of this study is to identify efficient sets of simple yet effective shape features, employed in the original and multi-scaled spectral representations of the boundary, for the characterization of the mammographic mass. These new methods of mass boundary representation and processing in more than one domain greatly improve the information content of the base data that is used for pattern classification purposes, introducing comprehensive spectral and multi-scale wavelet versions of the original boundary signals. The evaluation is conducted against morphological and diagnostic characterization of the mass, using statistical methods, fractal dimension analysis and a wide range of classifier architectures. Methods and materials: This study consists of (a) the investigation of the original radial distance measurements under the complete spectrum of signal analysis, (b) the application of curve feature extractors of morphological characteristics and the evaluation of the discriminative power of each one of them, by means of statistical significance analysis and dataset fractal dimension, and (c) the application of a wide range of classifier architectures on these morphological datasets, in order to conduct a comparative evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of all architectures, for mammographic mass characterization. Radial distance signal was exploited using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as additional carrier signals. Seven uniresolution feature functions were applied over these carrier signals and multiple shape descriptors were created. Classification was conducted against mass shape type and clinical diagnosis, using a wide range of linear and non-linear classifiers, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), least-squares minimum distance (LSMD), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), radial basis function (RBF) and multi-layered perceptron (MLP) neural networks (NN), and support vector machines (SVM). Fractal analysis was employed as a dataset analysis tool in the feature selection phase. The discriminative power of the features produced by this composite analysis is subsequently analyzed by means of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and tested against two distinct classification targets, namely (a) the morphological shape type of the mass and (b) the histologically verified clinical diagnosis for each mammogram. Results: Statistical analysis and classification results have shown that the discrimination value of the features extracted from the DWT components and especially the DFT spectrum, are of great importance. Furthermore, much of the information content of the curve features in the case of DFT and DWT datasets is directly related to the texture and fine-scale details of the corresponding envelope signal of the spectral components. Neural classifiers outperformed all other methods (SVM not used because they are mainly two-class classifiers) with overall success rate of 72.3% for shape type identification, while SVM achieved the overall highest 91.54% for clinical diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis has been employed to present the sensitivity and specificity of the results of this study. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
