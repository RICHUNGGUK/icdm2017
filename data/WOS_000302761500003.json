To explore whether Facebook provides opportunities for new literacy practices through text-making, the research considers how teenagers use the site to present themselves and 'do friendship'. Continuities of the teenagers' interactions were traced across the domains of school, home and Facebook and were found to reflect both 'traditional' and new ways of self presenting and of 'doing friendship'.
