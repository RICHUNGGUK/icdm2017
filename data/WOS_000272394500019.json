We calculated correlation values between the inputs and the outputs as a function of the RF size and intensities of the random components in photoreceptors and the MP neurons. We show the existence of \"optimal noise intensities\" of the MP neurons under the non-identical photoreceptors and \"nonzero optimal RF sizes.\" which indicated that optimal correlation values of this SR model were determined by two critical parameters; noise intensities (well-known) and RF sizes as a new parameter.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Resonance in an Array of Locally-Coupled McCulloch-Pitts Neurons with Population Heterogeneity", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394500019"}
