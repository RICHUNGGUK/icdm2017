Pipe deterioration is a physical manifestation of the aging process in which many factors can contribute to structural failure. Various technologies/techniques have been developed during the last few years to inspect/monitor piping systems, but how to intelligently interpret the collected data remains a challenge. In this paper, a new approach based on hierarchical evidential reasoning is proposed. This approach uses Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory to make inferences for condition assessment of buried pipes. A hierarchical evidential reasoning model can help combine different distress indicators (bodies of evidence) at different hierarchical levels using D-S rule of combination. The proposed hierarchical evidential reasoning method is demonstrated with an example of condition assessment for a large diameter pipe. Information from multiple sources is fused to obtain a more reliable assessment of pipe deterioration.", "paper_title": "Condition assessment of buried pipes using hierarchical evidential reasoning model", "paper_id": "WOS:000253392500006"}
