To mitigate artificial plasticity, we maintain a simulation mesh in both the current state and the rest shape, and store plastic offsets only to represent the non-embeddable portion of the plastic deformation. To maintain high element quality in a tetrahedral mesh undergoing gross changes, we use a dynamic meshing algorithm that attempts to replace as few tetrahedra as possible, and thereby limits the visual artifacts and artificial diffusion that would otherwise be introduced by repeatedly remeshing the domain from scratch. Our dynamic mesher also locally refines and coarsens a mesh, and even creates anisotropic tetrahedra, wherever a simulation requests it. We illustrate these features with animations of elastic and plastic behavior, extreme deformations, and fracture.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Local Remeshing for Elastoplastic Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000279806600021"}
