An infinite word on Sigma induces a non-homogeneous Markov chain (NHMC) on S. In the context of finite homogeneous Markov chains, a state s is recurrent if with probability one a run initialized on s visits s infinitely often. Equivalently, s is recurrent if with probability one, the proportion of time a run initialized on s spends on s converges to a non-zero limit. In this paper we introduce two natural notions of recurrence for non-homogeneous Markovian processes: a state s is weakly recurrent (resp. strongly recurrent) if with positive probability the process visits s infinitely often (resp. spends a non-zero proportion of time on s). These notions do not coincide in the context of NHMCs, and we study the related computational problem on FPTs: given an FPT and a state s, is there w is an element of Sigma(infinity) such that s is weakly (resp. strongly) recurrent for the associated NHMC? We prove that the strong recurrence problem is PSPACE-complete, along with other complexity results, which contrast with previous results which showed for instance the undecidability of the weak recurrence problem.
