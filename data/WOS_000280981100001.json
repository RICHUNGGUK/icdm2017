Most previous studies have interpreted push-pull test data using approximate analytical solutions to estimate (generally first-order) reaction rate coefficients. Though useful, these analytical solutions may not be able to describe important complexities in rate data. This paper reports the development of a multi-species, radial coordinate numerical model (PPTEST) that includes the effects of sorption, reaction lag time and arbitrary reaction order kinetics to estimate rates in the presence of mixing interfaces such as those created between injected \"push\" water and native aquifer water. The model has the ability to describe an arbitrary number of species and user-defined reaction rate expressions including Monod/Michelis-Menten kinetics. The FORTRAN code uses a finite-difference numerical model based on the advection-dispersion-reaction equation and was developed to describe the radial flow and transport during a push-pull test. The accuracy of the numerical solutions was assessed by comparing numerical results with analytical solutions and field data available in the literature. The model described the observed breakthrough data for tracers (chloride and iodide-131) and reactive components (sulfate and strontium-85) well and was found to be useful for testing hypotheses related to the complex set of processes operating near mixing interfaces.
