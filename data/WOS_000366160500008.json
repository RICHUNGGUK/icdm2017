Indeed, in a single machine, hundred of events occur per minute, produced and logged by the operating system and various software. Therefore, the identification of evidence, and more generally, the reconstruction of past events is a tedious and time-consuming task for the investigators. Our work aims at reconstructing and analysing automatically the events related to a digital incident, while respecting legal requirements. To tackle those three main problems (volume, heterogeneity and legal requirements), we identify seven necessary criteria that an efficient reconstruction tool must meet to address these challenges. This paper introduces an approach based on a three-layered ontology, called ORD2I, to represent any digital events. ORD2I is associated with a set of operators to analyse the resulting timeline and to ensure the reproducibility of the investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
