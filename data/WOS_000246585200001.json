The present paper aims at providing an overview of applications of dioid and semiring structures, stressing links with Fuzzy Sets and emphasizing linear algebraic problems (solving linear systems, computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors), non-classical path-finding problems (using algebras of endomorphisms) and connections between dioid structure and nonlinear analysis (in view of solving problems in Mathematical Physics).
