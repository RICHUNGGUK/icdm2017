ROC analysis determined the optimal RFAC cut-off values for detecting regional ischemic injury. This approach was tested on 18 MI and 10 sham mice. Automated regional LV motion interpretation and bull's eye display allowed non-invasive localization of the induced infarction. Possible applications to future studies assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments or regenerative medicine are expected. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
