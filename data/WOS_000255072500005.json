Lookahead is considered to improve the competitiveness of online deterministic strategies. For preemption-restart model, we will prove a lower bound of ([LD] + 2)/([LD] + 1) for the case where LD >= 1 and 3/2 for the case where 0 <= LD < 1, in which LD is the length of time segment that online strategies can foresee at any time. For non-preemptive model, we mainly present a greedy strategy that has an optimal competitive ratio of 3/2 when 1 <= LD < 2 while its competitive ratio is bounded from above by 4/3 as LD goes larger.
