We say that C is asymptotically good if, for some epsilon > 0 and for all i is an element of Z > 0, we have n(i) >= i and min(k(i)/n(i), d(i)/n(i)) = epsilon. Sequences of asymptotically good codes exist. We prove that if C is a class of GF(p(n))-linear codes (where p is prime and n = 1), closed under puncturing and shortening, and if C contains an asymptotically good sequence, then C must contain all GF(p)-linear codes. Our proof relies on a powerful new result from matroid structure theory.", "paper_title": "On the Existence of Asymptotically Good Linear Codes in Minor-Closed Classes", "paper_id": "WOS:000350160400001"}
