To the best knowledge of the authors, almost all of the existing results for such systems need Lipschitz condition. The main purpose of this paper is to take a step towards nonlinear growth rate for second-order systems. The control law is designed based on least squares (LS) algorithms and on recursive adaptive predictors. Global stability and tracking performance are established for the closed-loop systems.", "paper_title": "Prediction-based adaptive control of a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems with nonlionear growth rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000255985100007"}
