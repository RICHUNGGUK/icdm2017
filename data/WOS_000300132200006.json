In this context, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has initiated a work on standardization of an IPv6-based aeronautical telecommunications network and on future radio access technologies, respectively. In this paper, we integrate L-Band Digital Aeronautical Communications System Option 1 (L-DACS 1), which is one candidate for future radio access technologies, with realistic IPv6-based network layer functionality and analyze the effect of handover delay to the TCP performance. Realistic Frame Error Rate (FER) values obtained from an L-DACS 1 physical layer simulator, which uses a realistic aeronautical channel model, are used in the simulation experiments. In the first stage, we decreased layer 3 handover latency by removing the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure for address configuration. In the second stage, we introduced a Home Agent (HA)-buffering method, which is used to buffer the traffic (destined to the mobile node) during handover. Transmission completion time is the primary performance metric in our analysis. With the HA-buffering method, the transmission completion time is reduced by at least 10% for the transmission of 110 kB of information over a wireless link with 31.5 kbit s(-1) data rate.
