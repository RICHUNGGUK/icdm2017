The Quantum State Transform (QST) is introduced to define a Quantum Transfer Function (QTF) that can be used to characterize behavior of complex circuits like e.g. stability better. It is shown that ordering more general quantum systems into feedback can yield to the definition of hierarchical quantum systems that are very close to well-known scale-free networks. Finally, all identified mathematical instruments are used to define quantum information/knowledge circuits as ordering of 2-port quantum subsystems covering both input/output information flow and content.", "paper_title": "FROM QUANTUM TRANSFER FUNCTIONS TO COMPLEX QUANTUM CIRCUITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299355800003"}
