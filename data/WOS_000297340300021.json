As a result, a novel efficient method for Cartesian to polar coordinate inter-conversion, especially suited for dedicated hardware realization, is proposed. Applications to local image rotation, based on the simple steerability of the Laguerre-Gauss expansion, and to local image analysis, based on Gaussian derivatives, are considered in detail. A possible fixed-point realization of the proposed inter-conversion scheme is discussed.", "paper_title": "On the Inter-Conversion Between Hermite and Laguerre Local Image Expansions", "paper_id": "WOS:000297340300021"}
