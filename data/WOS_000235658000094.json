Two key issues in the framework are discussed: service description language and service matchmaking mechanism. A Fuzzy Petri nets-based service description language is proposed as a specification to publish or request for a service, Possibilistic transition is used to represent a service or request. Meanwhile, through ontology's class hierarchy, we give a semantic-based service matchmaking that can find an appropriate service for a request. Possibility and necessity measures are used to quantify the confidence levels that the service can satisfy a request, that is, support partial matching.", "paper_title": "A multi-agent based grid service discovery framework using fuzzy Petri net and ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000094"}
