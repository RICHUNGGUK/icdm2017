Currently, most of the approaches to this problem can be categorized into two classes. One is based on local features, and the other is based on global features. Meanwhile, manifold learning has become successful in many problems in computer vision, but because of the high variability of human body, the application of manifold learning to human action recognition is limited. We propose a framework based on Elastic Manifold Embedding (EME), a new sparse manifold learning algorithm, together with local interest point features to handle human action recognition. The result of the new framework is very promising in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
