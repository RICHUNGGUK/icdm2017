This paper presents a research effort aimed at creating a desktop-based, low-cost and independent VR-based simulation system for glass pressing, which integrates the forming process simulation and mold motion simulation. The skeletal animation technique is employed for Motion Simulation of the mold The stereoscopic view of the virtual system is achieved by Crystal Eyes shutter glasses, with C++ language and OpenGL support library selected as the development tool. With the stereoscopic display of the mold design, pressing motion and numerical CAE results, the system enables engineers to gain a cohesive view of mold structure, assembly issues, and possible forming faults. it can also support training of students and engineers to acquire the theoretical know-how, practical skills, and the problem troubleshooting techniques of glass pressing.
