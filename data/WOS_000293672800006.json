The approach is a two-step one. In the first phase homogenized masonry strength domains are obtained using a simplified kinematic procedure applied on a three-leaf unitary cell. In the second phase, homogenized domains are implemented at a structural level on a plate and cell kinematic FE software. The procedure is tested on two real scale existing churches located in Italy and compared to results provided by means of a conventional elastic approach performed by means of a standard commercial software. The global behavior at failure and the overall strength of the buildings are assessed through Monte Carlo simulations varying both masonry mechanical properties and direction of the equivalent seismic load.
