Therefore, vehicular networks have been widely studied in recent years. Because of limited transmission range of wireless antennas, mobile vehicles should also switch their access points to maintain the connections as conventional mobile nodes. Considering the inherent characteristics of vehicular networks such as dynamic topology and high speed, the question of how to implement handoff protocol under real-time scenarios is very important. IEEE 802.11p protocol is designed for vehicular networks for the long distance transmission. To reduce handoff latency for 802.11p protocol, the authentication phase is waived during the handoff. However, security is also very important for wireless communications, and authentication can forbid access from malicious nodes and prevent wireless communications from potential attacks. Thus, in this paper, a lightweight authentication scheme is introduced to balance the security requirements and the handoff performance for 802.11p vehicular networks. In our scheme, the access points are divided into different trust groups, and the authentication process is completed in a group-based method. Once a vehicle is authenticated by an access point group, during the handoff within the same group, few extra authentication operations are needed. As a result, there is no extra overhead introduced to the authentication servers. Simulation results demonstrate that our authentication scheme only introduces small handoff latency and it is ideal for vehicular networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
