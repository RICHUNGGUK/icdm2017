Designing a feasible primer pair is an important work before performing PCR-RFLP for SNP genotyping. However, in many cases, restriction enzymes to discriminate the target SNP resulting in the primer design is not applicable. A mutagenic primer is introduced to solve this problem. GA-based Mismatch PCR-RFLP Primers Design (GAMPD) provides a method that uses a genetic algorithm to search for optimal mutagenic primers and available restriction enzymes from REBASE. In order to improve the efficiency of the proposed method, a mutagenic matrix is employed to judge whether a hypothetical mutagenic primer can discriminate the target SNP by digestion with available restriction enzymes. The available restriction enzymes for the target SNP are mined by the updated core of SNP-RFLPing. GAMPD has been used to simulate the SNPs in the human SLC6A4 gene under different parameter settings and compared with SNP Cutter for mismatch PCR-RFLP primer design. The in silico simulation of the proposed GAMPD program showed that it designs mismatch PCR-RFLP primers. The GAMPD program is implemented in JAVA and is freely available at http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/gampd/.", "paper_title": "Mutagenic Primer Design for Mismatch PCR-RFLP SNP Genotyping Using a Genetic Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000301293900019"}
