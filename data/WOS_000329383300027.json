An early example is comparisons between Tabu Search (TS) and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms for tackling the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). The results of these comparisons are to a certain extent inconclusive, even when focusing on only these two types of algorithms. While comparisons of SA and TS algorithms were based on rather small-sized instances, here we focus on possible dependencies of the relative performance between SA and TS algorithms on instance size. In fact, our experimental results show that the assertion whether one algorithm is better than the other can depend strongly on QAP instance size even if one focuses on instances with otherwise same characteristics.
