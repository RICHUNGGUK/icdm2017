The proposed schemes greatly improve decoding performance and satisfy the real-time requirements of various high-definition (HD) video decoding standards. In THPHP, we propose both a task-based hybrid parallel, scheme, in which macro-block (MB)-level, block-level, and sub-block-level decoding tasks are parallelized to improve data processing throughput, and a hybrid pipeline scheme, in which slice-level, MB-level, block-level and sub-block-level computations are pipelined to improve efficiency. Computation-intensive tasks, such as motion compensation, intra prediction, inverse discrete cosine transform, reconstruction, and deblocking filter, are implemented on two reconfigurable processing units, which are the core computing engines of REMUS. Thanks to the proposed schemes, the implementations can achieve H.264 high profile (HP) 1920x1080@30 fps streams, AVS Jizhun profile (JP) 1920x1080@39 fps streams, and MPEG-2 main profile (MP) 1920x1080@41 fps streams when working at 200 MHz frequency. Compared with XPP-III (a commercial reconfigurable processor), when implementing H.264 HD decoding, the performance and energy efficiency on REMUS are improved by 1.81x and 14.3x, respectively.", "paper_title": "Implementation of multi-standard video decoder on a heterogeneous coarse-grained reconfigurable processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500020"}
