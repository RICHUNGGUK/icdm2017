As a part of our approach, we develop new quadratures appropriate for the singularity of Green's function in the Fourier domain. The approximation and quadratures yield a fast algorithm for computing volumetric convolutions with Green's function in dimensions two and three. The algorithmic complexity scales as O(K(d) log K + C(log epsilon(-1))(d)), where epsilon is selected accuracy, kappa is the number of wavelengths in the problem, d is the dimension, and C is a constant. The algorithm maintains its efficiency when applied to functions with singulafities. In contrast to the Fast Multipole Method, as K -> 0, our approximation makes a transition to that of the free space Green's function for the Poisson equation. We illustrate our approach with examples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
