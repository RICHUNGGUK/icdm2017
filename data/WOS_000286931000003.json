Most existing reconstruction algorithms for OAT assume that the ultrasound transducers employed to record the measurement data are point-like. When transducers with large detecting areas and/or compact measurement geometries are utilized, this assumption can result in conspicuous image blurring and distortions in the reconstructed images. In this work, a new OAT imaging model that incorporates the spatial and temporal responses of an ultrasound transducer is introduced. A discrete form of the imaging model is implemented and its numerical properties are investigated. We demonstrate that use of the imaging model in an iterative reconstruction method can improve the spatial resolution of the optoacoustic images as compared to those reconstructed assuming point-like ultrasound transducers.", "paper_title": "An Imaging Model Incorporating Ultrasonic Transducer Properties for Three-Dimensional Optoacoustic Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000286931000003"}
