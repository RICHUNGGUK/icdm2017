Our approach is to exploit the spatial and temporal nature of data and queries such as motion characteristics. In this article, we discuss four major themes and projects of the group: (i) nearest neighbor queries, (ii) temporal data processing and continuous queries, (iii) P2P spatial data management, and (iv) location privacy. The group is supported by funding from the Australian Research Council and the National ICT Australia Victoria Research Laboratory.", "paper_title": "Spatio-Temporal Database Research at the University of Melbourne", "paper_id": "WOS:000279362400005"}
