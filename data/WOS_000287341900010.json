Semantic-awareness, distribution and interoperability of new generation of distributed systems demand an authorisation model and framework that satisfies essential authorisation requirements of such environments. In this study, the authors propose an authorisation model and framework based on multi-security-domain architecture for distributed semantic-aware environments. The proposed framework is founded based on the MA(DL)(2) logic, which enables policy specification and inference (based on the defined semantic relationships) in both conceptual and ground (individual) levels. Also, it enables authorities to have cooperative security management in their shared domain of resources with different administration styles.", "paper_title": "Multi-level authorisation model and framework for distributed semantic-aware environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000287341900010"}
