WM relies substantially on wireless devices such as RFID (radio frequency identification) or Auto ID (automatic identification) sensors, and wireless information/communication networks Such as Wi-Fi for the collection and synchronisation or manufacturing field data. This paper discusses the recent developments ill RFID-based WM Solutions. The study is conducted by examining related whitepapers, case reports and research articles available in the literature, and by reflecting on the insights recently experienced in developing prototype Solutions. Typical motivations are presented to highlight why and flow Manufacturers can benefit from applying WM Solutions in addressing shop-floor challenges and facilitating contemporary manufacturing strategies. Representative WM manufacturing applications and potentials are presented in the areas or product assembly, part fabrication, just-in-time (JIT), mass customisation, manufacturing asset management and maintenance, and product lifecycle management. Different schemes tire discussed for deploying smart objects in manufacturing environments in order to achieve real-time traceability and visibility while minimising the total cost. Key issues are discussed for further research.", "paper_title": "Wireless manufacturing: a literature review, recent developments, and case studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000268243800002"}
