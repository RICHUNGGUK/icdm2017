An accurate description of the harbor geometry, bathymetry and an incident wave spectrum are required. The solution of Helmholtz equation in the bounded and unbounded region is obtained by 2-D boundary integral method with the consideration of partial reflection and corner point approximation. Moreover, the Chebyshev point discretization is applied on boundary of the harbor to improve the accuracy of the numerical scheme. The principle of superposition is adopted to simulate the directional random waves based on the solution of monochromatic incident waves. The form of Mitsuyasu's frequency spectrum was utilized for the random wave simulation. The wave spectra for multidirectional random waves are analyzed at various recorder stations in the Pohang New Harbor (PNH). Comparison of simulation results with in situ measurement data recorded at various recorder observatories in the PNH demonstrates the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed method. After this study, we analyzed the wave height distribution in the whole PNH domain. Based on the simulation results, some tactic has been introduced to reduce the wave amplitude in the PNH. Our primary results confirm that present numerical model is accurate and flexible to implement on various real harbors to predict the multidirectional random wave diffraction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
