This paper proposes a comprehensive QoS model specifically for pervasive services. It considers not only user-perceived factors but also mobile wireless network characteristics. The corresponding formula to calculate each QoS criterion is also devised. In particular, this paper formulates the QoS-aware service selection problem for pervasive service composition and proposes some solutions to the problem, i.e., global-search-based LOSSA (local optimal service selection algorithm) and limited broadcast based LOSSA-k. The evaluation results of the algorithms have shown the effectiveness of the QoS model and the efficiency of the proposed LOSSAs.", "paper_title": "QoS-Aware Service Selection Algorithms for Pervasive Service Composition in Mobile Wireless Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000278942100003"}
