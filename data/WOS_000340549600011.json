Our motivation is based on the fact that a search and rescue (SAR) robot can navigate within and penetrate a disaster area only if the area in question possesses connected voids. Traversability or penetrability of a disaster area is a primary factor that guides the navigation of a search and rescue (SAR) robot, since it is highly desirable that the robot, without hitting a dead end or getting stuck, keeps its mobility for its primary task of reconnaissance and mapping when searching the highly unstructured environment. We propose a novel percolation guidance that collaborates with entropy based SLAM under a switching control setting the priority to either position or map accuracy. This newly developed methodology has proven to combine the superiority of both percolator guidance and entropy based prioritization so that the active SLAM becomes speedy, with high coverage rate of the area as well as increased accuracy in localization. Our percolator guidance stems from a frontier based conditioning of a-posteriori occurrences of upcoming connected voids that uses the fact that every obstacle partially seen at the frontier of the explored domain has a spatial continuity into the unexplored area. The developed modular architecture is introduced in details and demonstrative examples are provided and discussed.", "paper_title": "Prioritized Mobile Robot Exploration Based on Percolation Enhanced Entropy Based Fast SLAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000340549600011"}
