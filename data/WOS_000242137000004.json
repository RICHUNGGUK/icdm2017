For example, we show how to assign natural indices to monotone Sigma(0)(1)-definitions and then use these to calculate the complexity of the set of all indices of monotone Sigma(0)(1)-definitions that are computable. We also examine the complexity of a new type of inductive definition, which we call weakly finitary monotone inductive definitions. Applications are given in proof theory and in logic programming.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of inductive definitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000242137000004"}
