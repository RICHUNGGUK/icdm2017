We apply our framework to the D-policy M/G/1 queue and confirm the results that already exist in the literature. We also use our approach and derive, for the first time, the sojourn time distribution of an arbitrary customer in the M/G/1 queue under D-policy. The methodologies developed in this paper can be applied to a wide range of M/G/1 queueing systems in which the server is controlled by workload.", "paper_title": "A unified framework for the analysis of M/G/1 queue controlled by workload", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300076"}
