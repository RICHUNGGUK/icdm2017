The proposed method does not directly use the text-line which has been the most widely used feature for the document dewarping. Instead, we use the discrete representation of text-lines and text-blocks which are the sets of connected components. Also, we model the geometric distortions caused by page curl and perspective view as the generalized cylindrical surfaces and camera rotation respectively. With these distortion models and the discrete representation of the features, we design a cost function whose minimization yields the parameters of the distortion model. In the cost function, we encode the properties of the pages such as text-block alignment, line-spacing, and the straightness of text-lines. By describing the text features using the sets of discrete points, the cost function can be easily defined and efficiently solved by Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed method works well for the various layouts and curved surfaces, and compares favorably with the conventional methods on the standard dataset. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
