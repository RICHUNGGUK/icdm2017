The extraction of a flat clustering from a cluster tree is formulated as an optimization problem and a linear complexity algorithm is presented that provides the globally optimal solution to this problem in semi-supervised as well as in unsupervised scenarios. A collection of experiments is presented involving clustering hierarchies of different natures, a variety of real data sets, and comparisons with specialized methods from the literature.", "paper_title": "A framework for semi-supervised and unsupervised optimal extraction of clusters from hierarchies", "paper_id": "WOS:000322454200004"}
