Firstly, the current samples were assumed to be a subset of the whole training samples, after the training process, the E-HMM parameters and the necessary temporary parameters in the parameter re-estimating process were saved for the possible retraining use. When new training samples were added to the training samples, the saved E-HMM parameters were chosen as the initial model parameter. Then the E-HMM was retrained based on the new samples and the new temporary parameters were obtained. Finally, these temporary parameters were combined with saved temporary parameters to form the final E-HMM parameters for representing one person face. Experiments on ORL databases show the improved method is effective.", "paper_title": "Improved parameters estimating scheme for E-HMM with application to face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300027"}
