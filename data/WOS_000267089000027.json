This paper presents a fast two-scan algorithm for labeling of connected components in binary images. We propose an efficient procedure for assigning provisional labels to object pixels and checking label equivalence. Our algorithm is very simple in principle, easy to implement, and suitable for hardware and parallel implementation. We show the correctness of our algorithm, analyze its complexity, and compare it with other labeling algorithms. Experimental results demonstrated that our algorithm is superior to conventional labeling algorithms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
