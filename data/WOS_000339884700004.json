This paper studies the relationship between optimality conditions in nonlinear programming theory and finite convergence of Lasserre's hierarchy. Our main results are: (i) Lasserre's hierarchy has finite convergence when the constraint qualification, strict complementarity and second order sufficiency conditions hold at every global minimizer, under the standard archimedean condition; the proof uses a result of Marshall on boundary hessian conditions. (ii) These optimality conditions are all satisfied at every local minimizer if a finite set of polynomials, which are in the coefficients of input polynomials, do not vanish at the input data (i.e., they hold in a Zariski open set). This implies that, under archimedeanness, Lasserre's hierarchy has finite convergence generically.", "paper_title": "Optimality conditions and finite convergence of Lasserre's hierarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884700004"}
