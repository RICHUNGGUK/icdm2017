Our work is a contribution to the model-theoretic study of fuzzy predicate logics. We present a reduced semantics and we prove a completeness theorem of the logics with respect to this semantics. The main concepts being studied are the Leibniz congruence and the structure-preserving relation. On the one hand, the Leibniz congruence of a model identifies the elements that are indistinguishable using equality-free atomic formulas and parameters from the model. A reduced structure is the quotient of a model modulo this congruence. On the other hand, the structure-preserving relation between two structures plays the same role that the isomorphism relation plays in classical predicate languages with equality.", "paper_title": "Preserving mappings in fuzzy predicate logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000311670000005"}
