In particular, we concentrate on sets of constraints that consist of key dependencies, and we give an algorithm that computes the consistent answers for a large and practical class of conjunctive queries. Given a query q, the algorithm returns a first-order query Q (called a query rewriting) such that for every (potentially inconsistent) database I, the consistent answers for q can be obtained by evaluating Q directly on I.
