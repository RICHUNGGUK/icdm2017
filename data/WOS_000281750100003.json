Analytical models are first constructed to capture the impact of process parameters on leakage current. Then a methodology is introduced to characterize leakage-related process variations in a systematic manner. On such a basis, an efficient procedure is developed to analyze the state-dependent power dissipation due to leakage of a large circuit block by taking into account different leakage mechanisms. Unlike many traditional approaches that rely on log-normal approximations, the proposed algorithm applies a quadratic model of the logarithm for the full-chip leakage current. It is able to handle both Gaussian and non-Gaussian parameter distributions. The model is validated with test chips manufactured with a commercial 65 nm CMOS process. Validation results prove that the proposed modeling methodology could achieve a higher accuracy than that from existing methods. Moreover, a full-chip leakage analysis using the developed model can be orders of magnitude faster than a Monte Carlo based approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
