The use of resynchronization marks is an efficient method in improving the error resilient performance of a video stream in error-prone environment. In this paper, a smart macroblock rearrangement (SMR) method is proposed to enhance the performance of the resynchronization mark insertion technique for intracoded frames in wireless video transmission. The proposed method makes use of content analysis to rearrange and encode macroblocks between adjacent resynchronization marks. Experiments using the SMR method in both H.263+ and H.264 codecs show that the proposed method outperforms some existing algorithms in both PSNR performance and visual quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
