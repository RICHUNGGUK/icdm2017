In this article, we address these prospects with respect to human skin, one of the most ubiquitous materials portrayed in synthetic imaging. We present the first hyperspectral model designed for the predictive rendering of skin appearance attributes in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared domains. The proposed model incorporates the intrinsic bio-optical properties of human skin affecting light transport in these spectral regions, including the particle nature and distribution patterns of the main light attenuation agents found within the cutaneous tissues. Accordingly, it accounts for phenomena that significantly affect skin spectral signatures, both within and outside the visible domain, such as detour and sieve effects, that are overlooked by existing skin appearance models. Using a first-principles approach, the proposed model computes the surface and subsurface scattering components of skin reflectance taking into account not only the wavelength and the illumination geometry, but also the positional dependence of the reflected light. Hence, the spectral and spatial distributions of light interacting with human skin can be comprehensively represented in terms of hyperspectral reflectance and BSSRDF, respectively.", "paper_title": "Hyperspectral Modeling of Skin Appearance", "paper_id": "WOS:000354800700008"}
