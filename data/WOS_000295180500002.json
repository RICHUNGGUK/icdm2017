In this paper, we propose a P2P Minimum Boundary Rectangle (PMBR, for short) which is a new spatial index specifically designed for mobile P2P environments. A node that contains desirable data item (s) can be easily identified by reading the PMBR index. Then, we propose a selective tuning algorithm, called Distributed exponential Sequence Scheme (DSS, for short), that provides clients with the ability of selective tuning of data items, thus preserving the scarce power resource. The proposed algorithm is simple but efficient in supporting linear transmission of spatial data and processing of location-aware queries. The results from theoretical analysis and experiments show that the proposed algorithm with the PMBR index is scalable and energy efficient in both range queries and nearest neighbor queries.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient Data Access in Mobile P2P Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000295180500002"}
