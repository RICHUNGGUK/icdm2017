The distributed cloud networks must have an ability to maintain an acceptable level of service during network failures to provide high resilience against service failures. This paper presents an eccentric fault tolerant path grouping scheme that can achieve mobility independent Quality of Service guaranteed services in distributed cloud networks To make this possible, we propose a path allocation and restoration strategy called \"Reverse Shared Risk Link Group\" and demonstrates how this concept can be applied to minimize recovery contention in cloud networks and to assess the network convergence associated with failures. To reflect little more actual situations, we assume that the bandwidth of cloud connection requests can be some fraction of the lightpath capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed recovery scheme outperforms other schemes with fewer signaling traffics and contention probability. Very fast restorability can be accomplished for multiple failures. We also has developed an analytical model and performed analysis for the proposed scheme in terms of two performance factors: mean system time and reservation blocking probability.", "paper_title": "A fault tolerant channel allocation scheme in distributed cloud networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365236800009"}
