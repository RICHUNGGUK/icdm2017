Various networks like social networks, sensor networks and computer networks are represented and stored in the form of graphs. The analysis of these kind of graphs has an immense importance from quite a long time. It is performed from various aspects to get maximum out of such multifaceted information repository. When the analysis is targeted towards finding groups of vertices based on their similarity in a graph, clustering is the most conspicuous option. Previous graph clustering approaches either focus on the topological structure or attributes likeness, however, few recent methods constitutes both aspects simultaneously. Due to enormous computation requirements for similarity estimation, these methods are often suffered from scalability issues. In order to overcome this limitation, we introduce collaborative similarity measure (CSM) for intra-graph clustering. CSM is based on shortest path strategy, instead of all paths, to define structural and semantic relevance among vertices. First, we calculate the pair-wise similarity among vertices using CSM. Second, vertices are grouped together based on calculated similarity under k-Medoid framework. Empirical analysis, based on density, and entropy, proves the efficacy of CSM over existing measures. Moreover, CSM becomes a potential candidate for medium scaled graph analysis due to an order of magnitude less computations.", "paper_title": "Intra graph clustering using collaborative similarity measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000360553700005"}
