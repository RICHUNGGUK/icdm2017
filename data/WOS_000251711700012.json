The existing literature provides little guidance on how to select optimal parameters, which are critical in efficiency of the model, among the infinite range of available parameters. We introduce a new criterion to find suitable parameters in GARCH models by using Markov length, which is the minimum time interval over which the data can be considered as constituting a Markov process. This criterion is applied to various time series and its results support the known idea that GARCH(1, 1) model works well.", "paper_title": "Why does the standard GARCH(1,1) model work well?", "paper_id": "WOS:000251711700012"}
