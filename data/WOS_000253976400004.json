The study focuses on overcoming the difficulties associated with developing middleware capable of processing and streaming multimedia data from a large number of cameras by expanding the traditional media processing technology. The content of the study can be classified into two main categories: One is a camera array management technique that involves the middleware-level framework and protocol for managing the camera array. The other is the media stream management technique for effective delivery management and processing of the multimedia streams from the camera array.", "paper_title": "Towards building large scale live media streaming framework for a U-city", "paper_id": "WOS:000253976400004"}
