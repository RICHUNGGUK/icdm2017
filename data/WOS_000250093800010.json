It is able to effectively prevent from the oscillation problems compared with conventional PTA algorithms. In this paper, an effective SPICE3 implementation method for the compound element PTA algorithm is proposed. It has the characteristic of not expanding the Jacobian matrix and not changing the Jacobian matrix structure when the pseudo-transient numerical simulation is being done. Thus a high simulation efficiency is guaranteed. The ability of the proposed SPICE3 implementation to avoid the oscillation problems and the simulation efficiency are demonstrated by examples.", "paper_title": "An effective SPICE3 implementation of the compound element pseudo-transient algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800010"}
