We give two new proofs of this result. The first one consists of an explicit construction of such a sequence. The second one is probabilistic and shows the existence of such a g that satisfies g(h)(epsilon) << epsilon(-1), improving the bound g(h)(epsilon) << epsilon(-h+1) obtained by Vu. Finally we use the \"alteration method\" to get a better bound for g(3)(epsilon), obtaining a more precise estimate for the growth of B(3)[g] sequences. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
