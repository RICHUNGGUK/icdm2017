We also show that the proposed method can be kernelized on the basis of a theorem similar to the representer theorem for non-linear cases. Experiments confirm that the proposed methods achieve competitive results, as compared to existing graph-based learning methods such as the Laplacian support vector machine and the Laplacian regularized least square, for publicly available datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.
