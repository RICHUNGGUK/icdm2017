Effective real numbers are interesting in areas of numerical analysis where numerical instability is a major problem. One key problem with effective real numbers is to perform intermediate computations at the smallest precision which is sufficient to guarantee an exact end-result. In this paper we first review two classical techniques to achieve this: a priori error estimates and interval analysis. We next present two new techniques: \"relaxed evaluations\" reduce the amount of re-evaluations at larger precisions and \"balanced error estimates\" automatically provide good tolerances for intermediate computations, (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
