It allows designers and engineers in virtual space to design and preview the thermal functional performance of clothing and gives feedback to improve the design iteratively. The system provides designers with an effective tool for designing and engineering clothing to achieve superior thermal functional performance. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
