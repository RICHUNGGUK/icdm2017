This article proposes a systematic approach to reverse engineer arbitrary XML, documents to their conceptual schema-extended DTD graphs-which is a DTD graph with data semantics. The proposed approach not only determines the structure of the XML document, but also derives candidate data semantics from the XML element instances by treating each XML element instance as a record in a table of a relational database. One application of the determined data semantics is to verify the linkages among elements. Implicit and explicit referential linkages are among XML elements modeled by the parent-children structure and I D/I DREF(S) respectively As a result, an arbitrary XML document can be reverse engineered into its conceptual schema in an extended DTD graph format.
