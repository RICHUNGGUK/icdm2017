The magnetic exchange constants were calculated using the broken-symmetry approach. The calculated J values are for HUKDUM J(1) = -68.6 cm(-1), J(2) = -69.9 cm(-1), J(3) = -70.4 cm(-1); for HUKDOG, J(1) = -73.5 cm(-1), J(2) = -58.9 cm(-1), J(3) = -62.1 cm(-1); for HOHQUR J(1) = -128.3 cm(-1), J(2) = -134.1 cm(-1), J(3) = -120.4 cm(-1); for ILEGEM J(1) = -151.6 cm(-1), J(2) = -173.9 cm(-1), J(3) = -186.9 cm(-1); for QOPJIP J(1) = -118.3 cm(-1), J(2) = -106.0 cm(-1), J(3) = -120.6 cm(-1); for DEFSEN J(1) = -74.9 cm(-1), J(2) = -64.0 cm(-1), J(3) = -57.7 cm(-1) and for RITXUO J(1) = -10.9 cm(-1), J(2) = +14.3 cm(-1), J(3) = -35.4 cm(-1). The Kahn-Briat model was used to correlate the calculated magnetic properties with the overlap of the magnetic orbitals.
