In this paper, an approach based on the joint use of mathematical programming and agent-based techniques is exploited in the context of maritime logistics. In particular, a transshipment terminal is considered with the goal of planning the container transportation between the yard and the quay during the loading/discharging operations of a containership by exploiting a pool of straddle carriers shared among the quay cranes. The goal is to route the straddle carriers by determining a sequence of container movements for each of them in order to optimize a given performance criterion. In particular, a new dispatching model is proposed and evaluated through an agent-based simulation model which also made it possible a better understanding of interesting properties of the problem under consideration.", "paper_title": "Agent-based simulation for the evaluation of a new dispatching model for the straddle carrier pooling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000350162900005"}
