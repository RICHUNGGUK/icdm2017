A new model is proposed to represent packet dropouts satisfying a Markov process and late-arrival packets. The closed-loop NCS with a state-feedback controller is transformed into a Markov system, which is convenient for the controller synthesis. Two types of state-feedback control laws are taken into account. Sufficient conditions on the existence of controllers for stochastic stability with an H-infinity disturbance attenuation level are derived through a Lyapunov function dependent on the upper bound of the number of consecutive packet dropouts. A numerical example is finally provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "H-infinity Controller Design of Networked Control Systems With Markov Packet Dropouts", "paper_id": "WOS:000323495900017"}
