The problem is formulated in terms of Petri nets and an approach based on integer programming is proposed to tackle the problem. The integer program provides necessary conditions and, as shown in this paper, for relevant subclasses these conditions are sufficient. Unlike traditional approaches, the approach allows for labeled Petri nets with \"hidden transitions\", noise, etc. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
