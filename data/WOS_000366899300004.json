This cloud resource sharing is primarily driven by resource virtualization and utility computing (the pay-as-you-go pricing model). The generic multilayered cloud service model is appealing to many parties-from small businesses looking for a low upfront infrastructure investment, to enterprises wanting to cut the cost of managing infrastructures, to research communities requiring large-scale data processing and computing power. In a cloud environment, computing resources (processors, storage devices, network bandwidth, and so on) and applications are provided as services over the Internet.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Cloud Resource Configuration Selection in the Big Data Era", "paper_id": "WOS:000366899300004"}
