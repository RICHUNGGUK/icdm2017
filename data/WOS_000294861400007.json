First, in this paper, we present some simple faithful remote state preparation of an arbitrary n-qubit state by constructing entanglement resources and special measurement basis for the sender. Then to weigh the classical resource required, we present an information-theoretical model to evaluate the classical communication cost. By optimizing the classical communication in quantum protocols, we obtain the optimal classical communication cost. This model can also be applied to the quantum teleportation. Moreover, based on the present computation model, we reinvestigate some remote state preparation and teleportation protocols in which the classical communication cost was imperfectly computed. Finally, some problems will be presented.", "paper_title": "CLASSICAL COMMUNICATION COSTS IN QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000294861400007"}
