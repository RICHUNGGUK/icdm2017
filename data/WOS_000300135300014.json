This letter presents an exact and fast Fourier implementation of the Poisson editing equation proposed in (Perez et al., 2003). The proposed algorithm can handle well all Poisson editing methods that are currently implemented with finite differences and multigrid methods. But it also authorizes fast complex editing strategies where the edited region is obtained by an algorithm instead of a manual selection. The selected region can therefore have a complex topology without additional computational cost. In this letter the proposed method is applied to a classic local contrast enhancement principle introduced in (Caselles et al., 1999). The manual selection of the dark regions is replaced by a lower threshold and the method becomes fast, efficient, level-line preserving, and interactive. The proposed method can be tried on line on any uploaded image at http://www.ipol.im/pub/ demo/Imps_selective_contrast_adjustment/. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
