To find these features, the adjusted Rand index (R') is used to estimate the degree of pairwise relationship among 130 linguistic features in a large published database. Many of the R' values prove to be near zero, as predicted for independent features, and a subset of 47 features is found with an average R' of -0.0001. These 47 features are recommended for use in statistical tests that require independent units of analysis.", "paper_title": "Approximately independent features of languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000254424500002"}
