We present an integrated view of sequence-structure-binding relationships in the tyrosine kinome space in which evolutionary analysis of the kinases binding sites is combined with computational proteomics profiling of the inhibitor-protein interactions. This approach provides a functional classification of the binding specificity mechanisms for cancer agents targeting protein tyrosine kinases. Results: The proposed functional classification of the kinase binding specificities explores mechanisms in which structural plasticity of the tyrosine kinases and sequence variation of the binding-site residues are linked with conformational preferences of the inhibitors in achieving effective drug binding. The molecular basis of binding specificity for tyrosine kinases may be largely driven by conformational adaptability of the inhibitors to an ensemble of structurally different conformational states of the enzyme, rather than being determined by their phylogenetic proximity in the kinome space or differences in the interactions with the variable binding-site residues. This approach provides a fruitful functional linkage between structural bioinformatics analysis and disease by unraveling the molecular basis of kinase selectivity for the prominent kinase drugs (Imatinib, Dasatinib and Erlotinib) which is consistent with structural and proteomics experiments.", "paper_title": "Exploring sequence-structure relationships in the tyrosine kinome space: functional classification of the binding specificity mechanisms for cancer therapeutics", "paper_id": "WOS:000249248400007"}
