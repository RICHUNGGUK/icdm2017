Through partitioning the delay intervals [0, tau(0)] and [tau(0), tau(m)], and choosing two augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the global stability by employing the simplified free-weighting matrix method and convex combination. These stability criteria are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and can be easily checked by resorting to LMI in Matlab toolbox. Finally, three numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and reduced conservatism of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Further stability analysis on Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time-varying and distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000293842400005"}
