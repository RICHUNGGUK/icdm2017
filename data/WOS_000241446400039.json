A new framework hybridizing multi-objective and multi-modal optimization is proposed to formalize these data mining problems, and addressed through Evolutionary Computation (EC). The merits of EC for spatio-temporal data mining are demonstrated as the approach facilitates the modelling of the experts' requirements, and flexibly accommodates their changing goals.", "paper_title": "Functional brain imaging with multi-objective multi-modal evolutionary optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400039"}
