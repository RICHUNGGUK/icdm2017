Open-ended single-walled carbon nanotubes are called tubulenes. The resonance graph of a tubulene reflects the interference among its Kekule structures. Our work is motivated by [15] where some basic properties of resonance graphs of benzenoid systems were investigated. In the present paper it is shown that every connected component of the resonance graph of a tubulene is either a path or a graph of girth 4. The example for the construction of an arbitrary path as a connected component of the resonance graph is given. We also provide a condition for a tubulene under which every connected component of its resonance graph different from a path without vertices of degree one is 2-connected.", "paper_title": "Connected Components of Resonance Graphs of Carbon Nanotubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000356205700013"}
