Design/methodology/approach - This study gathered sample data from eight high-tech companies in Taiwan. A total of 680 questionnaires were randomly distributed, 522 questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 76.76 percent, and 483 usable questionnaires were analyzed, with a usable response rate of 71.03 percent. Data were analyzed by using structural equation modeling. Findings - Information quality, service quality, system quality, and instructor quality, as the antecedents of e-learning acceptance can provide detailed accounts of the key forces underpinning employees' perception with regard to their beliefs (i.e. perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment), and this situation can further enhance employees' usage intention of the e-learning system. Originality/value - Based on the extended technology acceptance model and the updated DeLone and McLean information systems success model, this study integrates related e-learning quality factors including information quality, service quality, and system quality into the research model and further contributes additionally to the identification of instructor quality that may lead to e-learning acceptance. Also, it should be noted that the empirical evidence on capturing both extrinsic and intrinsic motivators for completely explaining quality antecedents of e-learning acceptance is well documented in this study. Hence, this study contributes significantly to the body of research on evaluating the quality antecedents of e-learning acceptance.", "paper_title": "Effects of quality antecedents on e-learning acceptance", "paper_id": "WOS:000307611400006"}
