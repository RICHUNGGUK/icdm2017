However, the 'customer' may not necessarily pay this amount due to any number of legitimate (e.g., price promotion) as well as illegitimate (e.g., theft) reasons. We consider ticket-switching, a scenario whereby the customer pays a lower amount for the purchased item by switching its price identifier. We propose the use of item-level RFID tags to address ticket-switching in apparel retail stores. We then develop authentication protocols that are directed at reducing the occurrence of ticket-switching incidents as well as identifying them when they occur. We evaluate the security properties of the proposed protocols. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
