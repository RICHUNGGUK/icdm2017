To protect critical digital resources, these organizations employ access-control mechanisms, which define rules under which authorized users can access the resources they need to perform organizational tasks. Natural or man- made disasters pose a unique challenge, whereby previously defined constraints can potentially debilitate an organization's ability to act. Here, the authors propose employing contextual parameters - specifically, activity context in the form of emergency warnings - to adapt access-control policies according to a priori configuration.", "paper_title": "Context-aware adaptation of access-control policies", "paper_id": "WOS:000252175300010"}
