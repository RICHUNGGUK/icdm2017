We study the correlation between the events {a -> s} and {s -> b}. We show that, counter-intuitively, when G is the complete graph K(n), n >= 5, then the correlation is positive. (It is negative for n = 3 and zero for n = 4.) We briefly discuss and pose problems for the same question on other graphs.", "paper_title": "A Counter-Intuitive Correlation in a Random Tournament", "paper_id": "WOS:000285718900001"}
