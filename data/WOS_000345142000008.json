However, the force transfer mechanisms of these devices and their level of action remain controversial. The objectives of this work are to characterise the mechanical performance of conventional knee braces regarding their anti-drawer effect using a finite element model of a braced lower limb. A design of experiment approach was used to quantify meaningful mechanical parameters related to the efficiency and discomfort tolerance of braces. Results show that the best tradeoff between efficiency and discomfort tolerance is obtained by adjusting the brace length or the strap tightening. Thanks to this computational analysis, novel brace designs can be evaluated for an optimal mechanical efficiency and a better compliance of the patient with the treatment.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of the mechanical efficiency of knee braces based on computational modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000345142000008"}
