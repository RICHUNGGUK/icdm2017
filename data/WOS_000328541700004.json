R&D projects are a building-block in the innovation process, hence the importance of managing them efficiently. Ontologies and semantic technologies have proven highly effective at this task. Within this context, the present study explores the use of ontologies to model R&D related data and the application of semantic technologies to the building of an enhanced management system. Findings confirm the success of the system proposed, and reveal that it may bring considerable benefits to project management, such as the definition of a completely explicit information model and improved management capabilities.", "paper_title": "A Semantic based Platform for Research and Development Projects Management in the ICT Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000328541700004"}
