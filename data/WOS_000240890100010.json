In classical information theory, the algorithmic complexity of a string is a measure of the information needed by a universal machine to reproduce the string itself. We define the complexity of a quantum state by means of the classical description complexity of an (abstract) experimental procedure that allows us to prepare the state with, a given fidelity. We argue that our definition satisfies the intuitive idea of complexity as a measure of \"how difficult\" it is to prepare a state. We apply this definition to give an upper bound on the algorithmic complexity of a number of known states. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the entanglement of a quantum state and its algorithmic complexity.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic complexity of quantum states", "paper_id": "WOS:000240890100010"}
