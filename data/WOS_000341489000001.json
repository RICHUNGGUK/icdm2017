The automatic loop presented here was strictly designed around an innovative Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm, developed at University of Padua, namely the GeDEA-II. Recent papers showed its excellent performance when tested on state-of-the-art problems. In order to test the performance of this algorithm two test cases are presented, each having its peculiar characteristics. The first problem regards the single-objective, multi-constraints aerodynamic optimization of the ERICA tilt-rotor cockpit region. The second one is a multi-point multi-constraint optimization of the left intake of the AgustaWestland AW101 helicopter. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this automatic optimization loop in tackling real-word engineering problems.", "paper_title": "Aerodynamic Shape Optimization in Aeronautics: A Fast and Effective Multi-Objective Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000341489000001"}
