The ANSI/ISA S84.01-1996 and IEC 61508 safety standards provide guidelines for the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and test of SIS. However, in the field, there is a considerable lack of understanding of how to apply these standards to both determine and achieve the required safety integrity level (SIL) for SIS. Moreover, in certain situations, the SIL evaluation is further complicated due to the uncertainty on reliability parameters of SIS components. This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the \"confidence\" of the SIL determination when there is an uncertainty about failure rates of SIS components. This approach is based on the use of failure rates and fuzzy probabilities to evaluate-the SIS failure probability on demand and the SIL of the SIS. Furthermore, we provide guidance on reducing the SIL uncertainty based on fuzzy Probabilistic importance measures.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy probabilistic approach for determining safety integrity level", "paper_id": "WOS:000253182600020"}
