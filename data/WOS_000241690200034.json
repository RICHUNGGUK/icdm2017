The Karaoke music encompasses two audio channels in each track: one is a mix of vocal and background accompaniment, and the other is composed of accompaniment only. The accompaniments in the two channels often resemble each other, but are not identical. This characteristic is exploited to infer the vocal's background music from the accompaniment-only channel, so that the main melody underlying the vocal signals can be extracted more effectively. To enable an efficient and accurate search for a large music database, we propose a phrase onset detection method based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for predicting the most likely beginning of a sung query, and adopt a multiple-level multiple-pass Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for melody similarity comparison. The experiments conducted on a Karaoke database consisting of 1,071 popular songs show the promising results of query-by-singing retrieval for Karaoke music.", "paper_title": "A music retrieval system based on query-by-singing for Karaoke jukebox", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200034"}
