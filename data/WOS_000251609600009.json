Recently, constructions of codebooks with difference sets meeting Welch's bound on the maximum cross-correlation amplitude were developed. In this paper, a generic construction of codebooks using almost difference sets is considered and several classes of codebooks nearly meeting the Welch bound are obtained. The parameters of the codebooks constructed in this paper are new.", "paper_title": "Codebooks from almost difference sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000251609600009"}
