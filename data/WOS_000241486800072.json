Not least due to the rapidly increasing number of efficient 3d hard- and software system components, alternative lowcost solutions are in great demand. We propose such a low-cost system for 3d data acquisition and fast pairwise surface registration. The only hardware requirements are a simple commercial hand-held laser and a standard grayscale camera.", "paper_title": "Low-cost laser range scanner and fast surface registration approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000241486800072"}
