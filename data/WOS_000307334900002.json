The formalization is carried out in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL using an encoding based on de Bruijn indices. We start with a relatively simple formalization covering only the basic features of System , and explain how it can be extended to also cover records and more advanced binding constructs. We also discuss different styles of formalizing the evaluation relation, and how this choice influences executability of the specification.", "paper_title": "A Solution to the PoplMark Challenge Using de Bruijn Indices in Isabelle/HOL", "paper_id": "WOS:000307334900002"}
