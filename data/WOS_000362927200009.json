We develop a theoretical framework in which four extrinsic motivation factors (i.e., integrated regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, and external regulation) are combined with the theory of reasoned action. We then examine their relationships using structural equation modelling. Our results reveal the significant roles of both integrated and identified regulations in influencing users' attitude toward green personal computing. We have also confirmed the positive impacts of both introjected and external regulations on subjective norms about green personal computing. Both attitude and subjective norms are proved to be positively related to users' intention to practice green personal computing. These four extrinsic motivation factors also exert significant indirect effects on behavioral intention of green personal computing through attitude and subjective norms.", "paper_title": "INVESTIGATING USERS' EXTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR GREEN PERSONAL COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000362927200009"}
