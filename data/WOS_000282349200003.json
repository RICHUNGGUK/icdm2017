Therefore the aim of this project was to sensitize secondary school students for occupational diseases before they start working. Four virtual patients for secondary school students were created. They present their experiences as apprentices. Occupational diseases as well as prevention methods are discussed. Evaluation and long-term knowledge was assessed. Furthermore, a webpage (http://www.volle-puste.de/en/) was created, where free access to the virtual patients can be ordered by teachers. Virtual patients are suitable for age 13-16. On a scale from 1 (very good) to 6 (insufficient) students rated the use of the virtual patients with an overall mean of 2.7 (Standard deviation: 1.15). Long-term gain in knowledge was shown. Using virtual patients in adolescents is useful to enhance knowledge about occupational risks. Whether this contributes to an informed job choice has to be shown in further studies.
