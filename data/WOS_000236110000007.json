A high level of sequence conservation between the two receptors was found with 64% and 80% of identity and similarity, respectively. Selected endocrine disrupting chemicals were docked into the ligand binding domain (LBD) of rtER alpha and the corresponding free binding energies Delta(Delta G(bind)) values were calculated. A Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model between the relative binding affinity data and the Delta(Delta G(bind)) values was derived in order to predict which further organic pollutants are likely to bind to rtER alpha.", "paper_title": "Homology model of the rainbow trout estrogen receptor (rtER alpha) and docking of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)", "paper_id": "WOS:000236110000007"}
