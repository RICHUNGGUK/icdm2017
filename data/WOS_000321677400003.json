Lyapunov's 2nd method is a popular tool by the use of which various controllers can be designed like adaptive neural networks, fuzzy controllers, and neuro-fuzzy solutions, or the sliding mode controllers and the well-known PID feedback controllers. Robust Fixed Point Transformation is a procedure which can be built for almost any type of controller in case an approximate model is used to estimate the controlled system's behavior. In this paper, a new approach to Robust Fixed Point Transformations (RFPT) is introduced by integrating a second controller in the system. Authors show that this additional, \"recalculated\" controller not just improves the original controller's results, but halves the tracking errors achieved by the previous RFPT methods.", "paper_title": "ROBUST FIXED POINT TRANSFORMATIONS-BASED CONTROL OF CHAOTIC SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000321677400003"}
