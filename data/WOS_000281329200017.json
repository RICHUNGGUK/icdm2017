This approach allows for intense visualization sessions for a couple of hours as opposed to storing massive amounts of data in a storage system. Our data sets consist of 3-D data with over 10 million unknowns at each time-step to be used for volume rendering. Large-scale interactive visualization on a display wall holding 15 million pixels has already been accomplished. With the advent of the age of the mobile web, we have now extended this tactic to hand-held devices, such as the OQO, Nokia N800, netbooks, iPHONE, and Android OS phones. We are developing web-based software in Java to extend the ubiquitous use of this system across long distances. The software is aimed at creating an interactive and functional application capable of running on multiple browsers by taking advantage of two AJAX-enabled web frameworks: Echo2 (http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo2) and Google Web Toolkit (http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/). Modular building of the system allows for components to be swapped out so that other forms of visualization can be accommodated, such as molecular dynamics in mineral physics or 2-D data sets from the regional convection models.
