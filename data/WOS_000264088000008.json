For a natural number k, a k-gonal drawing of G is an orthogonal drawing such that the boundary of G is drawn as a rectangle and each inner face is drawn as a polygon with at most k corners whose area is equal to the specified value. In this paper, we show that every slicing graph G with a slicing tree T and a set of specified face areas admits a 10-gonal drawing D such that the boundary of each slicing subgraph that appears in T is also drawn as a polygon with at most 10 corners. Such a drawing D can be found in linear time. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Drawing slicing graphs with face areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000264088000008"}
