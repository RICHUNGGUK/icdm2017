It is based on the Driscoll and Healy fast scalar spherical harmonics transform. The theoretical exactness of the transform relies on a sampling theorem. The associated asymptotic complexity is of order O(L(2)log(2)(2)L), where 2L stands for the square-root of the number of sampling points on the sphere, also setting a band limit L for the spin +/- 2 functions considered. The algorithm is presented as an alternative to existing fast algorithms with an asymptotic complexity of order O(L-3) on other pixelizations. We also illustrate these generic developments through their application in cosmology, for the analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
