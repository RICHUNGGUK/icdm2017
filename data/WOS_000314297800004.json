How to effectively leverage visual search method to find the items of users' interests is an important yet challenging task. Besides global appearances (e.g., color, shape or pattern), users may often pay more attention to the local styles of certain products, thus an ideal visual item search engine should support detailed and precise search of similar images, which is beyond the capabilities of current search systems. In this paper, we propose a novel system named iSearch and global/local matching of local features are combined to do precise retrieval of item images in an interactive manner. We extract multiple local features including scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), regional color moments and object contour fragments to sufficiently represent the visual appearances of items; while global and local matching of large-scale image dataset are allowed. To do this, an effective contour fragments encoding and indexing method is developed. Meanwhile, to improve the matching robustness of local features, we encode the spatial context with grid representations and a simple but effective verification approach using triangle relations constraints is proposed for spatial consistency filtering. The experimental evaluations show the promising results of our approach and system.", "paper_title": "Combining global and local matching of multiple features for precise item image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000314297800004"}
