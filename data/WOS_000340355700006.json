The motor state-space equations are implemented in Simulink and an easy to use graphic user interface is designed. The starting performance of a typical motor is then simulated in different conditions as a case study. This toolbox provides a friendly and efficient environment for students to become familiar with the performance of this type of motor which is receiving increasing attention in the industry and academic. An experimental study is also carried out to validate the toolbox.
