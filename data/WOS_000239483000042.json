The images in each class are clustered into several subclasses by the competitive neural network, which is helpful for feature extraction. The low rank approximation is used for image feature extraction. Finally, the k-nearest neighbor classifier is applied to the classification. Experiment results on USPS dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Handwritten digit recognition using low rank approximation based competitive neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000042"}
