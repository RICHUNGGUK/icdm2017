This paper presents a general approach to creating large, ground-truthed corpora for structured sketch domains such as mathematics. In the approach, random sketch templates are generated automatically using a grammar model of the sketch domain. These templates are transcribed manually, then automatically annotated with ground-truth. The annotation procedure uses the generated sketch templates to find a matching between transcribed and generated symbols. A large, ground-truthed corpus of handwritten mathematical expressions presented in the paper illustrates the utility of the approach.", "paper_title": "Grammar-based techniques for creating ground-truthed sketch corpora", "paper_id": "WOS:000287757000008"}
