The choice was made to model it via Bond Graph formalism. Although this tool has been developed since the 1970s, the novelty is its application to lithium-ion batteries, which turns the modeling presented here into an original energy approach. The main objective is to develop and validate a lithium-ion battery model that could be implemented in a global system for energy monitoring. However, nearly every phenomenon occurring in the battery is taken into account for a possible ageing or thermal study. In the first part, the energy modeling approach is described. In the second part, the lithium-ion battery operation is explained. In the third part, the Bond Graph model is proposed. At last, experimental validations are presented. (C) 2010 IMACS.
