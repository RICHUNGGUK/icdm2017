Verification of the numerical model was carried out by comparing the computed settlements at top and tip of the pier with the measured values. An un-rammed aggregate pier (LIAP) of the same diameter and length was also simulated using the numerical method to demonstrate the effect of installation. Interpretations of the numerical results were focused on the load-settlement behavior, the bulging of the pier, the axial load distributions along the pier, and the stress paths of the soil around the pier. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the influence of the pier length/diameter ratio and the soil properties on the behavior of rammed and un-rammed aggregate piers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
