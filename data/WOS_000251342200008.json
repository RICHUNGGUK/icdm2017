In an attempt to identify the binding site for SPARC on VEGF, we hypothesized that this binding site could overlap at least partially the binding site of VEGF receptor I (VEGFR-1), as SPARC acts by preventing VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-1. To this end, a docking simulation was carried out using a predictive docking tool to obtain modeled structures of the VEGF-SPARC complex. The predicted structure of VEGF-SPARC complex indicates that the extracellular domain of SPARC interacts with the VEGFR-I binding site of VEGF, and is consistent with known biochemical data. Following molecular dynamics refinement, side-chain interactions at the protein interface were identified that were predicted to contribute substantially to the free energy of binding. These provide a detailed prediction of key amino acid side-chain interactions at the protein-protein interface. To validate the model further, the identified interactions will be used for designing mutagenesis studies to investigate their effect on binding activity. This model of the VEGF-SPARC complex should provide a basis for future studies aimed at identifying inhibitors of VEGF-induced angiogenesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
