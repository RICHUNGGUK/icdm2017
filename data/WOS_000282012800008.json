The proposed topologies have been realized by employing low-voltage current mirrors as active elements. As a result, an absence. of resistors is achieved in the derived filter topologies; also only grounded capacitors are required. The resonant frequency of the filters can be electronically controlled by an appropriate dc current. In addition, the derived filters offer the feature of orthogonal adjustment between the resonant frequency and Q factor. The behavior evaluation of the proposed filters has been performed through a test chip prototype fabricated in AMS 0.35 mu m CMOS technology..", "paper_title": "Universal biquad filters using low-voltage current mirrors", "paper_id": "WOS:000282012800008"}
