A device using compound I as an emitting material exhibited luminous efficiency, power efficiency, external quantum efficiency and CIE coordinates of 337 cd/A, 1.50 lm/W, 1.87% at 20 mA/cm(2) and (0.18, 0.25) at 7 V. respectively. Furthermore, by exploiting this efficient blue fluorescent material as a blue emitting material with the combination of red phosphorescent bis(2-phenylquinoline)acetylacetonate [(pq)(2)Ir(acac)], an efficient white OLED (WOLED) with a external quantum efficiency of 1.70%, luminous efficiency of 1.38 cd/A, power efficiency of 0.94 lm/W at 20 mA/cm(2) and the color coordinates of (0.33, 0.36) at 14 V is demonstrated.
