This paper presents an algorithm to extract two novel discriminative features that describe three kinds of information: macro orientation patterns, micro ridge representation, and minutiae of fingerprints. These features, namely OrientationCodes and PolyLines, are fixed-length, easy to be measured in similarity, and effective in various stages of fingerprint matching, such as alignment, minutiae pairing, matching score computation, and matching rates fusion. In addition, the scheme of the proposed method has advantages of programming implementation, manipulating fingerprint matching much simpler and smoother at a high level. Experimental results on six data sets of FVC2002 and FVC2004 indicate the proposed algorithm not only achieves remarkably lower EERs, but also consumes significantly less computational times.
