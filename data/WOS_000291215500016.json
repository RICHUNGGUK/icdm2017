Based on the force screw theory and the minimum norm principle, a mathematical model is formulated to calculate the entire passive forces acting on the workpiece. Furthermore, a new methodology to optimizing clamping forces is put forward, on the criteria of keeping the stability of workpiece during cutting process. By this way, the intensity of clamping forces is decreased dramatically, which is the most beneficial in improving machining quality of thin-walled machined parts. Finally, a case study is made to support and validate the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Optimization of Workpiece-fixture System's Clamping Forces", "paper_id": "WOS:000291215500016"}
