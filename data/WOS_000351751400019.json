Concepts of dynamic threshold and switched resistors are proposed to improve the frequency stability against power supply and temperature variations, respectively. This design was verified in a 0.35-mu m standard CMOS process with a 3 V supply. Measurement results show the frequency drift of 0.6% from 2.4 to 4.0 V and temperature stability of 53.9 ppm/degrees C as temperature varied from -30 degrees C to 120 degrees C at a typical working frequency of 4 MHz. With the consideration of resistor and transistor matching, the oscillator was implemented in a core area of 0.05 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A Supply Voltage and Temperature Variation-Tolerant Relaxation Oscillator for Biomedical Systems Based on Dynamic Threshold and Switched Resistors", "paper_id": "WOS:000351751400019"}
