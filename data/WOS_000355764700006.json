Given the desired trajectories of human forearm positions, in the developed control, adaptive fuzzy approximators are used to estimate the dynamical uncertainties of the human-robot system, and an iterative learning scheme is utilized to compensate for unknown time-varying periodic disturbances. With the synthesis of the backstepping, iterative learning, and Lyapunov function approaches, the developed controller does not require exact knowledge of the exoskeleton model, and the close-loop system can be proven to be semiglobally uniformly bounded. Three comparison experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme by tracking periodic/repeated trajectories.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Approximation-Based Adaptive Backstepping Control of an Exoskeleton for Human Upper Limbs", "paper_id": "WOS:000355764700006"}
