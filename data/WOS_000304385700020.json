It is believed that the primary mechanism of action is associated with the pharmacological elevation of nitric oxide in the blood; however, the exact details of this are still unclear. In the current work, we investigate the atomic level details of this process using a combination of flexible-ligand/flexible-receptor virtual screening coupled with energetic analysis that decomposes interaction energies. Utilizing these methods, we were able to elucidate the previously unknown substrate binding modes of a series of hydroxyurea analogs to hemoglobin and the concomitant structural changes of the enzyme. We identify a backbone carbonyl that forms a hydrogen bond with bound substrates. Our results are consistent with kinetic and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of hydroxyurea-hemoglobin reactions, and a full mechanism is proposed that offers new insights into possibly improving substrate binding and/or reactivity.", "paper_title": "Unlocking the Binding and Reaction Mechanism of Hydroxyurea Substrates as Biological Nitric Oxide Donors", "paper_id": "WOS:000304385700020"}
