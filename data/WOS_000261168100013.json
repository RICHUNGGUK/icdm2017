[Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 ( 2004) 187901] gave a method for preparing an arbitrary quantum state with high success probability by physically transmitting some qubits, and by consuming a maximally entangled state, together with exhausting some shared random bits. In this paper, we discover that some states are impossible to be perfectly prepared by Alice and Bob initially sharing some entangled states. In particular, we present a sufficient and necessary condition for the states being enabled to be exactly prepared with probability equal to unity, in terms of the initial entangled states (maybe nonmaximally). In contrast, if the initially shared entanglement is maximal, then the probabilities for preparing these quantum states are smaller than unity. Furthermore, the lower bound on the probability for preparing some states are derived.", "paper_title": "A SUFFICIENT AND NECESSARY CONDITION FOR SUPERDENSE CODING OF QUANTUM STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000261168100013"}
