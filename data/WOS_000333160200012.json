To exhibit broad CP bandwidth that can cover the WLAN 2.4 GHz operating band, the patch antenna is fed by an L-shaped probe. To further attain conical beam radiation with peak gain of approximate to 8 dBic at +/- 30 degrees theta angle (), a 2 x 2 array type is proposed in this study, in which four circular disk patch array elements are arranged in a sequentially rotated fashion via a corporate feed network. Here, desirable 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth and 10-dB impedance bandwidth of approximate to 5% and 21% were measured. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
