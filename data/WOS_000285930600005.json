In PIOT, the concepts and formal definitions of antigen, antibody and affinity being used for time series prediction are given, and the mathematical models of immune optimization operators being used for establishing time series prediction model are exhibited. Chaotic time series is analyzed and corresponding sample space is reconstructed by phase space reconstruction method; then, the prediction model of chaotic time series is constructed by immune optimization theory; finally, using this prediction model to forecast chaotic time series. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PIOT, the three typical chaotic nonlinear time series are generated by nonlinear dynamics systems that are Lorenz, Mackey-Glass and Henon, respectively, and are used for simulating prediction. The simulation results show that PIOT is a feasible and effective prediction method, and meanwhile provides a novel prediction approach for chaotic time series.", "paper_title": "Chaotic Time Series Prediction Using Immune Optimization Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000285930600005"}
