Some unanswered questions are related to the computational power of such systems, and finding a characterization of the class of circular languages generated by circular splicing systems is still an open problem. In this paper we solve this problem for monotone complete systems, which are finite circular splicing systems with rules of a simpler form. We show that a circular language L is generated by a monotone complete system if and only if the set Lin(L) of all words corresponding to L is a pure unitary language generated by a set closed under the conjugacy relation. The class of pure unitary languages was introduced by A. Ehrenfeucht, D. Haussler, G. Rozenberg in 1983, as a subclass of the class of context-free languages, together with a characterization of regular pure unitary languages by means of a decidable property. As a direct consequence, we characterize (regular) circular languages generated by monotone complete systems. We can also decide whether the language generated by a monotone complete system is regular. Finally, we point out that monotone complete systems have the same computational power as finite simple systems, an easy type of circular splicing system defined in the literature from the very beginning, when only one rule of a specific type is allowed. From our results on monotone complete systems, it follows that finite simple systems generate a class of languages containing non-regular languages, showing the incorrectness of a longstanding result on simple systems.
