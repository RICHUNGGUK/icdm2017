We analyse a corrective selective maintenance model that identifies which components to replace in the finitely long periods of time between missions performed by a series-parallel system. We formulate this multi-mission problem as a stochastic dynamic program, and compare the resulting optimal infinite-horizon policy to both the optimal single-mission, and two-mission policies by executing a large numerical experiment. Our results indicate that these policies rarely differ, and that when they do, the difference in long-run mission reliability is minimal, which suggests that future work should concentrate on extending results for the single-mission problem.", "paper_title": "Selective Maintenance Decision-Making Over Extended Planning Horizons", "paper_id": "WOS:000269513900007"}
