After receiving both functional variables of the system and fault signals, the FDSS makes proper decisions to make up and repair the distorted situation and the affected elements of the network according to its data base established through experience gathered from expert managers and decision models properly developed. These decisions are expressed in the form of some scenarios with different desirability degrees, which are determined by some properly developed fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methods, helping the manager choose the best one according to his discretion.
