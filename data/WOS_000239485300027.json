We present an end-to-end network performance anomalies detection method, based on characterizing of the dynamic statistical properties of RTT normality. The experiment on real Internet end-to-end path RTT data shows that, the proposed method is accurate in detecting performance anomalies, it can successfully detect about 96.25% anomalies in the experiment.", "paper_title": "A resource allocating neural network based approach for detecting end-to-end network performance anomaly", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300027"}
