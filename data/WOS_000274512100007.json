However. the question regarding what classifiers should be chosen for a given situation to construct an optimal ensemble has often been debated. In addition, ensembles are often computationally expensive since they require the execution of multiple classifiers for a single classification task. To address these problems, we propose a hybrid approach for selecting and combining data mining models to construct ensembles by integrating Data Envelopment Analysis and stacking. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
