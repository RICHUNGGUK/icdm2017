The original computation domain is partitioned into nonoverlapping subdomains. The PBSV of each subdomain are evaluated independently. Then the field on the interfaces between subdomains can easily be obtained by an iterative vector summation procedure, and the final solution on each subdomain is solved independently and efficiently. To improve the algorithm further, two techniques, expanding the PBSV by roof-top basis functions and an under relaxed iteration method, are also studied. Compared with the traditional DDM, the proposed method can greatly reduce the computational complexity and the memory requirement; moreover, it can be implemented totally independently on both sequential and parallel computational platform, which is distinct from the others. The validity of this algorithm is verified by numerical examples. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
