Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem and the adaptive control theory, GPS between the two hyperchaotic systems is achieved by proposing a new adaptive controller and a novel parameters estimation up date law. Strict theoretical proof is put forward. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GPS scheme and verify the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "GENERALIZED PROJECTIVE SYNCHRONIZATION AND PARAMETERS ESTIMATION OF TWO NEW HYPERCHAOTIC SYSTEMS WITH FULLY UNCERTAIN PARAMETERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275469100008"}
