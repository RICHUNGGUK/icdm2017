We first give an alternate proof of Mader's theorem, and use it to obtain a deterministic (O) over tilde (m + r(max)(2) . n(2))-time complete edge splitting-off algorithm for unweighted graphs, where r(max) denotes the maximum edge-connectivity requirement. This improves upon the best known algorithm by Gabow by a factor of (Omega) over tilde (n). We then prove a new structural property, and use it to further speed up the algorithm to obtain a randomized (O) over tilde (m+ r(max)(3) . n)-time algorithm. These edge splitting-off algorithms can be used directly to speed up various graph algorithms.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT EDGE SPLITTING-OFF ALGORITHMS MAINTAINING ALL-PAIRS EDGE-CONNECTIVITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000323888700016"}
