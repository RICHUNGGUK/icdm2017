We show that by transferring network traffic to a mobile computing device associated with a femtocell while remotely monitoring its ingress traffic activity, any internet-connected sender can verify the cooperating receiver's location. We describe a prototype non-cryptographic location authentication system we constructed, and explain how to design both voice and data transmissions with distinct, discernible traffic signatures. Using both analytical modeling and empirical results from our implementation, we demonstrate that these signatures can be reliably detected even in the presence of heavy cross-traffic introduced by other femtocell users.", "paper_title": "Traffic Signature-Based Mobile Device Location Authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000342162100019"}
