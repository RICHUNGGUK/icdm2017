The human decision process is driven by rational reasoning, which is the capacity to use the faculty of reason to facilitate logical thinking and to derive uncertain but sensible arguments from existing knowledge and the observed fact. Knowledge refers to the accumulation and the continuous neurological organization of information via the repeated exposure to its effective usage. Functionally, a decision support system seeks to provide a systematic and human-like way to data analysis by synthesizing an expert's knowledge and reasoning capability to support the decision process of the user. However, conventional knowledge engineering and decision support systems often performed poorly when they are applied to problem domains festered with uncertain information, where the quality of the observed data is compromised by measurement noises. This paper presents T2-GenSoFNN, a brain-inspired fuzzy semantic memory model embedded with Type-2 fuzzy logic inference for learning and reasoning with noise-corrupted data. The proposed T2-GenSoFNN model is applied to the modeling of human insulin levels for the proper regulation of blood glucose concentration in diabetes therapy. The results are encouraging.", "paper_title": "A brain-inspired fuzzy semantic memory model for learning and reasoning with uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000250198500008"}
