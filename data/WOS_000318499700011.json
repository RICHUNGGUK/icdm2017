Noise is pushed to higher frequencies with the noise shaping by adding a switched capacitor. The SAR capacitor array mismatch has been compensated by the dual-polarity digital calibration with minimum circuit overhead. A proof-of-concept prototype SAR-ADC using the proposed techniques has been fabricated in a 0.5-mu m standard CMOS technology. It achieves 67.7 dB SNDR at 62.5 kHz sampling frequency, while consuming 38.3 mu W power with 1.8 V supply.", "paper_title": "A 13-bit noise shaping SAR-ADC with dual-polarity digital calibration", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499700011"}
