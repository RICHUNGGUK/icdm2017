The practical ED incorporates a non-convex objective function with several equality and inequality nonlinear constraints. As a result, solving the practical ED requires a powerful optimizer to reach the most economic dispatch solution. This paper suggests a newly introduced algorithm called Krill Herd (KH) to solve the practical ED problem considering the valve-loading effects, prohibited operating zone, spinning reserve and multi-fuel option, optimally. Also, a new modification method based on the Levy Flight movement is suggested to increase the convergence of the KH algorithm. The suggested algorithm is applied to two small size and one large size test system to demonstrate its high search ability.", "paper_title": "A new evolutionary-based intelligent method to solve the practical economic dispatch problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800024"}
