However, due to the relatively low resolution of cryo-EIM data, a major challenge is to identify components of complexes appearing in cryo-EM maps. Here, we describe EMatch, a novel integrated approach for recognizing structural homologues; of protein domains present in a 6-10 angstrom resolution cryo-EM map and constructing a quasi-atomic structural model of their assembly. The method is highly efficient and has been successfully validated on various simulated data. The strength of the method is demonstrated by a domain assembly of an experimental cryo-EM map of native GroEL at 6 angstrom resolution.", "paper_title": "EMatch: Discovery of high resolution structural homologues of protein domains in intermediate resolution cryo-EM maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000244645300005"}
