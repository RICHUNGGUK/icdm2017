The central contribution is a bijection principle between a known-radius spherical object's 3D world position and its 2D projected image curve, that we prove, thus establishing that for every possible 3D world position of the spherical object, there exists a unique curve on the image plane if the object is projected through a fisheye lens that follows equidistant projection model. Additionally, we present a setup for the experimental verification of the principle's correctness. In previously published works we have applied this principle to detect and subsequently track a known-radius spherical object. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
