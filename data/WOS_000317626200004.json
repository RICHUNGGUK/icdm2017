Moreover, we proposed an approach to select the multi-domain feature of an ERP among all extracted features and discussed determination of numbers of extracted components in NCPD and NTD regarding the ERP context.", "paper_title": "MULTI-DOMAIN FEATURE EXTRACTION FOR SMALL EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS THROUGH NONNEGATIVE MULTI-WAY ARRAY DECOMPOSITION FROM LOW DENSE ARRAY EEG", "paper_id": "WOS:000317626200004"}
