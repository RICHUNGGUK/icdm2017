However, direct reconstruction of cyclic feature may not be practical due to the relative high processing complexity. In this paper, we propose a new cyclic feature recovery approach based on the reconstruction of autocorrelation sequence from sub-Nyquist samples, which can reduce the computation complexity and memory consumption significantly, while the recovery performance remains well in the same compressive ratio. Through theoretical analyses and simulations, we conducted to show and verify our statements and conclusions.", "paper_title": "Low Complexity Cyclic Feature Recovery Based on Compressed Sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000363588900001"}
