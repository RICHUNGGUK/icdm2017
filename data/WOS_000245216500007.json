By the Hirota bilinear form for both flows, we find new bilinear system for these equations, and one- and two-soliton solutions. For special values of parameters our solutions show resonance behaviour with creation of four virtual solitons. We first time created four virtual soliton resonance solution for KP-II and established relations of it with degenerate four-soliton solution in the Hirota-Satsuma bilinear form for KP-II. Our approach allows one to interpret the resonance soliton as a composite object of two dissipative solitons in 1 + 1 dimensions. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
