Xia, Y. Zhao, J.H. Yeo, An immersed membrane method for simulation of fluid-structure interaction in bio-fluid flows, in: 1st International BioEngineering Conference (IBEC 2004) 08-10 September 2004]. The novel feature of the method presented is that it employs a unique combination of a parallel multi-grid scheme with low-Mach-number preconditioning and the IMM so that 3D unsteady low-Mach-number flows with arbitrarily moving objects can be efficiently simulated.
