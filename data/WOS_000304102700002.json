The themes are detected, quantified and visualized using an approach that combines performance analysis and science mapping. Bibliometric maps based on co-word analysis will help us to visualize the division of the journal into several subfields and their relationships, providing interesting insight into the main topics being discussed in the journal in these years. In addition, the study will show the most productive themes (according to published papers) and the most impacting ones (according to received citations).", "paper_title": "A CONCEPTUAL SNAPSHOT OF THE FIRST DECADE (2002-2011) OF THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000304102700002"}
