Restoration of such images is highly dependent on estimation of motion blur parameters. Since 1976, many researchers have developed algorithms to estimate linear motion blur parameters. These algorithms are different in their performance, time complexity, precision and robustness in noisy environments. In this paper, we have presented a novel algorithm to estimate linear motion blur parameters such as direction and length. We used Radon transform to find direction and bispectrum, modeling to find the length of motion. Our algorithm is based on the combination of spatial and frequency domain analysis. The great benefit of our algorithm is its robustness and precision in noisy images. We used statistical measures to prove goodness of our model. Our method was tested on 80 standard images that were degraded with different directions and motion lengths, with additive Gaussian noise. The error tolerance average of the estimated parameters was 0.9 degrees in direction and 0.95 pixel in length and the standard deviations were 0.69 and 0.85, respectively.
