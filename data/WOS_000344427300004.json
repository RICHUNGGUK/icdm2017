It is assumed that the demand is price- and ramp-type time-dependent. The selling season for the deteriorating product is fixed. The decision maker needs to set up the price and the production schedule at the beginning of the season. Although the profit function is not concave in general, the optimal price can be determined efficiently through a simple algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
