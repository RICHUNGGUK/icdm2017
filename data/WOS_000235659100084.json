Our design and implementation of intelligent transportation information service systems (ITIS) focuses on integrating heterogeneous data, transportation systems, and resources by using the grid technique. The ITIS project will refine and summarize the business model in Shanghai transportation information service system, design and set up open standards for intelligent transportation information service and simulation, develop grid supporting platform for transportation information service, integrate and fuse massive dynamic transportation data and legacy transportation systems, construct high performance computing (HPC) platform and dynamic parallel transportation simulation platform. ITIS will provide various high-level transportation information services for both citizens and government, which include optimal dynamic bus riding planning service, dynamic on-board navigation service, bus arrival-time prediction service, network optimization and simulation system, large-scale traffic-flow simulation system. Using these services will help to reduce the traffic congestion and other traffic problems, enhancing the transportation intelligence.", "paper_title": "Towards building intelligent transportation information service system on grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100084"}
