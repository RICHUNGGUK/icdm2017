A major part of TeraGrid's wide initiative to broaden its user base is the Science Gateways program. To explain the program's conceptual basis and illustrate supporting services that have evolved within TeraGrid, the authors highlight four successful science gateways: the Computational Chemistry Grid (GridChem), Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD), nanoHUB.org, and the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG).", "paper_title": "TeraGrid Science Gateways and Their Impact on Science", "paper_id": "WOS:000260722700011"}
