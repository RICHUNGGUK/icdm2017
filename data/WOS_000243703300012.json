In this paper, we investigate series-parallel multisignature schemes for multi-messages and propose an ID-SP-M4M scheme based on pairings in which signers in the same subgroup sign the same message, and those in different subgroups sign different messages. Our new scheme is an improvement over the series-parallel multisignature schemes introduced by Doi et a]. [6]-[8] and subsequent results such as the schemes proposed by Burmester et al. [41 and the original protocols proposed by Tada [20], [2 1], in which only one message is to be signed. Furthermore, our ID-SP-M4M scheme is secure against forgery signature attack from parallel insiders under the BDH assumption.", "paper_title": "An ID-SP-M4M scheme and its security analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703300012"}
