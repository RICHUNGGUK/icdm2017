The resulting project scheduling problems involve coordinating hundreds of testing and manufacturing activities over a period of several quarters. Most conventional integer programming approaches are computationally impractical for problems of this size, while priority rule-driven heuristics seldom provide consistent solution quality. We propose a Lagrangian decomposition (LD) heuristic that exploits the special structure of these problems. Some resources (typically manpower) are shared across all on-going projects while others (typically equipment) are specific to individual project categories. Our objective function is a weighted discounted cost expressed in terms of activity completion times. The LD heuristics were subjected to a comprehensive experimental study based on typical operational instances. While the conventional \"Reward-Risk\" priority rule heuristic generates duality gaps between 47-58%, the best LD heuristic achieves duality gaps between 10-20%. The LD heuristics also yield makespan reductions of' over 30% over the Reward-Risk priority rule.", "paper_title": "Lagrangian heuristics for scheduling new product development projects in the pharmaceutical industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000250300800001"}
