The control technique, based on Ramptime current control technique, uses multisampling as the sampling strategy that results in a high accuracy of control. In an active power filter experiment, compared with the original Ramptime current control, the performance of the Digital Ramptime current control is found to be satisfactory.", "paper_title": "Design and Development of Digital Ramptime Current Control Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700043"}
