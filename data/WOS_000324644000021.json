ES structure is modeled on the basis of a limited conformational subspace of the Ramachandran plot. The model distinguishes seven structural motifs corresponding to seven local probability maxima within the limited conformational subspace. Three of these are assigned to well-defined secondary structures, while the remaining four are found to represent various types of random coils. The presented heuristic approach also provides insight into the reasons behind incorrect predictions occurring when the folding process depends on external factors (e.g., ligands, ions or other proteins) rather than on the characteristics of the backbone itself. The accuracy of the presented method is estimated at around 48 %.", "paper_title": "Hypothetical in silico model of the early-stage intermediate in protein folding", "paper_id": "WOS:000324644000021"}
