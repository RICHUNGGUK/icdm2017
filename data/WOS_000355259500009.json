This application focuses on the mitigation of environmental temperature variation effects that occur in the transmission links that impact the expected magnitude of the autocorrelation peak in the users' code. The FLC system, whose input variables are the propagation distances and the estimated temperature changes, is installed in the network receivers. This system sets the threshold detection level according to the variations of the environmental temperature provided by external sensors. Calibration of the fuzzy control requires a priori knowledge of the analytical response of the OCDMA channels. The simulation results show that the network performance can be significantly improved when the proposed approach is employed.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Logic Control for the Mitigation of Environmental Temperature Variations in OCDMA Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355259500009"}
