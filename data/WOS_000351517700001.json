The development of the control system has introduced varieties of control strategies depending on the application. This paper reviews some control systems used for prosthetics, orthotics, and exoskeletons. The advantages and limitations of different control systems for particular applications have been discussed and presented in a comparative manner to help in deciding the appropriate method for pertinent application.", "paper_title": "Development of a control system for artificially rehabilitated limbs: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000351517700001"}
