In the framework of the input delay approach and the linear matrix inequality technique, two delay-dependent criteria are derived to ensure the stochastic stability of the error systems, and thus, the master systems stochastically synchronize with the slave systems. The desired mode-independent controller is designed, which depends upon the maximum sampling interval. The effectiveness and potential of the obtained results is verified by two simulation examples.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Synchronization of Markovian Jump Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay Using Sampled Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000327647500024"}
