These approaches cannot always take into account the dynamic behavior of applications, dynamicity in the execution environment or the heterogeneity of the execution platform. Transparent deployment algorithms are necessary for automizing and optimizing application distribution. The Adaptive Distributed Applications in Java (ADAJ) project deals with placement and migration of Java objects. It automatically deploys parallel Java applications on a cluster of workstations using monitoring information about the application behavior. The transparency obtained through the integration of these tools in the middleware makes such an environment easy to use and improves efficiency.
