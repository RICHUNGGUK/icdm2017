Therefore these parameters may admit a representation as fuzzy numbers. In this paper, we show how multi-criteria decision theory can be used to deal with a fuzzy linear production problem and with the associated fuzzy linear production game.", "paper_title": "A MULTI-OBJECTIVE APPROACH TO FUZZY LINEAR PRODUCTION GAMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000325419500004"}
