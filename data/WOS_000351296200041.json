In this paper, we consider unrelated parallel-machine scheduling problems with discrete controllable processing times. The processing time of a job is discretely controllable by the allocation of indivisible resources. The planner must make decisions on whether or how to allocate resources to jobs during the scheduling horizon to optimize the performance measures. The objective is to minimize the total cost including the cost measured by a standard criterion and the total processing cost. We first consider three scheduling criterions: the total completion time, the total machine load, and the total earliness and tardiness penalties. If the number of machines and the number of possible processing times are fixed, we develop polynomial time algorithms for the considered problems. We then consider the minimization problem of the makespan cost plus the total processing cost and present an integer programming method and a heuristic method to solve the studied problem.
