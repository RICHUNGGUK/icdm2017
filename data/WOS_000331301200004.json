The proposed smart home recommender system addresses these issues by continuously interpreting the user's current situation and recommending services that fit the user's habits, i.e. automate some action that the user would want to perform anyway. With these recommendations it is possible to build much simpler user interfaces that highlight the most interesting choices currently available. Configuration becomes much more flexible, since the recommender system automatically learns user habits. Evaluations on two smart home datasets show that the algorithm produces correct recommendations with 61% and 73% accuracy, respectively.", "paper_title": "An unsupervised recommender system for smart homes", "paper_id": "WOS:000331301200004"}
