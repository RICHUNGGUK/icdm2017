Almost all the models at hand are not applicable online, although online prediction, especially for air quality parameters forecasting, has very important significance for real-world applications. A support vector machine (SVM), as a novel and powerful machine learning tool, can be used for time-series prediction and has been reported to perform well by some promising results. This paper develops an online SVM model to predict air pollutant levels in an advancing time-series based on the monitored air pollutant database in Hong Kong downtown area. The experimental comparison between the online SVM model and the conventional SVM model (non-online SVM model) demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency in predicting air quality parameters with different time series.
