Our extension provides a tool that measures the amount of anonymity retained during data mining. We show that our model can be applied to various data mining problems, such as classification, association rule mining and clustering. We describe two data mining algorithms which exploit our extension to guarantee they will generate only k-anonymous output, and provide experimental results for one of them. Finally, we show that our method contributes new and efficient ways to anonymize data and preserve patterns during anonymization.", "paper_title": "Providing k-anonymity in data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000256765700008"}
