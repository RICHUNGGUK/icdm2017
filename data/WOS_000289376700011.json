The protocol does not disclose any unique identifier that is bound to user's identity. By verifying user's role the protocol can convince service the user is valid and his role is acceptable. Protocol can achieve the goal of authentication and meet identity privacy requirement at the same time. Protocol analysis indicates the protocol is easy to cooperate with role-based authorization and is safer than multi-server authentication schema. Simulation proves the protocol satisfies both authentication and identity privacy requirements. Protocol is safe and easy to realize.
