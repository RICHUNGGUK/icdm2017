Assuming a natural coordinate description of the system, its kinematics equations are derived in the form of a driftless control system with three controls. The motion planning problem is stated, and solved by means of a Jacobian algorithm resulting from the endogenous configuration space approach. Solutions of example motion planning problems are obtained by numeric computations.", "paper_title": "Kinematics and Motion Planning of the Multi-Bar System", "paper_id": "WOS:000337053500003"}
