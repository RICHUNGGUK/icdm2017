The emergency response process are described based on the ideas from ODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop theory. Pointing at the difficulty in the described the cooperation in the emergency response process, the coupled ODA framework is built to analyze the interaction between the emergency response units. In order to demonstrate the emergency response mechanism in theoretic way, the simulation theory of DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) is adopted to build up the simulator model of the basic OODA process framework. Utilize the coupled DEVS model to build the simulation coordinator of the coupled ODA process framework. The earthquake disaster response scenario in STAGE is built on the emergency response mechanism, and the emergency collaborative rescue process based on coupled OODA frameworks is adopted to build up the emergency response system, and the simulation results show reasonable.
