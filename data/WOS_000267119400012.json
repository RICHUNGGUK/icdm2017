IP spoofing makes it difficult for the victim to determine the packet's origin. There is a need for a mechanism that could enable real-time traceback of the origins of the attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol, fast autonomous system traceback (FAST) to traceback to the attack originating autonomous systems (AS). The multifold advantages of FAST include reconstruction requires just around 5-10 packets and reconstruction takes just a few seconds. We validate the performance through extensive simulations over the datasets obtained from traceroute. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
