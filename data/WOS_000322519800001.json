Since the amount of sensing data may be large and sensor nodes are usually battery-powered, it is critical to design energy-efficient routing algorithms to prolong network lifetime. Given a certain sensor deployment, the routing strategy of sensor data would have profound effects on the communication cost. In this paper, based on low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) series protocols which are low-energy consumption adaptive clustering routing protocols, we propose the OVSF mechanism based routing protocol and EERPP (Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol based on Priority). Simulation results of OVSF mechanism based protocol and EERPP demonstrate a significant improvement on the network metrics such as the lifetime and the end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Routing Algorithms Based on OVSF Code and Priority in Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322519800001"}
