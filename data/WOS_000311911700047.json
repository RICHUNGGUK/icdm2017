The existence of positive solutions for the above problem is established by applying the fixed point index theorems under some weaker conditions concerning the first eigenvalue corresponding to the relevant linear operator. The results obtained herein generalize and improve some known results including singular and non-singular cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
