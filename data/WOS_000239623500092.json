Tunneling is a heuristic-based method that solves global optimization problem. In this paper we use content block algorithm to enhance focused crawler's ability of traversing tunnel. The novel Algorithm not only avoid granularity too coarse when evaluation on the whole page but also avoid granularity too fine based on link-context. A comprehensive experiment has been conducted, the result shows obviously that this approach outperforms BestFirst and Anchor text algorithm both in harvest ratio and efficiency.", "paper_title": "A new method for focused crawler cross tunnel", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500092"}
