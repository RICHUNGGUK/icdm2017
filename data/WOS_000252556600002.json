In recent years, several approaches that use metaheuristic search techniques to automatically obtain the test inputs have been proposed. Although work in this field is very active, little attention has been paid to the selection of an appropriate search space. The present work describes an alternative to this issue. More precisely, two approaches which employ an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm as the metaheuristic technique are explained. In both cases, different regions are considered in the search for the test inputs. Moreover, to depart from a region near to the one containing the optimum, the definition of the initial search space incorporates static information extracted from the source code of the software under test. If this information is not enough to complete the definition, then a grid search method is used. According to the results of the experiments conducted, it is concluded that this is a promising option that can be used to enhance the test data generation process.", "paper_title": "Dynamic search space transformations for software test data generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252556600002"}
