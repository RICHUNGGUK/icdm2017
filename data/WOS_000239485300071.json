The presented model greatly improves the prediction performance of the single SVMs model in forecasting futures prices. In our experiment, the performance of the hybrid is evaluated using futures prices. Experimental results indicate that the hybrid model outperforms the individual SVMs models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) metric. This hybrid model yields better forecasting result than the SVMs model.", "paper_title": "A hybrid support vector machines and discrete wavelet transform model in futures price forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300071"}
