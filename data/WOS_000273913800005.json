The recently introduced modified divergence information criterion is used and compared with traditional selection criteria like the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz information criterion (SIC). The appropriateness of the selected model is tested for one- and five-step ahead predictions with the use of the normalized mean squared forecast errors (NMSFE).", "paper_title": "Forecasting ARMA models: a comparative study of information criteria focusing on MDIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000273913800005"}
