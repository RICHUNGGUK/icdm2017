Different diagnostic approaches according to medical as well as to psychosocial and cultural characteristics of patients are usually followed. In this paper, a GA (genetic algorithm) driven intelligent system (GADIS) for diagnosis of male impotence is presented. The rule-base of GADIS has been constructed by using a genetic algorithm for rule extraction from a patients database. Experimental results show a very good diagnostic performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the intelligent system. The rule-base can be refined each time the patient database is updated over a limit.", "paper_title": "A GA driven intelligent system for medical diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000116"}
