In this paper, we propose an improved TMFPGA architecture to simplify the precedence constraints so that the number of the registers among sub-circuits can be reduced for sequential circuits partitioning. To demonstrate the practicability of the architecture, we also present a greedy algorithm to minimize the maximum number of the registers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectives of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED TIME-MULTIPLEXED FPGA ARCHITECTURE AND ALGORITHM FOR MINIMIZING COMMUNICATION COST DESIGNS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318791500005"}
