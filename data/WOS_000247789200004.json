It involves robot and ball dynamic behaviour and focuses mainly on their collisions study. Vital parts of the simulator are explained and modelled in more detail, beginning with the simple model of ball and robot motion and continuing with a more complex approximate collisions models, where the real robot shape is taken into consideration. Some new ideas of collision formulation, realization and real robot shape inclusion are used. The implementation of the simulator is described and advantages for the usage of the realistic simulator are stated. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
