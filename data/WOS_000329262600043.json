The present method adds consistent numerical diffusion terms to robustly capture interface discontinuities, while maintaining the velocity, pressure, and temperature equilibriums at interfaces. Analysis of the numerical errors generated at the interfaces leads to a proposal of new consistent numerical diffusion terms. The method solves a fully conservative form of the total mass, momentum, total energy, and species-mass, and an additional advection form of the specific heats ratio to preserve the pressure oscillation-free property at the interfaces. Several one- and two-dimensional problems are used to verify the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
