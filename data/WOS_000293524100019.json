LiDAR data is appropriate to reconstruct urban models. In urban scenes, the individual surfaces can be reconstructed and connected to form the scene geometry. There are various methods for reconstructing the free-form shape of a point sample on a single surface. However, these methods do not take the context of the surface into account. We present the guided alpha-shape: an extension of the well known alpha-shape that uses lines (guides) to indicate preferred locations for the boundary of the shape. The guided alpha-shape uses (parts of) these lines as boundary where the points suggest that this is appropriate. We prove that the guided alpha-shape can be constructed in O((n + m) log (n + m)) time, from an input of n points and m guides. We apply guided alpha-shapes to urban reconstruction from LiDAR, where neighboring surfaces can be connected conveniently along their intersection lines into adjacent surfaces of a 3D model. We analyze guided alpha-shapes of both synthetic and real data and show they are consistently better than alpha-shapes for this application.", "paper_title": "On the shape of a set of points and lines in the plane", "paper_id": "WOS:000293524100019"}
