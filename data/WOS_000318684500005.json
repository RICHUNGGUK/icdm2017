There still was not satisfying solution to monitor energy consumption of every sensor node in large-scale wireless sensor network. In this paper, we propose a new real-time energy monitoring schema as a function component of WSN testbed (sensor network assistant platform, SNAP). Our monitoring schema has the following advantages: real-time accurate energy measurement, the ability to cope with large-scale WSN, side effect free to the monitored nodes, highly adaptive to different kinds of sensor nodes and supporting further energy efficiency analysis on nodes. Noted that all of these advantages are based on SNAP, we introduce the architecture and implementation of our proposed schema together with the counterpart of SNAP. Then we use experimental results to evaluate and demonstrate the performance of this energy consumption monitoring schema.", "paper_title": "Energy consumption monitoring for sensor nodes in SNAP", "paper_id": "WOS:000318684500005"}
