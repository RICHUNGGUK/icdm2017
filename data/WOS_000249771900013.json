This paper uses ideas and inspiration from early infant psychology (up to three months of age) to examine how robot systems could discover the structure of their local sensory-motor spaces and learn how to coordinate these for the control of action. An experimental learning model is described and results from robotic experiments using the model are presented and discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
