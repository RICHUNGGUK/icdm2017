We assume that the CRs are equipped with sectorized antennas, an antenna model we use to describe different types of directional antennas with a low hardware overhead (e.g. only a single RF front-end). We first derive the bias and mean square error (MSE) of RSS and DoA estimates based on the simplified least square (SLS) algorithm. We then proceed to derive the theoretical MSE of PU localization using the Stansfield algorithm that fuses SLS estimates from multiple nodes. Simulation results studying the impact of various system parameters on the RSS/DoA estimation and localization accuracy are presented to verify theoretical derivations, as well as provide design guidelines for localization systems based on sectorized antennas.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Primary User RSS/DoA Estimation and Localization in Cognitive Radio Networks Using Sectorized Antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681200030"}
