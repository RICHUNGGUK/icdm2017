In this paper we present a new graph model, called the conjugate conflict continuation graph, for multilayer CVM with stacked vias. This graph model eases the handling of stacked via problems. An integer linear programming (ILP) formulation and a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm based on this graph model are developed to solve multilayer CVM. The ILP model is too complicated to solve efficiently. The SA algorithm on average achieves 6.4% via reduction for layouts obtained using a commercial tool under a set of practical constraints in which the metal wires (including pins) used in cell layouts, power rails and rings, and clock routing are treated as obstacles or fixed-layer objects to a multilayer CVM.
