Also, a new first-order all-pass filter that compensates for some C-CDBA non-idealities is given as an application example. The all-pass filter circuit has low output impedance for easy cascadability and it can be made electronically tunable using the proposed C-CDBA implementation. The theoretical results are verified with SPICE simulations.", "paper_title": "NEW ALL-PASS FILTER CIRCUIT COMPENSATING FOR C-CDBA NON-IDEALITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000275469300005"}
