Nonetheless, these mechanisms have not been designed through formal approaches and thereby some important design issues such as effectiveness and optimality have remained unresolved. This paper utilizes game theory to propose a series of optimal puzzle-based strategies for handling increasingly sophisticated flooding attack scenarios. In doing so, the solution concept of Nash equilibrium is used in a prescriptive way, where the defender takes his part in the solution as an optimum defense against rational attackers. This study culminates in a strategy for handling distributed attacks from an unknown number of sources.", "paper_title": "A Puzzle-Based Defense Strategy Against Flooding Attacks Using Game Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000274193600003"}
