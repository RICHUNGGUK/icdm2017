Methods: Real-time teleconferences and live demonstrations with medical-quality videos, broadcast via the Digital Video Transport System, have been used to teach surgical techniques and other medical procedures across national borders. The Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) committee in August 2005 formally approved our proposal to establish a medical working group within APAN. The network was expanded by the launch of the Trans-Eurasia Information Network 2 in 2006. By the end of 2006, we had conducted 82 events, in 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The multi-station event has increased every year. Results: There have been no serious transmission problems or ethical conflicts so for. With these experiences and current achievements, we hope to extend this advanced network system to the entire Asia-Pacific. Conclusion: This system is a promising and very useful tool for the standardization of medical system and procedures across national borders. Drawing upon these experiences and current achievements, we hope to extend this advanced network system to the entire Asia-Pacific region.", "paper_title": "Development of a broadband telemedical network based on internet protocol in the Asia-Pacific region", "paper_id": "WOS:000251934500015"}
