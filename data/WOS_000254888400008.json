The convective flux terms are discretized by using the modified advection upstream splitting method (AUSM). The developed scheme is used to compute the one-dimensional Burgers equation and four different example problems of supersonic compressible flows, respectively. The results show that the high-resolution upwind compact scheme based oil modified AUSM+ flux splitting can capture shock wave and other discontinuities, obtain higher resolution and restrain numerical oscillation.
