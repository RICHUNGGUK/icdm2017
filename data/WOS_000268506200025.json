For each scanline of a path, it adaptively selects a left or right scanning direction that minimizes the number of pixels visited during scanning. According to the experimental results, the proposed algorithm reduces the number of pixels visited by 6 to 37% relative to that with a constant scanning direction for all the scanlines.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Scanline Filling Algorithm for OpenVG 2D Vector Graphics Accelerator", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506200025"}
