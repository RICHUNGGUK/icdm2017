After giving a compact multicommodity flow formulation of the problem, we state a decomposition property obtained from projecting out the flow variables. This property considerably simplifies the resulting polyhedral analysis and computations by doing away with metric inequalities. Then we focus on a specific choice of the uncertainty description, called the \"hose model,\" which specifies aggregate traffic upper bounds for selected endpoints of the network. We study the polyhedral aspects of the NLP under hose demand uncertainty and use the results as the basis of an efficient branch-and-cut algorithm. The results of extensive computational experiments on well-known network design instances are reported.", "paper_title": "The Robust Network Loading Problem Under Hose Demand Uncertainty: Formulation, Polyhedral Analysis, and Computations", "paper_id": "WOS:000287841500006"}
