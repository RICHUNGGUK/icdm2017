PDDSs constitute a generalization of perfect Lee codes, diameter perfect codes, as well as other codes and dominating sets. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of PDDSs. PDDSs related to the application will be constructed and the non-existence of some PDDSs will be shown. In addition, an extension of the long-standing Golomb-Welch conjecture, in terms of PDDS, will be stated. We note that all constructed PDDSs are lattice-like which is a very important feature from the practical point of view as in this case decoding algorithms tend to be much simpler.", "paper_title": "A generalization of Lee codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000329240200008"}
