As such, analyzing those websites and discovering customers' purchasing power, the present study tends to propose a framework and an appropriate structure to make the websites more flexible and highly functional. Such an efficient and effective framework facilitates customers' purchasing capacities. In this framework, different techniques and methods including the genetic algorithm, neural networks, and collaborative filtering are utilized. The pre- and post-execution data show that the proposed framework changes the website structure based on the two criteria, i.e., sales conversion rate and average pre-purchase page views and finally leading to improved website usability.", "paper_title": "A framework for improving e-commerce websites usability using a hybrid genetic algorithm and neural network system", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552000020"}
