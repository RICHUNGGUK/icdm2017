Using Hamiltonian function method, this article investigates robust adaptive control design for synchronous generators with such a unit, and proposes an energy-based robust adaptive controller for the systems with disturbances and unknown parameters. The generator used in this article is a 4th order model with both excitation and steam valve controls. It is shown that the generator with one SMES unit can be changed as a dissipative Hamiltonian system, with which the energy-based robust adaptive control law can be designed for the system by using the structural properties of dissipative Hamiltonian systems. Study on simulations shows that the controller proposed in this article works very well.", "paper_title": "Robust adaptive control of synchronous generators with SMES unit via Hamiltonian function method", "paper_id": "WOS:000244844900001"}
