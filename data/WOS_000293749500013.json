In this brief, we evaluate a way in which a cerebellar-like structure can store a model in the granular and molecular layers. Furthermore, we study how its microstructure and input representations (context labels and sensorimotor signals) can efficiently support model abstraction toward delivering accurate corrective torque values for increasing precision during different-object manipulation. We also describe how the explicit (object-related input labels) and implicit state input representations (sensorimotor signals) complement each other to better handle different models and allow interpolation between two already stored models. This facilitates accurate corrections during manipulations of new objects taking advantage of already stored models.", "paper_title": "Cerebellar Input Configuration Toward Object Model Abstraction in Manipulation Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000293749500013"}
