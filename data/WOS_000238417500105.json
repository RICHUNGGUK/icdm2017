In this paper, we propose to use support vector machines for regression applied to software metrics to predict software quality. In experiments we compare this method with other regression techniques such as Multivariate Linear Regression, Conjunctive Rule and Locally Weighted Regression. Results on benchmark dataset MIS, using mean absolute error, and correlation coefficient as regression performance measures, indicate that support vector machines regression is a promising technique for software quality prediction. In addition, our investigation of PCA based metrics extraction shows that using the first few Principal Components (PC) we can still get relatively good performance.", "paper_title": "Support vector machines for regression and applications to software quality prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500105"}
