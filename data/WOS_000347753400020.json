A state estimator is designed to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that the resulted error dynamics is stochastically finite-time stable. By stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, sufficient conditions are derived for the error dynamics to be stochastic finite-time stable. The desired state estimator is designed via linear matrix inequality technique. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
