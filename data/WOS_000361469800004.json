The key difficulty in graph classification lies in selecting a subset of optimal features from a huge number of structural features. The features need to be highly discriminative and small in numbers for better classification accuracy and running time. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection framework that selects an optimal feature subset by removing redundant subgraphs. Topologically similar subgraphs have similar discriminative powers and coverage. We cluster these subgraphs and select one subgraph as a feature. We also propose an efficient topological similarity-based clustering method that guarantees the efficiency of our framework. Empirical results show that the proposed framework achieves significantly improved classification accuracy and running time in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Topological Similarity-Based Feature Selection for Graph Classiinot signcation", "paper_id": "WOS:000361469800004"}
