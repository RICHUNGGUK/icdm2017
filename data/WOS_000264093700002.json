It is based on a functional that shares a common set of minimizers with Ivanenko's harmonic functional [A.A. Charakhch'yan, S.A. Ivanenko, Curvilinear grids of convex quadrilaterals, Comput. Maths. Math. Phys. 28(2) (1988) 126-133.]. An unconstrained optimization process related to a continuation parameter is used to guarantee the convexity of the grid cells. Several numerical examples of grids generated on quite irregular 2Dregions, show the effective performance of the proposed method and its robustness when preset monitor functions are, given.
