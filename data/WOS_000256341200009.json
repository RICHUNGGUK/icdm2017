We generalize existing methods to any linear, differential operator order on the combined field while keeping the projection onto the isophote normal constant. We discuss invariant flow fields, present a novel iterative solution based on Euler-Lagrange equations, prove continuous convergence, and give synthetic examples for common energy functionals. Possible uses are: estimating physical flow in image sequences, estimating human growth processes, and co-warping textures in animation sequences.", "paper_title": "Guessing tangents in normal flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000256341200009"}
