The input parameters consist of the phase saturation, media permeability, capillary entry pressure, viscosity ratio, density ratio, temperature, pore size distribution index, porosity and domain volume with corresponding output t obtained at different domain scales. Different ANN configurations as well as linear and nonlinear multivariate regression models were tested using a number of performance criteria. Findings in this work showed that the ANN structures with double hidden layers perform better than those with a single hidden layer. In particular, the ANN configuration with 13 and 15 neurons in the first and second hidden layers, respectively, performed the best. Using this best-performing ANN, effects of increased domain size were predicted for three separate experimental results obtained from literature and our laboratory with different domain scales. Results showed increased magnitude of t as the domain size increases for all the independent experimental data considered. This work shows the applicability and techniques of using ANNs in the prediction of scale dependence of two-phase flow parameters.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural network modeling of scale-dependent dynamic capillary pressure effects in two-phase flow in porous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000354700800009"}
