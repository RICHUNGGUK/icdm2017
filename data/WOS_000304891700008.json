A representation taking (1 + epsilon)n lg n + O(1) bits suffices to compute arbitrary powers in constant time, for any positive constant epsilon <= 1. A representation taking the optimal inverted right perpendicularlg n!inverted left perpendicular o(n) bits can be used to compute arbitrary powers in O(lg n/lg lg n) time. We then consider the more general problem of succinctly representing an arbitrary function, f : [n] -> [n] that f(k)(i) can be computed quickly for any land any integer power k. We give a representation that takes (1 + epsilon)n lg n O(1) bits, for any positive constant epsilon <= 1, and computes arbitrary positive powers in constant time. It can also be used to compute f(k)(i), for any negative integer k, in optimal O(1+ [f(k)(i)]) time. We place emphasis on the redundancy, or the space beyond the information-theoretic lower bound that the data structure uses in order to support operations efficiently. A number of lower bounds have recently been shown on the redundancy of data structures. These lower bounds confirm the space-time optimality of some of our solutions. Furthermore, the redundancy of one of our structures \"surpasses\" a recent lower bound by Golynski [Golynski, SODA 2009], thus demonstrating the limitations of this lower bound.
