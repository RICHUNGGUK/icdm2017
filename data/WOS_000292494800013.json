In this paper we investigate the extension of the MCS scheme to two-dimensional convection-diffusion equations with a mixed derivative. Both necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameter theta of the scheme are derived concerning unconditional stability in the von Neumann sense. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
