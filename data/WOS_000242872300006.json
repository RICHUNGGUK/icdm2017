Disjunctions in the logic can be indexed by arbitrary sets (as in geometric logic) but must be provably disjoint. This raises several technical issues which have to be addressed before clean notions of axiom system and theory can be defined. We show soundness and completeness of the proof system with respect to distributive disjunctive semilattices, and prove that every such semilattice arises as the Lindenbaum algebra of a disjunctive theory. Via stable Stone duality, we show how to use disjunctive propositional logic for a logical description of algebraic L-domains. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
