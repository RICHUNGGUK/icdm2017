Although there have been many approaches proposed for animating quadrupeds, there is not much research on synthesizing horse locomotion. In this paper, we present a horse locomotion synthesis approach. A user can arbitrarily change a horse's moving speed and direction, and our system would automatically adjust the horse's motion to fulfill the user's commands. At preprocessing, we manually capture horse locomotion data from Eadweard Muybridge's famous photographs of animal locomotion and expand the captured motion database to various speeds for each gait. At runtime, our approach automatically changes gaits based on speed, synthesizes the horse's root trajectory, and adjusts its body orientation based on the horse's turning direction. We propose an asynchronous time warping approach to handle gait transition, which is critical for generating realistic and controllable horse locomotion. Our experiments demonstrate that our system can produce smooth, rich, and controllable horse locomotion in real time.
