Several challenges exist in Bluetooth scatternet formation and routing, since nodes can arrive and depart at arbitrary times. In this paper, novel route maintenance algorithms are proposed for the Bluetooth ad hoc networks, where nodes can enter or exit from the piconets time to time. Our protocols guarantee the connectivity among nodes and reconstruct the routes dynamically by considering location information of the nodes. Besides, it is proposed how to reduce the number of hops and to form the shortest route between the source and the destination due to addition of new nodes to a piconet. Performance analysis of our protocols show that they outperform in terms of end to end transmission delay, bandwidth consumption and average hop counts as compared to similar Bluetooth routing protocols that we have considered.
