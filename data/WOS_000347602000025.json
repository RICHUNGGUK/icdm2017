In the univariate case we show the connection of our method to the optimization problem formulated by Karmarkar and Lakshman for the nearest GCD. In the multivariate case we generalize the expressions of Karmarkar and Lakshman, and give explicitly several iteration functions to compute the optimum. The arithmetic complexity of the iterations is detailed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
