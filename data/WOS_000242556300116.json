This serves as an alternative forecasting rebalance quantitative model to the popular global assets allocation, in which the portfolio is first being observed in contrast with major asset and sub-assets classes which possess upward and downward positive co-movement phenomenon while considering the linkage of cross-market between different timezones. In addition, fuzzy scenarios clustering would be induced into the MV model so as to adjust the weighting of the risk-return structural matrices. It could further enhance the efficient frontier of a portfolio as well as obtaining opportunity of excess return. By means of global major market indices as the empirical evidences, it shows that the new approach can provide a more efficient frontier for a portfolio and there would be less computational cost to solve MV model.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy scenarios clustering-based approach with MV model in optimizing tactical allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300116"}
