This problem which minimizes a mix of these criteria is in the NP-hard class of problems. Hence, inevitably we make use of meta-heuristic methods to tackle large scale problems. In this paper two meta-heuristics such as genetic algorithm and hybrid kangaroo simulated annealing are taken into consideration. Taguchi method is employed to tune the parameters of these algorithms and analyze the parameters of the studying problem simultaneously. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
