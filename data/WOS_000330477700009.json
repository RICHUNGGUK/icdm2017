Survivability is a crucial issue in OFDM-based flexible optical networks. Recently we proposed a new survivable multipath provisioning scheme (MPP) that efficiently supports demands with flexible protection requirement in OFDM-based optical networks and studied the static survivable multipath routing and spectrum allocation (SM-RSA) problem, which aims to accommodate a given set of demands with minimum utilized spectrum. We have showed that the MPP scheme achieves higher spectral efficiency than the traditional single-path provisioning (SPP) scheme. In this paper, we study the dynamic SM-RSA problem, which selects multiple routes and allocates spectrum on these routes for a given demand as it arrives at the network. We develop an integer linear programming (ILP) model as well as a heuristic algorithm for the dynamic SM-RSA problem. We conduct simulations to study the advantage of MPP over SPP for the dynamic traffic scenario in terms of blocking performance and fairness. We also compare the performance of the MPP heuristic algorithm and the ILP model.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Survivable Multipath Routing and Spectrum Allocation in OFDM-Based Flexible Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330477700009"}
