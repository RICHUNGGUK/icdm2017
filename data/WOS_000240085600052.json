In particular, we show that surprisingly simple forms of such constraints lead to undecidability of the associated logical implication problem if they are allowed within the scope of a negation or on the left-hand-side of inclusion dependencies. We then show that allowing a very general form of identification constraints to occur in the scope of monotone concept constructors on the right-hand-side of inclusion dependencies still leads to decidable implication problems. Finally, we consider the relationship between certain classes of identification constraints and nominals.", "paper_title": "On keys and functional dependencies as first-class citizens in description logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085600052"}
