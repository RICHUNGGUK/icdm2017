It is shown that target matching is needed in the estimation of target velocity when targets have unequal velocities. Based on monopulse radar scheme, this target matching process is extended to angular domain, and an angle matching method of velocity measurement is proposed to resolve different velocities of multi-target. The method is analyzed from different aspects in terms of matching probability and CRLB of velocity estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that it is effective and feasible.", "paper_title": "A new approach of motion compensation for synthetic wideband radar under multitarget environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000276775200019"}
