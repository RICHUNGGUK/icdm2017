Two technologies, protection and restoration, are used in general, and the former is investigated in this paper. The existing protection strategies mainly cope with a single link failure or a double-link failure in an optical network and not consider what causes these failures. In this paper, we study the reasons which lead to the network malfunctions, and pose a new concept named regional demolishment. A protection algorithm named Ellipse-underlay algorithm is also proposed. We compare the performance of the Ellipse-underlay algorithm to the Node-disjoint algorithm. Simulation results show that the Ellipse-underlay algorithm is more effective to the survivability of traffic than the Node-disjoint algorithm.", "paper_title": "Ellipse-underlay protection algorithm to deal with regional demolishments in mesh optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283589400007"}
