The primary contribution of this research is to further our understanding of the factors that affect teachers' GIS usage. The structural equation model was employed to analyze the data collected from 725 senior high school geography teachers. This was done using a survey questionnaire inspired by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which postulates the importance of how teachers perceived the usefulness and ease of use of GIS. Further, this study investigates the direct effect of GIS workshop attendance on actual GIS usage and assesses whether GIS workshop attendance mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and actual usage. Structural equation modeling results suggest that the perceived usefulness of adopting GIS is vital as it directly affects teachers' attendance at GIS training, and can further prompt their application of GIS in lectures. The perceived ease of GIS use does not influence actual usage directly, but does affect teachers' GIS usage in teaching through perceived usefulness and workshop attendance. Finally, workshop attendance can increase teachers' usage of GIS and mediate the association between perceived usefulness and actual usage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
