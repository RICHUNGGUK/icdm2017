In this article, a new annotation scheme for paraphrase-type annotation is set out, together with newly created measures for the computation of inter-annotator agreement. Three corpora different in nature and in two languages have been annotated using this infrastructure. The annotation results and the inter-annotator agreement scores for these corpora are proof of the adequacy and robustness of our proposal.", "paper_title": "Corpus annotation with paraphrase types: new annotation scheme and inter-annotator agreement measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000349889400004"}
