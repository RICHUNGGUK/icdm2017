The goal is to identify, for each gene expressed in a particular cellular context, the regulators affecting its transcription, and the co-ordination of several regulators in specific types of regulation. DNA microarrays can be used to investigate relationships between regulators and their target genes, through simultaneous observations of their RNA levels. Results: We propose a data mining system for inferring transcriptional regulation relationships from RNA expression values. This system is particularly suitable for the detection of cooperative transcriptional regulation. We model regulatory relationships as labelled two-layer gene regulatory networks, and describe a method for the efficient learning of these bipartite networks from discretized expression data sets. We also evaluate the statistical significance of such inferred networks and validate our methods on two public yeast expression data sets.", "paper_title": "LICORN: learning cooperative regulation networks from gene expression data", "paper_id": "WOS:000249818700008"}
