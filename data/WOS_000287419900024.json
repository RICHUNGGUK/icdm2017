It integrates financial measures with other key performance indicators around customer perspectives, internal business processes, and organizational growth, learning, and innovation. The strategy planning is a virtual necessity for business activities, and this paper presents the use of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to prioritize all of the measures and strategies in a BSC framework. This study has found related strategies and objectives from four perspectives of balanced scorecard. This case illustrates selection or design of the most appropriate and helpful measures of the BSC in the pharmaceutical firm in an emerging market.
