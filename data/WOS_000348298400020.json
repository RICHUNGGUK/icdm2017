We derive four inner bounds on the DMT region: the first is based on the compress-and-forward (CF) relaying scheme, the second is based on the decode-and-forward (DF) relaying scheme, and the last two bounds are based on the half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) schemes. For the CF and DF schemes, we find conditions on the channel parameters and the multiplexing gains, under which the corresponding inner bound achieves the optimal DMT region. We also identify the cases in which the DMT region of the ICR corresponds to that of two parallel slow fading relay channels, implying that interference does not decrease the DMT for each pair, and that a single relay can be DMT-optimal for two pairs simultaneously. For the HD-AF scheme, we derive conditions on the channel coefficients under which the proposed scheme achieves the optimal DMT for the AF-based relay channel. Finally, we identify the conditions under which adding a relay strictly enlarges the DMT region relative to the interference channel without a relay.", "paper_title": "Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff for the Interference Channel With a Relay", "paper_id": "WOS:000348298400020"}
