Clustering is an unsupervised learning method which divides whole data set into subgroups, and popular clustering algorithms such as c-means are employing kernel methods. Other kernel-based clustering algorithms have been inspired from kernel c-means. However, the formulation of kernel c-means has a high computational complexity. This paper gives an alternative formulation of kernel-based clustering algorithms derived from competitive learning clustering. This new formulation obviously uses sequential updating or on-line learning to avoid high computational complexity. We apply kernel methods to related algorithms: learning vector quantization and self-organizing map. We moreover consider kernel methods for sequential c-means and its fuzzy version by the proposed formulation.", "paper_title": "Kernel methods for clustering: Competitive learning and c-means", "paper_id": "WOS:000239909300007"}
