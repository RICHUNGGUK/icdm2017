Since the GPS device is expensive, we used a small number of fixed anchor nodes that are aware of their locations to help estimate the locations of sensor nodes in WSNs. To efficiently route sensed data to the destination (the server), identifying the location of each sensor node can be of great help. We adopted a range-free color-theory based dynamic localization (CDL) [Shen-Hai Shee, Kuochen Wang, I.L. Hsieh, Color-theory-based dynamic localization in mobile wireless sensor networks, in: Proceedings of Workshop on Wireless, Ad Hoc, Sensor Networks, August 2005] approach, to help identify the location of each sensor node. Since sensor nodes are battery-powered, we propose an efficient color-theory-based energy efficient routing (CEER) algorithm to prolong the life time of each sensor node. The uniqueness of our approach is that by comparing the associated RGB values among neighboring nodes, we can efficiently choose a better routing path with energy awareness. Besides, the CEER has no topology hole problem. Simulation results have shown that our CEER algorithm can save up to 50-60% energy than ESDSR [Mohammed Tarique, Kemal E. Tepe, Mohammad Naserian, Energy saving dynamic source routing for ad hoc wireless networks, in: Proceedings of Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks, April 2005, pp. 305-310] in mobile wireless sensor networks. In addition, the latency per packet of CEER is 50% less than that of ESDSR. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
