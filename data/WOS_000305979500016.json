Affine invariance is desirable to enable learning of nondeterministic textures without a priori localizations, orientations, or sizes. When combined with complementary gray-level histograms, the proposed method allows a global classification accuracy of 76.9% with balanced precision among five classes of lung tissue using a leave-one-patient-out cross validation, in accordance with clinical practice.", "paper_title": "Near-Affine-Invariant Texture Learning for Lung Tissue Analysis Using Isotropic Wavelet Frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000305979500016"}
