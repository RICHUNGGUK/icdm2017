The majority of approaches for trust modeling addressed trust by actually focusing on security, and some of them addressed also trust as such. This paper presents a formal apparatus that concentrates on trust as such. It is flexible enough to accommodate the driving factors behind trust and consequently different trust-focused methodologies and technologies. The basic goal of the work presented in this paper is the definition of qualitative trust modeling methodology for trust management in contemporary computing environments that efficiently complements existing quantitative methodologies. Further, an open conceptual model for trust management is presented that accommodates various qualitative and quantitative trust management methodologies. This model has also been implemented in the web services environment, and this is discussed in this paper as well. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
