Special attention is paid to significant languages designed and developed in order to support implementation of agent-based systems and their applications in different domains. Afterwards, a number of useful and practically used tools and platforms available are presented, as well as support activities or phases of the process of agent-oriented software development.", "paper_title": "Software Agents: Languages, Tools, Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000292705700003"}
