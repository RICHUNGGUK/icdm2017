Ionospheric clutter influences most range bins, all Doppler bins and beams, and exhibits a high directivity. A robust adaptive side-lobe cancellation algorithm based on orthogonal auxiliary beams, which use the difference beams to estimate the ionospheric clutter information, is introduced to suppress the ionospheric clutter. Training data was selected by excluding the sea clutter and probable target unit; and diagonal loading was added to enhance the robustness of the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is able to suppress the ionospheric clutter whilst preserving the desired characteristics of the target echoes and is suitable for practical implementation.", "paper_title": "Robust ionospheric clutter mitigation method for high frequency surface wave radar", "paper_id": "WOS:000260770400013"}
