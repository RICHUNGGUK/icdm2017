Lesion detection is considered as a two-class pattern recognition problem. In order to get an effective and stable representation, the detection scheme codifies the image by using a ranklet transform. The vectors of ranklet coefficients obtained are classified by means of an SVM classifier. Our approach has two main advantages. First it does not need any feature selected by the trainer. Second, it is quite stable, with respect to the image histogram. That allows us to tune the detection parameters in one database and use the trained CAD on other databases without needing any adjustment. In this paper, training is accomplished on images coming from different databases (both digitized and digital). Test results are calculated on images coming from a few FFDM Giotto Image MD clinical units. The sensitivity of our CAD system is about 85% with a false-positive rate of 0.5 marks per image.", "paper_title": "A ranklet-based CAD for digital mammography", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900046"}
