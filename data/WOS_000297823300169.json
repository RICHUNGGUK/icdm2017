However, traditional SVM does not make efficient use of both labeled training data and unlabeled testing data. Moreover, high dimensional and nonlinear distributed data generally degrade the performance of a classifier due to the curse of dimensionality in financial distress (or bankruptcy) predictions. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel hybrid classifier which integrates Kernel local Fisher discriminant analysis (KLFDA) with a manifold-regularized SVM (MR-SVM). KLFDA is employed to find an optimal projection which maximizes the margin between data points from different classes at each local area of data manifold, while MR-SVM data-dependently warps the structure of feature space to reflect the underlying geometry of the data manifold. Compared with other dimensionality reduction methods and conventional classifiers, the hybrid classifier performs best. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
