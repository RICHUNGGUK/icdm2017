However, the parameters of the problem are sometimes uncertain in nature. Two kinds of uncertainty, fuzziness and randomness, do exist simultaneously in real decision situation. One of the way to model such situation with fuzzy random variable. In this paper, posynomial geometric programming problem with fuzzy random variable coefficients is studied. A fuzzy two stage stochastic programming technique has been developed to handle fuzzy random variable. A numerical example is solved to illustrate the methodology.", "paper_title": "Solving geometric programming problems with fuzzy random variable coefficients", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600008"}
