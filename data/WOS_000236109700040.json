One such research is fuzzy ranking models, which have been showing their superior performance in handling the uncertainty involved in the retrieval process. However, these conventional fuzzy ranking models are limited to incorporate the user preference when calculating the rank of documents. To address this issue, we develop a new fuzzy ranking model based on the user preference.", "paper_title": "On text ranking for information retrieval based on degree of preference", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700040"}
