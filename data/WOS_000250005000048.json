The success of such an algorithm hinges on the ability of its scoring function combined with a significance analysis test to discern real motifs from random noise. Results: In the first half of the paper we show that the paradigm of relying on entropy scores and their E-values can lead to undesirable results when searching for weak motifs and we offer alternate approaches to analyzing the significance of motifs. In the second half of the paper we reintroduce a scoring function and present a motif-finder that optimizes it that are more effective in finding relatively weak motifs than other tools.", "paper_title": "Apples to apples: improving the performance of motif finders and their significance analysis in the Twilight-Zone", "paper_id": "WOS:000250005000048"}
