We show that there exists a family of outerplanar directed acyclic graphs whose volume requirement is super-linear. We also prove that for the special case of rooted trees a linear volume upper bound is achievable.", "paper_title": "Volume requirements of 3D upward drawings", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300010"}
