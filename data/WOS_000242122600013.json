Self-organized similarity (or dissimilarity) has been proposed in order to consider not only the similarity (or dissimilarity) between a pair of objects but also the similarity (or dissimilarity) between the classification structures of objects. Depending on how the similarity (or dissimilarity) of the classification structures cope with the fuzzy clustering methods, the results will be different from each other. This paper discusses this difference and shows several numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy structural classification methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600013"}
