We characterize which noisy channels/distributions are useful for obtaining OT. We also introduce the problem of computing the oblivious-transfer capacity of a noisy resource, which measures the optimal way of implementing OT from a noisy channel/distribution. We show that for honest-but-curious sender, the oblivious-transfer capacity of noisy resources is strictly positive. Several open questions are raised.", "paper_title": "On the oblivious-transfer capacity of noisy resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000258033700013"}
