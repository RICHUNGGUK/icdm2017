In this study, a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm is presented to solve this problem with the objective of minimizing the makespan. The performance of the proposed HABC algorithm was evaluated by comparing its solutions to state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms and a high performing artificial bee colony (ABC)-based algorithm. Extensive computational results indicate that the proposed HABC algorithm significantly outperforms these best-so-far algorithms. Since the problem addressed in this study is a core topic for numerous industrial applications, this article may help to reduce the gap between theoretical progress and industrial practice.
