Special attention is paid to the validity of the method in flow visualization, and three-dimensional unsteady simulation is focused. Seemingly fundamental CFD technique for 3-D turbulence simulation has been well developed recently, but its practical use as an industrial tool has not yet become popular. An effort to close a wide gap between fundamental and practical use of scientific computer simulation is introduced through the national project promoting computational science and its development in industries of the next generation.", "paper_title": "High-performance computing and visualization of unsteady turbulent flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000252611800010"}
