It is proposed to define topology of links between the objects by describing a \"neighborhood\" of each object in the form of a list of \"formal neighbors.\" Synchronization of evolution of the object and its neighbors is described in terms of \"local time\" of the object and its neighborhood. Results of solution of real problems on a supercomputer are presented. They demonstrate that it is possible to the reduce labor input required for the creation of distributed software systems to that of local programming.", "paper_title": "Solution of Parallel Computation Problem Based on \"Space-Time\" Concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000307389400003"}
