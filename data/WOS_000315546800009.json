As a result, several enterprises including IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have started to offer different Cloud services to their customers. Due to the vast diversity in the available Cloud services, from the customer's point of view, it has become difficult to decide whose services they should use and what is the basis for their selection. Currently, there is no framework that can allow customers to evaluate Cloud offerings and rank them based on their ability to meet the user's Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this work, we propose a framework and a mechanism that measure the quality and prioritize Cloud services. Such a framework can make a significant impact and will create healthy competition among Cloud providers to satisfy their Service Level Agreement (SLA) and improve their QoS. We have shown the applicability of the ranking framework using a case study. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
