The dynamic analysis here employs the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side as introduced by Filippov. The designing laws in the synchronization of neural networks are proposed via state or output coupling. In addition, the new proposed algebraic criteria are very easy to verify, and they also enrich and improve the earlier publications. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "New Algebraic Criteria for Synchronization Stability of Chaotic Memristive Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981400016"}
