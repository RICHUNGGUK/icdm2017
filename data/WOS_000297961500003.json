Impulsive and dipolar terms arise in the dynamic equations, which do not seem to alter the piecewise well known solutions. It is proved in the paper that the addition of a null distribution to the original expression of the displacements, produces non-null effects on the response of the system, with the impact obeying to a strongly non-linear equation. It is thus confirmed that rocking block dynamics is a very delicate topic to be treated by numerical analyses. (C) 2011 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
