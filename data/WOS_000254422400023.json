A Hidden Markov Model has been set up to optimally compress 3D conformation of proteins into a structural alphabet (SA), corresponding to a library of limited and representative SA-letters. Each SA-letter corresponds to a set of short local fragments of four C, similar both in terms of geometry and in the way in which these fragments are concatenated in order to make a protein. The discretization of protein backbone local conformation as series of SA-letters results on a simplification of protein 3D coordinates into a unique 1 D representation. Some evidence is presented that such approach can constitute a very relevant way to analyze protein architecture in particular for protein structure comparison or prediction. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
