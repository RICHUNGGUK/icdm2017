The distillation of knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web can be a key factor for tasks such as social media marketing, branding, product positioning, and corporate reputation management. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text by machines, from which we are still very far. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that enable a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data. A recent knowledge-based technology in this context is sentic computing, which relies on the ensemble application of common-sense computing and the psychology of emotions to infer the conceptual and affective information associated with natural language. Sentic computing, however, is limited by the richness of the knowledge base and by the fact that the bag-of-concepts model, despite more sophisticated than bag-of-words, misses out important discourse structure information that is key for properly detecting the polarity conveyed by natural language opinions. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm to concept-level sentiment analysis that merges linguistics, common-sense computing, and machine learning for improving the accuracy of tasks such as polarity detection. By allowing sentiments to flow from concept to concept based on the dependency relation of the input sentence, in particular, we achieve a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept within the sentence and, hence, obtain a polarity detection engine that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods.
