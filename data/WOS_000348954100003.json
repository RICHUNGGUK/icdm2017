The effects of the load's intensity and velocity and of the foundation's stiffness are investigated. Critical velocities are determined for beams on uniform foundations or foundations composed of two sub-domains with different values of stiffness, with or without viscous damping. In the case of non-uniform linear foundations, a very good agreement is obtained between the results of the model and available analytical solutions. The goal of this study is to generalize, for more realistic foundation behaviors, the analyses obtained by other authors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
