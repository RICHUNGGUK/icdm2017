The coding and decoding scheme based on job permutation is applied in the algorithm. The algorithm employs several efficient heuristics in the initialisation phase and incorporates an insertion-based local search. To validate the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are conducted on a benchmark problem set from the literature. Computational results show that the HDDE algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms for the Pm// problem.", "paper_title": "A hybrid discrete differential evolution algorithm to minimise total tardiness on identical parallel machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000319325400002"}
