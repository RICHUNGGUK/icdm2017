Although the ontology consistency problem for SHOIN is known to be decidable, up to now there has been no known \"practical\" decision procedure, that is, a goal-directed procedure that is likely to perform well with realistic ontology derived problems. We present such a decision procedure for SHOIQ, a slightly more expressive logic than SHOIN, extending the well-known algorithm for SHIQ, which is the basis for several highly successful implementations.", "paper_title": "A tableau decision procedure for SHOIQ", "paper_id": "WOS:000249120300002"}
