The MAP has many recognized applications such as data association, target tracking, and resource planning. While the linear assignment problem is solvable in polynomial time, the MAP is NP-hard. In this work, we develop a new approach based on the Cross-Entropy (CE) methods for solving the MAP. Exploiting the special structure of the MAP, we propose an appropriate family of discrete distributions on the feasible set of the MAP that allow us to design an efficient and scalable CE algorithm. The efficiency and scalability of our method are proved via several tests on large-scale problems with up to 5 dimensions and 20 elements in each dimension, which is equivalent to a 0-1 linear program with 3.2 millions binary variables and 100 constraints.", "paper_title": "Solving the Multidimensional Assignment Problem by a Cross-Entropy method", "paper_id": "WOS:000333387600012"}
