Existing deformation techniques work on preserving surface details under bending and twisting operations. Stretching different parts of a shape is also a useful operation for generating shape variations. However, under stretching, texture-like geometric details should not be preserved but rather replicated. We propose a simple and efficient method that helps create model variations by applying nonuniform stretching on 3D models with organic geometric details. The method replicates the geometric details and synthesizes extensions by adopting texture synthesis techniques on surface details. We work on analyzing and separating the stretching of surface details from the stretching of the base mesh resulting in the appearance of preserved details. The efficiency of our method is attributed to a local parameterization of the surface with the help of curve skeletons. We show a variety of experimental results that demonstrate the usefulness of this intuitive stretching tool in creating shape variations.", "paper_title": "Detail-replicating shape stretching", "paper_id": "WOS:000310538700002"}
