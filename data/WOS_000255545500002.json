Workflow management is emerging as one of the most important part of it. Because the grid environment is very dynamic and the services are shared among many users, it is impossible to optimize the workflow from the point of view of execution ahead of time. In fact, one may want to make decisions about the execution locations and the access to a particular data set as late as possible. In this paper, we propose a method of using Contract Net Protocol(CNP) to implement service-oriented workflow mapping in ShanghaiGrid workflow management system(SHGWMS). Three types of workflow in SHGWMS are denoted as Abstract workflow(AW), Concrete workflow(CW) and Executable workflow(EW). Belief-Desire-Intention(BDI) agent technology in SHGWMS helps the system meet challenges from the grid context. CNP provides a very proper negotiation model for agents. The problem of workflow mapping has been transferred to the problem of multi-agent negotiation with the help of CNP model in SHGWMS. We also propose AW2CW mapping algorithm and CW2EW mapping algorithm to accomplish service-oriented workflow mapping.", "paper_title": "CNP-based implementation of service-oriented workflow mapping in SHGWMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000255545500002"}
