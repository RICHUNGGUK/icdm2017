To this end, the use of intelligent computer systems that analyze emotional processes within teams is a promising direction. As a first step toward the development of such systems, this paper uses an agent-based approach to formalize and simulate emotion contagion processes within groups, which may involve absorption or amplification of emotions of others. The obtained computational model is analyzed both by explorative simulation and by mathematical analysis. In addition, to illustrate the applicability of the model, it is shown how the model can be integrated within a computational 'ambient agent model' that monitors and predicts group emotion levels over time and proposes group support actions based on that. Based on this description, a discussion is provided of the main contribution of the model, as well as the next steps needed to incorporate it into real-world applications.", "paper_title": "Agent-Based Modeling of Emotion Contagion in Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000349525500012"}
