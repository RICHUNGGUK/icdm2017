This paper presents a model and its hardware real-time architecture in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to be integrated in a robotic system that emulates this powerful biological process. It is based on the combination of bottom-up saliency and top-down task-dependent modulation. The bottom-up stream is deployed including local energy, orientation, color opponencies, and motion maps. The most novel part of this work is the saliency modulation by two high-level features: 1) optical flow and 2) disparity. Furthermore, the influence of the features may be adjusted depending on the application. The proposed system reaches 180 fps for resolution. Finally, an example shows its modulation potential for driving assistance systems.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Visual Saliency Architecture for FPGA With Top-Down Attention Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000340428100006"}
