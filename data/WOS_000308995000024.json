To achieve this, a cyclic-motion criterion at the joint-acceleration level is exploited. This criterion, together with the joint-angle limits, joint-velocity limits, and joint-acceleration limits, is considered into the scheme formulation. In addition, the neural-dynamic method of Zhang et al. is employed to explain and analyze the effectiveness of the proposed criterion. Then, the scheme is reformulated as a quadratic program, which is solved by a primal-dual neural network. Furthermore, four tracking path simulations verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed acceleration-level CMG scheme. Moreover, the comparisons between the proposed acceleration-level CMG scheme and the velocity-level scheme demonstrate that the former is safer and more applicable. The experiment on a physical robot system further verifies the physical realizability of the proposed acceleration-level CMG scheme.", "paper_title": "Acceleration-Level Cyclic-Motion Generation of Constrained Redundant Robots Tracking Different Paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000308995000024"}
