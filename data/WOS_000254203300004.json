These include an array of XML schemas for representing linguistic resources; a variety of text corpora, raw, automatically processed and manually annotated; lexical databases, including a broad-coverage monolingual lexicon, a bilingual dictionary and a WordNet; and morphological processors which can analyze, generate and disambiguate Hebrew word forms. The resources are developed under centralized supervision, so that they are compatible with each other. They are freely available and many of them have already been used for several applications, both academic and industrial.", "paper_title": "Language resources for hebrew", "paper_id": "WOS:000254203300004"}
