The article shows how to simulate the components of power system in order to teach students the basics of lightning transient phenomena, and to practice the simulation of power system components. In the first part of the article the simulation of component is described, and in the second part a system is simulated for lightning transient study. Evaluation of the simulation over several semesters with more than 48 students is very positive in terms of their developing confidence in and understanding of lightning transient phenomena.
