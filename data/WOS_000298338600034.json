In order to prevent accidents, coordinate rescue operations and warn people about critical events, this process imposes end-to-end delay constraints. Accordingly, the delay from each source to each destination should be monitored. For this purpose, a middleware is required between the network and the applications, offering the tracking capabilities of disseminated information. In this paper, we propose a middleware architecture for disseminating delay-constrained information in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In order to evaluate the feasibility of such architecture, a proof of concept of a real scenario is implemented. For performance evaluation, the end-to-end delay and the percentage of success related to the disseminated information are analyzed. Such analysis reveals that the middleware offers a percentage of success close to 98%, which is highly superior to the success of individual resources, such as Short Message Services (SMS), emailing and twitter.
