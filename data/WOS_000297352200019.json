Controlled-flooding resource query algorithms are widely used in unstructured networks such as peer-to-peer networks. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Selective Dynamic Query (SDQ). Based on mathematical programming, SDQ calculates the optimal combination of an integer TTL value and a set of neighbors to control the scope of the next query. Our results demonstrate that SDQ provides finer grained control than other algorithms: its response latency is close to the well-known minimum one via Expanding Ring; in the mean time, its traffic cost is also close to the minimum. To our best knowledge, this is the first work capable of achieving a best trade-off between response latency and traffic cost.", "paper_title": "Revisiting Dynamic Query Protocols in Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297352200019"}
