Common interaction concepts for such applications are often limited to pure 2D pointing and clicking on the device's touch screen. Such an interaction with virtual objects is not only restrictive but also difficult, for example, due to the small form factor. In this article, we investigate the potential of finger tracking for gesture-based interaction. We present two experiments evaluating canonical operations such as translation, rotation, and scaling of virtual objects with respect to performance (time and accuracy) and engagement (subjective user feedback). Our results indicate a high entertainment value, but low accuracy if objects are manipulated in midair, suggesting great possibilities for leisure applications but limited usage for serious tasks.", "paper_title": "Gesture-based interaction via finger tracking for mobile augmented reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000313965800011"}
