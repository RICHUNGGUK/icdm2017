The key building block of the CPM controller is an accurate current-sensing circuit. This paper proposes a lossless current-sensing technique to measure the inductor current by measuring the current through the power transistor. A self-trimming circuit is used to compensate for any inaccuracies caused by voltage and temperature variations. The measurement results validate the operation of the fabricated chip.", "paper_title": "A 400-mA current-mode buck converter with a self-trimming current sensing scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000287398700003"}
