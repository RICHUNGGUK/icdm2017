Firstly, the original small texture is segmented into layers, each of which contains one particular texture element. Secondly, each layer is deformed using a set of chaotic-based transformation operations. Thirdly, all the deformed layers are added together to form a new texture, which is a natural variation of the original sample texture. Since each layer is deformed independently, adding the deformed layers together usually results in a texture with overlapping regions and holes. We employ the graphcut algorithm and an example-based image inpainting technique to seamlessly patch the overlapping regions and to fill the holes. Moreover, an optimized graphcut synthesis algorithm and a new cyclic texture synthesis technique are also developed for efficiently creating large seamless textures. As a result, our approach shows particular strength in generating a large variety of textures from a single sample texture while avoiding highly repetitive patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can also be used for other texture synthesis applications, such as texture synthesis from multiple samples.", "paper_title": "Completion-based texture design using deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240381000036"}
