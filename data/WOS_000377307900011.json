We first formulate the corresponding optimization problem, which consists of the joint optimization -in terms of achievable rate-of, 1) the dynamic power allocation among multiple channels and, 2) the selection of the power splitting ratio between information processing and energy harvesting at the relay, when amplify-and-forward is applied. This is a non-convex optimization problem, which is mapped to a convex one and optimally solved using one-dimensional search and dual decomposition, while a suboptimal efficient iterative method is also proposed. Simulations reveal a significant increase in the throughput, when comparing the proposed approach with two alternative power allocation schemes, while they verify the effectiveness of the fast-converging iterative solution.", "paper_title": "Throughput Maximization in Multicarrier Wireless Powered Relaying Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900011"}
