A direct adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is developed by using the backstepping approach. It is proved that the design scheme ensures that all the error variables are bounded in probability while the mean square tracking error becomes semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in an arbitrarily small area around the origin. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the control scheme.", "paper_title": "Adaptive fuzzy tracking control of a class of stochastic nonlinear systems with unknown dead-zone input", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333600003"}
