This framework allows the partial and progressive transmission of 3D worlds as well as of separate meshes, achieving reduced waiting times for the end-user and improved network utilization. We also present a 3D mesh compression method focused on network communication, which is designed to support progressive mesh transmission, offering a fast and effective means of reducing the storage and transmission needs for geometrical data. This method is integrated in the above framework and utilizes prediction to achieve efficient lossy compression of 3D geometry.
