Firstly, a desired kinetic energy function is designed for the non-trivial points. Secondly, applying the KES method to the Hamiltonian function with the desired kinetic energy function builds some matching equations. Thirdly, solving those equations yields some asymptotically stabilized controllers. Finally, numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "ASYMPTOTICAL STABILIZATION FOR TIME-INVARIANT AND TIME-VARYING PORT-HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS VIA A NEW KINETIC ENERGY-SHAPING", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800007"}
