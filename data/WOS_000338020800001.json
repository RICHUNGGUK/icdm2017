The morbidity of the organs can be revealed by the human facial complexion, so the color space based on human visual system will be more conducive to facial complexion recognition. It is much suitable to measure and distinguish facial complexion by uniform Lab color space, as it has the characteristic of isometry and high resolving power. First, the skin blocks in the human facial region are extracted by locating the eye position and mouth corner accurately. Second, the statistical characteristic of color histogram and the characteristic of aberration chromatic in Lab color space are introduced to extract the facial complexion feature. At last, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to evaluate the performance of facial complexion recognition. The experimental results show the complexion feature proposed in this paper can achieve the better performance, with the facial complexion recognition rate up to 81%.", "paper_title": "HUMAN FACIAL COMPLEXION RECOGNITION OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE BASED ON UNIFORM COLOR SPACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000338020800001"}
