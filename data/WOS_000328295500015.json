Such an effect can also be achieved (not perfectly) by using negative index metamaterials, but only within a single frequency. Maxwell's fish-eye lens, however, can work for a set of eigenfrequencies. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the effect.", "paper_title": "An illusion effect of Maxwell's fish-eye lens", "paper_id": "WOS:000328295500015"}
