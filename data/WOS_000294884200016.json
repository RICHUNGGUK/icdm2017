Design/methodology/approach - Based on the study of cascading failure models of complex power networks, an extended dynamical cascading failure model is proposed. Based on this model, two representatives of the complex power grids, the small-world network and the scale-free network, were simulated for line cascading failure. The power loss caused by cascading failures and the spreading speed of cascading failure are discussed. Findings - Power loss caused by cascading failures in the small-world network is much larger than that in the scale-free network, and the speed of cascading failure propagation in the small-world network is much faster than that in the scale-free network. Research limitations/implications - The establishment of the dynamical cascading failure model considering other protection devices needs further study. Practical implications The results of this study can be beneficial in system planning and upgrading. Originality/value - An extended dynamical cascading failure model is proposed and cascading failures in different topology of power grid are discussed.", "paper_title": "Dynamical model and analysis of cascading failures on the complex power grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000294884200016"}
