This paper presents an approach that circumvents this problem by performing tracking based on observations from multiple wide-baseline cameras. The proposed global occlusion estimation approach can deal with severe inter-person occlusions in one or more views by exploiting information from other views. Image features from non-occluded views are given more weight than image features from occluded views. Self occlusion is handled by local occlusion estimation. The local occlusion estimation is used to update the image likelihood function by sorting body parts as a function of distance to the cameras. The combination of the global and the local occlusion estimation leads to accurate tracking results at much lower computational costs. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a pose estimation data Set in which inter-person and self occlusions are present. The results of our experiments show that our approach is able to robustly track multiple people during large movement with severe inter-person occlusions and self occlusions, whilst maintaining near real-time performance.
