Nevertheless, in 1975 Solovay showed that there are computable functions f >= K + O(1) such that for infinitely many strings sigma, f (sigma) = K(sigma) + O(1), where K denotes prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity. Such an f is now called a Solovay function. We prove that many classical results about K can be obtained by replacing K by a Solovay function. For example, the three following properties of a function g all hold for the function K. (i) The sum of the terms Sigma(n) 2(-g(n))) is a Martin-Lof random real. (ii) A sequence A is Martin-Lof random if and only if g(A vertical bar n) > n - O(1). (iii) A sequence A is K-trivial if and only if K(A vertical bar n) < g(n) + O(1). We show that when fixing any of these three properties, then among all computable functions exactly the Solovay functions possess this property. Furthermore, this characterization extends accordingly to the larger class of right-c.e. functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
