Recently, some reversible data hiding schemes have concentrated on the VQ compression domain. In this paper, we present a new reversible data hiding scheme based on VQ and SMVQ techniques to enhance embedding capacity and compression rate. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme achieves higher embedding capacity and smaller average compression rate than some previous methods. Moreover, our proposed scheme maintains the high level of visual quality of the reconstructed image.", "paper_title": "A Reversible Data Hiding Scheme for SMVQ Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000347513200001"}
