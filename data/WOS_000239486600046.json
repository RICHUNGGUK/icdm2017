It is based on a substitutive procedure in the spatial domain. We propose a Virtual Multi-Level Embed Procedure to embed information based on shifting the message point by its virtual geometrical property, the order of which is assigned by principal component analysis. We have defined and validated an effective metric of distortion anticipation, which can help us easily anticipate and control the distortion rate. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is efficient and secure, has high capacity and low distortion, and is robust against affine transformations. It provides a reversible method and has proven to be feasible in data hiding.", "paper_title": "Steganography for three-dimensional models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600046"}
