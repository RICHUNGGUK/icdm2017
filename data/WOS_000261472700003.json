This iterative method begins by transformation of the Dirichlet boundary conditions from the physical boundaries to some corresponding regular grid points (which are called the numerical boundaries), using a second order interpolation method. Then the transformed boundary conditions and the forcing function are extended to a square, smoothly and periodically, via multiplying them by some suitable error functions. Instead of direct solution of the resulting extended Poisson's problem, it is suggested to define and solve an equivalent transient diffusion problem on the regular domain, until achievement of the steady solution (which is considered as the solution of the original problem). Without need of any numerical time integration method, time advancement of the solution is obtained directly, from the exact solution of the transient problem in the Fourier space. Consequently, timestep sizes can be chosen without stability limitations, which it means higher rates of convergence in comparison with the classical relaxation methods. The method is presented in details for one- and two-dimensional problems, and a new emerged phenomenon (which is called the saturation state) is illustrated both in the physical and spectral spaces. The numerical experiments have been performed on the one- and two-dimensional irregular domains to show the accuracy of the method and its superiority (from the rate of convergence viewpoint) to the other classical relaxation methods. Capability of the method, in dealing with complex geometries, and in presence of discontinuity at the boundaries, has been shown via some numerical experiments on a four-leaf shape geometry.
