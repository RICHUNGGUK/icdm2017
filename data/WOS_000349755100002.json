The concepts are illustrated using chemical plant stream data in a process with multiple distillation columns. Pinch analysis is first applied to find the grand composite curve (GCC) of the problem, which is then used by the algorithm to determine the maximum mass flow rate of steam that can be produced from process waste heat. An analysis of the effects of the minimum temperature of approach Delta T-min on the optimal steam raising result is also conducted, and it is found that, in general, a higher Delta T-min will reduce the percentage heat recovery from the process.
