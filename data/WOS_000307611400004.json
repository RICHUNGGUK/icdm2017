Although MCS provides more benefits than single-channel shopping, there is a need to investigate consumer values in the MCS context. This study aims to develop a consumer value hierarchy that represents how consumers think and pursue when performing MCS. Design/methodology/approach - The research framework was developed from a perspective of means-end theory. Two studies were designed to elicit and evaluate a consumer value hierarchy of MCS. First, a qualitative study was conducted to explore means-end elements of MCS. Then, a hierarchical value map of MCS was constructed with 314 usable responses from an empirical survey in Taiwan. The impacts of past shopping experience on consumers' value perceptions were also examined. Findings - In the hierarchical value map (HVM) of MCS, the results indicate 18 means-end chains from ten MCS attributes resulting in nine consequences derived from those attributes, and then to four MCS values. The results also show that both expert and novice shoppers emphasize the utilitarian value of MCS; however, shopping novices pay more attention to the hedonic value of MCS than experts do. Practical implications - This paper provides several managerial implications for multi-channel retailers. Multi-channel retailers need to know more about the attributes and functions of each channel that they offer in order to create a superior shopping experience for their customers. Also, retailers need to understand different MCS patterns for successful multi-channel customer relationship management. Finally, the consumer value hierarchy of MCS is a useful tool for retailers to develop effective promotion strategies to increase customers' engagement in MCS. Originality/value - This paper is the first to apply means-end theory to investigate consumer value in the MCS context. It advances the consumer value literature in explaining a novel type of consumer channel-mixing behavior. The paper concludes with implications for multi-channel retailers, and future directions for MCS research are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Exploring consumer value of multi-channel shopping: a perspective of means-end theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000307611400004"}
