The first approach designs two attack games to give the formal definition of fuzzy negotiation that forms a new key negotiation scheme based on fuzzy extractor technology. According to the definition, we further define a concrete structure of fuzzy negotiation that can enlarge the types of biometric data used to negotiate shared keys between biosensor nodes. The second approach includes a detailed key sampling method that uses shared secrets to generate linear interpolation factors and an improved linear interpolation encryption scheme based on linear equation group. Security analyses show that these two approaches are secure and can resist attacks launched by Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) technology, which has not received due attention in the existing studies.", "paper_title": "Securing Body Sensor Networks with Biometric Methods: A New Key Negotiation Method and a Key Sampling Method for Linear Interpolation Encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000360476800001"}
