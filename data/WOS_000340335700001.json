It is shown that (1) the Tychonoff Theorem with respect to the compactness degrees holds in (L, M)-fuzzy convergence spaces and (L, M)-fuzzy topological spaces; (2) the compactness degrees of an (L, M)-fuzzy pseudo-quasi-metric space and a pointwise (L, M)-fuzzy quasi-uniform space are equal to the compactness degrees of their induced (L, M)-fuzzy topological spaces, respectively; (3) an (L, M)-fuzzy pseudo-quasi-metric space can induce a pointwise (L, M)-fuzzy quasi-uniform space and their compactness degrees are equal.
