To adequately deal with this uncertainty, we employ a two-stage formulation where the operational parameters can be adapted to the realization of the uncertainty while the design parameters are the first-stage decisions. The uncertainty is represented by a set of discrete scenarios and the optimization problem is solved by stage decomposition. The approach is implemented in the computer tool FSOpt (Flow sheet Superstructure Optimization) FSOpt provides a flexible environment for the modelling of the unit operations and the generation of superstructures and algorithms for the translation of the superstructure into non-linear programming models. The approach is applied to two case studies, the hydroformylation of dodec-1-ene and the separation of an azeotropic mixture of water and formic acid. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
