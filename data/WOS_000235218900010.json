Computational complexity results show that the problem is hard to solve. Yet, instances from realistic applications are large and demand fast and reliable algorithms. Results: We propose a new global optimization algorithm, which for the first time integrates residue reduction and rotamer reduction techniques previously developed for the protein side-chain conformation problem. We show that the proposed approach simplifies dramatically the topology of the underlining residue graph. Computations show that our algorithm solves problems using only 1-10% of the time required by the mixed-integer linear programming approach available in the literature. In addition, on a set of hard side-chain conformation problems, our algorithm runs 2-78 times faster than SCWRL 3.0, which is widely used for solving these problems.", "paper_title": "Residue-rotamer-reduction algorithm for the protein side-chain conformation problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000235218900010"}
