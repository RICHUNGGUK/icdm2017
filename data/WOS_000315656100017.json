Then, an arithmeticgeometric inequality method is proposed not only to simplify the algebraic method of completing prefect squares, but also to complement their shortcomings. In addition, we provide a closed-form solution to integral number of deliveries for the distributor and the vendor without using complex derivatives. Furthermore, our method can solve many cases in which their method cannot, because they did not consider that a squared root of a negative number does not exist. Finally, we use some numerical examples to show that our proposed optimal solution is cheaper to operate than theirs.", "paper_title": "Optimal economic order quantity for buyerdistributorvendor supply chain with backlogging derived without derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000315656100017"}
