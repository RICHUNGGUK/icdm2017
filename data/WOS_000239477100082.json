After the system comprehends the problem inputted by the learner and determines the category of the problem, the system produces a solution plan for the learner. The learner solves the problem by following the plan step by step. After that, the system diagnoses the learner's answer when s/he executes a plan. If the learner's answer is incorrect, the system provides hints for the learner to revise the answer. Empirical evaluation results indicate that the system is effective in tutoring digital logic problem.", "paper_title": "The design of a tutoring system with learner-initiating instruction strategy for digital logic problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100082"}
