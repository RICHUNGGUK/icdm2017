The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal selling price and the length of replenishment cycle such that the total profit per unit time has a maximum value for the retailer. We first establish a proper model for a mathematical formulation. Then we develop several theoretical results and provide the decision-maker with an algorithm to find the optimal solution. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the solution procedure, and a sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to major parameters is carried out.", "paper_title": "Coordinating replenishment and pricing policies for non-instantaneous deteriorating items with price-sensitive demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000272497400006"}
