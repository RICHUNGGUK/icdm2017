Conventional calculation of structure requires the use of various software packages, considerable user expertise and ample computational resources. To facilitate the use of NMR spectroscopy and SAXS in life sciences the WeNMR consortium has established standard computational workflows and services through easy-to-use web interfaces, while still retaining sufficient flexibility to handle more specific requests. Thus far, a number of programs often used in structural biology have been made available through application portals. The implementation of these services, in particular the distribution of calculations to a Grid computing infrastructure, involves a novel mechanism for submission and handling of jobs that is independent of the type of job being run. With over 450 registered users (September 2012), WeNMR is currently the largest Virtual Organization (VO) in life sciences. With its large and worldwide user community, WeNMR has become the first Virtual Research Community officially recognized by the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI).", "paper_title": "WeNMR: Structural Biology on the Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000312875700009"}
