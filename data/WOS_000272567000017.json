As the proposed model is not well-defined due to fuzzy variables, thus to solve them directly and analytically, the possibility measure is introduced. Then, in order to aggregate the multi-criteria objective functions into the single-criterion, the fuzzy compromise programming model is proposed. Furthermore, by introducing the interval of each weight to the objective functions, the proposed model is reformulated as a robust programming problem. Since this problem is a semi-infinite programming problem, the an efficient algorithm. is developed using the linearity of the proposed model. Finally, a numerical example is provided to compare proposed models with the basic model.", "paper_title": "A ROBUST MULTI-CRITERIA FUZZY PROGRAMMING PROBLEM CONSIDERING POSSIBILITY MEASURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000272567000017"}
