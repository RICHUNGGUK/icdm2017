Leveraging locally managed IPv6 addresses with identity based cryptography (IBC), we propose an efficient end-to-end authentication that (a) assigns a robust and deployment friendly federation scheme to gateways of IoT subnetworks, and (b) has been evaluated with a modern twisted Edwards elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Our early results demonstrate feasibility and promise efficiency after ongoing optimisations.", "paper_title": "Federated End-to-End Authentication for the Constrained Internet of Things Using IBC and ECC", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200081"}
