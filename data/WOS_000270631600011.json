The interoperability of these tools is obtained through the adoption of Optimization systems as a bridging element between CAI and PLM systems. This methodology was developed within the PROSIT project (http://www.kaemart.it/prosit). The paper describes the main issues related to the integration of these complementary instruments and the solutions proposed by the authors. More specifically, the main idea of the PROSIT project to link CAI and Optimization systems is the adoption of the latter tools not just to generate optimized solutions, but also as a design analysis tool, capable to outline critical aspects of a mechanical component in terms of conflicting design requirements or parameters. CAI systems are then applied to overcome the contradictory requirements. The second step, i.e. the integration between Optimization and PLM systems, has been obtained through the development of Knowledge-Based (KB) tools to support designer's activities. More in details, they provide means to analyze and extrapolate useful geometrical information from the results provided by the optimizer, as well as semi-automatic modelling features for some specific geometries. A detailed example related to the design of a plastic wheel for light motoscooters clarifies the whole procedure.
