Basic features of this approach together with some in silico test cases were discussed in that work. Here, we provide more insights of this approach by performing a sensitivity analysis of the formulas relating blood flow rate to velocity. In particular we analyze how our estimates are affected by perturbation or errors in measurements in comparison with a standard method for catheter based estimates based on the assumption of a parabolic velocity profile. A first glance to in vivo clinical applications is given as well. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
