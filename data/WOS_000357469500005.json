While previous research has concentrated on the effects of hydraulic and geometric parameters on the scour patterns at river confluences, there remains a lack of expert systems designed to predict the maximum scour depth (d(sm)). In the present study, several soft computing models, namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) and M5P model tree, were used to predict the d(sm) at river confluences under live-bed conditions. Model performance, assessed through a number of statistical indices (RMSE, MAE, MARE and R-2), showed that while all three models could provide acceptable predictions of d(sm) under live-bed conditions, the MLP model was the most accurate. By testing the models at three different ranges of scour depths, we determined that while the MLP model was the most accurate model in the low scour depth range, the RBF model was more accurate in the higher range of scour depths.
