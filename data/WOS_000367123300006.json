Virtualized network environments (VNEs) have recently emerged as a solution in this technology to address the challenges of future Internet. VNEs also play a fundamental role toward virtualizing data centers. Consequently, it is essential to develop novel techniques for reducing the energy consumption of VNEs. In this paper, we discuss multiple energy-saving solutions that locally optimize the node and link energy consumption of VNEs during the off-peak period by reconfiguring the mapping of already allocated virtual nodes and links. The proposed reconfigurations enable the providers to adjust the level of the reconfiguration and accordingly control possible traffic disruptions. An integer linear program (ILP) is formulated for each solution. Because the defined ILPs are MP-hard, a novel heuristic algorithm is also proposed. The proposed energy-saving methods are evaluated over random VNE scenarios. The results confirm that the solutions save notable amounts of energy in physical nodes and links during the off-peak period. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
