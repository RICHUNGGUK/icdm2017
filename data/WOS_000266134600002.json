The formulation uses the principle of virtual work, the Bernoulli-Euler curved beam theory for the arch and the composite reinforcement, and a high-order kinematic assumption that satisfies the compatibility and (with the constitutive laws) the tangential equilibrium conditions of the adhesive. The character of the masonry arch is introduced through the constitutive equations with a distinction between the masonry units and the mortar joints. Convergence and numerical studies that support using high-order shape functions and examine the capabilities of the model are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
