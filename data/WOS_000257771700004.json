However, it requires huge memory and the dimension increases exponentially with the number of inputs. It is difficult to model dynamic systems with static fuzzy CMACs. In this paper, we use two types of recurrent techniques for fuzzy CMAC to overcome the above problems. The new CMAC neural networks are named recurrent fuzzy CMAC (RFCMAC) which add feedback connections in the inner layers (local feedback) or the output layer (global feedback). The corresponding learning algorithms have time-varying learning rates, the stabilities of the neural identifications are proven.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear systems identification via two types of recurrent fuzzy CMAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000257771700004"}
