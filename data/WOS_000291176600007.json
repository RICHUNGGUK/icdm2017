This combination is necessary because objects in medical images, e.g., bones, are usually highly inhomogeneous while distinct organs should generate distinct image configurations. Compared with the conventional Chan-Vese AC, the proposed model yields similar performance in a set of CT images but performs better in an MRI data set, which is generally in lower contrast.
