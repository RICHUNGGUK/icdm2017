The results show that HHI of patents and RPP(MIT) have nonlinearly and monotonically positive influences upon corporate performance, while the influence of patent citations is nonlinearly U-shaped. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies should raise the degrees of the leading position in their most important technological fields and the centralization of their technological capabilities to enhance corporate performance.", "paper_title": "The nonlinear nature of the relationships between the patent traits and corporate performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000273950900016"}
