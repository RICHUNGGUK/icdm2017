The test-bed comprises a fleet of networked mobile sensors, an indoor localization system, a control, debugging and management infrastructure, and a tiered wireless ad hoc network for seamless integration of the above three components and the existing wireless infrastructure. First, the software and hardware architectural details of a swarm capable autonomous vehicle (SCAV) system for our collaborative applications are presented. Second, the details of an indoor self-localization and Kalman filter based navigation system design for the SCAV platform are presented. Third, as an example multi-sensor application, a collaborative multi-target tracking problem and a heuristics-based networked solution are formulated. Finally, the performance of the collaborative tracking framework is evaluated on the laboratory test-bed for characterizing the impacts of localization and navigation errors on the distributed tracking performance. The experimental study also characterizes the tradeoff between the tracking performance and the consumed wireless bandwidth. The experimental results demonstrate a number of counterintuitive results due to various errors in sensor localization and navigation.", "paper_title": "A networked mobile sensor test-bed for collaborative multi-target tracking applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000278968500008"}
