Moreover a linear optimization scheme was proposed to address the problems of redundancy in boosting learning and threshold adjusting in cascade coupling. Experiments were done to compare the performance of boosting chain with that of Adaboost and Floatboost and the results show the effectiveness of this new method.", "paper_title": "Face detection method based on Kernel Independent Component Analysis and Boosting Chain Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000019"}
