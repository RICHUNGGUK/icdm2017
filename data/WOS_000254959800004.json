DBMSs have traditionally exhibited poor cache performance and large memory footprints, therefore performing only at a fraction of their ideal execution and exhibiting low processor utilization. Previous research has studied the memory system of DBMSs on research-based simultaneous multithreading (SMT) processors. Recently, several differences have been noted between the real hyper-threaded architecture implemented by the Intel Pentium 4 and the earlier SMT research architectures. This paper characterizes the performance of a prototype open-source DBMS running TPC-equivalent benchmark queries on an Intel Pentium 4 Hyper-Threading processor. We use hardware counters provided by the Pentium 4 to evaluate the micro-architecture and study the memory system behavior of each query running on the DBMS. Our results show a performance improvement of up to 1.16 in TPC-C-equivalent and 1.26 in TPC-H-equivalent queries due to hyperthreading.", "paper_title": "Analyzing the effects of hyperthreading on the performance of data management systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254959800004"}
