The hybrid method combines the unstructured finite volume method with high-order finite difference methods on complex geometries. The coupling procedure between the two numerical methods is based on energy estimates and stable interface conditions are constructed. Numerical calculations show that the hybrid method is efficient and accurate. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
