To the end, we extend Continuous Stochastic Logic introduced in Aziz et al. (2000) [1] to Conditional Continuous Stochastic Logic (CCSL) by introducing a conditional probabilistic operator. CCSL allows us to express a richer class of properties for CTMCs. Based on a parameterized product obtained from the CTMC and an automaton extracted from a given CCSL formula, we propose an approximate model checking algorithm and analyse its complexity.
