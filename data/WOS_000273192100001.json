This is especially true when the plasma is interacting with a gas flow, a problem of considerable recent interest in the context of aerodynamic applications Of Surface discharges. This paper presents a contribution to the numerical modeling of such discharges. We describe here a new approach for adaptive meshing which is suitable for use with the explicit asynchronous integration scheme described in our previous publication. Rather than relying on a family of nested grids as is commonly done, this technique is based on a single unstructured mesh with possible non-conforming cells at the interface between coarse and fine areas. Substantial computational time saving has been achieved for a surface dielectric barrier discharge configuration of the kind proposed as plasma actuators for flow control. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
