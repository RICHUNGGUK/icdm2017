We analyze the effects of the approximation on gradient quantization and histogramming. The ARGT is incorporated into the rotation-invariant fast feature (RIFF) algorithm. We demonstrate that, using the ARGT, RIFF extracts features 16x faster than SURF while achieving a similar performance for image matching and retrieval.", "paper_title": "Fast Computation of Rotation-Invariant Image Features by an Approximate Radial Gradient Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000321926600004"}
