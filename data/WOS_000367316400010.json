This paper conduct a further study of valued tolerance relation based rough approximations. We make an analysis of the existing rough approximabilities and propose a new approach for lower (upper) approximability, which is a generalization of Pawlak approximation operators for complete information system. The approach has also been generalized to fuzzy cases. Some basic properties of the approximation operators are examined.", "paper_title": "Rough Approximations Based on Valued Tolerance Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000367316400010"}
