Unlike conventional graph coloring, the proposed algorithm iterates over available channels assigning one channel at a time starting with a network with a higher priority (e.g. based on assigned channels so far) and then reusing the same channel in as many other networks as possible. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm not only improves spectrum utilization but also well approximates the optimal solution yet with polynomial-time complexity.", "paper_title": "Iterative Fair Channel Assignment for Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681200007"}
