The schemes presented here are memory-efficient and easy to implement, and some of them appproach the performance of majority-voting schemes without having the same memory requirements. One particularly interesting scheme combines segment-based transmission with Luby-type erasure codes.", "paper_title": "Memory-Efficient Segment-Based Packet-Combining Schemes in Face of Deadlines", "paper_id": "WOS:000268823700013"}
