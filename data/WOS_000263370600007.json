One sample of the whole system (i.e., subsystem) is taken into account in most DSMC methods. It means that a spatially-isotropic whole system is considered, and simulation particles having same number weight are tracked. A new event-driven constant-volume (EDCV) method for population balance modeling is proposed to describe the dynamic evolution in dispersed systems under influence of coagulation, breakage, nucleation, surface growth/dissolution (condensation/evaporation) and deposition (settling). The method adopts the concept of differentially weighting simulation particles, and several schemes of sample restoration are developed to maintain simulation particle number within prescribed bounds, at the same time the constant-volume computational domain is tracked. By comparing of several popular Monte Carlo methods, it is concluded that the proposed EDCV method exhibits comparatively high precision and efficiency. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
