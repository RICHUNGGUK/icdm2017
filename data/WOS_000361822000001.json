One of the key challenges in using these temporarily available spectrums is that bandwidths of the available spectrums are not equal. In addition, the issue of competition for a single channel by many secondary users must be resolved. This paper develops a load balancing spectrum decision scheme for CR networks with unequal-bandwidth, using the concept of the delay bandwidth (DB) product to select suitable unequal-width channels. Compared with other existing unequal bandwidth spectrum decision schemes, the proposed DB-based spectrum decision can improve the overall system throughput by up to 40 % in our simulation results.", "paper_title": "Delay-bandwidth product approach for unequal-width load balancing spectrum decisions in cognitive radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361822000001"}
