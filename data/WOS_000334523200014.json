In this paper, we extend Mita et al.'s work by proposing Gaussian weak classifiers that fuse information obtained from the co-occurring features at the feature level, and are potentially more discriminative. Experimental results, on the standard MIT+CMU test images, show that the face detectors built using Gaussian weak classifiers achieve up to 38 % more accuracy in terms of false positives and 42 % decrease in testing time when compared to the detectors built using Mita et al.'s weak classifiers.", "paper_title": "Gaussian weak classifiers based on co-occurring Haar-like features for face detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000334523200014"}
