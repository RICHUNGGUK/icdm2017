We define locality-aware predicates (LAP) that aim at detecting a predicate within a specified area. We model the area of interest as the set of processes that are within a breadth-first search tree (BFST) of height k rooted at the initiator process. Although a locality-aware predicate specifies a predicate only within a local area, observing the area consistently requires considering the entire system in a consistent manner. This raises the challenge of making the complexities of the corresponding predicate detection algorithms scale-free, i.e., independent of the size of the system. Since all existing algorithms for getting a consistent view of the system require either a global snapshot of the entire system or vector clocks of the size of the system, a new solution is needed. We focus on stable LAP, which are those LAP that remain true once they become true. We propose a scale-free algorithm to detect stable LAP within a k-height BFST. Our algorithm can detect both stable conjunctive LAP and stable relational LAP. In the process of designing our algorithm, we also propose the first distributed algorithm for building a BFST within an area of interest in a graph, and the first distributed algorithm for recording a consistent sub-cut within the area of interest. This paper demonstrates that LAPs are a natural fit for detecting distributed properties in large-scale distributed systems, and stable LAPs can be practically detected at low cost.
