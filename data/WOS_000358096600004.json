Based on the power-law interpolation, shrinkage of concrete is numerically simulated by introducing an additional design-dependent force. Under multi-axial stress conditions, the concrete failure surface is well fitted by two Drucker-Prager yield functions. The optimization problem aims at minimizing the cost function under yield strength constraints on concrete elements and a structural shrinkage volume constraint. In conjunction with the adjoint-variable sensitivity information, the enhanced aggregation method is utilized to efficiently reduce the computational effort arisen from large-scale strength constraints. Numerical results reveal that the proposed approach can produce a reasonable solution with the least steel reinforcements to ensure the structural safety under the combined action of external loads and shrinkage.
