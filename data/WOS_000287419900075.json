To deal with these two issues, a multi-agent system (MAS) and knowledge management systems (KMS) based process management system is proposed. The proposed system has two goals: to prevent the PD information quality deterioration by active management of analytical processes and to provide a universal access point allowing the simultaneous use of multiple prediction models.
