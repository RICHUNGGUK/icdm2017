{"auto_keywords": [], "paper_keywords": ["MV algebra", " R-0 algebra", " state"], "paper_abstract": "The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of states on R-0 algebras and investigate some of their properties. We prove that every R-0 algebra possesses at least one state. Moreover, we investigate states on weak R-0 algebras and give some examples to show that, in contrast to R-0 algebras, there exist weak R-0 algebras which have no states. We also derive the condition under which finite linearly ordered weak R-0 algebras have a state.", "paper_title": "States on R-0 algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000256825600008"}
