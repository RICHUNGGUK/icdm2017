In this paper, we study the problem of parallel construction of ISTs on crossed cubes. We first propose the definitions of dimension-adjacent walk and dimension-adjacent tree along with a dimension property of crossed cubes. Then, we consider the parallel construction of ISTs on crossed cubes. We show that there exist n general dimension-adjacent trees which are independent of the addresses of vertices in the n-dimensional crossed cube CQ(n). Based on n dimension-adjacent trees and an arbitrary root vertex, a parallel algorithm with the time complexity is O(2(n))proposed to construct n ISTs on CQ(n), where n >= 1. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
