The TRMS is a highly nonlinear aerodynamic test rig with complex cross-coupled dynamics and therefore represents the control challenges of modern air vehicles. A highly nonlinear 1DOF mathematical model of the TRMS is considered in this study and a nonlinear inverse model is developed for the pitch channel of the system. An adaptive neural network element is integrated thereafter with the feedback control system to compensate for model inversion errors. The proposed on-line learning algorithm updates the weights and biases of the neural network using the error between the set-point and the real output. The real-time response of the method shows a satisfactory tracking performance in the presence of inversion errors caused by model uncertainty. The approach is therefore deemed to be suitable to apply real-time to other nonlinear systems with necessary modifications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
