In the case p = 2, we derive results related to the range of the operators, alternative representations, computation of their norms, basic spectral analysis and isolated properties involving the native spaces of the kernels. Even being not compact, the integral operators possess interesting properties which are peculiar to compact operators. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
