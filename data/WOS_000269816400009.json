Particular cases such as therapeutic and educational procedures, which rely strongly on paper-based artefacts (e.g., questionnaires, forms, manuals) assume special importance due to their critical content. However, their passiveness, limited interactivity, lack of adjustment. among other problems tend to obstruct personalization, hindering efficiency and limiting some users while achieving desired goals. This paper presents an environment that supports an easy and flexible design of tailored digital artefacts for mobile devices. The artefacts can be adjusted to the users' needs, providing support to various purposes by coping with and enhancing different procedures. The environment integrates a set of configurable domain oriented guidelines that aid end-users through the creation of their personalized artefacts. It has been validated through three case studies by providing support to mobile leaming. personal training and by offering means to achieve ubiquitous cognitive behavioural therapy.
