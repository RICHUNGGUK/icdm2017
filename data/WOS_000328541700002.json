We specify the core labelling properties in semantic web to identify the name of entities which are described in web resources and use them to identify the candidate senses for a web resource. Moreover, we define the web resource's context to identify the most appropriate sense for each of the input web resources. Evaluation of the system shows the high coverage of the core labelling properties and the high performance of the sense disambiguation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Web Resource Sense Disambiguation in Web of Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000328541700002"}
