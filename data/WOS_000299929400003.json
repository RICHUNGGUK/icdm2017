We predict the growth of multicore computing and dramatic growth of data, as well as the improvements in force fields and sampling methods. We also predict that effects of therapeutic and environmental molecules on human body, as well as complex natural chemical signalling will be understood in terms of three dimensional models of their binding to specific pockets.", "paper_title": "Computational chemistry in 25 years", "paper_id": "WOS:000299929400003"}
