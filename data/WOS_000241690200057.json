It is an indispensable step for effective data fusion algorithms such as CombSum and CombMNZ to combine them. In this paper, we evaluate four linear score normalization methods, namely the fitting method, Zero-one, Sum, and ZMUV, through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that the fitting method and Zero-one appear to be the two leading methods.", "paper_title": "Evaluating score normalization methods in data fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200057"}
