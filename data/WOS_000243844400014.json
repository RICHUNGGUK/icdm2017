Acyclic digraphs give a model for networks such as citation networks and organizational charts. Motivated by a \"local hierarchy theory\" developed for this model, we consider the set D(delta) of acyclic digraphs with a specified degree sequence delta. We show that all digraphs in this set can be generated from any one such digraph using just one kind of basic transformation. In the case of degree sequences delta that are minimal in the \"Lorenz order\", we investigate the maximum number of edges in an acyclic digraph in D(delta) and show how to construct digraphs in D(delta) with many edges. Determining this maximum number of edges seems to be a very difficult problem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
