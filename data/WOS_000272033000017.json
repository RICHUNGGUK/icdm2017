Firstly, based on the Hamiltonian realization of the nonlinear descriptor systems and a suitable output feedback, two nonlinear descriptor systems are equivalently transformed into two nonlinear Hamiltonian differential-algebraic systems by a nonsingular transformation, and a sufficient condition for two closed-loop systems to be impulse-free is given. The two systems are then combined to generate an augmented dissipative Hamiltonian differential-algebraic system by using the system-augmentation technique, based on which a simultaneous stabilization controller and a robust simultaneous stabilization controller are designed for the two systems. Secondly, the case of more than two nonlinear descriptor systems is investigated, and two new results are proposed for the simultaneous stabilization and robust simultaneous stabilization, respectively. Finally, an illustrative example is studied by using the results proposed in this paper, and simulations show that the simultaneous stabilization controllers obtained in this paper work very well.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous stabilization of a class of nonlinear descriptor systems via Hamiltonian function method", "paper_id": "WOS:000272033000017"}
