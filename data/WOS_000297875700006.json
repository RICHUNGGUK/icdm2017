We call this the \"load balancing problem\" of a P2P system. By providing an abstract formulation of the optimization problem, we contrast this problem with the network congestion control problem, both in terms of parallels and differences. We then proceed to study several versions and aspects of this problem: (a) request allocation, (b) neighbor selection, and (c) server load minimization. We have proposed and evaluated several practical algorithms that are discrete (window-based), distributed (without needing global information), and adaptive. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
