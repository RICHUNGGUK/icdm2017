The boundary of each link of the object is represented by a finite set of boundary points allowing links of any shape to be considered. Grasp analysis is carried out to verify whether a set of contact points on the object boundary allows a force-closure grasp, while the goal of grasp synthesis is to determine a set of contact points that allows a force-closure grasp. The paper describes the process of finding the elements of the generalized wrench vector generated by a force applied to any link of the articulated object and a procedure to search for a force-closure grasp based on these generalized wrenches. The approach has been implemented and some examples are included in the paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
