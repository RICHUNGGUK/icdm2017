Using spaces occupied by C2, C5 and C6 natural moieties of SA when bound to hemagglutinin (HA) crystallographic structure, new fragments that are commercially available were docked independently in all the pockets. The oriented fragments were then connected to the SA scaffold with or without incorporation of linker molecules. The completed analogues were docked to the whole SA binding site to estimate their binding conformations and affinities, generating three databases of HA-bound SA analogues. Selected new analogues showed higher estimated affinities than the natural SA when tested against H3N2, H5N1 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A. An improvement in the binding energies indicates that fragment-based drug design when combined with molecular docking simulation is capable to produce virtual analogues that can become lead compound candidates for anti-flu drug discovery program.", "paper_title": "Site-directed fragment-based generation of virtual sialic acid databases against influenza A hemagglutinin", "paper_id": "WOS:000276061300015"}
