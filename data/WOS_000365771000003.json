Edges correspond to the boundaries between regions in an image, which are useful for object segmentation and recognition tasks. This work presents a novel method for 3D edge detection based on Boolean functions and local operators, which is an extension of the 2D edge detector introduced by Vemis et al. [ Signal Processing 45(2), 161-172 (1995)] The proposed method is composed of two main steps. An adaptive binarization process is initially applied to blocks of the image and the resulting binary map is processed with a set of Boolean functions to identify edge points within the blocks. A global threshold, calculated to estimate image intensity variation, is then used to reduce false edges in the image blocks. The proposed method is compared to other 3D gradient filters: Canny, Monga-Deriche, Zucker-Hummel and Sobel operators. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique when applied to several 3D synthetic and real data sets.", "paper_title": "3D Edge Detection Based on Boolean Functions and Local Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000365771000003"}
