The calculus uses labels and transition formulas and can be used to prove decidability and space complexity bounds for the respective logics. We also show that these calculi can be the base for uniform proof systems. Moreover, we present CondLean, a theorem prover in Prolog for these calculi.", "paper_title": "A sequent calculus and a theorem prover for standard conditional logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000249658400004"}
