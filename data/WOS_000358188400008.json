We describe an open source library, Polyestimate, enabling a user with no knowledge of the surface code to specify realistic physical quantum gate error models and obtain logical error rate estimates. Functions allowing the user to specify simple depolarizing error rates for each gate have also been included. Every effort has been made to make this library user-friendly. Polyestimate provides data essentially instantaneously that previously required hundreds to thousands of hours of simulation, statements which we discuss and make precise. This advance has been made possible through careful analysis of the error structure of the surface code and extensive pre-simulation.", "paper_title": "POLYESTIMATE: A LIBRARY FOR NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS SURFACE CODE ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188400008"}
