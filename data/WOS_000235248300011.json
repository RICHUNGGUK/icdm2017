We prove a theorem that can be interpreted as follows: if the separoid S can be mapped with a monomorphism to a d-dimensional separoid of points P in general position, then there exists a k-colouring zeta: S -> K-k such that, for each pair of colours i, j epsilon K-k, the convex hulls of their preimages do intersect-they are not separated. Here, by a monomorphism we mean an injective function such that the preimage of separated sets are separated. In a sense, this result is \"dual\" to the Hadwiger-type theorems proved by Goodman and Pollack (1988) and Arocha et al. (2002). We also introduce upsilon(k,d), the minimum number n such that all d-dimensional separoids of order at least n can be k-coloured as before. By means of examples and explicit colourings, we show that for all k > 2 and d > 0, (k-1)(d+1)+1 <upsilon(k,d)<{k\\choose2}(d+1)+1. Furthermore, by means of a probabilistic argument, we show that for each d there exists a constant C=C(d) such that for all k, upsilon(k,d)<= Ck logk.", "paper_title": "Tverberg-type theorems for separoids", "paper_id": "WOS:000235248300011"}
