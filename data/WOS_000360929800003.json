Our proposal is a domain-independent regression planning model which provides good-quality responses in a timely fashion. The use of a regressed model allows us to work exclusively with the sufficient and necessary information to deal with the plan failure. The model performs a time-bounded process that continuously operate on the plan to recover from incoming failures. This process guarantees there always exists a plan repair for a plan failure at anytime. The model is tested on a simulation of a real-world planetary space mission and on a well-known vehicle routing problem.", "paper_title": "Reactive execution for solving plan failures in planning control applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000360929800003"}
