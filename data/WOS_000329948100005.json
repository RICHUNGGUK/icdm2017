Design/methodology/approach - A survey is performed to collect data. Valid questionnaires of 344 ARIT users are identified. The hypothesized associations are analyzed using structure equation modeling. Findings - Empirical results indicate that narrative experience induces a higher experiential value than other simulative experiences, including presence and media richness. Practical implications - Results of this study provide a valuable reference for managers attempting to design an ARIT process in order to optimize the experiential value in various online simulation environments. Originality/value - This study adopts an integrated framework that incorporates narrative theory, media richness theory, and presence in the online ARIT. Exactly how narrative experience, media richness, and presence affect the formation of experiential value in the ARIT process is explored as well.", "paper_title": "Formation of augmented-reality interactive technology's persuasive effects from the perspective of experiential value", "paper_id": "WOS:000329948100005"}
