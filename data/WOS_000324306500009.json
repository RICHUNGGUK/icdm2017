To efficiently obtain the services from high dependable nodes, many trust management systems have been developed. However, the previous trust models in distributed networks ignore a fact that the entity itself could provide trust information for services also. In this paper, we present a novel trust management model based on the subjective logic trust for service-oriented distributed networks. The proposed algorithm involves passive trust of entity and combines the direct trust and recommendation trust. We also propose a novel scheme called passive trust feedback to avoid the deceit of malicious nodes and unstable nodes, and to encourage honest nodes. Our proposed model expands the trust range of service resource via passive trust of entity, which generates a flexible access path to the service resources. Simulations show that the proposed trust management model can significantly improve the feasibility of trust management as well as effectively detect malicious entities.
