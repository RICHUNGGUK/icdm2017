Experimental images obtained using a single Galileo channel, E5a or E5b, are presented and analyzed. The paper also puts forward the channel combination scheme to jointly process E5a and E5b channels, which brings up high-resolution possibilities for passive SAR technique. By employing the entire E5 band for imaging, the range resolution may be potentially increased by up to 5 times. Preliminary experimental results for this concept are demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Passive GNSS-based SAR imaging and opportunities using Galileo E5 signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000356404200006"}
