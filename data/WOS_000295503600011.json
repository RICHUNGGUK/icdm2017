Information systems are treated as dynamic granules used for representing the results of the interaction of attributes with the environment. Two kinds of attributes are distinguished, namely, the perception attributes, including sensory attributes, and the action attributes. Sensory attributes are the basic perception attributes, other perception attributes are constructed on the basis of the sensory ones. Actions are activated when their guards, being often complex and vague concepts, are satisfied to a satisfactory degree. The guards can be approximated on the basis of measurements performed by sensory attributes rather than defined exactly. Satisfiability degrees for guards are results of reasoning called the adaptive judgment. The approximations are induced using hierarchical modeling. We show that information systems can be used for modeling more advanced forms of interactions in hierarchical modeling. The role of hierarchical interactions is emphasized in the modeling of interactive computations. Some illustrative examples of interactions used in the ACT-R 6.0 system are reported. ACT-R 6.0 is based on a cognitive architecture and can be treated as an example of a highly interactive complex granule which can be involved in hierarchical interactions. For modeling of interactive computations, we propose much more general information systems than the studied dynamic information systems (see, e.g., Ciucci (2010) [8] and Palasinski and Pancerz (2010)[32]). For example, the dynamic information systems are making it possible to consider incremental changes in information systems. However, they do not contain the perception and action attributes necessary for modeling interactive computations, in particular for modeling intrastep interactions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
