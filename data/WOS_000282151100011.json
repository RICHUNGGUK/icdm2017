In particular, our model includes a 'slow-to-stop' rule that exhibits more realistic microscopic driver behaviour than the BJH model. We present some statistics related to fuel economy and pollution generation and show that our model differs greatly in these measures. We give concise results based on extensive simulations using our system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
