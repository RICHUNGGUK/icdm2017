Previous work on sensor deployment has considered only sensor and environment models. This paper shows that considering also target models can greatly reduce the deployment cost. We first show how to derive target models for robot navigation and then show that the problem of finding the minimum-cost deployment of a sensor network is NP-hard. The presented algorithms were evaluated through extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Sensor-Deployment Strategies for Indoor Robot Navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000274734300014"}
