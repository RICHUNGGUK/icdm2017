In this paper, a secure oblivious watermarking system, based on Sparse Coding (SC) is proposed in order to tackle the three most critical watermarking security problems, i.e., unauthorized reading, false positive detection, and multiple claims of ownership problems, as well as optimize the fidelity, imperceptibility, and robustness characteristics. The reason for incorporating SC in the proposed system is to encode the watermark image before embedding it in the host image. This process is implemented using the well-known Stagewise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP) method and an orthogonal dictionary that is derived from the host image itself. The watermark embedding is implemented in the transform domain of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the host image. The proposed system is oblivious, as it does not need the original host image when extracting the embedded watermark. In addition, it is suitable for both bi-level and gray-level watermarks, and can accommodate large watermarks that are up to half the size of the host image. The proposed SC-DWT-SVD based watermarking scheme is tested for various malicious and un-malicious attacks and the experimental results show that it realizes the security requirement as it tackles the false positive detection and multiple claims of ownership problems on one hand and generates an encryption form of the watermark on the other hand. In addition, the added security does not compromise the imperceptibility and robustness aspects of the proposed technique and hence can be considered to be comparable or superior to other up-to-date watermarking techniques.
