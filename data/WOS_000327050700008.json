Using the approach presented in this study, first, without using any approximation, the transcendental characteristic equation is converted to an algebraic one with some specific crossing points. Then, an expression in terms of system parameters and imaginary root of the characteristic equation is derived for computing the delay margin. Finally, the concept of stability is expressed as a function of delay. An illustrative example is presented to confirm the proposed method results.", "paper_title": "Direct Method for Stability Analysis of Fractional Delay Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000327050700008"}
