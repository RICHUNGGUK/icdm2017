Since there exist some problems of finite samples and uncertain data in many forecasting problem, the input variables are described as crisp numbers by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. To represent the fuzzy degree of these input variables, the symmetric triangular fuzzy technique is adopted. Then by the integration of the fuzzy theory, v-SVM and Gaussian loss function theory, the fuzzy v-SVM with Gaussian loss function (Fg-SVM) which can penalize Gaussian noise is proposed. To seek the optimal parameters of Fg-SVM, genetic algorithm is also proposed to optimize the unknown parameters of Fg-SVM. The results of the application in sale system forecasts confirm the feasibility and the validity of the Fg-SVM model. Compared with the traditional model, Fg-SVM method requires fewer samples and has better generalization capability for Gaussian noise. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
