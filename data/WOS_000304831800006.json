First, a new WS with multiple weights is constructed, and it is proved that when the squared Euclidean distance between the WS and the cover image is minimal, the weight parameters are equal to the embedding ratios in MLSB planes. Afterward, based on this result and an estimation of cover image, a simple estimation equation is derived to estimate the embedding ratio in each bit plane. Experimental results show that the new steganalysis method performs more stably with the change of embedding ratios than typical structural steganalysis, and outperforms the typical structural steganalysis method on the estimation accuracy when the embedding ratio in any bit plane is larger than 0.4.", "paper_title": "Weighted Stego-Image Steganalysis of Messages Hidden into Each Bit Plane", "paper_id": "WOS:000304831800006"}
