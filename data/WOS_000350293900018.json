Performance and power consumption of an on-chip interconnect are directly affected by the network topology. Researchers have proposed various topologies to optimize these metrics. The efficiency can also be optimized by proper mapping of applications. Therefore in this paper, we propose a novel partially diagonal network-on-chip (PDNOC) design that takes advantage of both heterogeneous network topology and congestion-aware application mapping. We analyse the partially diagonal network in terms of interconnect structure, area usage, power consumption, routing algorithm and implementation complexity. The key insight that enables the PDNOC is that most communication patterns in real-world applications are hot-spot and bursty. We implement a full system simulation environment using SPLASH-2 benchmarks. Performance metrics of standard mesh, concentrated mesh, full diagonal mesh and four types of the proposed PDNOC are measured in terms of network latency, application execution time and energy delay product. Evaluation results show that on average, the proposed PDNOC designs provide up to 36% improvement in execution time over concentrated mesh, and 3.6x better energy delay product over fully connected diagonal network. PDNOC design with two adjacent PD networks is a better candidate for higher efficiency, while four PD networks provide better performance.
