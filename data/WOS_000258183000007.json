Following a bottom-up approach, services provided by elementary components are used as resources for services at a higher level. Several versions exist when the same service can be rendered by using distinct sets of resources. Reconfiguration results from the existence of multiple versions since a faulty resource does not imply losing the services that use it. A level regulation example shows the effectiveness of the proposed model and tools.", "paper_title": "Reconfiguration analysis using generic component models", "paper_id": "WOS:000258183000007"}
