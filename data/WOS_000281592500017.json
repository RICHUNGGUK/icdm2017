Providing wideband multimedia access for a variety of applications has led to the inception of mesh networks. Classic access techniques such as FDMA and TDMA have been the norm for such networks. CDMA maximum transmitter power is much less than TDMA and FDMA counter parts, which is an important asset for mobile operation. In this paper we introduce a code division multiple access/time division duplex technique CDMA/TDD for such networks. The CDMA approach is an almost play and plug technology for wireless access, making it amenable for implementation by the mesh network service station, SS. Further it inherently allows mesh network service stations to use a combination of turbo coding and dynamic parallel orthogonal transmission to improve network efficiency. We outline briefly the new transmitter and receiver structures then evaluate the efficiency, delay and delay jitter. By analysis we show the advantages over classic counter parts with respect to the total network efficiency achievable especially for larger number of hops. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
