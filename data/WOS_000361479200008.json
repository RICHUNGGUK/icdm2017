Correlated components are identified under the assumption that the involved spatial networks are identical. Herewe propose a hierarchical probabilistic model that can infer the level of universality in such multiview data, from completely unrelated representations, corresponding to canonical correlation analysis, to identical representations as in correlated component analysis. This new model, which we denote Bayesian correlated component analysis, evaluates favorably against three relevant algorithms in simulated data. A well-established benchmark EEG data set is used to further validate the new model and infer the variability of spatial representations across multiple subjects.", "paper_title": "Multiview Bayesian Correlated Component Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000361479200008"}
