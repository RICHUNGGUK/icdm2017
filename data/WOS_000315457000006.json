To develop such clients, we present a parameterized network traffic model, based on a large collection of Second Life traces gathered by us. Our methodology is also applicable to virtual worlds other than Second Life. With the traffic model, various optimization criteria can be adopted, including visual quality, response time, and energy consumption. We use energy consumption as the show case, and demonstrate via trace-driven simulations that, compared to two existing schemes, a mobile client can save up to 36% and 41% communication energy by selectively turning on its WiFi network interface.", "paper_title": "Region- and Action-Aware Virtual World Clients", "paper_id": "WOS:000315457000006"}
