They allow the user to define geometric elements, establish relationships between them and explore the dynamic behavior of the remaining geometric elements when one of them is moved. The main problem in dynamic geometry systems is the ambiguity that arises from operations that lead to more than one possible solution. Most dynamic geometry systems deal with this problem in such a way that the solution selection method leads to a fixed dynamic behavior of the system. This is specially annoying when the behavior observed is not the one the user intended. In this work we propose a modular architecture for dynamic geometry systems built upon a set of functional units which will allow us to apply some well-known results from the Geometric Constraint Solving field. A functional unit called filter will provide the user with tools to unambiguously capture the expected dynamic behavior of a given geometric problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
