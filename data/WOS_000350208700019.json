This has several advantages, most importantly, that test cubes, which are derived from functional broadside tests, create functional operation conditions in subcircuits around the sites of detected faults. These conditions are preserved when a test cube is merged with other test cubes. This brief applies a similar approach to the generation of a low-power skewed-load test set. The main challenge that this paper addresses is the derivation of skewed-load test cubes from functional broadside tests. The paper also considers the percentages of values that should be unspecified in the skewed-load test cubes in order to balance the need to create functional operation conditions with the need for test compaction.", "paper_title": "Skewed-Load Test Cubes Based on Functional Broadside Tests for a Low-Power Test Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000350208700019"}
