The proposed transform consists essentially in changing the descriptors originally defined in the space of the calculus of fractal dimension into the space of coefficients used in the functional data representation of these descriptors. The transformed descriptors are used here in texture classification problems. The enhancement provided by the FDA transform is measured by comparing the transformed to the original descriptors in terms of the correctness rate in the classification of well known datasets.", "paper_title": "ENHANCING VOLUMETRIC BOULIGAND-MINKOWSKI FRACTAL DESCRIPTORS BY USING FUNCTIONAL DATA ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296644000004"}
