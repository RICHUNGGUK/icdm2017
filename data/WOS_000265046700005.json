This problem is formulated here as an optimization problem where the positions of a finite set of inductors are the design variables. Two different formulations for this optimization problem for the two-dimensional case are proposed. The first one minimizes the difference between the target and the equilibrium shapes while the second approach minimizes the L (2) norm of a fictitious surface pressure that makes the target shape to be in mechanical equilibrium. The optimization problems are solved using Feasible Arc Interior Point Algorithm, a line search interior-point algorithm for nonlinear optimization. Some examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "The inverse electromagnetic shaping problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000265046700005"}
