Analysis of axially loaded piles in a multi-layered soil is complicated and deserves more attention. A boundary element method is used in this study to analyze an axially loaded single pile in a multi-layered soil using the solution for vertical and horizontal axisymmetric ring loads in a multi-layered elastic medium. Good and reasonable agreement is obtained between the proposed and published solutions for a single pile in a homogenous soil, a finite soil, and a Gibson soil. The proposed solution is also used to evaluate an axially loaded single pile in a multi-layered (8 layers) soil. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
