Such journals are labeled predatory journals. This study examines author profiles for some of these predatory journals as well as for groups of more well-recognized open access journals. We collect and analyze the publication record, citation count, and geographic location of authors from the various groups of journals. Statistical analyses verify that each group of journals has a distinct author population. Those who publish in predatory journals are, for the most part, young and inexperienced researchers from developing countries. We believe that economic and sociocultural conditions in these developing countries have contributed to the differences found in authorship between predatory and nonpredatory journals.", "paper_title": "Who publishes in \"predatory\" journals?", "paper_id": "WOS:000355858200008"}
