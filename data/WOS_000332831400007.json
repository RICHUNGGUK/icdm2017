We show that the completely mixed uniform strategy profile, i.e., the combination of mixed strategies (one per player) where each player plays with equal probability each one of her available pure strategies, is with high probability a root lnn/n-Nash equilibrium and a root 3 lnn/n-well supported Nash equilibrium, where n is the number of pure strategies available to each player. This asserts that the completely mixed, uniform strategy profile is an almost Nash equilibrium for random bimatrix games, since it is, with high probability, an epsilon-well-supported Nash equilibrium where epsilon tends to zero as n tends to infinity.", "paper_title": "Random Bimatrix Games Are Asymptotically Easy to Solve (A Simple Proof)", "paper_id": "WOS:000332831400007"}
