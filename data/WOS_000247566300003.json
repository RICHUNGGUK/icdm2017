An electric analogy is used to capture the flow of information throughout the design process, it maps well to existing models of collaboration, and it provides a mechanism to capture resistances to flow. Specifically, the resistances are identified from a collaborative design taxonomy. Currently, these resistances are qualitatively captured based upon empirical evidence, but they may in the future be calibrated with additional experimental investigations. The model is illustrated through a simple example. Extensions and an assessment of the model are provided.", "paper_title": "Resistance based modeling of collaborative design", "paper_id": "WOS:000247566300003"}
