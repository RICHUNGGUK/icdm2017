In numerous applications the rapid increase of data size over time makes classical clustering algorithms too slow because of the high computational cost. In such situations online clustering algorithms are an efficient alternative to classical batch algorithms. We present an original online algorithm for graph clustering based on a Erdos-Renyi graph Mixture. The relevance of the algorithm is illustrated, using both simulated The real data set is a network extracted from the French political blogosphere and and real data sets. presents an interesting community organization.
