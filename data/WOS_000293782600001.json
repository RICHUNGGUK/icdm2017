Adopting Eisenhardt's (1989) 'process of building theories from case study research', it explores IL in the context of a wide range of teaching and learning experiences in the programme, using interview, questionnaire, students' reflection, observation and document study as data collection methods. The two-level within- and across-case analysis, suggested by Eisenhardt, was innovatively combined with grounded theory data analysis approaches. It appeared that in the ODL GIS programmes IL is needed, not just as a set of transferable skills, but as an enabler for independent, connective, transferable and lifelong learning.", "paper_title": "A contextual model of information literacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000293782600001"}
