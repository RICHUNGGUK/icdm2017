In order to store and handle the UCS, we propose a two-level data structure which is efficient for storage and easy to process. We also pointed several practical applications for our shortest cycle algorithms and the UCS data structure.", "paper_title": "Computing shortest cycles using universal covering space", "paper_id": "WOS:000251001400005"}
