To begin with, we find a closed-form expression for the information-theoretic causal rate-distortion function (RDF) under such distortion measure, denoted by R-c(it)(D), for first-order Gauss-Markov processes. R-c(it)(D) is a lower bound to the optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA) by any causal source code, namely R-c(it)(D). We show that, for Gaussian sources, the latter can also be upper bounded as R-c(op)(D) <= R-c(it)(D) + 0.5 log(2) (2 pi e) bits/sample. In order to analyze R-c(it)(D) for arbitrary zero-mean Gaussian stationary sources, we introduce <(R-c(it))over bar>(D), the information-theoretic causal RDF when the reconstruction error is jointly stationary with the source. Based upon <(R-c(it))over bar>(D), we derive three closed-form upper bounds to the additive rate loss defined as <(R-c(it))over bar>(D) - R(D), where R(D) denotes Shannon's RDF. Two of these bounds are strictly smaller than 0.5 bits/sample at all rates. These bounds differ from one another in their tightness and ease of evaluation; the tighter the bound, the more involved its evaluation. We then show that, for any source spectral density and any positive distortion D <= sigma(2)(x), <(R-c(it))over bar>(D) can be realized by an additive white Gaussian noise channel surrounded by a unique set of causal pre-, post-, and feedback filters. We show that finding such filters constitutes a convex optimization problem. In order to solve the latter, we propose an iterative optimization procedure that yields the optimal filters and is guaranteed to converge to <(R-c(it))over bar>(D). Finally, by establishing a connection to feedback quantization, we design a causal and a zero-delay coding scheme which, for Gaussian sources, achieves an operational rate lower than <(R-c(it))over bar>(D) + 0.254 and <(R-c(it))over bar>(D) + 0.754 bits/sample, respectively. This implies that the OPTA among all zero-delay source codes, denoted by R-zd(op)(D), is upper bounded as R-zd(op)(D) < <(R-c(it))over bar>(D) + R(D) + 1.754 bits/sample.", "paper_title": "Improved Upper Bounds to the Causal Quadratic Rate-Distortion Function for Gaussian Stationary Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000303204900037"}
