How to automatically and effectively discover new knowledge from rich multimedia data poses a compelling challenge because most state-of-the-art data mining techniques can only search and extract pre-defined patterns or knowledge from complex heterogeneous data. In light of this challenge, we propose a hybrid approach that allows scientists to use data mining as a first pass, and then forms a closed loop of visual analysis of current results followed by more data mining work inspired by visualization, the results of which can be in turn visualized and lead to the next round of visual exploration and analysis. In this way, new insights and hypotheses gleaned from the raw data and the current level of analysis can contribute to further analysis. As a first step toward this goal, we implement a visualization system with three critical components: (1) a smooth interface between visualization and data mining; (2) a flexible tool to explore and query temporal data derived from raw multimedia data; and (3) a seamless interface between raw multimedia data and derived data. We have developed various ways to visualize both temporal correlations and statistics of multiple derived variables as well as conditional and high-order statistics. Our visualization tool allows users to explore, compare and analyze multi-stream derived variables and simultaneously switch to access raw multimedia data.
