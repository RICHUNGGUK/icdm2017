Our primary goal is to reduce the space required for such a dictionary data structure. Many compression schemes have been developed for dictionaries, which fall generally in the categories of combinatorial encodings and data-aware methods and still support queries efficiently. We show that for many (real-world) datasets, data-aware methods lead to a worthwhile compression over combinatorial methods. Additionally, we design a new data-aware building block structure called BSCAP that presents improvements over other data-aware methods.", "paper_title": "Compressed dictionaries: Space measures, data sets, and experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000238121700014"}
