Most of the engineering design problems can be modelled as MINLP problems with stochastic parameters. In this paper a decomposition algorithm is presented to solve convex stochastic MINLP problems. The proposed approach is an extension of the simplicial approximation approach proposed by Goyal and Ierapetritou [Goyal, V., & lerapetritou, M. G. (2004a). MINLP optimization using simplicial approximation method for classes of non-convex problems. In C. A. Floudas, & P. M. Pardalos (Eds.), Frontiers in Global Optimization (p. 165). Goyal, V., & lerapetritou, M. G. (2004b). Computational studies using a novel simplicial-approximation based algorithm for MINLP optimisation. Computers and Chemical Engineering, 28, 177 1], for solving deterministic MINLP problems and is based on the idea of representing the feasible region by a close approximation of its convex hull. Two case studies are presented illustrating the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
