To avoid such problems while working to minimize budgetary expenses, we balanced traffic flow on 'to-be-determined' backhauls and adjacent links, a mixed nonlinear- and integer-programming problem that minimizes the aggregated flow subject to budget, backhaul assignment, top-level load-balanced routing, and link capacity constraints. Two algorithms are proposed, weighted backhaul assignment (WBA) and greedy load-balanced routing (GLBR), that operate in conjunction with Lagrangean relaxation (LR), used for constructing LR-based heuristics and also as a means of quantification and evaluation of the proposed algorithms. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithms achieve near-optimization, outperforming related solutions.
