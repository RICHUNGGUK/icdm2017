Our purpose is to find a criterion to identify the simultaneous and non-simultaneous quenching which coincides with the continuous one. We also show that the quenching set and quenching rate converge to the continuous one.", "paper_title": "Numerical quenching for a reaction-diffusion system with coupled singular absorption terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000300529500017"}
