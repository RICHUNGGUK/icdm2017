Using business professionals, technology adoption is investigated by presenting participants with an alternative choice set using software applications relevant to the professional domain of the subjects. Results from this study, focusing on models of intentions, provide evidence to suggest the underlying process by which choice behaviors are determined and demonstrate the value of incorporating choice into models of technology adoption, particularly in situations where selection is made from a set of candidate technologies, such as in an organizational adoption decision. In addition, theoretically derived models of comparison processes are examined to develop further understanding into how individuals arrive at a specific choice behavior. A second study is conducted to further validate the obtained results. Implications for future research into the processes leading to adoption of information technologies are also presented.", "paper_title": "Exploring Choice as an Antecedent to Behavior: Incorporating Alternatives into the Technology Acceptance Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000208914200005"}
