A preprocessing transformation matrix is first introduced, which transforms both the complex-valued covariance matrix and the complex-valued search vector into real-valued ones. Then the 2-D DOA estimation problem is decoupled into two successive real-valued one-dimensional (1-D) DOA estimation problems with real-valued computations only. All these measures lead to significantly reduced computational complexity for the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Computationally efficient 2-D DOA estimation for uniform rectangular arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000339724400012"}
