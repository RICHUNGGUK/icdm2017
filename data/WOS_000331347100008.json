In this paper, we propose a new License Plate (LP) detection technique based on multistage information fusion, which is adopted to reduce high false alarm rate in the conventional Adaboost detector. The proposed multistage information fusion system is composed of an enhanced Adaboost detector, a color checking module and an SVM detector, where the latter two stages further check whether the image patch that gets through the Adaboost detector is an LP. Test results of the dataset that consists of 950 real-world images show that the fusion reduces the false alarm rate. The proposed Fusion detector outperforms the conventional Adaboost detector throughout the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the best Fusion detector reaches 0.9081; however, the AUC of the best Adaboost detector is only 0.8441, which shows that the modification on feature extraction and the multistage information fusion significantly improve the LP detection performance.
