In this paper, a method is proposed to obtain multiple training samples from a single face image by sampling, and then Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) is applied to the set of newly produced samples. Experimental results on the ORL face database show that the proposed method is feasible and has higher recognition performance than E(PC)(2)A and SVD perturbation algorithms. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
