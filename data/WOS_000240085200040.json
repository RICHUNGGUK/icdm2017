Pi-calculus is a kind of mobile process algebra which can be used for modeling concurrent and dynamic systems. Based on the pi-calculus, this paper proposes a kind of ontology process model used for solving the change implementation and propagation problems in ontology evolution process. This solution is discussed at three levels: the change implementation of single ontology evolution, the push-based synchronization realization for the change propagation in the evolution of multiple dependent ontologies within a single node, and the pull-based synchronization realization for the change propagation of the distributed ontologies evolution.", "paper_title": "A description method of ontology change management using Pi-calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200040"}
