Due to lack of evident influence of free cysteines on the protein structure, it may be expected that only half-cystines convey encoded information. The results obtained from the analysis of amino acid distribution in proximity of both states of cysteines explicitly indicated that perquisite information for inducing cysteine bonding state is present even in the flanking amino acid sequences of free cysteines.
