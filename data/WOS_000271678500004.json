Given a polynomial mapping f = (f(1), ... , f(p)) from k(n) to k(p), the local Bernstein-Sato ideal of f at a point a is an element of k(n) is defined as an ideal of the ring of polynomials in s = (s(1), ... , s(p)). We propose an algorithm for computing local Bernstein-Sato ideals by combining Grobner bases in rings of differential operators with primary decomposition in a polynomial ring. It also enables us to compute a constructible stratification of k(n) such that the local Bernstein-Sato ideal is constant along each stratum. We also present examples, some of which have nonprincipal Bernstein-Sato ideals, computed with our algorithm by using the computer algebra system Risa/Asir. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
