It is obtained that evolution of the averaging number density along with time in space of three dimensions is described in different cluster of neuronal oscillators firing action potential at different phase space by means of method of numerical analysis. The results of numerical analysis show that the dynamic model proposed in this paper can be used to describe mechanism of neurodynamics on attention and memory.", "paper_title": "A neural model on cognitive process", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000008"}
