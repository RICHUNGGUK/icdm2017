The result is an agile software engineering methodology tailored to open self-organising systems. We show how the methodology has been applied in a development project and discuss the lessons learned. Finally, we compare the Scrum version of PosoMAS to other agile agent-oriented software engineering methodologies and address the selection of a suitable process.", "paper_title": "COMBINING POSOMAS METHOD CONTENT WITH SCRUM: AGILE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FOR OPEN SELF-ORGANISING SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000371914800002"}
