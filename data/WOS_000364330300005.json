(J Inst Math Appl 11:73-82, 1973). Major contributions are that the integral form of the mean-value theorem leads to a proof that the BFGS update is pointwise the infinite average of all the updates on the one-dimension manifold in the Dennis class that connects the DFP secant update to the Greenstadt update, and that it can be expressed as the pointwise average of these latter two updates. Analogous results hold for all secant updates that belong to the difference class. These results contribute new understanding of the structural properties of the highly popular BFGS secant update and other updates from the difference class.", "paper_title": "On averaging and representation properties of the BFGS and related secant updates", "paper_id": "WOS:000364330300005"}
