However, if there are fingerprints per audio file, then the amount of query data for the audio search increases. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can reduce the number of fingerprints while providing a level of performance similar to that of existing methods. The proposed method uses the difference of Gaussians which is often used in feature extraction during image signal processing. In the experiment, we use the proposed method and dynamic time warping and undertake an experimental search for the same audio with a success rate of 90%. The proposed method, therefore, can be used for an effective audio search.", "paper_title": "An algorithm that minimizes audio fingerprints using the difference of Gaussians", "paper_id": "WOS:000296253000006"}
