The large size of these circuits poses major challenges for simulation in terms of excessive CPU cost. To address this, a parallel circuit simulation algorithm has been recently developed that allows modern multicore processors to be exploited to realize higher parallel scalability with an increasing number of CPUs. In this paper, several methods have been proposed to improve efficiency and flexibility during the partitioning of analog circuits. The proposed methods reduce the constraints for partitioning, allowing a more efficient set of partitions to be found, which improves scalability when used in a parallel implementation.", "paper_title": "Addressing Partitioning Issues in Parallel Circuit Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000345568900023"}
