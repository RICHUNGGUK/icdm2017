We consider the problem in a setting where there is no golden reference for verifying the validity of the interconnections between the blocks. The proposed verification methodology relies on an abstract modeling of the functional behavior of the blocks and a set of consistency criteria defined over the composition of these abstract models. A new formalism called mode sequence chart (MSeqC) has been presented for capturing the behavior of the blocks at a level of abstraction that is suitable for interconnection verification. We present rules to compose the MSeqCs of each block in an integrated design and present three criteria that indicate possible interconnection faults. We present a tool called AMS-IV (AMS-interconnection verification) that takes the design netlist as input, the MSeqC model of each design block as reference, and tests the three criteria.
