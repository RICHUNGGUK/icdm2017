Therefore, this research attempts to present an objective and quantitative assessment model based on the Balance Scorecard approach for the purpose of appraising the performance of the ERP system. The methodology used in this research involves the Grounded Theory, Expert Questionnaire, the Analytic Hierarchy Process, and the Fuzzy Theory to filter out and develop the KPIs for the ERP system performance assessment model. It is expected that such a model may be used by enterprises to assess the efficiency of the ERP system during the various stages of management and support within the system. Finally, this assessment model is verified in a case company through the examination of its unbiased and quantifiable assessment approach. This result allows us to further understand authentic efficiency, and explore if enterprises have fulfilled their proposed objectives after the introduction of the ERP system.", "paper_title": "An ERP system performance assessment model development based on the balanced scorecard approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000292286200011"}
