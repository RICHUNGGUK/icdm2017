By better and more quickly estimating the state of a system we can make better decisions faster. This has tremendous value and broad impact. A key function in system state estimation is data fusion. A model for data fusion is adapted here for civil engineering systems from existing models. Applications and future research needs are identified.", "paper_title": "A model for data fusion in civil engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630500029"}
