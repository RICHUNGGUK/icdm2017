However, combining two brands may cause brand meaning to transfer in ways that were never intended. Utilizing two or more brand names in the process of introducing new products offers competitive advantages. The present paper advances research on co-branding strategies by proposing a knowledge management system for co-branding through an ontology with three concepts: co-branding aim, category, and effect. The ontology-based knowledge system not only provides a roadmap of co-branding strategies but also illuminates issues related to co-branding for related research. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
