Based on a statistical analysis of this test we propose simple and effective methods for its improvement. These methods are related to the m spacing technique common in goodness-of-fit problems and the L - leave out method used for a noise reduction in the final Maurer test statistic. We also show that the spacing distribution test represents a serious competitor for Maurer's test in the case when the random number generator is governed by a Markov chain with a long memory.", "paper_title": "On statistical testing of random numbers generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000240537600019"}
