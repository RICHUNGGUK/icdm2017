The problem of finding a singleton attractor in a BN is known to be NP-hard in general. For BNs consisting of n nested canalyzing functions, we present an O(1.799(n)) time algorithm. The core part of this development is an O(min(2(k/2) . 2(m/2), 2(k)) . poly(k, m)) time algorithm for the satisfiability problem for m nested canalyzing functions over k variables. For BNs consisting of chain functions, a subclass of nested canalyzing functions, we present an O(1.619(n)) time algorithm and show that the problem remains NP-hard, even though the satisfiability problem for m chain functions over k variables is solvable in polynomial time. Finally, we present an o(2(n)) time algorithm for bounded degree BNs consisting of canalyzing functions.", "paper_title": "Determining a Singleton Attractor of a Boolean Network with Nested Canalyzing Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000295079100001"}
