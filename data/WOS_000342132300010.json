It is necessary to consider this cost while charging the consumers for their service utilization. In this work, we arrive at a metering mechanism for cloud services, in which the price of a cloud service tracks the variable input cost of electricity from a smart grid. The power-aware cloud metering developed here is a dynamic pricing and billing model where tariff for a cloud service is varied in accordance with the input electricity cost. We arrive at a model for power consumption of virtual machines hosted on the cloud infrastructure. This power consumption model is used in calculating the cost of operation of the service. A cloud instance leased by a consumer is billed based on the cost of operation obtained, and its resource utilization. Experimental results validate the approach presented.", "paper_title": "Power-Aware Cloud Metering", "paper_id": "WOS:000342132300010"}
