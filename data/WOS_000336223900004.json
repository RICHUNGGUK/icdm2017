Therefore, several IT manufacturers around the world have developed plans for fulfilling consumer's needs by providing a combination of product and services and also management of product at the end of its life (EOL). Hence, it is essential to develop an analytical model that can help manufacturers to analyze their S-PSS plans. We model both optimization of environmental and economical impacts of the product during consumption and end of life phase from point of view of the consumer and manufacturer. A multi-objective genetic algorithm has been applied to simultaneously optimize service period and product EOL decisions. Finally, a case study of a notebook market is provided to show the applications of the model.", "paper_title": "A model for integrating services and product EOL management in sustainable product service system (S-PSS)", "paper_id": "WOS:000336223900004"}
