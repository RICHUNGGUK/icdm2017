Each round of panning consists of two basic processes: Selection and amplification. However, recent studies have showed that the amplification step would decrease the diversity of phage display libraries due to different propagation capacity of phage clones. This may induce phages with growth advantage rather than specific affinity to appear in the final experimental results. The peptides displayed by such phages are termed as propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (PrTUPs). They would mislead further analysis and research if not removed. In this paper, we describe PhD7Faster, an ensemble predictor based on support vector machine (SVM) for predicting clones with growth advantage from the Ph.D.-7 phage display peptide library. By using reduced dipeptide composition (ReDPC) as features, an accuracy (Acc) of 79.67% and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.595 were achieved in 5-fold cross-validation. In addition, the SVM-based model was demonstrated to perform better than several representative machine learning algorithms. We anticipate that PhD7Faster can assist biologists to exclude potential PrTUPs and accelerate the finding of specific binders from the popular Ph.D.-7 library.
