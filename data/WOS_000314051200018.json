Several FTase inhibitors (FTIs) have advanced into clinical testing. Nevertheless, despite the progress in the field several functional and mechanistic doubts on the FTase catalytic activity have persisted. This work provides some crucial information on this important enzyme by describing the application of molecular dynamics simulations using specifically designed molecular mechanical parameters for a variety of 22 CaaX peptides known to work as natural substrates or inhibitors for this enzyme. The study involves a comparative analysis of several important molecular aspects, at the mechanistic level, of the behavior of substrates and inhibitors at the dynamic level, including the behavior of the enzyme and peptides, as well as their interaction, together with the effect of the solvent. Properties evaluated include the radial distribution function of the water molecules around the catalytically important zinc metal atom and cysteine sulfur of CaaX, the conformations of the substrate and inhibitor and the corresponding RMSF values, critical hydrogen bonds, and several catalytically relevant distances. These results are discussed in light of recent experimental and computational evidence that provides new insights into the activity of this enzyme.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics analysis of a series of 22 potential farnesyltransferase substrates containing a CaaX-motif", "paper_id": "WOS:000314051200018"}
