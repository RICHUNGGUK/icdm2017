Each variant is represented by a precedence subgraph that defines the tasks to be performed and their processing times. The proposed methods use priority rules and random choice to select the assembly subgraphs and to assign the tasks to the stations in order to minimize the number of required workstations. The methods are evaluated by a computational experiment based on medium- and large-scale benchmark problems.", "paper_title": "An evaluation of constructive heuristic methods for solving the alternative subgraphs assembly line balancing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000265020400002"}
