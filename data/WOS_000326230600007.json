Success of POC is reliant upon the willingness of members to contribute useful information and knowledge. Few studies have examined the influence of interpersonal bonds between members on members' contribution of information and knowledge within the context of POC. We investigated how trust, social identity, and empathy influence members' willingness to contribute knowledge to POC. Results indicated that trust and social identity within POC positively influenced the development of empathy. Empathy in turn exerted a positive influence on willingness to contribute personal knowledge and experience. Social identity also directly influenced members' willingness to contribute knowledge. The findings highlight the importance of trust, empathy, and a sense of group cohesiveness within online health settings in motivating members to contribute knowledge and support to other participants in POC.", "paper_title": "Trust, empathy, social identity, and contribution of knowledge within patient online communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000326230600007"}
