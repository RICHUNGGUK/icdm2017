Statistical models for short linear functional motifs in proteins are built using the database of short sequence fragments taken from proteins in the current release of the Swiss-Prot database. Those segments are confirmed by experiments to have single-residue post-translational modification. The sensitivities of the classification for various types of short linear motifs are in the range of 70%. The query protein sequence is dissected into short overlapping fragments. All segments are represented as vectors. Each vector is then classified by a machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine) as potentially modifiable or not. The resulting list of plausible post-translational sites in the query protein is returned to the user. We also present a study of the human protein kinase C family as a biological application of our method.", "paper_title": "Support-vector-machine classification of linear functional motifs in proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000235749700011"}
