The main challenge of the scenario is different velocity constraints for UAV and the LCA. To rise to the challenge, for fixed-wing UAV a novel moving center trajectory is proposed whose center is determined by the LCA. Moreover, the sufficient conditions on the proposed trajectory for fulfillment of UAV constraints are derived. In the next step, ambient disturbances like wind gust are considered for UAV heading rate computation which are mitigated by employment of the well known sliding mode controller. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
