Then we extend the scheme to a general form of sharing an arbitrary multi-qudit state in the high-dimensional system. The schemes consider the most general case where an arbitrary quantum state can be shared among an arbitrary number of agents in a symmetric way that any agent can recover the state with the help of the others. Compared with a traditional QSTS scheme sharing an unknown state, our schemes are more efficient since the dealer only needs to perform a simpler measurement and consume less classical communication costs.", "paper_title": "Quantum state sharing of arbitrary known multi-qubit and multi-qudit states", "paper_id": "WOS:000338135100006"}
