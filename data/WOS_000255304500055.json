Specific applications include electrodeposition of copper in sub-micron trenches, as well as any other electrochemical system with an arbitrarily shaped bulk region of dilute electrolyte solution. Our method uses a finite volume spatial discretization that is second-order accurate throughout, including a nonuniform region used as a transition to the far-field chemical concentrations. Time integration is performed with a splitting technique that includes a projection step to solve for the electric potential. The resulting method is first-order accurate in time, and is observed to be stable for relatively large time steps. Furthermore, the algorithm complexity scales very respectably with grid refinement and is naturally parallelizable. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
