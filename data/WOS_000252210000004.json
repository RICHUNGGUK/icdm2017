This article provides a parsimonious macroscopic model able to replicate the main traffic features occurring at this kind of intersection. Especially, it accounts for time-limited disruptions on the approach legs due to the insertion process, even when the entry demand does not exceed the merging capacity. It also computes circulating flows that are consistent with vehicle paths induced by the O-D traffic composition. The two-step validation process using data collected at two different roundabouts is convincing. Moreover, the model appears to be computer-efficient and has few easy-to-calibrate parameters. As a result, it can be easily linked to a traffic simulation package to model a whole urban network.", "paper_title": "A macroscopic single-lane roundabout model to account for insertion delays and O-D patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000252210000004"}
