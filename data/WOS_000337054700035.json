On the other hand, the labeling of fractured bone usually requires the participation of an expert. Moreover, close fragment can be joined after the segmentation because of their proximity and the resolution of the CT image. Classical methods perform well in the segmentation of healthy bone, but they are not able to identify bone fragments separately. In this paper, we propose a method to segment and label bone fragments from CT images. Labeling involves the identification of bone fragments separately. The method is based on 2D region growing and requires minimal user interaction. In addition, the presented method is able to separate wrongly joined fragments during the segmentation process.", "paper_title": "3D segmentation and labeling of fractured bone from CT images", "paper_id": "WOS:000337054700035"}
