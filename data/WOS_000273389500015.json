The formulation was capable of unifying several popular methods including the discontinuous Galerkin, staggered-grid multi-domain method, or the spectral difference/spectral volume methods into a single family. The extension of the method to quadrilateral and hexahedral elements is straightforward. In an attempt to extend the method to other element types such as triangular, tetrahedral or prismatic elements, the idea of \"flux reconstruction\" is generalized into a \"lifting collocation penalty\" approach. With a judicious selection of solution points and flux points, the approach can be made simple and efficient to implement for mixed grids. In addition, the formulation includes the discontinuous Galerkin, spectral volume and spectral difference methods as special cases. Several test problems are presented to demonstrate the capability of the method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
