Properties of the B-spline wavelet method are utilized to reduce the Hammerstein equations to some algebraic equations. The advantage of our method is that the dimension of the arising algebraic equation is 10 x 10. The operational matrix of semi-orthogonal B-spline scaling functions is sparse which is easily applicable. Error estimation of the presented method is analyzed and proved. To demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique the method applied to some illustrative examples and the maximum absolute error in the solutions are compared with the results in existing methods.20,25,27,29", "paper_title": "SEMI-ORTHOGONAL SPLINE SCALING FUNCTIONS FOR SOLVING HAMMERSTEIN INTEGRAL EQUATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291260400006"}
