We provide a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether an edge-colored complete graph is rainbow c-splittable. For not necessarily complete graphs, we show that the problem is polynomial if c = 2, whereas for c >= 3 it is NP-complete even if the graph has maximum degree 2c - 1. Finally, it remains NP-complete even for 2-edge colored graphs of maximum degree 7c - 14. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
