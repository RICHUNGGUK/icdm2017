This work describes a convex optimization problem, called reaper, that can reliably fit a low-dimensional model to this type of data. This approach parameterizes linear subspaces using orthogonal projectors and uses a relaxation of the set of orthogonal projectors to reach the convex formulation. The paper provides an efficient algorithm for solving the reaper problem, and it documents numerical experiments that confirm that reaper can dependably find linear structure in synthetic and natural data. In addition, when the inliers lie near a low-dimensional subspace, there is a rigorous theory that describes when reaper can approximate this subspace.", "paper_title": "Robust Computation of Linear Models by Convex Relaxation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351238600002"}
