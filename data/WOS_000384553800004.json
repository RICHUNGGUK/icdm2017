Additionally, the authors have in mind use cases where a large amount images are to be protected. Traditional encryption is not fast enough for such environments and such use cases. The authors derived a new solution by parallelizing selective encryption and using available GPU ( Graphic Process Unit) acceleration. Progress obtained in terms of performance allows considering selective encryption as a general purpose solution for the use cases considered. After presenting related works, a 'first level' of protection is described and a new 'strong level' of protection method is introduced. Different architecture designs and implementation choices are extensively discussed, considering various criteria: performance indeed, but also image reconstruction quality and quality of data protection.", "paper_title": "Fast Selective Encryption Methods for Bitmap Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000384553800004"}
