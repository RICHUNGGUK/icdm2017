Two types of applications have been considered, namely parameter (flaw) identification and probabilistic seismic analysis of structures. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) based metamodels are used in order to replace the time-consuming repeated structural analyses. The back-propagation algorithm is employed for training the ANN, using data derived from selected analyses. The trained ANN is then used to predict the values of the necessary data. The numerical tests demonstrate the computational advantages of the proposed methodologies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
