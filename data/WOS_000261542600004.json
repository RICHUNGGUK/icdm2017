The method is composed of three steps: identifying the free surface by using a non-linear function from the volume fraction matrix, updating the volume fraction matrix using a volume projection method with error correction and treatment of the results using overshooting or undershooting. Identification of the free surface includes using a polynomial function with 2, 4, or 8 coefficients for one-, two-, or three-dimensional problems respectively. The polynomial reconstruction involves non-negligible numerical error. The second advection step includes a linear projection method in space and time. Advection of the volume fraction matrix is computed from the occupying volume of the mesh at the previous time step. At the new time step the error at each grid point is assumed to be similar to the error at the previous time step and is used for correction. Overshooting or undershooting develops around the free surface mesh points due to the solution's finite time increment. The third step includes truncating the numerical overshooting or undershooting volumes, i.e. isotropic spreading of the excess fluid volumes. The PREC method is evaluated for a one-dimensional flow case and several two-dimensional simple flow cases with circular sections (cases include transition parallel to a coordinate, transition with an intersection angle to a coordinate and rotation). The results from the present method are compared with analytical solutions and results from a donor-cell VOF method. As a result of these comparisons, the PREC method is validated.
