According to Fourier series expansion theory, the hidden neurons activation functions in the improved ELM are sine and cosine functions. In addition, the improved ELM analytically determines the output weights of neural networks. Finally, experimental results are given to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the improved ELM.
