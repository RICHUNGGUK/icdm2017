The proposed scheme simultaneously performs bandwidth spreading and space-time coding and outperforms those using high-rate, conventional unitary space-time constellations. Furthermore, the proposed scheme allows for a simple detector structure based on fast Walsh transforms.", "paper_title": "Noncoherent Unitary Space-Time Modulated DSSS Systems in Multipath Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000304736100012"}
