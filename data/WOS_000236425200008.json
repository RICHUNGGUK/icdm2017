All these models, however, have been discussed for routing algorithms with deadlock avoidance. Recent studies have revealed that deadlocks are quite rare in the network, especially when enough routing freedom is provided. Thus, the hardware resources, e.g. virtual channels, dedicated for deadlock avoidance are not utilised most of the time. This consideration has motivated researchers to introduce fully adaptive routing algorithms with deadlock-recovery. This paper proposes a new analytical model to predict message latency in k-ary n-cubes with compressionless routing, a fully adaptive algorithm that uses deadlock-recovery. The proposed model uses results from queueing systems with impatient customers to capture the effects of the timeout mechanism used in this routing algorithm to deal with message deadlock. The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing results predicted by the analytical model against those obtained through simulation experiments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
