In this paper, we present the hidden Markov model and corresponding algorithm based on frame-domain. This model can effectively capture the correlation of wavelet frame coefficients, and we apply this model for image denoising. Furthermore, two new algorithms are developed for denoising. We demonstrate the performance of our new method on some text images with very encouraging results.", "paper_title": "Frame-based image denoising using hidden Markov model", "paper_id": "WOS:000257762000005"}
