In this paper, two types of forecasting methods within the framework of fuzzy regression analysis are discussed. The first type is a conventional forecasting method, which intends to find the value of a dependent variable when the given values of independent variables are beyond the range covered by historical data. The second type considers forecasting in which the necessary values of independent variables are desired when the given value of a dependent variable does not fall within the range of historical data. While the first type can be applied in planning, the second one is useful for control and management. Numerical examples are provided for illustration.", "paper_title": "FORECASTING IN FUZZY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289173000007"}
