Recent cyberinfrastructure initiatives seek to create ubiquitous, comprehensive, interactive, and functionally complete digital environments for research communities that consist of people, data, information, tools, and instruments. With product dissection as our unifying theme, we are applying cyberinfrastructure tools and technologies to undergraduate engineering education and assessing the impact of these tools on student learning. Specifically, the project combines product dissection activities at three universities with two digital design repositories CAD modeling and animation, video, and MediaWiki technology to enable cyberinfrastructure-based product dissection activities. Lessons learned from these efforts are presented from the students' perspectives as well as that of the faculties in both engineering and computer science. The implications for implementing the developments on a national scale are discussed along with ongoing research.
