Sufficient conditions are given to demonstrate fold-flip bifurcation. By performing linear and nonlinear transformation, the normal form and versal unfolding are derived to obtain the bifurcation diagrams of the truncated normal form such as fold bifurcation, flip bifurcation, and the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation of the period-2 cycle. Some numerical simulations are given to support the analytic results.", "paper_title": "Fold-flip bifurcation analysis on a class of discrete-time neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600020"}
