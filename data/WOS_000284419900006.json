We study the achievable rates in several scenarios of feedback and full unidirectional receiver cooperation. In particular, we focus on two scenarios: the first scenario is the general finite-state broadcast channel (FSBC) where both receivers send feedback to the transmitter while one receiver also sends its channel output to the second receiver. The second scenario is the degraded FSBC where only the strong receiver sends feedback to the transmitter. Using a superposition codebook construction, we derive the capacity regions for both scenarios. Combining elements from these two basic results, we obtain the capacity regions for a number of additional broadcast scenarios with feedback and unidirectional receiver cooperation.", "paper_title": "Capacity Theorems for Discrete, Finite-State Broadcast Channels With Feedback and Unidirectional Receiver Cooperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000284419900006"}
