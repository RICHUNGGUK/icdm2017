On the one hand, our receding horizon scheme is based upon an online optimisation that utilises optimised sequence plus local linear feedback. On the other hand, due to the consideration of computation burden, an amplitude decaying aggregation strategy is introduced to reduce the number of optimisation variables. The proposed controller is obtained using semi-definite programming, which can be easily solved by means of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is given to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Aggregation-based fuzzy dual-mode control for nonlinear systems with mixed constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000300854500004"}
