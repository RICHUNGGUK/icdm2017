In this paper, we point out their new distributed multiplication procedure is not secure, thus making the whole new construction insecure. Finally, we present an improved forward-secure signature scheme without a manager.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of Tzeng-Tzeng forward-secure signature schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290000024"}
