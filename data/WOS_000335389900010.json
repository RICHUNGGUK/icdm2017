It is a challenging work to design a edge-preserving image denoising scheme. Extended discrete Shearlet transform (extended DST) is an effective multi-scale and multi-direction analysis method, it not only can exactly compute the shearlet coefficients based on a multiresolution analysis, but also can provide nearly optimal approximation for a piecewise smooth function. Based on extended DST, an image denoising using fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) is proposed. Firstly, the noisy image is decomposed into different subbands of frequency and orientation responses using the extended DST. Secondly, the feature vector for a pixel in a noisy image is formed by the spatial regularity in extended DST domain, and the FSVM model is obtained by training. Then the extended DST detail coefficients are divided into two classes (edge-related coefficients and noise-related ones) by FSVM training model. Finally, the detail subbands of extended DST coefficients are denoised by using the adaptive Bayesian threshold. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can obtain better performances in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations than those state-of-the-art denoising techniques. Especially, the proposed method can preserve edges very well while removing noise.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Remote Sensing Image Denoising Method in Extended Discrete Shearlet Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000335389900010"}
