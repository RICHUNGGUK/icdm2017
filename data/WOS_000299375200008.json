Moreover, it is accepted that macro variables are completely defined by micro variables. We show that in the considered particle system with strong local (Coulomb) interaction this is not always the case. Namely, information concerning some macro variables can be encoded on a scale much finer than the micro scale.", "paper_title": "Critical States of Strongly Interacting Many-Particle Systems on a Circle", "paper_id": "WOS:000299375200008"}
