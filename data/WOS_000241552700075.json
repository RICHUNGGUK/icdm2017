We developed two constraints to avoid the singularity and local minima of the interaction matrix. These constraints were combined with the minimization of tracking errors to identify suitable system configuration for tracking. Experiments were conducted to validate the method.", "paper_title": "Towards constrained optimal 3D tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700075"}
