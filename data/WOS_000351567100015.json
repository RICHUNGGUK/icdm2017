In this paper, a novel method is proposed for realizing automated estimation of two important RTN-model parameters: the number of interface-states and corresponding threshold voltage shift. The proposed method utilizes a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to represent the voltage distributions, and estimates their parameters using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Using information criteria, the optimal estimation is automatically obtained while avoiding overfitting. In addition, we use a shared variance for all the Gaussian components in the GMM to deal with the noise in RTN signals. The proposed method improved estimation accuracy when the large measurement noise is observed.", "paper_title": "Automation of Model Parameter Estimation for Random Telegraph Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100015"}
