The flow field is described by the incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations using a vorticity-streamfunction approach. A fluid-solid coupling formulation for the thermal and momentum fields is developed that is robust, computationally efficient and second-order accurate. Solutions for several example problems are presented for flow over stationary and moving cylinders to bench mark the current approach. Heat transfer for an isolated cylinder and two cylinders in series are then examined to explore the Nusselt number dependence on cylinder spacing and unsteady conjugate heat transfer processes.
