In EANN, the optimal parameters are obtained by chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm. CPSO adopts chaotic mapping and combines local search and global search, possessing high search efficiency and good performance. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed model can correctly recur to the flow stress in the sampled data and it can also predict well the non-sampled data. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model are demonstrated in comparison with the model combining BP networks with mathematical models (BPN-MM) used in much literature.", "paper_title": "An evolutionary hybrid model for the prediction of flow stress of steel", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300129"}
