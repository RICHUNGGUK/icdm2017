The neighborhood pattern sensitive fault (NPSF) model is suitable to address such faulty behaviors and identify them during the characterization and/or test of new DRAM chips. However, NPSF test algorithms are extremely time-consuming and therefore not economically affordable. In this brief, we show how layout information can be used to refine and significantly simplify the NPSF model and reduce the test time complexity. As a case study, the folded DRAM array is considered. A realistic NPSF model, the Delta-type neighborhood, is introduced together with a time efficient test algorithm which is more than two-times cheaper than traditional ones. Even when incorporating bit-line influence and word-line coupling effects, along with NPSFs, the test algorithm time complexity almost remains unaltered. Therefore, the proposed approach makes NPSF testing economically affordable, and hence, suitable for the characterization/test of dense DRAMs in the nanoera.", "paper_title": "Layout-Based Refined NPSF Model for DRAM Characterization and Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000337167600022"}
