Instead, symmetric cryptosystem using preloaded keys is suitable for this environment. In such a solution, pairwise key establishment is a fundamental task for securing sensor networks. However, the conventional polynomial-based key predistribution approach, on which many existing key management schemes in sensor networks were based, can only offer probabilistic authentication. In this paper, we first develop a novel tame-based key predistribution approach, where we exploit tame automorphisms to get symmetric and two-one bivariate maps for the pairwise key establishment. This tame-based approach can provide deterministic authentication between two parties. We then present a general framework for the key predistribution, on the basis of the tame-based approach. It turns out that this tame map can substitute the conventional polynomial in any existing polynomial-based scheme to offer deterministic authentication service. In particular, we further introduce a new key predistribution scheme, the local symmetric-tame maps predistribution scheme, based on this framework and the deployment information. The analysis demonstrates that, in addition to being able to provide deterministic authentication service, the scheme not only has significantly better performance, but can also achieve greater resilience on security than existing schemes.", "paper_title": "TAME POOL-BASED PAIRWISE KEY PREDISTRIBUTION FOR LARGE-SCALE SENSOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000301026100001"}
