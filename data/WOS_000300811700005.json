If d is a primitive element modulo p(2), we determine the minimal characteristic polynomials of the sequences and hence their linear complexities, which depend on whether p equivalent to 1 or 3 (mod 4). Moreover, we generalize the result to the polynomial quotients modulo a power of p. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
