A new fuzzy level set algorithm is proposed in this paper to facilitate medical image segmentation. It is able to directly evolve from the initial segmentation by spatial fuzzy clustering. The controlling parameters of level set evolution are also estimated from the results of fuzzy clustering. Moreover the fuzzy level set algorithm is enhanced with locally regularized evolution. Such improvements facilitate level set manipulation and lead to more robust segmentation. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm was carried on medical images from different modalities. The results confirm its effectiveness for medical image segmentation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
