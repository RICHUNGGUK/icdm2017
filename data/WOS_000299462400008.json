Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides several approaches for the implementation of moment method on compute unified device architecture (CUDA) capable general purpose video cards, as well as giving general implementation design patterns and a good overview on the topic. Findings The proposed method seems to be efficient in the light of the presented numerical results. Originality/value - The subject of the paper is an evolving, considerably new aspect among computation techniques which could be of high interest for the scientific community.", "paper_title": "Acceleration of moment method using CUDA", "paper_id": "WOS:000299462400008"}
