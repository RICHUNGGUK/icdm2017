We prove that for k/2 < l = k, with high probability almost all edges of the random k -uniform hypergraph H(n,p,k) with p(n) >> log 2n/n can be decomposed into edge-disjoint type l Hamilton cycles. A slightly weaker result is given for l = k/2. We also provide sufficient conditions for decomposing almost all edges of a pseudo-random k -uniform hypergraph into type l Hamilton cycles, for k/2 = l = k. For the case l = k these results show that almost all edges of corresponding random and pseudo-random hypergraphs can be packed with disjoint perfect matchings. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
