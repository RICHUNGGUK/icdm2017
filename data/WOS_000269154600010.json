We determine the secrecy capacity of this channel by proposing an achievable scheme and then developing a tight upper bound that meets the proposed achievable secrecy rate. We show that, for this channel, Gaussian signalling in the form of beam-forming is optimal, and no pre-processing of information is necessary.", "paper_title": "Towards the Secrecy Capacity of the Gaussian MIMO Wire-Tap Channel: The 2-2-1 Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000269154600010"}
