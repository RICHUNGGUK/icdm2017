The vehicle ad hoc wireless communications form an indispensable part of truly ubiquitous communications networking. VANET is formed by spontaneously moving autonomous vehicles with the self-organization and self-management capability. In this paper, we focus on the decentralized coordination of multiple unmanned vehicles such that they can freely move and adaptively cooperate in a complex environment. During this procedure, flocking is one of the key operations and requirements. Here, flocking refers to the formation and maintenance of a desired pattern by a group of mobile vehicles without collision during movement. We propose a resilient and scalable flocking scheme for a group of vehicles, which follows the leader-followers moving pattern. In the absence of obstacles, a collision avoidance algorithm is presented to maintain a desired distance among vehicles. This will ensure information completeness and is significant in certain mission critical situations without collision between a unmanned vehicle and its neighboring vehicles. In the presence of obstacles in an environment, this algorithm is able to avoid collision between a vehicle and its neighbor (either a neighboring vehicle or a neighboring obstacle). Theoretical proof has been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the algorithm to guarantee collision-free. In addition, with increasing number of vehicles, the performance of the proposed flocking scheme performs without increasing the processing overhead, which demonstrates the desirable scalability.", "paper_title": "A Resilient and Scalable Flocking Scheme in Autonomous Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274252200010"}
