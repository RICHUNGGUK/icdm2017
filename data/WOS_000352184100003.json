In this research, we built an experimental system to extract intelligence and security information from electronic documents. Our system, CAINES, is based on a knowledge engineering approach and relies on sublanguage analysis techniques. CAINES performs syntactic and semantic analysis and uses lexicons of various categories of terms. The system is able to extract certain types of information from reports on terrorist incidents posted by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), such as what happened and the results of the incidents.", "paper_title": "TERRORISM INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM ONLINE REPORTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000352184100003"}
