The paper introduces basic definitions and properties of this new theory. Continuous Archimedean logic is a t-norm and t-conorm logic system and Compensatory Fuzzy Logic can be obtained from quasi-arithmetic mean operators. We will prove the property that the preference over a pair of truth-value vectors is the same for certain predicates in the Compensatory Fuzzy Logic and the Continuous Archimedean Logic.", "paper_title": "Archimedean-Compensatory Fuzzy Logic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000366393000006"}
