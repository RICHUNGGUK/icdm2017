In the paper, the information audit system adopts the network processor to collect and analyze the date in the low level of network. Through taking an advanced research on current algorithm, some improvements of the Bayes categorization algorithm have been made as well as the proposal of a text categorization model of the minimal risk Bayes decision. In addition, it considers the risk probability of mistaking the related text for unrelated text during the text categorization. The experiments results show that it promotes the precision of text categorization.", "paper_title": "An information audit system based on Bayes algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100120"}
