We present heuristic algorithms based on the beam search technique. These algorithms include classic beam search procedures, as well as the filtered and recovering variants. Previous beam search implementations use fixed beam and filter widths. We consider the usual fixed width algorithms, and develop new versions that use variable beam and filter widths. The computational results show that the beam search versions with a variable width are marginally superior to their fixed value counterparts, even when a lower average number of beam and filter nodes is used. The best results are given by the recovering beam search algorithms. For large problems, however, these procedures require excessive computation times. The priority beam search algorithms are much faster, and can therefore be used for the largest instances.", "paper_title": "Beam search algorithms for the single machine total weighted tardiness scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setups", "paper_id": "WOS:000253025300017"}
