Our main result is a local limit theorem of Gaussian type for these statistics under the hypothesis that s is a power of a primitive series. This result is obtained by showing a general criterion for (Gaussian) local limit laws of sequences of integer random variables. To prove our result we also introduce and analyse a notion of symbol-periodicity for irreducible matrices, whose entries are polynomials over positive semirings; the properties we prove on this topic extend the classical Perron-Frobenius theory of non-negative real matrices. As a further application we obtain some asymptotic evaluations of the maximum coefficient of monomials of given size for rational series in two commutative variables.", "paper_title": "Local limit properties for pattern statistics and rational models", "paper_id": "WOS:000234426500012"}
