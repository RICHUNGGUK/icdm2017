Intrusion detection systems are usually classified into two main categories according to whether they are based on misuse (signature-based) detection or on anomaly detection. With the aim of minimizing the number of wrong decisions, a new Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to optimize the automatic rule generation of a signature-based intrusion detection system (IDS). This optimizer, included within a network IDS, has been evaluated using a benchmark dataset and real traffic of a Spanish university. The results obtained in this real application show the advantages of using this multi-objective approach.", "paper_title": "A Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for automatic rule generation in network intrusion detection systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000313969400006"}
