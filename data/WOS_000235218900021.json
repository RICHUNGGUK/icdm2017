The core algorithm is based on dynamic time warping techniques used in the speech recognition field. These techniques allow for non-linear (elastic) alignment of temporal sequences of feature vectors and consequently enable detection of similar shapes with different phases.", "paper_title": "Gene Time E(X)pression Warper: a tool for alignment, template matching and visualization of gene expression time series", "paper_id": "WOS:000235218900021"}
