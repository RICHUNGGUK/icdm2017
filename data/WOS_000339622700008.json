The software requires transform values at arbitrary points in the complex plane. We developed a software package, called ReLIADiff, which is a modification of Algorithm 662 using transform values at arbitrary points on real axis. ReLIADiff, implemented in C++, relies on TADIFF software package designed for Algorithmic Differentiation. In this article, we present ReLIADiff focusing on its design principles, performance, and use.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 946: ReLIADiff-A C plus plus Software Package for Real Laplace Transform Inversion based on Algorithmic Differentiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000339622700008"}
