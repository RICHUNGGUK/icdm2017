A morphological modification of the image is thus the projection of an equivalent operation on the object. Otherwise, due to perspective effects, a morphological operation on the image is not the projection of an equivalent operation on the objects to be analyzed. With catadioptric omnidirectional images, it is almost impossible to place the sensor such that a regular mesh on the scene projects a regular mesh on the image. Nevertheless, with proper calibration of a central catadioptric, system, the projection of a regular structuring element in a scene can be determined for each point on the image. The aim of this paper is to present new morphological operators that use this projective property. These operators make use of a structuring element of varying shape. Since this varying shape cannot be represented as a binary union of pixels, we propose to use a fuzzy extension of the classical gray-level morphology to account for this phenomenon. This fuzzy extension is performed via fuzzy integrals. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
