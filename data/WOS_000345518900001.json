Compared with previous works on the hysteresis phenomenon, the direction of the modified Bouc-Wen hysteresis model investigated in the literature is unknown. To reduce the computation burden in adaptation mechanism, an optimized adaptation method is successfully applied to the control design. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, two neural-network-based adaptive control algorithms are constructed to guarantee that all the system states and adaptive parameters remain bounded, and the tracking error converges to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin. In final, some numerical examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Neural Control for a Class of Nonlinear Time-Varying Delay Systems With Unknown Hysteresis", "paper_id": "WOS:000345518900001"}
