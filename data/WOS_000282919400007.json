In this paper, we explore to apply fuzzy sets theory to the utility 7117711119 problem and propose a novel method, namely FHUI (Fuzzy h Utility Itemsets)-Mine, for mining fuzzy high utility itemsets In addition to reflecting the fuzzy degree for quantity and profit regions of high utility itemsets, FHUI-Mine also provides a fuzzy threshold range that may include itemsets with profits slightly less than the designated threshold value To prove the feasibility of HMI-Aline, it was compared with the well-known Two-Phase algorithm through experimental evaluation The results show that FHUI-Mine delivers higher mining capability since it can not, only 1111,71,C all high utility itemsets found by Two-Phase algorithm but, also discover additional itemsets that are potentially high utility ones", "paper_title": "A NOVEL ALGORITHM FOR MINING FUZZY HIGH UTILITY ITEMSETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400007"}
