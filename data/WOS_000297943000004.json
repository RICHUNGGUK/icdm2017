However, most current approaches for composition languages and architectures for dynamic process integration do not provide the flexibility and dynamism required by interorganisational evolving environments. In this work, the DENEB platform for the development and execution of Web processes is presented. DENEB is based on the conversational approach and the Nets-within-Nets paradigm, allowing Web processes to acquire and execute new interaction protocols at run-time. This makes DENEB a well-adapted and flexible platform for dynamic service composition, interaction and integration, suitable for this kind of scenario. The scalability of the proposed solution is evaluated by means of the development of a set of experiments.
