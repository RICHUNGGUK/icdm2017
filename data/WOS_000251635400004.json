The finite strip method is used to present in-plane displacement and stress components, while the through-thickness components are obtained by using the method of state equation. The method can replace the traditional three-dimensional finite element solutions for structures that have regular geometric plans and simple boundary conditions, where a full three-dimensional finite element analysis is very often both extravagant and unnecessary. The new method provides results that show good agreement with available benchmark problems having different material compositions, thickness and boundary conditions. The new method provides a three-dimensional solution for laminated plates, while the advantages of using the traditional finite strip method are fully taken. This solution also yields a continuous transverse stress field across material interfaces that normally is not achievable by other numerical modelling of laminates, such as the traditional finite element method.
