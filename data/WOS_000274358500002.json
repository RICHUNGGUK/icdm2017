This paper describes an analytical design and planning simulator to assess the readiness of existing IP networks for the deployment of VoIP. The analytical simulator utilizes techniques used for network flows and queuing network analysis to compute two key performance bounds for VoIP: delay and bandwidth. The simulator is GUI-based and has an interface with drag-and-drop features to easily construct any generic network topology. The simulator has an engine that automates and implements the analytical techniques. The engine determines the number of VoIP calls that can be sustained by the constructed network while satisfying VoIP QoS requirements and leaving adequate capacity for future growth. As a case study, the paper illustrates how the simulator can be utilized to assess the readiness to deploy VoIP for a typical network of a small enterprise. We have made the analytical simulator publicly available in order to improve and ease the process of VoIP deployment.
