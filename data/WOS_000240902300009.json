In this paper, we present an analytical model for the blocking probability analysis on adaptive routing over the WDM networks with finite wavelength conversion capability. Modeling the finite nature of wavelength conversion has been a difficult task. We make use of the idea of segmented route to handle the finite wavelength conversion property. In this approach, a route is divided into a number of segments separated by wavelength converting nodes. We then combine the single-link model and the overflow model to derive the network-wide blocking probability. There are two distinct features in our technique. First, a concept of segmented route is used. Second, link state is considered when calculating the traffic flow. The latter ensures that the analytical results match closely to practical network status. Extensive simulations show that the analytical technique is effective in modeling the blocking probability performance for sparse networks.", "paper_title": "Blocking performance analysis on adaptive routing over WDM networks with finite wavelength conversion capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000240902300009"}
