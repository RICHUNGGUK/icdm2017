Whether it's improved reliability or sheer throughput potential, network devices will benefit from a multihomed framework. Unfortunately, our current means of guaranteeing reliability while maintaining quality control, specifically, the transmission control protocol (TCP), does not support multihoming. Despite the latter, a relatively young transport layer standard called the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP), incorporates multihoming into its design. In this paper, we investigate state-of-the-art multihoming techniques using SCTP. A comprehensive survey of developments has brought forth three main research areas, namely: handover management, concurrent multipath transfer (CMT), and cross-layer activities. While the presented algorithms may offer sufficient results, many open problems still remain.", "paper_title": "A Review of Multihoming Issues Using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000303890500019"}
