The procedural approach models a detailed 3D Chinese ting model efficiently. The movement of control-point with user guidance and interaction-clue provides a user-friendly GUI for intuitively constructing variant tings flexibly. Also, the summarized scale proportional relationships between parameters used in ting architecture makes the user's interaction simple yet powerful. The user studies and the experimental results show that nonprofessional users can intuitively construct a variant of complex, novel Chinese tings within minutes.", "paper_title": "Ting tools: interactive and procedural modeling of Chinese ting", "paper_id": "WOS:000326929200007"}
