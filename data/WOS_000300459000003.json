After preprocessing, the areas in the image are roughly clustered into nucleus, cytoplasm and the background by a spatial K-means clustering algorithm. After initial contours are extracted, the image is segmented using RGVF. RGVF involves a new edge map computation method and a stack-based refinement, and is thus robust to contaminations and can effectively locate the obscure boundaries. The boundaries can also be correctly traced even if there are interferences near the cytoplasm and nucleus regions. Experiments performed on the Herlev dataset, which contains 917 images show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
