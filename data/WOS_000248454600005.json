Separating the flows into two categories as one-way (packets in one direction only) and two-way (packets in both directions) flows can yield further insight. We have examined traces of Auckland traffic for 2000, 2003 and 2006, and analyzed their one-way and two-way flows. We observed several behaviors and the changes in flow sizes and their lifetimes over time. In our traces, we observe that one-way flows are mostly malicious, re-transmissions, and some are long-lived. Two-way flows are mostly normal end-to-end transmissions with their lifetimes/RTTs decreasing, their sizes increasing, and many short-lived flows mostly depict errors in TCP. Also, we observe similarity between one-way and two-way flow sizes for their lifetimes.", "paper_title": "Passive measurement of one-way and two-way flow lifetimes", "paper_id": "WOS:000248454600005"}
