It consists of a surface sampling step and a volume sampling step that both work in a unified optimization framework. First, high-quality isotropic samplings as well as a triangular mesh on the surface are generated. Then uniform volume samplings are determined by optimizing the point distribution inside the closed surface domain. Finally, the tetrahedral mesh is easily obtained by constrained Delaunay triangulation. Experimental results show that the new method can generate ideal tetrahedral meshes for closed implicit surfaces efficiently that are Delaunay based. Our method has the advantage of high efficiency and nice performance at surface boundaries.
