The membership functions of fuzzy sets are designed by distance transforms, and their levels are set in the fuzzy space for fast matching of a specific fiducial mark. After the fuzzification, a sub-pixel level translation is estimated by a fuzzy similarity measure and an interpolation using fuzzified model and target images. This paper also proposes a method of coarse-to-fine rotation estimation in sub-pixel level. Experiments show that the proposed fuzzy space pattern matching algorithm outperforms commercial pattern matching algorithms based on correlation or edge.", "paper_title": "Robust and accurate pattern matching in fuzzy space for fiducial mark alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000316361400001"}
