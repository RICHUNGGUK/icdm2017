In this paper, independent component analysis with reference method is proposed to extract the fault features using reference signals established based on the a priori knowledge of machine faults; experimental studies based on both simulated and actual fault signals of rotating machinery have been performed; and the results show that the proposed approach can effectively extract fault features under the situation of interferences and coexistence of multiple faults.", "paper_title": "Fault feature extraction using independent component analysis with reference and its application on fault diagnosis of rotating machinery", "paper_id": "WOS:000347408400016"}
