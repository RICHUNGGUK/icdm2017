The KH methodology draws its analogy from the herding behaviour of krill individuals in nature. The objective function for the krill movement is mostly influenced by the least distances of each krill individual from food and from highest density of the herd. The new algorithm is examined by solving three truss design optimisation problems and its performance is further compared with various classical and advanced algorithms.", "paper_title": "Krill herd algorithm for optimum design of truss structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000326677200002"}
