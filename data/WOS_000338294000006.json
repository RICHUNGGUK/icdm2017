We resolve a question of Pach and Tardos about the maximum conflict-free chromatic number an n-vertex graph can have. Our construction is randomized. In relation to this we study the evolution of the conflict-free chromatic number of the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n, p) and give the asymptotics for p = omega(1/n). We also show that for p >= 1/2 the conflict-free chromatic number differs from the domination number by at most 3.", "paper_title": "Conflict-Free Colouring of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000338294000006"}
