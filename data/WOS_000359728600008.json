Based on the theory of evidence, the model estimates a probability interval for an item represented by a set of features. This interval represents the item preference within a group of users and it is computed according to preferences expressed in the past. Additionally, a method for moving among different domains and fusing information is outlined. The issue of efficient search subsets of interest within the inclusion lattice is investigated and algorithms are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
