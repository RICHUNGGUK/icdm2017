Inductive logic programming (ILP) can be used to mine logical rules from these KBs, such as \"If two persons are married, then they (usually) live in the same city.\" While ILP is a mature field, mining logical rules from KBs is difficult, because KBs make an open-world assumption. This means that absent information cannot be taken as counterexamples. Our approach AMIE (Galarraga et al. in WWW, 2013) has shown how rules can be mined effectively from KBs even in the absence of counterexamples. In this paper, we show how this approach can be optimized to mine even larger KBs with more than 12M statements. Extensive experiments show how our new approach, AMIE, extends to areas of mining that were previously beyond reach.", "paper_title": "Fast rule mining in ontological knowledge bases with AMIE", "paper_id": "WOS:000365190400001"}
