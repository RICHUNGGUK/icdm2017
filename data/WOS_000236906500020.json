Data analysis frameworks such as the Toscana System use manually arranged concept lattices to avoid the problem of automatically producing high quality lattices. This limits Toscana systems to a finite number of concept lattices that have been prepared a priori. To extend the use of formal concept analysis, automated techniques are required that can produce high quality concept lattice drawings on demand. This paper proposes and evaluates an adaption of layer diagrams to improve automated lattice drawing.", "paper_title": "Automated layout of small lattices using layer diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000236906500020"}
