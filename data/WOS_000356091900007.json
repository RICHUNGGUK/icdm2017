Many current approaches to motion segmentation in monocular or stereo image sequences rely on sparse interest points or are dense but computationally demanding. We propose an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) framework for dense 3D segmentation of moving rigid parts in RGB-D video. Our approach segments images into pixel regions that undergo coherent 3D rigid-body motion. Our formulation treats background and foreground objects equally and poses no further assumptions on the motion of the camera or the objects than rigidness. While our EM-formulation is not restricted to a specific image representation, we supplement it with efficient image representation and registration for rapid segmentation of RGB-D video. In experiments, we demonstrate that our approach recovers segmentation and 3D motion at good precision.", "paper_title": "Efficient Dense Rigid-Body Motion Segmentation and Estimation in RGB-D Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000356091900007"}
