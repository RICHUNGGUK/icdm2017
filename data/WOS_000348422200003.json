The method intrinsically adapts to the structures of different size and shape in dMRI and hence avoids blurring typically observed in non-adaptive smoothing. We give examples for the usage of the toolbox and explain the determination of experiment-dependent parameters for an optimal performance of msPOAS.", "paper_title": "POAS4SPM: A Toolbox for SPM to Denoise Diffusion MRI Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000348422200003"}
