CF approaches generally fall into two categories: rating based and ranking based. The former makes recommendations based on historical rating scores of items and the latter based on their rankings. Ranking-based CF has demonstrated advantages in recommendation accuracy, being able to capture the preference similarity between users even if their rating scores differ significantly. In this study, we propose VSRank, a novel framework that seeks accuracy improvement of ranking-based CF through adaptation of the vector space model. In VSRank, we consider each user as a document and his or her pairwise relative preferences as terms. We then use a novel degree-specialty weighting scheme resembling TF-IDF to weight the terms. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the promise of our approach.", "paper_title": "VSRank: A Novel Framework for Ranking-Based Collaborative Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000344304000015"}
