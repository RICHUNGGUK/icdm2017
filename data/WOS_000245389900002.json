It is shown that the traditional deterministic conception can be easily extended by applying statistical and probabilistic concepts. The so-called Monte Carlo simulation procedure is the key for those developments, as it allows the straightforward use of the currently used deterministic analysis procedures. A numerical example exemplifies the methodology. It is concluded that uncertainty analysis may ensure robust predictions of variability, model verification, safety assessment, etc. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
