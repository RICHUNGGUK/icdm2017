Taking listed companies' three-year data before special treatment (ST) as sample data, adopting cross-validation and grid-search technique to find SVM model's good parameters, an empirical study is carried out. By comparing the experiment result of SVM with Fisher discriminant analysis, Logistic regression and back propagation neural networks (BP-NNs), it is concluded that financial distress early-warning model based on SVM obtains a better balance among fitting ability, generalization ability and model stability than the other models.", "paper_title": "An application of support vector machine to companies' financial distress prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000237084600027"}
