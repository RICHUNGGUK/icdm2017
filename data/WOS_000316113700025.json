The fuzzy model is generated automatically by on-line clustering method and fuzzy support vector machines. This fuzzy model is not updated, but its modeling error is compensated by a neural network. The neural network acts as the parameter identification model. The benefits of this new method are the structure is simple, and the physical meanings of each part of the model are clear. For the neural compensator, a new stable and fast training algorithm is proposed. Finally, this modeling method is successfully applied to model a magnetic tube recovery ratio in a metal company in China.", "paper_title": "On-line modeling via fuzzy support vector machines and neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316113700025"}
