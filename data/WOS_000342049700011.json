Given this, we examine how communication in the driving context influences social closeness, drawing from theories of computer-mediated communication, a context with notable similarities to the road. A survey study found that social closeness with others is associated with greater communication comfort and identity expression through the car, but less treatment of the car as a social entity. An interview study provides context and caveats for these generalizations. Together, these studies present implications for near-future social-mobility services relating to safety on the road.
