The predictions of 31 steroids benchmarks and 79 carbapenem derivatives using multiple linear regression analysis were carried out. The statistically significant QSAR models were obtained (steroids benchmarks: N=25, R(2)=0.894.; R(cv)(2)=0.785: carbapenem derivatives: n=64, R(2)=0.821, R(cv)(2)=0.765). Finally, classification of 32 stereoisomers of perindoprilate as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was carried out. All LDA models classified correctly 100% for active and inactive compounds. Our results showed 3D-Vpai models remarkably superior to others, and it provides a powerful alternative to other more common 3D-QSAR descriptors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
