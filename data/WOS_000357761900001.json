The VQA database, called MCL-V, contains 12 source video clips and 96 distorted video clips with subjective assessment scores. The source video clips are selected from a large pool of public-domain high-definition (HD) video sequences with representative and diversified contents. Both distortion types are perceptually adjusted to yield distinguishable distortion levels. An improved pairwise comparison method is adopted for subjective evaluation to save evaluation time. Several existing image and video quality assessment (IQA and VQA) algorithms are evaluated against the MCL-V database. The MCL-V database is publicly accessible in the link - http://mcLusc.edu/mcl-v-database/ to facilitate future video quality assessment research of the community. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
