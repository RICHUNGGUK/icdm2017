To provide decision support for FFP-related decisions, we formulate a conceptual model for FFP by following Simon's decision-making process model and map our model to the generic FFP process. The design, development, and empirical investigation of an intelligent FFP system for supporting FFP decisions by utilizing intelligent agents and Web-services technology are presented.
