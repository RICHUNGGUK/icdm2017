Two different approaches can be adopted to tackle service coordination: orchestration and choreography. In this paper, we introduce a formal methodology to handle coordination among services from the perspective of a global observer, in the spirit of choreography models. In particular, we address the problem of verifying compliance and consistency between the design of service interactions and the choreography constraints. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
