The lack of easy to use tools for predicting their structure may be in part responsible for the small number of reports of biologically relevant RNA/DNA hetero-dimers. Results: We present here an extension to the widely used (Lorenz et al., 2011) for the prediction of the structure of RNA/DNA hetero-dimers.", "paper_title": "Folding RNA/DNA hybrid duplexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000309687500021"}
