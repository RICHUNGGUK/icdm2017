We extracted hydrogen-bonding geometries from all available structures of minor groove-binder-DNA complexes of two noncovalent binding modes, namely 1:1 (including hairpin and cyclic ligands) and 2:1 ligand/DNA binding. Positions of the ligand atoms involved in hydrogen bonding deviate from idealized hydrogen bond geometries and do not exploit the possibilities indicated by water molecules. Therefore, we suggest the inclusion of shape-based descriptors rather than hydrogen-bond patterns in virtual screening protocols for the identification of innovative minor groove-binding scaffolds.", "paper_title": "Hydrogen-Bonding Patterns of Minor Groove-Binder-DNA Complexes Reveal Criteria for Discovery of New Scaffolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000265528400029"}
