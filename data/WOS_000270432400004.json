On realistic data, the break-even point for automatic correction so far could not be reached: the number of additional infelicitous corrections outnumbered the useful corrections. We present a new approach where we first compute a profile of the error channel for the given text. During the correction process, the profile (1) helps to restrict attention to a small set of \"suspicious\" lexical tokens of the input text where it is \"plausible\" to assume that the token represents a false friend. In this way, recognition of false friends is improved. Furthermore, the profile (2) helps to isolate the \"most promising\" correction suggestion for \"suspicious\" tokens. Using a conventional word trigram statistics for disambiguation we obtain a correction method that can be successfully applied to unrestricted text. In experiments for OCR documents, we show significant accuracy gains by fully automatic correction of false friends.", "paper_title": "Successfully detecting and correcting false friends using channel profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000270432400004"}
