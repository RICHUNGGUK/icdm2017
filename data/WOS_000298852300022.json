The concern is how to minimize the communication between individual streams and the root, while allowing the root, at any time, to report the global statistics of all streams within a given error bound. This paper presents communication-efficient algorithms for three classical statistics, namely, basic counting, frequent items and quantiles. The worst-case communication cost over a window is O(k/epsilon log epsilon N/k) bits for basic counting, O(k/epsilon log N/k) words for frequent items and O(k epsilon 2log N/k) words for quantiles, where k is the number of distributed data streams, N is the total number of items in the streams that arrive or expire in the window, and epsilon < 1 is the given error bound. The performance of our algorithms matches and nearly matches the corresponding lower bounds. We also show how to generalize these results to streams with out-of-order data.", "paper_title": "Continuous Monitoring of Distributed Data Streams over a Time-Based Sliding Window", "paper_id": "WOS:000298852300022"}
