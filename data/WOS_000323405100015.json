In the first algorithm, the routing decision is assisted by the number of occupied buffer slots at the corresponding input buffer of the next router and the congestion level of that router. Although this algorithm performs better than the conventional method, DyXY, in some cases the proposed algorithm leads to non-optimal decisions. Fuzzy controllers compensate for ambiguities in the data by giving a level of confidence rather than declaring the data simply true or false. To make a better routing decision, we propose an adaptive routing algorithm based on fuzzy logic for Networks-on-chip where the routing path is determined based on the current condition of the network. The proposed algorithm avoids congestion by distributing traffic over the routers that are less congested or have a spare capacity. The output of the fuzzy controller is the congestion level, so that at each router, the neighboring router with the lowest congestion value is chosen for routing a packet. To evaluate the proposed routing method, we use two multimedia applications and two synthetic traffic profiles. The experimental results show that the fuzzy-based routing scheme improves the performance over the DyXY routing algorithm by up to 25% with a negligible hardware overhead. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
