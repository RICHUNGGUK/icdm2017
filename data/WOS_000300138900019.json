Unlike the traditional image subtraction technique, we used the independent component analysis (ICA) to separate the coronary vessels and backgrounds. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the traditional subtraction technique and the segmentation method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
