However, the detection of fast air moving targets from high speed platform is challenged by the range walk of both the clutter and moving targets. It is well known that keystone formatting can be used to compensate for the range walk of multiple moving targets simultaneously without using the knowledge of the motion parameters. However, in the presence of serious Doppler ambiguity of fast air moving targets, distribution of the clutter will be affected by the keystone formatting matched to the ambiguity number of targets, and as a result the STAP performance will degrade. In this paper, a novel STAP method is proposed for the detection of fast air moving targets from high speed platform, which can deal with the range walk of both clutter and targets. Effectiveness of the new method is verified via simulation examples.", "paper_title": "A novel STAP method for the detection of fast air moving targets from high speed platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000304120300003"}
