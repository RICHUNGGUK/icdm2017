The existing face recognition algorithms relying on the texture information of face images are affected greatly by the variation of expression, scale and illumination. Whereas the algorithms based on the shape topology weaken the influence of illumination to some extent, but the impact of expression, scale and illumination on face recognition is still unsolved. To this end, we propose a new method for face recognition by integrating texture information with shape information, called biview face recognition algorithm. The texture models are constructed by using subspace learning methods and shape topologies are formed by building graphs for face images. The proposed biview face recognition method is compared with recognition algorithms merely based on texture or shape information. Experimental results of recognizing faces under the variation of illumination, expression and scale demonstrate that the performance of the proposed biview face recognition outperforms texture-based and shape-based algorithms.
