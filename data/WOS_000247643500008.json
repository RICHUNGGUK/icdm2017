Unfortunately, such transformations cannot adequately deal with the highly dynamic nature of today's multimedia applications. Therefore, we go one step back in the design process. Starting from a conceptual UML model, we first transform the model before refining it into executable code. This paper presents: various model transformations, an estimation technique for the steering cost parameters, and three case studies that show how our model transformations result in factors improvement in memory footprint and performance with respect to the initial implementation.
