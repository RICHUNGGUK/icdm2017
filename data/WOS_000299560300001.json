Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs) built with translinear elements offer a promising solution to this problem. These FPAAs can be built to use previously developed synthesis procedures for translinear circuits. Furthermore, large-scale translinear FPAAs can be built using floating-gate transistors as both the computational elements and the reconfigurable interconnect network. An FPAA built using Multiple Input Translinear Elements (MITEs) has been designed, fabricated in 0.35 mu m CMOS, and tested. These devices have been programmed to implement various circuits including multipliers, squaring circuits, RMS-to-DC converters, and filters. In addition, synthesis, place-and-route, and programming tools have been created in order to implement a reconfigurable system where the circuits implemented are described only by equations. The continued development of translinear FPAAs will lead to a reconfigurable analog system that allows for a large portion of the design to be abstracted away from the user.", "paper_title": "A MITE-Based Translinear FPAA", "paper_id": "WOS:000299560300001"}
