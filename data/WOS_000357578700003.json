Web applications need more strict requirements in order to sup-port higher availability. The techniques in quality assurance of these applications hence become essential, the role of testing for web application becomes more significant. Model-driven testing is a promising paradigm for the automation of software testing. In the web domain, the challenge however remains in the creation of models and the complexity of configuring, launching, and testing big number of valid configuration and testing cases. This paper proposes a solution towards this challenge with an approach using Domain Specific Language (DSL) for model driven testing of web application. Our techniques are based on building abstractions of web pages using domain specific language. We introduce WTML -a domain specific language for modeling web pages and provide automatic code generation with a web-testing framework. This methodology and techniques aim at helping software developers as well as testers to become more productive and reduce the time-to-market, while maintaining high standards of web application quality.", "paper_title": "Model Driven Testing of Web Applications Using Domain Specific Language", "paper_id": "WOS:000357578700003"}
