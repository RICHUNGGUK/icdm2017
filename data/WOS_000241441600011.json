Since a decision maker may face several scenarios when renting out rooms, we use a semi-absolute deviation model to measure the risk of hotel revenue, and only consider the risk of falling below the expected revenue. The method proposed in this paper can be changed to a linear programming model by applying linearization techniques. Some examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of this method.", "paper_title": "A stochastic approach to hotel revenue management considering multiple-day stays", "paper_id": "WOS:000241441600011"}
