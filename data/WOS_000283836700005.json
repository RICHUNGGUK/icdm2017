Therefore, the inclusion of an entry depends on the subjective decision of the lexicographer. As a consequence, those resources are usually incomplete. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised methodology to automatically discover pairs of semantically related words by highlighting their local environment and evaluating their semantic similarity in local and global semantic spaces. This proposal differs from all other research presented so far as it tries to take the best of two different methodologies, i.e. semantic space models and information extraction models. In particular, it can be applied to extract close semantic relations, it limits the search space to few, highly probable options and it is unsupervised.", "paper_title": "Automatic discovery of word semantic relations using paraphrase alignment and distributional lexical semantics analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000283836700005"}
