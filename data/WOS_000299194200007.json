Therefore, the realtime service of on-demand routing protocol is necessary. To reduce the end-to-end delay of the network, we have proposed two efficient routing protocols: Multipath Source Routing (MSR) and Redundant Source Routing (RSR) in previous work. And simulations have shown good performances for supporting realtime services. In this paper we propose a new on-demand routing protocol Redundant Multipath Source Routing (RMSR), which is an extension of MSR and RSR. We focus on the theoretical analysis of RMSR. We analyze the network capacity and the end-to-end queueing delay in RMSR by computing the number of active links in ad hoc networks. In comparison with Dynamic Source Routing, RMSR improves network delay from O(N) to O( log N), where N is the number of network nodes.", "paper_title": "An Analysis of Capacity and Delay for the Redundant Multipath Source Routing in Ad hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299194200007"}
