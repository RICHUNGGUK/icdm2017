In this paper we focus on the problem of classifying 16 types of meeting-room acoustic events. First of all, we have defined the events and gathered a sound database. Then, several classifiers based on support vector machines (SVM) are developed using confusion matrix based clustering schemes to deal with the multi-class problem. Also, several sets of acoustic features are defined and used in the classification tests. In the experiments, the developed SVM-based classifiers are compared with an already reported binary tree scheme and with their correlative Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifiers. The best results are obtained with a tree SVM-based classifier that may use a different feature set at each node. With it, 31.5% relative average error reduction is obtained with respect to the best result from a conventional binary tree scheme. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
