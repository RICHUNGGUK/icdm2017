A robust, low-overhead, and process-tolerant on-chip delay-sensing circuit is designed for this purpose. An algorithm is also developed to judiciously insert delay-sensor circuits at the internal nodes of logic blocks for improving delay-fault coverage with little or no impact on the critical-path delay. The proposed delay-fault testing approach is verified for transition- and segment-delay-fault models. Experimental results for external testing (BIST) show up to 31% (30%) improvement in fault coverage and up to 67.5% (85.5%) reduction in test length for transition faults. An increase in the number of robustly detectable critical-path segments of up to 54% and a reduction in test length for the segment-delay-fault model of up to 76% were also observed. The delay and area overhead due to insertion of the delay-sensing hardware have been limited to 2% and 4%, respectively.", "paper_title": "A novel delay fault testing methodology using low-overhead built-in delay sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000242604800028"}
