Functional brain imaging as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is commonly used to guide the clinician's diagnosis. However, conventional evaluation of these scans often relies on manual reorientation, visual reading and semi-quantitative analysis of certain regions of the brain. These steps are time consuming, subjective and prone to error. This paper shows a fully automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for improving the accuracy in the early diagnosis of the AD. The proposed approach is based on a first automatic feature selection, and secondly a combination of component-based support vector machine (SVM) classification and a pasting votes technique of assembling SVM classifiers.
