Computer-based numerical models are used as a means of simulating hydrologic processes and water quality within the basin and can be useful tools for organizing Basin data in a structured and readily accessible manner. These models can also be used to extend information derived from environmental sensors within existing monitoring networks to areas outside these systems based on similarity factors - since it would be cost prohibitive to collect data for every channel or pollutant source within the Basin. A common feature of all hydrologic and water quality models is the ability to perform mass balances. This paper describes the use of a number of state-of-the-art sensor technologies that have been deployed to obtain water and salinity mass balances for a 60,000 ha tract of seasonally managed wetlands in the San Joaquin River Basin of California. These sensor technologies are being combined with more traditional environmental monitoring techniques to support real-time salinity management (RTSM) in the River Basin. Two of these new technology applications: YSI-Econet (which supports continuous flow and salinity monitoring of surface water deliveries and seasonal wetland drainage); and electromagnetic salinity mapping (a remote sensing technology for mapping soil salinity in the surface soils) - have not previously been reported in the literature. Continuous sensor deployments that experience more widespread use include: weather station sensor arrays - used to estimate wetland pond evaporation and moist soil plant evapotranspiration; high resolution multi-spectral imagery - used to discriminate between and estimate the area of wetland moist soil plant vegetation: and groundwater level sensors - used primarily to estimate seepage losses beneath a wetland pond during flood-up. Important issues associated with quality assurance of continuous data are discussed and the application of a state-of-the-art software product AQUARIUS, which streamlines the process of data error correction and dissemination, is described as an essential element of ensuring successful RTSM implementation in the San Joaquin River Basin.
