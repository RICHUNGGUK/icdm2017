With two cores, each with 96 Processing Elements, this SIMD architecture provides a peak computation power of 96 GFLOPS while consuming only 9 Watts, making it an excellent candidate for embedded computing applications. Exploiting full features of this architecture, we have developed schemes for an efficient parallel implementation with minimum of overhead. For the sum of squared differences (SSD) algorithm and for VGA (640 x 480) images with disparity ranges of 16 and 32, we achieve a performance of 179 and 94 frames per second (fps), respectively. For the HDTV (1,280 x 720) images with disparity ranges of 16 and 32, we achieve a performance of 67 and 35 fps, respectively. We have also implemented more accurate, and hence more computationally expensive variants of the SSD, and for most cases, particularly for VGA images, we have achieved faster than real-time performance. Our results clearly demonstrate that, by developing careful parallelization schemes, the CSX architecture can provide excellent performance and flexibility for various embedded vision applications.", "paper_title": "Fast implementation of dense stereo vision algorithms on a highly parallel SIMD architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000327437200008"}
