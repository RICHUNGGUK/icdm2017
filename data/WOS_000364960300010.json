(TCC 2010). The construction given by them doubles the domain. To extend the domain by a factor of t > 2, recursively applying their extender requires using the cipher exponential times, i. e. O(t(log23)). In this paper, we describe an improved extender which extends the domain by a factor of t with O(t) calls to underlying small-block blockciphers. This extender is based on a (2t - 1)-round generalized Feistel structure, and is actually a generalization of the proposal of Coron et al. We show it to be indifferentiable from an ideal cipher with tn-bit blocks. Additionally, for expansion factor t we give an attack to show that indifferentiability cannot be achieved in (2t - 2)-round case. Compared with the recursively applying strategy, the time complexity of this extender is competitive in some practical applications.", "paper_title": "Improved domain extender for the ideal cipher", "paper_id": "WOS:000364960300010"}
