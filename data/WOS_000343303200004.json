Based on spatial fuzzy set and inference mechanism, 2-D T-S fuzzy FMII model with stochastic perturbation is established first. Then the results for stability analysis and bounded real lemma are obtained. Moreover, an H-infinity fuzzy controller is designed. In order to reduce the computational demand of the conditions for the existence of H-infinity fuzzy controller, the control inputs are regarded as the variables independent of the states, and some free matrices are introduced to reduce the conservatism of this method. Then, a new H-infinity fuzzy controller is derived. Two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "H-infinity control for 2-D T-S fuzzy FMII model with stochastic perturbation", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303200004"}
