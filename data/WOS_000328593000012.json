We propose a simulation model considering various types of container ships and cranes, flexible berth allocation and dynamic crane scheduling. We carry out simulation experiments in order to identify a parameter setting that can minimize the total investment cost while maintaining a required service level. The experiment results show that the proposed economic investment plan can reduce the cost compared with the current investment plan. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
