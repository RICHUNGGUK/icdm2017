The fault classifier is constructed by a SM SVDD algorithm to realize analog circuit fault diagnosis. Experimental results on two typical circuits confirm that the proposed method is effective in analog circuit fault diagnosis with good accuracy, and the performance surpasses other intelligent diagnosis methods, such as back propagation neural network, support vector machine and the normal SVDD. The developed method can be applied to other multi-classifier in electronic applications.", "paper_title": "Fault diagnosis of analog circuit based on a second map SVDD", "paper_id": "WOS:000363940900002"}
