The main categorical properties are established and a special class of operators, called Q-module transforms, is defined. Such operators-that turn out to be precisely the homomorphisms between free objects in those categories-find concrete applications in two different branches of image processing, namely fuzzy image compression and mathematical morphology.", "paper_title": "Quantale Modules and their Operators, with Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000280314500007"}
