These interdependent networks may exhibit some interesting and even surprising behaviors due to the interdependency and the interplay between the constituent systems. In this article we focus on two important phenomena, namely cascading failure in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and information cascade in coupled social networks. Specifically, cascading failures may occur in CPS that exhibit functional interdependency between two constituent systems (e.g. smart grid); information cascade may happen in multiple social networks that are coupled together by so-called multi-membership individuals. This article explores these two types of cascading effects in interdependent networks by reviewing existing studies in the literature. We review different models in the literature to study the two types of cascading effects in interdependent networks, and highlight the key findings from these studies.", "paper_title": "Cascading Effects in Interdependent Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345579100014"}
