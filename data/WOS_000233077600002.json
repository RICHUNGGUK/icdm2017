The proposed procedure can be applied to general balanced mixed linear models. Some practical examples are given to illustrate the proposed procedure. In addition, detailed simulation studies are conducted to evaluate its performance, showing that it can be recommended for use in practical applications. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
