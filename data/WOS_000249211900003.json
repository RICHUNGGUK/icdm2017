Although the pipeline of a modern graphics processing unit (GPU) permits high throughput and more concurrency, they bring more complexities in analyzing the performance of GPU-based applications. In this paper, we identify factors that determine performance of GPU-based applications. We then classify them into three categories: data-linear, data-constant and computation-dependent. According to the characteristics of these factors, we propose a performance model for each factor. These models are then used to predict the performance of bio-sequence database scanning application on GPUs. Theoretical analyses and measurements show that our models can achieve precise performance predictions.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of general-purpose computation on commodity graphics hardware: A case study using bioinformatics", "paper_id": "WOS:000249211900003"}
