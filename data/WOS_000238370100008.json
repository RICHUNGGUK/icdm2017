Many reasons are responsible for this status. Hence, the Internet is likely to be organized with both unicast and multicast enabled networks. Thus, it is of utmost importance to design protocols that allow the progressive deployment of the multicast service by supporting unicast clouds. This paper presents HBH (hop-by-hop multicast routing protocol). HBH adopts the source-specific channel abstraction to simplify address allocation and implements data distribution using recursive unicast trees, which allow the transparent support of uni-cast-only routers. An important original feature of HBH is its tree construction algorithm that takes into account the unicast routing asymmetries. Since most multicast routing protocols rely on the unicast infrastructure, the unicast asymmetries impact the structure of the multicast trees. We show through simulation that HBH outperforms other multicast routing protocols in terms of the delay experienced by the receivers and the bandwidth consumption of the multicast trees. Additionally, we show that HBH can be incrementally deployed and that with a small fraction of HBH-enabled routers in the network HBH outperforms application-layer multicast.", "paper_title": "Incremental service deployment using the hop-by-hop multicast routing protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000238370100008"}
