The Burkholderia Genome Database represents a model for such a database, providing a powerful, user-friendly search and comparative analysis interface that contains features not found in other genome databases. It contains continually updated, curated and tracked information about Burkholderia cepacia complex genome annotations, plus other Burkholderia species genomes for comparison, providing a high-quality resource for its targeted cystic fibrosis research community.
