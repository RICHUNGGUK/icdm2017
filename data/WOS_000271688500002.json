A two-step approximation scheme is presented here. In the first step, a constant bias is extracted from the approximated function, while in the second, the function with extracted bias is approximated in a usual way. Later, these two components arc added together. First of all Arc prove that. a constant bias extracted from the function decreases the error. We demonstrate how to calculate that bias. Secondly. in a minor contribution, we show how to choose basis from a selected set of orthonormal functions to achieve minimum error. Finally we prove that loss of orthonormality due to truncation of the argument ran-c of the basis functions does not effect the. overall error of approximation and the expansion coefficients, Correctness. we show how this feature call be used. Our attention is focused oil Hermite orthonormal functions. Ail application of the obtained results to ECG data compression is presented.", "paper_title": "SOME ENHANCEMENTS TO APPROXIMATION OF ONE-VARIABLE FUNCTIONS BY ORTHONORMAL BASIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271688500002"}
