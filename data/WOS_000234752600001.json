Due to limited optical buffering in optical switches and constraints of high switching speeds, data transmitted over optical networks must be routed without waiting queues along a path from source to destination. Moreover, in optical networks deprived of wavelength converters, it is necessary for each established path to transfer data from source to destination by using only one wavelength. To solve this NP-hard problem, many algorithms have been proposed for dynamic optical routing like Fixed-Paths Least Congested (FPLC) routing or Least Loaded Path Routing (LLR). This paper proposes two heuristic algorithms based on former algorithms to improve network throughput and reduce blocking probabilities of data transmitted in all-optical networks with regard to connection costs. We also introduce new criteria to estimate network congestion and choose better routing paths. Experimental results in ring networks show that both new algorithms achieve promising performance.", "paper_title": "Link-state-based algorithms for dynamic routing in all-optical networks with ring topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000234752600001"}
