Many studies have been performed to develop an effective tool to identify market power based on indices. Most often it is rather difficult to use an index-based method for real-time analysis. This paper provides a method to identify market power that can be used in real time. The purpose is to analyze price-dispatch sensitivity to determine whether there is a generator or a subset of generators that have the ability to increase its own price profitably. Case studies performed on a modified IEEE 118-bus system are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
