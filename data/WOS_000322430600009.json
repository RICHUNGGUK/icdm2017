The method is specially designed to address the specific properties of contrast-enhanced MRI time-series. Firstly, a segmentation method is proposed to extract the brain tissue mask which is used in MI computing to avoid the adverse effects of surrounding deformed tissues. Secondly, a two-stage registration framework is proposed, where the images are first aligned using deformable registration and then finally matched by rigid registration. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the registration method qualitatively and quantitatively. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a high degree of accuracy and reliability, and is adequate to the task of three-dimensional registration of rat brain MRI time-series.
