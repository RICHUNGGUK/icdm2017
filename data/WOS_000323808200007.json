The approach is based on the interval arithmetic. Comparisons with previous methods are discussed. The new linear model is theoretically analyzed and the regression parameters are estimated. Some properties of the regression estimators are investigated. Finally, the performance of the procedure is illustrated using both a real-life application and simulation studies.
