Two different constant temperatures of 0 degrees C and 38 degrees C and a temperature gradient of 4 degrees C along the column were modeled. Changing the temperature from 0 degrees C to 38 degrees C did not have a significant effect on the suction head distribution in the soil-geotextile column. The temperature gradient resulted in appreciable thermal vapor flow and changes in suction head and hydraulic conductivity of the geotextile. During drainage, the temperature gradient and lower temperature at the top of the column increased suction in the geotextile and its ability to function as a capillary barrier. During capillary rise, the temperature gradient and lower temperature at the top of the column decreased the suction in the geotextile and its ability to function as a capillary barrier. Changing the direction of the thermal gradient reversed the water vapor flow direction and its effect on the suction in the geotextile. A temperature gradient did not have a noticeable effect on the suction head of the geotextile when positive pore pressure was developed in the geotextile and adjacent soil during drainage.
