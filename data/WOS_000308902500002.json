This flexibility creates opportunities for individuals to use systems in unanticipated ways to better fit particular tasks. Yet such unanticipated usage is counter to the use of IS as vehicles for managerial control and ensuring consistency in transaction processing across organizations. To effectively manage this tension a structured appreciation of post-adoption IS usage in its social context is required. Through a case study of users in a large Australian accommodation chain we develop a taxonomy of system usage, exploring unanticipated usage to meet workplace demands, its underlying motivations, implications for transaction processing consistency and ultimately operational and/or managerial decision making.", "paper_title": "Acceptance of Post-Adoption Unanticipated IS Usage: Towards a Taxonomy", "paper_id": "WOS:000308902500002"}
