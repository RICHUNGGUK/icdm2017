Many available methods on market research for designing new products are more focused on the analysis process, so that product designers run short of ideas discovery. In this paper, we present a novel innovation support system (ISS) based on chance discovery with data crystallization to assist human innovation in designing new products, especially creative products. The ISS is a human-centric system to enable value cognition and follows the following process: (1) visualized scenario graph generation, (2) human value cognition, (3) value co-creation based on shared knowledge, and (4) emerging chances evaluation. The result of a case study validates the effectiveness of ISS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
