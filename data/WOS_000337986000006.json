In this work, the DPG method is extrapolated to nonlinear systems, and applied to several problems in fluid dynamics whose solutions exhibit boundary layers or singularities in stresses. In particular, the effectiveness of DPG as a numerical method for compressible flow is assessed with the application of DPG to two model problems over a range of Mach numbers and laminar Reynolds numbers using automatic adaptivity with higher order finite elements, beginning with highly under-resolved coarse initial meshes.
