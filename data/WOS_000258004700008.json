This claimed connection is not, however, explained in depth in the author's available scientific literature. This article clarifies the methodological and theoretical backgrounds to winMAX, with special focus on the influence of Weber and Schutz. It became clear that-in spite of similarities-Weber and Schutz differ in several respects, which raises objections to the claimed connection and puts practical application to the test. More in-depth information is therefore needed to apply Kuckartz's case-oriented quantification approach in social research with respect to its theoretical background.", "paper_title": "Max Weber and Alfred Schutz - The theoretical and methodological background of the case-oriented quantification approach behind winMAX", "paper_id": "WOS:000258004700008"}
