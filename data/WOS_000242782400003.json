The system is implemented by reproducing kernel particle method. Aspects of a coarse grain parallel paradigm-domain decompose method-are detailed for a Lagrangian formulation using model partitioning. Integration cells are uniquely assigned on each process element and particles are overlap in boundary zones. Partitioning scheme multilevel recursive spectrum bisection approach is applied. The parallel contact search algorithm is also presented. Explicit message passing interface statements are used for all communication among partitions on different processors. The parallel 3D system is developed and implemented into 3D bulk metal forming problems, and the simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the developed parallel reproducing kernel particle method system.
