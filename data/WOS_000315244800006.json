The proposed differential flip-flop in SAR logic and high efficiency wide range delay element extend the flexibility of speed and resolution tradeoff. The ADC fabricated in 40 nm CMOS process covers 4-10 bit resolution and 0.4-1 V power supply range. The ADC achieved 49.8 dB SNDR and the peak FoM of 3.4 fJ/conv. with 160 kS/sec at 0.4 V single power supply voltage. At 10 bit mode and 1 V operation, up to 10 MS/s, the FoM is below 10 fJ/conv. while keeping ENOB of 8.7 bit.", "paper_title": "A 4-10 bit, 0.4-1 V Power Supply, Power Scalable Asynchronous SAR-ADC in 40 nm-CMOS with Wide Supply Voltage Range SAR Controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000315244800006"}
