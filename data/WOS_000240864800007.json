Incorporating four steps that include a pumping model, a simplified consolidation evaluation, a pile-soil interaction model and a semi-theoretical pile settlement prediction, this paper presents a procedure to estimate the drawdown, the soil consolidation settlement, the negative friction on the pile shaft and the additional pile settlement, induced by dewatering in phreatic zones. Numerical calculations for a simplified situation of dewatering operation illustrate the proposed procedure in estimating the mechanical effects of dewatering on nearby piles. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
