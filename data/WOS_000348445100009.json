In the background of this paper we point out four main enabling factors. We envisage advanced SF solutions would be able to help us with a better life style and our industries with a brighter productivity: (1) SF is a well-known and socially accepted hybrid device built on decades of maturity and of successful progress of mobile and wireless technologies, (2) SF stands upon the advancing pillar of our natural nomadic life style enhanced with superb connectivity, (3) ever growing personal and health needs are due to change in our social and healthcare systems and require SF's safety and security features, and finally (4) the computing intelligence is there to be discovered and used for the most needed basic human requirements so that with it we expect to see a variety of integrated intelligence in the form of distributed and multi-agent style using software intensive, lightweight, and agile applications. We also enhance our message by exemplifying few but informative typical application cases for researchers and developers to help to harness this unique technological development opportunity.", "paper_title": "Smartphone intelligent applications: a brief review", "paper_id": "WOS:000348445100009"}
