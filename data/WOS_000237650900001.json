This model predicts a future grid resource demand of grid users and suggests a reasonable transaction price of each resource to customers and resource providers. The suggestion of transaction price infers the more transactions between customers and providers and reduces a response time after ordering resource. In order to improve accuracy of transaction price prediction, microeconomics-based statistics approach is applied to this grid resource transaction model. For performance evaluation, this paper measures resource demand response time, and number of transactions. This model works on the less 72.39% of response time and the more 162.56% of the number of transactions than those of single auction model and double auction model.", "paper_title": "Resource demand prediction-based grid resource transaction network model in grid computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900001"}
