Design/methodology/approach - Based on organizational cybernetics concepts, an heuristic is used by the top management of a public university for designing the strategy and actions related to urban planning issues. Findings - The paper outlines the process that helped the university's new top management to diagnose the. situation at the beginning of its mandate and to design pertinent actions This process starts by clarifying the university identity, purpose and boundaries and is followed by identifying the required structural levels. For each of them the key factors to be considered and actions to be taken are stated. The use of a Recursion Levels-Key Factors Matrix helped to maintain a coherent and holistic view of the intervention. Practical implications - This kind of framework can guide leaders of public and private organizations to apply cybernetic concepts to improve their strategic policies' design and actions. Originality/value - The application of organizational cybernetics and the viable system model to urban planning-related activities in universities is highly original. The framework here presented, together with the example of its application, can serve as a guide to leaders of other universities as well as other public or private organizations when coping with the complexity they have to face.", "paper_title": "Design and diagnosis for viable organizations in practice: university urban planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000306446600002"}
