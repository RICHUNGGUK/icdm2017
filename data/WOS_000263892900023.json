A more appropriate model is presented for fluid material between viscous and elastic to introduce the fractional calculus approach in to the constitutive relationship. This paper employs the fractional calculus approach to study second grade fluid flows. In order to avoid lengthy calculations of residues and contour integrals, the discrete inverse Laplace transform method has been used. Similar solutions for second grade fluid appear as the limiting cases of our solutions. The influence of ppertinent parameters on the flows is delineated and appropriate conclusions are drawn.
