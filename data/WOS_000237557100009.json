First, we introduce two novel similarity measures for comparing trajectories in far-field visual surveillance. The measures simultaneously compare the spatial distribution of trajectories and other attributes, such as velocity and object size, along the trajectories. They also provide a comparison confidence measure which indicates how well the measured image-based similarity approximates true physical similarity. We also introduce novel clustering algorithms which use both similarity and comparison confidence. Based on the proposed similarity measures and clustering methods, a framework to learn semantic scene models by trajectory analysis is developed. Trajectories are first clustered into vehicles and pedestrians, and then further grouped based on spatial and velocity distributions. Different trajectory clusters represent different activities. The geometric and statistical models of structures in the scene, such as roads, walk paths, sources and sinks, are automatically learned from the trajectory clusters. Abnormal activities are detected using the semantic scene models. system is robust to low-level tracking errors.", "paper_title": "Learning semantic scene models by trajectory analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000237557100009"}
