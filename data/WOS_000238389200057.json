To estimate the laser energy absorption through electron heating, we derive a power transfer rate equation and an electron number density equation for a steady state as a function of temperature and electric field. Numerical simulations using the derived equations show that the laser power absorption dependence of glass on temperature and electric field strength.", "paper_title": "Physical modeling of laser-induced breakdown of glass", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200057"}
