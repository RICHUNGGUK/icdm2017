This paper proposes an adaptive push system for data broadcasting in underwater acoustic wireless networks with locality of client demands. The proposed system exploits the characteristic relationship between the bandwidth of an underwater acoustic link and the transmitter-receiver distance in order to improve performance in environments with locality of client demands. Simulation results show superior performance of the proposed approach in the underwater environment compared to existing systems.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of acoustic underwater data broadcasting exploiting the bandwidth-distance relationship", "paper_id": "WOS:000297535200001"}
