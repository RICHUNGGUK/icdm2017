The new model is based on a three-energy-level and three-speed lattice Boltzmann equation by using a method of higher moments of the equilibrium distribution functions. As the 25-bit model, we obtained the equilibrium distribution functions and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with the second accuracy of the truncation errors. The numerical examples show that the model can be used to simulate the shock waves, contact discontinuities and supersonic flows around circular cylinder. The numerical results are compared with those obtained by traditional method.
