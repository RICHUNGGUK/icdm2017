This solves a problem posed by Calabi et al. (Int. J. Comput. Vis. 26:107-135, 1998). Based on the proof of this result, we then develop some cautionary examples concerning the application of signature curves for object recognition and symmetry detection as proposed by Calabi et al.", "paper_title": "Invariant Signatures of Closed Planar Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000267340900005"}
