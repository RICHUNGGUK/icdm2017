The goal of one player is to maximize the probability of reaching the target set so that the constraint is satisfied, while the other player aims at the opposite. We show that the winner in such games can be determined in P for the '> 0' constraint, and in NP boolean AND co-NP for the '=1' constraint. Further, we prove that the winning regions for both players are regular, and we design algorithms which compute the associated finite-state automata. Finally, we show that winning strategies can be synthesized effectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
