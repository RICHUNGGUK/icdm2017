But very little discussion has transpired regarding the meaning of proofs conducted in this model or regarding the model's validity. In this paper, we briefly discuss the implications of proofs done in the ideal-cipher model, then show some limitations of the model analogous to recent work regarding the Random-Oracle Model [2]. In particular, we extend work by Canetti, Coldreich and Halevi [5], and a recent simplification by Maurer, Renner, and Holenstein [15], to exhibit a blockcipher-based hash function that is provably-secure in the ideal-cipher model but trivially insecure when instantiated by any blockcipher.", "paper_title": "The Ideal-Cipher Model, revisited: An uninstantiable blockcipher-based hash function", "paper_id": "WOS:000239471600021"}
