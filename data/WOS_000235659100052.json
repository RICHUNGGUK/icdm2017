Therefore, cryptography methods are being used to protect the information in wireless sensor network even though cryptography methods consume the large amount of additional energy. One of the final goals in the wireless sensor network is to maximize the life time of sensor node because sensor nodes have very limited power, Therefore, this paper proposes the energy efficient security method which uses relative coordinate instead of physical coordinate to reduce the energy consumption. Location information description with relative coordinate makes the caught data meaningless and can protect the data without using cryptography methods.", "paper_title": "Low energy consumption security method for protecting information of wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100052"}
