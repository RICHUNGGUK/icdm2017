We motivate the model with respect to existing approaches, among others, conditional random fields (CRFs), maximum margin Markov networks ((MN)-N-3), and structured support vector machines (SVMstruct), which embody only a subset of its properties. We present an inference procedure based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The framework can be instantiated for a wide range of structured objects such as linear chains, trees, grids, and other general graphs. As a proof of concept, the model is benchmarked on several natural language processing tasks and a video gesture segmentation task involving a linear chain structure. We show prediction accuracies for GPstruct which are comparable to or exceeding those of CRFs and SVMstruct.", "paper_title": "GPstruct: Bayesian Structured Prediction Using Gaussian Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000355931100016"}
