Performance is examined for varying cluster counts and under loads of varying network locality. In today's technology, similar performance is attained at high network communication locality loads (>2/3), and a 19% latency reduction is obtained at the highest locality loads (>95%) for current optical switching technology. For projected future technology, the clustered system is shown to yield up to a 55% reduction in latency for applications with 2/3 or better locality.
