Typical solutions in the Lagrangian reference frame contain heating errors which arise during the simulation of a shock reflection originating at a wall. The paper shows that the inherent properties of MPDATA can be exploited in the remapping to reduce wall heating errors. The resulting increase in accuracy and symmetry of solutions is demonstrated.
