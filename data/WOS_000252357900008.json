Optical networks offer very high bit rates and, by employing technologies like internet protocol over wavelength division multiplexing (IP-over-WDM), these high bit rates can be effectively utilized. However, failure of a network component, carrying such high speed data traffic can result in enormous loss of data in a few seconds and persistence of a failure can severely degrade the performance of the entire network. Designing IP-over-WDM networks, which can withstand failures, has been subject of considerable interest in the research community recently. Most of the research is focused on the failure of optical links in the network. This paper addresses the problem of designing IP-over-WDM networks that do not suffer service degradation in case of a single link failure. The paper proposes an approach based on the framework provided by a recent paper by M. Kurant and P. Thiran. The proposed approach can be used to design large survivable IP-over-WDM networks.", "paper_title": "Lightpaths routing for single link failure survivability in IP-over-WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252357900008"}
