A generalised concept of superstability, applied to complex matrices, and extended superstability, is introduced in order to obtain a new result for guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of a switched system under arbitrary switching. The relation between extended superstable and stable simultaneously triangularizable sets of matrices is also discussed. It is shown that stable triangularizable matrices are a proper subset of extended superstable ones, pointing out that the presented stability result is a generalisation of the previous well-known stability theorems to a broader class of switched dynamical systems.", "paper_title": "Superstability of linear switched systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340192900016"}
