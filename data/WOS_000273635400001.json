We sought to demonstrate empirically the causal relationship between the organization's preparedness and the emergence of implementation problems. We examined four case Studies to extract insight into the criticality of certain factors and the type of problems created when no moderating measures were taken by project managers. Consequently, we developed a predictor-outcome model mapping a lack of preparedness with implementation problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
