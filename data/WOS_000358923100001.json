Most state-of-the-art approaches adopted the well-known bag-of-features representations, generated based on isolated local patches or patch trajectories, where motion patterns, such as object-object and object-background relationships are mostly discarded. In this paper, we propose a simple representation aiming at modeling these motion relationships. We adopt global and local reference points to explicitly characterize motion information, so that the final representation is more robust to camera movements, which widely exist in unconstrained videos. Our approach operates on the top of visual codewords generated on dense local patch trajectories, and therefore, does not require foreground-background separation, which is normally a critical and difficult step in modeling object relationships. Through an extensive set of experimental evaluations, we show that the proposed representation produces a very competitive performance on several challenging benchmark data sets. Further combining it with the standard bag-of-features or Fisher vector representations can lead to substantial improvements.", "paper_title": "Human Action Recognition in Unconstrained Videos by Explicit Motion Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000358923100001"}
