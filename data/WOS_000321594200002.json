The objective of the design optimisation is to minimise the standard deviation of the weighted structural compliance. The gradient-based method is applied to perform a sensitivity analysis for the identification of optimal design variables. A material replacement method is used to overcome difficulty in the sensitivity analysis due to the stress-dependent behaviour of the original bi-modulus material. In the material replacement operation, two new isotropic materials are identified to replace the original bi-modulus material according to its two moduli. To reduce the side effects of the material replacement operation on the final design, the local stiffness is modified in terms of the stress state. Typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to the final design, including the load uncertainty on the optimal bi-modulus layout, as well as other factors, such as loading direction and the ratio between the two moduli of the bi-modulus material. The comparison between layouts of isotropic and hi-modulus materials also shows that the final bi-modulus material distribution is sensitive to loading directions in practical designs.
