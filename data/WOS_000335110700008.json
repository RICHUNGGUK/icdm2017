But the emergence of fake fingerprints brings on a new challenge. Among the numerous fingerprint vitality detection methods, local binary pattern (LBP) is considered as one of the best operators. But the original LBP operator has the limitation of its small spatial support area. So we proposed a novel spoof fingerprint detection method based on multi-scale local binary pattern (MSLBP). Generally speaking, the MSLBP can be realized in two different ways. We implemented both types of MSLBP. Each MSLBP was combined with a set of filters. In this way, each sample in the LBP circle could be made to collect intensity information from a large area rather than a single pixel. The experimental results in the database of the Liveness Detection Competition 2011 (LivDet2011) have shown that both types of MSLBP are effective and superior in spoof fingerprint detection.
