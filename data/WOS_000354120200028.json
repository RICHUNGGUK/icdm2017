In the non-conducting region a scalar magnetic potential is introduced. The method can deal automatically with any topological configuration of the conducting region and, being based on the search of a scalar magnetic potential in the non-conducting region, has the advantage of making use of a reduced number of unknowns. Several numerical tests are presented for illustrating the performance of the proposed method; inparticular, the numerical simulation of a new type of transformer of complicated topological shape is shown.
