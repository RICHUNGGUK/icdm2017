Firstly, we initialize weights based on metric learning with pairwise constraints, then simultaneously learn two kinds of knowledge by combining the distance-based and the constraint-based approaches, finally evaluate and select clustering result based on the degree of users' satisfaction. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Integrating Instance-level and Attribute-level Knowledge into Document Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000295127500007"}
