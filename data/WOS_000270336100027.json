Some new delay-dependent stochastic stability criteria are derived based on a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) approach. These new criteria based on the delay partitioning idea prove to be less conservative, since the conservatism could be notably reduced by thinning the delay partitioning. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
