The motivation for designing this model is twofold. First, experiments that are to provide insight into chemical problems should be expressed in a syntax that remains as close as possible to real chemistry. Second, the study of physical properties of the complex chemical reaction networks requires growing models that incorporate features realistic from a biochemical perspective. In this article the theory and algorithms underlying the coevolutionary model are explained, and two illustrative examples are provided. These examples show that one needs to be careful in making general claims concerning the structure of chemical reaction networks.", "paper_title": "A Synthon Approach to Artificial Chemistry", "paper_id": "WOS:000262417700007"}
