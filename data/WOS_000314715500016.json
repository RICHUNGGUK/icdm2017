Based on the observation that dance motions used in similar musical pieces can be a good reference in choreographing a new dance, we first construct a music-motion database that comprises a number of segment-wise music-motion pairs. When a new musical input is given, it is divided into short segments and for each segment our system suggests the dance motion candidates by finding from the database the music cluster that is most similar to the input. After a user selects the best motion segment, we perform music-dance synchronization by means of cross-correlation between the two music segments using the novelty functions as an input. We evaluate our system's performance using a user study, and the results show that the dance motion sequence generated by our system achieves significantly higher ratings than the one generated randomly.", "paper_title": "Music similarity-based approach to generating dance motion sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000314715500016"}
