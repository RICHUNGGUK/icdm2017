Among them, SVM is the most representative method that models and forecasts financial time series. However, SVM cannot reflect on the dynamic characteristic of financial time series effectively due to its superior generalization performance. And we cannot guarantee that the parameters of SVM have the optimum values, since they are locally searched owing to the limited time bound. These vulnerabilities are the main factors that degenerates the forecasting performance of SVM. On the other hand, continuous HMM can effectively capture the irregular and dynamic movement of financial time series with a non-stationary property, since it models a financial time series stochastically, rather than deterministically. Therefore, this paper suggests a new method that constructs the trend forecasting model of financial time series. It firstly detects PIPs indicating the significant turnabout of trend in each financial time series. And then the detected PIPs are used to construtct its trend forecasting model based on continuous HMM. In the experiment with various financial time series datasets we demonstrate its superiority.", "paper_title": "Trend forecasting of financial time series using PIPs detection and continuous HMM", "paper_id": "WOS:000294432100009"}
