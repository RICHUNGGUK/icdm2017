Continuing this development, a new five DOF prostate biopsy manipulator has been designed for use inside a closed 1.5T MRI scanner. Space constraints in the bore and the current trend to restrict field strength exposure for operators indicate that a master-slave configuration is ideal for controlling the robotic system from outside the bore. This system has been designed to work with piezoceramic motors and optical encoders placed inside or near the field of view of the scanner, using real time image guidance for targeting biopsies to specific lesions in the prostate. MRI tests have been performed to prove the feasibility of this concept and a one DOF proof-of-concept test rig implementing closed loop position control has been tested and is presented here. A first prototype of the slave manipulator has been designed and manufactured incorporating this new technology.", "paper_title": "The feasibility of MR-image guided prostate biopsy using piezoceramic motors inside or near to the magnet isocentre", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300064"}
