Our approach can be useful in two scenarios: 1. A multiuser virtual world with mobile clients with sufficient CPU and GPU power but with limited network speed. This reflects current mobile phones, tablets and laptops in areas without a high-speed mobile connection or Wi-Fi connectivity. 2. Virtual world on-demand generation in a cloud environment that would be useful for scalable massive multiplayer games. If multiple independent generators create areas that are over-lapping, our method ensures that the intersection of the areas will contain the same geometry for all of them. For this reason, we call our method stateless generation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
