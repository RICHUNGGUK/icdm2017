The search operation consists of computing the Viterbi score for each sequence in the database with respect to a given query PHMM. Because of the rapid growth of biological sequence databases, finding fast solutions is of highest importance to research in this area. Unfortunately, the required scan times of currently available sequential software implementations are very high. In this paper we show how reconfigurable hardware can be used as a computational platform to accelerate this application by two orders of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Accelerating the Viterbi algorithm for Profile Hidden Markov Models using reconfigurable hardware", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200067"}
