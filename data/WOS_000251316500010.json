Hardwiring such automata raises surface area and clock frequency constraints, requiring efficient epsilon-transitions-removal techniques. In this paper, we present bounds on the number of new transitions for the development of acyclic WFA, which is a special case of the epsilon-transitions-removal problem. We introduce a new problem, a partial removal of epsilon-transitions while accepting short chains of epsilon-transitions.", "paper_title": "Path-equivalent developments in acyclic weighted automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316500010"}
