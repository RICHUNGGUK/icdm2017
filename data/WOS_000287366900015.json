In this paper, we propose some new quantum and reversible compressors using our new genetic algorithm-based simulator, analyzer, and synthesizer software. The proposed quantum 4:2 and 6:2 compressor circuits are compared with the existing counterparts in terms of number of constant inputs, number of garbage outputs, delay and the quantum cost (QC). We have also designed quantum 7:2 compressor for the first time. The proposed quantum compressors are optimized in terms of QC and delay. The proposed designs can be used as a basic block in complex systems like multipliers, and can execute complicated operations better than the existing designs in literature.", "paper_title": "NOVEL QUANTUM COMPRESSOR DESIGNS USING NEW GENETIC ALGORITHM-BASED SIMULATOR, ANALYZER AND SYNTHESIZER SOFTWARE IN NANOTECHNOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000287366900015"}
