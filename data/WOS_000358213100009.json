Though, several experimental investigations have shown that evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are efficient for this NP-complete problem, there is little theoretical work about EAs on the problem. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the performance of EAs on the MAX-CUT problem. We find that both the (1+1) EA and the (1+1) EA*, two simple EAs, efficiently achieve approximation solutions of (m/2) + (1/4) s(G) and (m/2) + (1/2)(root 8m + 1 - 1), where m and s(G) are respectively the number of edges and the number of odd degree vertices in the input graph. We also reveal that for a given integer k the (1+ 1) EA* finds a cut of size at least k in expected runtime O(nm + 1/delta(4k)) and a cut of size at least (m/2) + k in expected runtime O(n(2)m + 1/delta((64/3)k2)), where delta is a constant mutation probability and n is the number of vertices in the input graph. Finally, we show that the (1+ 1) EA and the (1+ 1) EA* are better than some local search algorithms in one instance, and we also show that these two simple EAs may not be efficient in another instance.", "paper_title": "Approximation and Parameterized Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms for the Maximum Cut Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000358213100009"}
