Although WSNs have become more and more prospective in human life with the development of hardware and communication technologies, there are some natural limitations of WSNs (e.g., network connectivity, network lifetime) due to the static network style in WSNs. Moreover, more and more application scenarios require the sensors in WSNs to be mobile rather than static so as to make traditional applications in WSNs become smarter and enable some new applications. All this induce the mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) which can greatly promote the development and application of WSNs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive survey about the communication and data management issues in MWSNs. In this paper,focusing on researching the communication issues and data management issues in MWSNs, we discuss different research methods regarding communication and data management in MWSNs and propose some further open research areas in MWSNs.Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "A survey on communication and data management issues in mobile sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328209200002"}
