A wave penetrable object is located in a layer where the refraction index is different from the other part of the half-space. Wave propagation in such a layered half-space is different from that in a homogeneous half-space. In a layered half-space, a scattered wave consists of a free wave and a guided wave. In many cases, only the free-wave far-field or only the guided-wave far-field can be measured. We establish mathematical formulas for relations between the object, the incident wave and the scattered wave. In the ideal condition where exact data are given, we prove the uniqueness of the inverse problem. A numerical example is presented for the reconstruction of a penetrable object from simulated noise data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
