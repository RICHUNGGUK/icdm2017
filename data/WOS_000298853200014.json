The underpinning mathematic model of the DCLC multicast routing problem is the constrained Steiner tree problem in graphs, a well known NP-complete problem. After combining a path relinking method as the solution combination method in scatter search, we further explore two improvement strategies: tabu search and variable neighborhood search, to intensify the search in the hybrid scatter search algorithm. A large number of simulations on some benchmark instances from the OR-library and a group of random graphs of different characteristics demonstrate that the improvement strategy greatly affects the performance of the proposed scatter search algorithm. The hybrid scatter search algorithm intensified by a variable neighborhood descent search is highly efficient in solving the DCLC multicast routing problem in comparison with other algorithms and heuristics in the literature.", "paper_title": "A hybrid scatter search meta-heuristic for delay-constrained multicast routing problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298853200014"}
