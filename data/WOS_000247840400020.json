Moreover, we show that the upper bound asymptotically decreases polynomially with the code length. Furthermore, when we consider several regular LDPC code ensembles as special cases of standard irregular ones over an additive white Gaussian noise channel, we numerically show that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholds at which the proposed bound converges to zero as the code length tends to infinity are smaller than those for a bound provided by Miller et al.. We also give an example of a standard irregular LDPC code ensemble which has a lower SNR threshold than a given regular LDPC code ensemble.", "paper_title": "Performance of standard irregular LDPC codes under maximum likelihood decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400020"}
