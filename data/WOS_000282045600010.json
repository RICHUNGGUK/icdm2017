Multi-Layered Satellite Networks (MLSNs) that consist of low earth orbit and medium earth orbit satellites are becoming increasingly important since they have higher coverage and better service than single-layered satellite networks. One of the challenges in MLSNs is the development of specialized and efficient routing algorithms. In this paper, we improved the virtual topology strategy and import heuristic algorithm to satisfy the QoS requirements of the MLSN users. The QoS requirements include end to end delay; link utilization, bandwidth, and package loss rate are mainly focused in this paper. To satisfy the QoS requirements is a multi-parameter optimization problem, and it is convinced as a Non-deterministic Polynomial Complete problem already. As a solution, three typical heuristic algorithms-Ant Colony Algorithm, Taboo Search Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm are applied in the routing scheme in order to reduce package loss, link congestion and call blocking. Simulation results show that heuristic routing algorithm can provide more QoS guarantees than shortest path first algorithm on package loss rate, link congestion and call blocking.", "paper_title": "A sustainable heuristic QoS routing algorithm for pervasive multi-layered satellite wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282045600010"}
