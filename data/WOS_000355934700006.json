In this new model, the channel state is available at the transmitter in a noncausal or causal manner, and there may exist a noiseless feedback link from the nondegraded receiver to the transmitter. For the discrete memoryless SD-DBC-CM, inner and outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation regions are provided for both the noncausal and causal cases. For the discrete memoryless SD-DBC-CM with feedback, inner and outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation region are provided for the noncausal case, and the capacity-equivocation region is determined for the causal case. The results of this paper are further explained via Gaussian and binary examples.", "paper_title": "Feedback Enhances the Security of State-Dependent Degraded Broadcast Channels With Confidential Messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000355934700006"}
