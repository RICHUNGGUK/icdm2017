We particularly emphasise that quantity discounts and joint replenishment policies can be utilised as coordination mechanisms among all parties. In addition, a linearisation approach and mixed integer method are developed not only to obtain an executable integer solution for a finite planning horizon problem but also to simplify the conventional multiple-step procedure used in the quantity discount. The result indicates that the coordination and consolidation of orders can lead to the total cost reduction. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the benefits of orders coordination and consolidation.", "paper_title": "A three-echelon supply chain coordination with quantity discounts for multiple items", "paper_id": "WOS:000277149800008"}
