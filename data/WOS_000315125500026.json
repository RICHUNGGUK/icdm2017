It uses selective reorthogonalization to avoid the duplication of eigenpairs in finite-precision arithmetic, but uses a new bound to decide when such reorthogonalization is required, and only reorthogonalizes with respect to eigenpairs within the region of interest. We investigate its performance for the Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator gamma D-5 in lattice quantum chromodynamics, and compare it with previous methods. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
