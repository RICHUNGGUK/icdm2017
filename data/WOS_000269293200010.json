QoS support in WiMAX is a fundamental design requirement, and is considerably more difficult than in wired networks, mainly because of the variable and unpredictable characteristics of wireless links. We discuss various QoS architectures, signaling mechanisms and admission control techniques proposed in the WiMAX research literature, summarizing the operation of each, and providing comparative evaluations that include advantages and limitations.
