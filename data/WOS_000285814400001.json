However, there are several obstacles to the wide use of MLC flash memory, including slow write performance and shorter lifespan. To improve the performance and lifespan of MLC flash memory, we propose an FIT (flash translation layer) for MLC flash memory, called ComboFTL. By exploiting the SIC mode of MLC flash memory, ComboFTL manages a small SLC region for hot data and a large MLC region for cold data. To provide the performance and lifespan similar to those of SIC flash memory, ComboFTL identifies the hotness/coldness of data effectively. It can also adjust its several policies based on workload changes. Our experimental results showed that ComboFTL improves the write performance and lifespan of MLC flash memory significantly.
