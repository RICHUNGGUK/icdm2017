Through supervised Gaustafason-Kessel (G-K) clustering algorithm, proper fuzzy clusters are found to partition the input data space. At the same time cluster number is searched by monotone increasing process. If the cluster number matches with that exactly exist in data sets then excellent fuzzy rough data modeling (FRDM) model can be built. And by integrating it with neural network technique, corresponding rough neural network is constructed. Our method overcomes the defects of conventional top-down based rough logic neural network (RLNN) method, and it also achieves adaptive learning ability and comprehensive soft decision-making ability compared with FRDM model. The experiment results indicate that our method has stronger generalization ability and more compact network structure than conventional RLNN.", "paper_title": "Rough Neural Network Based on Bottom-Up Fuzzy Rough Data Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000271533900002"}
