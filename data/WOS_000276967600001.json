The orientation is decoded irrespective of the grating's spatial frequency. Since pyramidal cells are less prominent in visual areas, compared to (pre) motor areas, the recordings contain spikes with smaller amplitudes, compared to the noise level. Hence, rather than performing spike decoding, feature selection algorithms are applied to extract the required information for the decoder. Two types of feature selection procedures are compared, filter and wrapper. The wrapper is combined with a linear discriminant analysis classifier, and the filter is followed by a radial-basis function support vector machine classifier. In addition, since we have a multiclass classification problen, different methods for combining pairwise classifiers are compared.", "paper_title": "DECODING GRATING ORIENTATION FROM MICROELECTRODE ARRAY RECORDINGS IN MONKEY CORTICAL AREA V4", "paper_id": "WOS:000276967600001"}
