In this article, we provide f-tolerant routings in complete and complete balanced bipartite optical networks, optimal according to two parameters: the arc-forwarding index and the optical index. These constructions use tools from design theory and graph theory and improve previous results of Dinitz et al. (Networks 48 (2006), 47-54) for the complete network, and Gupta et al. (J Combin Design 14 (2006), 25-40) for the complete balanced bipartite network. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
