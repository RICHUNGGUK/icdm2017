The comparison of numerical and experimental data has been performed, for the simple nozzle, in terms of mass flow rate, velocity at the exit and pressure and cavitation distributions. The numerical results for the real diesel nozzle geometry have been validated with experimental measurements of mass flow rate, momentum flux and effective injection velocity. The results obtained in both cases and their comparison with available experimental data showed that the model is able to predict with a high level of confidence the behavior of the fluid in such conditions.
