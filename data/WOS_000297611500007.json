Some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the exponential synchronization of the coupled networks based on drive-response concept, differential inclusions theory and Lyapunov functional method. The analysis in the paper employs results from the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side as introduced by Filippov. Finally, the validity of the obtained result is illustrated by a numerical example. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.
