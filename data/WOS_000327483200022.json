Here, we present different methods for fractional ODEs that lead to exponentially fast decay of the error. First, we develop a Petrov-Galerkin (PG) spectral method for Fractional Initial-Value Problems (FIVPs) of the form (0)D(t)(nu)u(t) = f (t) and Fractional Final-Value Problems (FFVPs) (t)D(T)(nu)u(t) = g(t), where nu is an element of (0, 1), subject to Dirichlet initial/final conditions. These schemes are developed based on a new spectral theory for fractional Sturm-Liouville problems (FSLPs), which has been recently developed in [1]. Specifically, we obtain solutions to FIVPs and FFVPs in terms of the new fractional (non-polynomial) basis functions, called Jacobi polyfractonomials, which are the eigenfunctions of the FSLP of first kind (FSLP-I). Correspondingly, we employ another space of test functions as the span of polyfractonomial eigenfunctions of the FSLP of second kind (FSLP-II). Subsequently, we develop a Discontinuous Spectral Method (DSM) of Petrov-Galerkin sense for the aforementioned FIVPs and FFVPs, where the basis functions do not satisfy the initial/final conditions. Finally, we extend the DSM scheme to a Discontinuous Spectral Element Method (DSEM) for efficient longer time-integration and adaptive refinement. In these discontinuous schemes, we employ the asymptotic eigensolutions to FSLP-I & -II, which are of Jacobi polynomial forms, as basis and test functions. Our numerical tests confirm the exponential/algebraic convergence, respectively, in p- and h-refinements, for various test cases with integer- and fractional-order solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
