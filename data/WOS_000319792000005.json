In this paper we present a computational model of tutorial feedback selection based on the context of the immediate situation for which the feedback is selected as well as on politeness considerations shown to be of importance to increasing pedagogical efficacy of computer assisted learning (Wang et al., 2008). The model is based on empirical studies with human tutors and on extensive linguistic analysis of human tutorial dialogues collected with the specific aim to inform the implementation of a natural language tutorial dialogue interface. The evaluation of the model, involving the comparison of its output with the linguistic responses produced by a human tutor, demonstrates the model's plausibility and highlights future directions for improving natural language human computer interactions for educational purposes.
