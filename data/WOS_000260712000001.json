We give a construction for an induced-universal graph for the family of graphs on it vertices with degree at most k. For k even, our induced-universal graph has O(n(k/2)) vertices and for k odd it has O(n([k/2]-1/k) log(2+2/k) n) vertices. This construction improves a result of Butler by a multiplicative constant factor for the even case and by almost a multiplicative n(1/k) factor for the odd case. We also construct induced-universal graphs for the class of oriented graphs with bounded incoming and outgoing degree, slightly improving another result of Butler. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
