Certain graph products may be used to obtain larger expander graphs from smaller ones. In particular, the zig-zag product and replacement product may be used to construct infinite families of constant degree expander graphs. This paper investigates the use of zig-zag and replacement product graphs for the construction of codes on graphs. A modification of zig-zag product is also introduced, which can operate on two unbalanced biregular bipartite graphs, and a proof of the expansion property of this modified zig-zag product is presented.", "paper_title": "ZIG-ZAG AND REPLACEMENT PRODUCT GRAPHS AND LDPC CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000260924300001"}
