However, interference between colocated workloads and the difficulty to match applications to one of the many hardware platforms available can degrade performance, violating the quality of service (QoS) guarantees that many cloud workloads require. While previous work has identified the impact of heterogeneity and interference, existing solutions are computationally intensive, cannot be applied online and do not scale beyond few applications. We present Paragon, an online and scalable DC scheduler that is heterogeneity and interference-aware. Paragon is derived from robust analytical methods and instead of profiling each application in detail, it leverages information the system already has about applications it has previously seen. It uses collaborative filtering techniques to quickly and accurately classify an unknown, incoming workload with respect to heterogeneity and interference in multiple shared resources, by identifying similarities to previously scheduled applications. The classification allows Paragon to greedily schedule applications in a manner that minimizes interference and maximizes server utilization. Paragon scales to tens of thousands of servers with marginal scheduling overheads in terms of time or state. We evaluate Paragon with a wide range of workload scenarios, on both small and large-scale systems, including 1,000 servers on EC2. For a 2,500-workload scenario, Paragon enforces performance guarantees for 91% of applications, while significantly improving utilization. In comparison, heterogeneity-oblivious, interference-oblivious and least-loaded schedulers only provide similar guarantees for 14%, 11% and 3% of workloads. The differences are more striking in oversubscribed scenarios where resource efficiency is more critical.", "paper_title": "Paragon: QoS-Aware Scheduling for Heterogeneous Datacenters", "paper_id": "WOS:000321213100007"}
