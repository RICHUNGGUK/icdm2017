It uses degree and joint degree measurements in a dynamic evolution network to compose a set of shape descriptors. The proposed shape characterization method has all efficient power of shape characterization, it is robust, noise tolerant, scale invariant and rotation invariant. A leaf plant classification experiment is presented on three image databases in order to evaluate the method and compare it with other descriptors in the literature (Fourier descriptors, Curvature, Zernike moments and multiscale fractal dimension).
