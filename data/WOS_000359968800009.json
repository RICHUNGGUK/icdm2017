The results show that the extended R-curve for type I tends to be the same for different specimen configurations, while it is greatly dependent on specimen geometry in terms of the initial crack length. Furthermore, the predicted load-deflection responses from the suggested R-curve are found to agree well with the testing results on concrete and rock materials. Besides, maximum loads for type II specimen are predicted well from the extended R-curve.", "paper_title": "On geometry dependent R-curve from size effect law for concrete-like quasibrittle materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000359968800009"}
