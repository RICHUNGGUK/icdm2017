It is these two factors which make the building of an improved P2P and grid hybrid framework for resource management and task schedule such a popular research topic. This paper differs from current research because it puts forward an Information Pool Based Grid Architecture (IPBGA), which is a real sense hybrid of P2P and grid instead of only introducing P2P methods into grid systems for resource management. Based on virtualizations, abstract physical resources and tasks to be, the information requests from resources for tasks and appeals from tasks for resources are upgraded as information services by using an information pool protocol (IPP). Thus, grid resource management and task scheduling are regarded as information matching by IPP which is adaptive to the heterogeneous, dynamic, and distributed characteristics of a grid system. Tri-Information Center (Tri-IC) and source ranking mechanisms are presented in IPP to improve robustness, prevent sybil attack, and to discourage free riding. Experiments and theory analysis show that the IPP of the IPBGA is more efficient and robust in dealing with information while both the bandwidth and process costs are less.", "paper_title": "IPBGA: a hybrid P2P based grid architecture by using information pool protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000269060200001"}
