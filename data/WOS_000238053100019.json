In IHGA-clustering, DHB operation is developed to improve the individual and accelerate the convergence speed, and partition-mergence mutation operation is designed to reassign objects among different clusters. Equipped with these two components, IHGA-clustering can stably output the proper result. Its superiority over HGA-clustering, GKA, and KGA-clustering is extensively demonstrated for experimental data sets.", "paper_title": "An improved hybrid genetic clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100019"}
