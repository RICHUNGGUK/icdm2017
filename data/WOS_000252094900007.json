This paper describes a method of efficiently allocating resources to heterogeneous services that have diverse optical performance requirements at 10 and 40 Gbit/s in terms of tolerance to chromatic dispersion ( CD) and optical signal-to-noise ratio degradations. We particularly focus on exploiting the wavelength-dependent nature of CD and demonstrate that by including such information in the routing subproblem and introducing a new just-enough wavelength assignment method, significant improvements in resource utilization can be obtained.
