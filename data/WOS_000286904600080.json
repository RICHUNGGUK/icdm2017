The objective is to choose one technology for each subsystem in order to maximize the reliability of the whole system subject to the available budget. This problem is NP-hard and could be formulated as a binary integer programming problem with a nonlinear objective function. In this paper, an efficient ant colony optimization (ACO) approach is developed for the problem. In the approach, a solution is generated by an ant based on both pheromone trails modified by previous ants and heuristic information considered as a fuzzy set. Constructed solutions are not guaranteed to be feasible; consequently, applying an appropriate procedure, an infeasible solution is replaced by a feasible one. Then, feasible solutions are improved by a local search. The proposed approach is compared with the existing metaheuristic available in the literature. Computational results demonstrate that the approach serves to be a better performance for large problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
