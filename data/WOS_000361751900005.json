It decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a number of optimization subproblems. Each subproblem is handled by an agent in a collaborative manner. The selection of MOEA/D is a process of choosing solutions by agents. In particular, each agent has two requirements on its selected solution: one is the convergence toward the efficient front, the other is the distinction with the other agents' choices. This paper suggests addressing these two requirements by defining mutual-preferences between subproblems and solutions. Afterwards, a simple yet effective method is proposed to build an interrelationship between subproblems and solutions, based on their mutual-preferences. At each generation, this interrelationship is used as a guideline to select the elite solutions to survive as the next parents. By considering the mutual-preferences between subproblems and solutions (i.e., the two requirements of each agent), the selection operator is able to balance the convergence and diversity of the search process. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several MOP test instances with complicated Pareto sets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Interrelationship-Based Selection for Decomposition Multiobjective Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751900005"}
