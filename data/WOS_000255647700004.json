Additional advantage is taken of the negative resistance region of the ID model and its hysteretic properties by widening the negative resistance region and letting the output of the ID neuron be almost instant. Calling this neuron limit ID neuron, a model with limit ID neurons connected pairwise with conventional neurons enlarges the storage capacity and increases it even further by using a weightmatrix that is calculated to guarantee the storage after transforming the sequence of patterns into a linear separation problem. The network's tolerance, or the model's ability to recall a sequence, starting in a pattern with initial distortion is also investigated and by choosing a suitable value for the output delay of the conventional neuron, the distortion is gradually reduced and finally vanishes.", "paper_title": "Recalling temporal sequences of patterns using neurons with hysteretic property", "paper_id": "WOS:000255647700004"}
