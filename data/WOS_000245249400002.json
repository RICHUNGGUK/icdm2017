As soon as the system becomes empty, the server leaves the system for a vacation of exponential length. When he returns from the vacation, if there are customers waiting in the queue, he begins to serve the customers; otherwise, another vacation is taken. Breakdown times and repair times of the server are assumed to obey a negative exponential distribution. Arrival rate varies according to the server's status: vacation, busy, or breakdown. Using the maximum entropy principle, we develop the approximate formulae for the probability distributions of the number of customers in the system which is used to obtain various system performance measures. We perform a comparative analysis between the exact results and the maximum entropy results. We demonstrate, through the maximum entropy results, that the maximum entropy principle approach is accurate enough for practical purposes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
