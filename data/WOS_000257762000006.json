In this paper, we introduce fusion frames and g-frames in Hilbert C*-modules and we show that they share many useful properties with their corresponding notions in Hilbert space. We also generalize a perturbation result in frame theory to g-frames in Hilbert spaces. We also show that tensor product of fusion frames (g-frames) is a fusion frame (g-frame) and tensor product of resolution of identity is a resolution of identity.", "paper_title": "Fusion frames and g-frames in Hilbert C*-modules", "paper_id": "WOS:000257762000006"}
