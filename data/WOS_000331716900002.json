Strang-based splitting schemes are used to separate the governing equations into transport fractional substeps and chemical reaction fractional substeps. The DAC method expedites the numerical integration of reaction fractional substeps by using locally valid skeletal mechanisms that are obtained using the directed relation graph (DRG) reduction method to eliminate unimportant species and reactions from the full mechanism. Second-order temporal accuracy of the Strang-based splitting schemes with DAC is demonstrated on one-dimensional, unsteady, freely-propagating, premixed methane/air laminar flames with detailed chemical kinetics and realistic transport. The use of DAC dramatically reduces the CPU time required to perform the simulation, and there is minimal impact on solution accuracy. It is shown that with DAC the starting species and resulting skeletal mechanisms strongly depend on the local composition in the flames. In addition, the number of retained species may be significant only near the flame front region where chemical reactions are significant. For the one-dimensional methane/air flame considered, speed-up factors of three and five are achieved over the entire simulation for GRI-Mech 3.0 and USC-Mech II, respectively. Greater speed-up factors are expected for larger chemical kinetics mechanisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
