An accurate analysis is required to avoid these failures and detect them when occurring. The purpose of this paper is to develop a lamination stack model compliant with interlamination default analysis. Design/methodology/approach - An electromagnetic model should account for the eddy-current in the lamination stack. To avoid the modelling of the insulation between the steel sheets, the authors propose to introduce a condition on the fields applied between each sheet. In the case of electric fault between several sheets, the conducting domain, i.e. the sheets, is not simply connected. Then, T-Omega formulation must be adapted to solve such problem. Findings - The model allows to account for thin plates, insulating layers and electrical faults in electromagnetic modeling of core plates. This study leads to a first evaluation of eddy current losses in steel laminations with defaults. Research limitations/implications - The present study does not take into account thermal effects. The next step will consist in a magneto-thermal computation. Thus, an electromagnetic finite element software must be coupled with a thermal one. An other improvement will rely on the study of actual situation in order to,evaluate the accuracy of industrial sensors and to compare with measurements. Originality/value - The paper develops a lamination stack model compliant with interlamination default analysis. As far as the authors know, this is the first study on 3D electromagnetic modeling.", "paper_title": "Electromagnetic modelling of short circuited coreplates", "paper_id": "WOS:000267277700023"}
