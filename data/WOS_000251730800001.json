MABP in diabetics dropped significantly in response to tilting (91.6 +/- 14.9 vs. 74.1 +/- 13.4 mmHg, P < 0.05). Valsalva ratio of heart rate was reduced in diabetics compared to normal (1.1 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.2, P < 0.05). It indicated AN affects the vasomotor tone of peripheral vessels and baroreflex. Nonlinear results showed higher correlation dimension values of MABP and MCBFV in diabetics compared to normal, especially MABP (3.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.8, P < 0.05). It indicated CA is more complicated in diabetics. The lower Lyapunov exponent and the higher Kolmogorov entropy values in diabetics indicated less predictable behavior and higher chaotic degree. This study suggests impaired autoregulation would be more chaotic and less predictable.", "paper_title": "Dynamic cerebral autoregulation assessment using chaotic analysis in diabetic autonomic neuropathy", "paper_id": "WOS:000251730800001"}
