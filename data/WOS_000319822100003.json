There have been several proposals for using SMR to tolerate arbitrary or Byzantine faults, including intrusions. However, most of these systems can tolerate at most f faulty servers out of a total of 3f+1. We show that it is possible to implement a Byzantine SMR algorithm with only 2f+1 replicas by extending the system with a simple trusted distributed component. Several performance metrics show that our algorithm, BFT-TO, fares well in comparison with others in the literature. Furthermore, BFT-TO is not vulnerable to some recently presented performance attacks that affect alternative approaches.", "paper_title": "BFT-TO: Intrusion Tolerance with Less Replicas", "paper_id": "WOS:000319822100003"}
