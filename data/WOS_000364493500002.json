In addition, the load distribution ratio, defined as the fraction of applied load transferred by a vertical tie of truss load transfer mechanism, was proposed to help structural designers perform the analysis and design of continuous reinforced concrete deep beams by using the strut-tie model approaches of current design codes. In the determination of the load distribution ratio, a concept of balanced shear reinforcement ratio requiring a simultaneous failure of inclined concrete strut and vertical steel tie was introduced to ensure the ductile shear failure of reinforced concrete deep beams, and the primary design variables including the shear span-to-effective depth ratio, flexural reinforcement ratio, and compressive strength of concrete were reflected upon. To verify the appropriateness of the present study, the ultimate strength of 58 continuous reinforced concrete deep beams tested to shear failure was evaluated by the ACI 318M-11's strut-tie model approach associated with the presented indeterminate strut-tie model and load distribution ratio. The ultimate strength of the continuous deep beams was also estimated by the experimental shear equations, conventional design codes that were based on experimental and theoretical shear strength models, and current strut-tie model design codes. The validity of the proposed strut-tie model and load distribution ratio was examined through the comparison of the strength analysis results classified according to the primary design variables. The present study associated with the indeterminate strut-tie model and load distribution ratio evaluated the ultimate strength of the continuous deep beams fairly well compared with those by other approaches. In addition, the present approach reflected the effects of the primary design variables on the ultimate strength of the continuous deep beams consistently and reasonably. The present study may provide an opportunity to help structural designers conduct the rational and practical strut-tie model design of continuous deep beams.", "paper_title": "Strut-tie model for two-span continuous RC deep beams", "paper_id": "WOS:000364493500002"}
