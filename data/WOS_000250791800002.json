Using this aforementioned architecture, enterprise information systems tend to be more flexible and agile to fit into the capricious business environment, and thus, will be easier to be integrated with other additional applications. The purpose of this manuscript is to propose a migrating solution to convert the architecture of the legacy system into SOA with a systematic approach. This proposed methodology is different from other traditional object-oriented approaches, which migrates the system to have a services-oriented focus without incorporating general objected-oriented (00) or functional oriented feature. In this study, a case study and information capacity theory were employed to verify/validate that this approach is indeed an effective and a practicable one.", "paper_title": "Migrating legacy information systems to web services architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000250791800002"}
