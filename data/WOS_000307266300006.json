However, the management of services on virtualization infrastructure is still in the preliminary stage. Contstructing user service environments quickly and efficiently remains a challenge. This paper presents a service oriented multiple-VM deployment system (SO-MVDS) for creating and configuring virtual appliances running services on-demand. The system provides a template management model where all the virtual machines are created based on the templates with the software environment pre-prepared. To improve the deployment performance, we explore some strategies for incremental mechanisms and deployment.We also design a service deployment mechanism to dynamically and automatically deploy multiple services within virtual appliances. We evaluate both the deployment time and I/O performance using the proposed incremental mechanism. The experimental results show that the incremental mechanism outperforms the clone one.", "paper_title": "Effectively deploying services on virtualization infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000307266300006"}
