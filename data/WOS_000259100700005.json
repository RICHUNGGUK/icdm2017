We propose a weighted support vector data description (SVDD) multi-class classification method, which can be used to deal with the outlier sensitivity problem in traditional multi-class classification problems. The proposed method is the robust version of SVDD by assigning a weight to each data point, which represents fuzzy membership degree of the cluster computed by the kernel-based PCM method. Accordingly, this paper presents the multi classification algorithm and gives the simple classification rule, which satisfies Bayesian optimal decision theory. With a simple classification rule, our experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the effect of outliers and reduce the rate of classification error.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy support vector classifier based on Bayesian optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000259100700005"}
