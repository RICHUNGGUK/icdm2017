As a solution to this problem, digital fingerprinting technique is now attracting attention as new method for integrity protection. According to frequency domain statistical characteristic, an efficient fingerprint-based audio authentication scheme is proposed in this paper. Initially, the host audio signal is equally divided into non-overlapping frames, moreover, each audio frame is then equally split into non-overlapping segments, and the DFT (discrete Fourier transform) domain relation of each audio segment is computed. Then DFT domain relations of each audio frame are adopted to generate the corresponding binary pattern using non-uniform quantization. Finally, the fingerprint is obtained by performing XOR operation between the binary pattern and binary pseudo-random sequence. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in terms of inaudibility, detection reliability, robustness against some non-malicious signal processing operations and vulnerability against malicious falsification.", "paper_title": "A fingerprint-based audio authentication scheme using frequency domain statistical characteristic", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500039"}
