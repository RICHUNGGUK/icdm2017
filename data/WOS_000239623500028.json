However, the flow graph can not effectively deal with some situations, such as estimating consistence and removing redundant attributes. A primary reason is that it is a quantitative graph and requires the network to be steady. Therefore, we propose an extension of the flow graph which takes objects flowing in network as its basis to study the relations among the information in this paper. It not only has the capabilities of the flow graph, but also can implement some functions as well as decision table.", "paper_title": "An extension of Pawlak's flow graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500028"}
