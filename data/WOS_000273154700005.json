We suggest a powerful attack that can be used in systems with detector efficiency mismatch, even if the detector assignments are chosen randomly by Bob. A security proof is provided, valid for any basis dependent, possibly lossy. linear optical imperfections in the channel/receiver/detectors. The proof does not assume the so-called squashing detector model.", "paper_title": "SECURITY OF QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION WITH BIT AND BASIS DEPENDENT DETECTOR FLAWS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273154700005"}
