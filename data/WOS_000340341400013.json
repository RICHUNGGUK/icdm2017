Confronting the inherent vagueness or impreciseness in the QFD process, we embed the fuzzy set theory into QFD. A fuzzy chance-constrained modelling approach with core philosophies of fuzzy expected value model and fuzzy chance-constrained programming is used in this paper. Thus, a novel fuzzy chance-constrained programming model whose objective is to minimize the fuzzy expected cost is proposed to determine the target values of the ECs with risk control to ensure satisfying CRs. Meanwhile, when considering the importance of the ECs, we adopt a more reasonable dispose which is to aggregate the relationships between the CRs and the ECs, and the correlations among the ECs. In order to solve the presented model, a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed by integrating fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm. Finally, an example of a motor car design is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the devised modelling approach and algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
