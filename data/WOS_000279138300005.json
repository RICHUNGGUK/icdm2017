Effective entity matching typically requires combining several match techniques and finding suitable configuration parameters, such as similarity thresholds. The authors investigate to what degree machine learning helps semi-automatically determine suitable match strategies with a limited amount of manual training effort. They use a new framework, Fever, to evaluate several learning-based approaches for matching different sets of Web data entities. In particular, they study different approaches for training-data selection and how much training is needed to find effective combined match strategies and configurations.", "paper_title": "Learning-Based Approaches for Matching Web Data Entities", "paper_id": "WOS:000279138300005"}
