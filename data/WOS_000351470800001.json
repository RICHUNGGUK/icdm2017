In this paper, a generalized hybrid coding technique is proposed for communication over discrete memoryless and Gaussian systems, and its utility is demonstrated via three examples-lossy joint source-channel coding over multiple access channels, channel coding over two-way relay channels, and channel coding over diamond networks. The corresponding coding schemes recover and extend several existing results in the literature.", "paper_title": "A Unified Approach to Hybrid Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800001"}
