At the same time, each vehicular application has its own set of Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements which must be guaranteed by the underlying dissemination protocol. This has lead to a proliferation of geocast protocols proposed in the literature of VANETs, usually based on reactive or proactive approaches. However, most of these solutions are tailored for a specific application (e.g. active-safety applications), and thus might not be suitable for generic deployments of VANETs. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Backbone Assisted (DBA) MAC protocol as a general solution to support geocast communication on highway scenarios for different classes of vehicular applications. DBA-MAC combines the benefits of proactive and reactive schemes through a cross-layer architecture which includes: (i) a novel distributed clustering algorithm and (ii) a fast information dissemination mechanism. First, DBA-MAC creates and maintains a virtual backbone of vehicles inside the highway scenario. Then, it provides fast dissemination of geocast messages through a combination of contention-free and contention-based forwarding mechanisms at the link layer. We provide a complete and exhaustive evaluation of the DBA-MAC scheme under different application requirements and network load conditions. We propose three metrics for the selection of backbone members which provide different characteristics in terms of delivery delay and ratio, and we analyze their performance with both analytical models and simulation studies. Then, we evaluate the performance of DBA-MAC compared to traditional geocast schemes for three classes of vehicular applications: active-safety applications, traffic-information applications, multimedia streaming (audio/video) applications. The simulation results confirm that DBA-MAC is able to greatly reduce the delivery delay for active-safety applications, and to adequately meet the requirements of multimedia applications for VANETs.
