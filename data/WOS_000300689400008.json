Generally speaking, the biggest difference between VANET and traditional ad hoc network is the velocity of carriers because in VANET, the velocity of vehicles, the carriers, is much higher than those in traditional ad hoc. Therefore, it would be a great challenge to forward data efficiently in VANETs and many researches proposed have focused on the development of routing protocols. The current proposed routing protocols are all assumed to simulate in a distributed and ideal environment. As for the complex geographic environments, such as urban scenarios, extra amendments must be needed to improve the efficiency of the routing protocols. Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to design a suitable routing protocol for urban scenarios with better performance and adaptability. For this reason, greedy on straight roads and predictive at the intersections (GSPI) routing protocol is proposed to use greedy mode on straight roads and to use predictive mode at the intersections. In greedy mode, we choose the next hop according to the weight value that combines the distances and multi-rate. In predictive mode, we predict the directions of the vehicles to determine the next hop. The simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm indeed proves its feasibility.
