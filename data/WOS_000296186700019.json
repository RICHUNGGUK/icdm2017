The inductances and the induced electromotive force for a typical generator are calculated using the magnetostatic three-dimensional finite element method. A new method is then proposed that reveals the behavior of the generator under any load. Finally, torque calculations are carried out using three dimensional finite element analyses. It is shown that although in the single-phase generator the cogging torque is very high, this can be improved significantly by combining three single-phase modules into a three-phase generator.", "paper_title": "Accurate Modeling of a Transverse Flux Permanent Magnet Generator Using 3D Finite Element Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000296186700019"}
