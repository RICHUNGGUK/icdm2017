The first stage consists of inferring the logic forms for both the text and the hypothesis. The logic forms are obtained by analysing the dependency relations between words. The second stage carries out a comparison between the inferred logic forms by means of WordNet relations. This comparison aims at establishing the existence of an entailment relation. This approach has been evaluated within the PASCAL Second RTE Challenge and achieved 60% average precision.", "paper_title": "A knowledge based strategy for recognising textual entailment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500007"}
