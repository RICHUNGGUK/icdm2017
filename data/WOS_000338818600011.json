This paper presents, from a purely geometric perspective, the fundamental theory for optimising the cutter orientation on a quadric, which maximises the machined strip width whilst avoiding local and rear gouging. The analysis focuses on the flat-end cutter which is modelled by a circular cylinder but can be generalised for any fillet-end cutter using an appropriate offset of the design surface and the concept of geometric equivalency. The theory is illustrated by three examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
