It uses Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the values of nodes in a search tree. The node values are then used to select the actions during subsequent simulations. The performance of MCTS heavily depends on the quality of its default policy, which guides the simulations beyond the search tree. In this paper, we propose an MCTS improvement, called incentive learning, which learns the default policy online. This new default policy learning scheme is based on ideas from combinatorial game theory, and hence is particularly useful when the underlying game is a sum of games. To illustrate the efficiency of incentive learning, we describe a game named Heap-Go and present experimental results on the game.", "paper_title": "Incentive Learning in Monte Carlo Tree Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000328732600005"}
