Rather than approximating the communication volume for linear algebra operations, this new model represents the communication volume exactly. To this end, a hypergraph partitioning problem is formulated where the objective function involves a new metric. This metric, the lambda(lambda - 1)-metric, accurately models the communication volume for an all-neighbor communication pattern occurring in a concrete finite element application. It is a member of a more general class of metrics, which also contains more widely used metrics, such as the cut-net and the (lambda - 1)-metric. In addition, we develop a heuristic to minimize the communication volume in the new lambda(lambda - 1)-metric. For the solution of several real-world finite element problems, experimental results based on this new heuristic demonstrate a small reduction in communication volume compared to a standard graph partitioner and do not show significant reductions in communication volume compared to a hypergraph partitioner using the common (lambda - 1)-metric. However, for this set of problems, the new approach does reduce actual communication times. As a by-product, we observe that it also tends to reduce the number of messages. Furthermore, the new approach dramatically reduces the communication volume for a set of sparse matrix problems that are more irregularly-structured than finite element problems.
