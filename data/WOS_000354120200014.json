In this paper, we construct high order operator splitting schemes using the IDC procedure to solve initial value problems (IVPs). We present analysis to show that the IDC methods can correct for both the splitting and numerical errors, lifting the order of accuracy by r with each correction, where r is the order of accuracy of the method used to solve the correction equation. We further apply this framework to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical examples in two dimensions of linear and nonlinear initial-boundary value problems are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed IDC approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
