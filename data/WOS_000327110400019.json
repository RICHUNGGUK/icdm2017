Utilizing the FO calculus, it is showed that the state trajectories of the closed-loop system reach the FO switching manifold in finite time. The control law ensures the asymptotical stability on the sliding surface. A parameter adjustment scheme for FO integral sliding surface is proposed by using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. The proposed controller can be applied to different systems such as chaotic systems. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method controlling chaos in FO Chua circuit and FO Van-der-Pol oscillator. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
