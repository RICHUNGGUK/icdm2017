New platforms with increasingly more features for managing big datasets are being announced almost on a weekly basis. Yet, there is currently a lack of any means of comparability among such platforms. While the performance of traditional database systems is well understood and measured by long-established institutions such as the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TCP), there is neither a clear definition of the performance of big data systems nor a generally agreed upon metric for comparing these systems. In this article, we describe a community-based effort for defining a big data benchmark. Over the past year, a Big Data Benchmarking Community has become established in order to fill this void. The effort focuses on defining an end-to-end application-layer benchmark for measuring the performance of big data applications, with the ability to easily adapt the benchmark specification to evolving challenges in the big data space. This article describes the efforts that have been undertaken thus far toward the definition of a BigData Top100 List. While highlighting the major technical as well as organizational challenges, through this article, we also solicit community input into this process.\t[Baru, Chaitanya] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego Supercomp Ctr, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bhandarkar, Milind] EMC, Greenplum, San Mateo, CA USA; [Nambiar, Raghunath] Cisco Syst Inc, San Jose, CA USA; [Poess, Meikel] Oracle Corp, Redwood City, CA USA; [Rabl, Tilmann] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada\tBaru, C (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego Supercomp Ctr, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\tbaru@sdsc.edu\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t9\t11\t8\t10\tMARY ANN LIEBERT, INC\tNEW ROCHELLE\t140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA\t2167-6461\t2167-647X\t\tBIG DATA\tBig Data\tMAR\t2013\t1\t1\t\t\t\t\t60\t64\t\t10.1089/big.2013.1509\t\t5\tComputer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods\tComputer Science\tV42XH\tWOS:000209646000012\t27447039\t\nJ\tScalosub, G; Marbach, P; Liebeherr, J\t\t\t\tScalosub, Gabriel; Marbach, Peter; Liebeherr, Joerg\t\t\tBuffer Management for Aggregated Streaming Data with Packet Dependencies\tIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS\t\t\tEnglish\tArticle\t\t\t\t\t\tBuffer management; competitive analysis; FIFO; switch and router architecture; quality of service\tOVERFLOW MANAGEMENT; FRAME DISCARD; QOS SWITCHES; ATM NETWORKS; VIDEO; TRANSPORT; SERVICE\tIn many applications, the traffic traversing the network has interpacket dependencies due to application-level encoding schemes. For some applications, e. g., multimedia streaming, dropping a single packet may render useless the delivery of a whole sequence. In such environments, the algorithm used to decide which packet to drop in case of buffer overflows must be carefully designed, to avoid goodput degradation. We present a model that captures such interpacket dependencies, and design algorithms for performing packet discard. Traffic consists of an aggregation of multiple streams, each of which consists of a sequence of interdependent packets. We provide two guidelines for designing buffer management algorithms, and demonstrate their effectiveness. We devise an algorithm according to these guidelines and evaluate its performance analytically, using competitive analysis. We also perform a simulation study that shows that the performance of our algorithm is within a small fraction of the performance of the best known offline algorithm.\t[Scalosub, Gabriel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Commun Syst Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Marbach, Peter] Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada; [Liebeherr, Joerg] Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada\tScalosub, G (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Commun Syst Engn, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.\tsgabriel@bgu.ac.il; marbach@cs.toronto.edu; jorg@comm.utoronto.ca\t\t\t\t\t\t32\t3\t6\t0\t6\tIEEE COMPUTER SOC\tLOS ALAMITOS\t10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA\t1045-9219\t\t\tIEEE T PARALL DISTR\tIEEE Trans.

The extension with respect to the existing MCMC literature is twofold. First, the sampler proposed extends the basic MTM algorithm by allowing for different proposal distributions in the multiple-try generation step. Second, we exploit the different proposal distributions to naturally introduce an interacting MTM mechanism (IMTM) that expands the class of population Monte Carlo methods and builds connections with the rapidly expanding world of adaptive MCMC. We show the validity of the algorithm and discuss the choice of the selection weights and of the different proposals. The numerical studies show that the interaction mechanism allows the IMTM to efficiently explore the state space leading to higher efficiency than other competing algorithms.\t[Casarin, Roberto] Adv Sch Econ, Venice, Italy; [Casarin, Roberto] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Venice, Italy; [Craiu, Radu] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Leisen, Fabrizio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain\tCraiu, R (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\tcraiu@utstat.toronto.edu\tCasarin, Roberto/D-5894-2014\tCasarin, Roberto/0000-0003-1746-9190\tNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada\tWe would like to thank the Editor, Professor Gilles Celeux, an Associate Editor and two referees for constructive suggestions that have greatly improved the paper.

GESTODIFFERENT is a Cytoscape plugin aimed at the generation and the identification of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) describing an arbitrary stochastic cell differentiation process. The (dynamical) model adopted to describe general GRNs is that of noisy random Boolean networks (NRBNs), with a specific focus on their emergent dynamical behavior. GESTODIFFERENT explores the space of GRNs by filtering the NRBN instances inconsistent with a stochastic lineage differentiation tree representing the cell lineages that can be obtained by following the fate of a stem cell descendant. Matched networks can then be analyzed by Cytoscape network analysis algorithms or, for instance, used to define (multiscale) models of cellular dynamics.\t[Antoniotti, Marco; Caravagna, Giulio; Crippa, Silvia; Graudenzi, Alex; Mauri, Giancarlo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Informat Syst & Commun, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Bader, Gary D.] Univ Toronto, Donnelly Ctr, Bader Lab, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada\tAntoniotti, M (reprint author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Informat Syst & Commun, Viale Sarca 336, I-20126 Milan, Italy.\tmarco.antoniotti@unimib.it\tCaravagna, Giulio/F-5011-2015\tCaravagna, Giulio/0000-0003-4240-3265\tRegione Lombardia of Italy under the research projects RetroNet through the ASTIL [12-4-5148000-40]; U.A 053 and NEDD Project Fondo Accordi Istituzionali [ID14546A Rif SAL-7]\tRegione Lombardia of Italy under the research projects RetroNet through the ASTIL [12-4-5148000-40]; U.A 053 and NEDD Project [ID14546A Rif SAL-7] Fondo Accordi Istituzionali 2009.\t\t6\t3\t3\t0\t12\tOXFORD UNIV PRESS\tOXFORD\tGREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND\t1367-4803\t\t\tBIOINFORMATICS\tBioinformatics\tFEB 15\t2013\t29\t4\t\t\t\t\t513\t514\t\t10.1093/bioinformatics/bts726\t\t2\tBiochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Statistics & Probability\tBiochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics\t092YI\tWOS:000315158500019\t23292740\t\nJ\tBaskir, MB; Turksen, IB\t\t\t\tBaskir, M.

For this purpose, a new hybrid clustering algorithm for model structure identification is proposed. This model is based on hybridization of extended version of possibilistic c-mean (PCM) clustering with mahalonobise distance measure and a noise rejection method. In this research, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is applied for selecting variables and approximating fuzzy functions in each cluster. A metaheuristic Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is used to initialize the clustering parameters. The proposed FFs model is validated using two well-known standard artificial datasets and two real datasets, Tehran stock exchange and ozone level. It is shown that using the proposed FFs model can lead to promising results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\t[Zarandi, M. H.

Phase synchrony analysis, in particular, has emerged as a promising methodology to study transient and frequency-specific coupling effects across multi-site signals. In this study, we investigated phase synchronization in intracellular recordings of interictal and ictal epileptiform events recorded from pairs of cells in the whole (intact) mouse hippocampus. In particular, we focused our analysis on the background noise-like activity (NLA), previously reported to exhibit complex neurodynamical properties. Our results show evidence for increased linear and nonlinear phase coupling in NLA across three frequency bands [theta (4-10Hz), beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz)] in the ictal compared to interictal state dynamics. We also present qualitative and statistical evidence for increased phase synchronization in the theta, beta and gamma frequency bands from paired recordings of ictal NLA. Overall, our results validate the use of background NLA in the neurodynamical study of epileptiform transitions and suggest that what is considered neuronal noise\" is amenable to synchronization effects in the spatiotemporal domain.", "paper_title": "BENCHMARKING BIG DATA SYSTEMS AND THE BIGDATA TOP100 LIST", "paper_id": "WOS:000316807400006"}
