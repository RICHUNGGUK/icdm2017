These methods can be computationally expensive with an increase in the number of variables and/or constraints of the optimization problem. This paper provides a modification to the original NBI algorithm so that continuous Pareto frontiers are obtained \"in one go,\" i.e., by solving only a single optimization problem. Discontinuous Pareto frontiers require solving a significantly fewer number of optimization problems than the original NBI algorithm. In the proposed method, the optimization problem is solved using a quasi-Newton method whose history of iterates is used to obtain points on the Pareto frontier. The proposed and the original NBI methods have been applied to a collection of 16 test problems, including a welded beam design and a heat exchanger design problem. The results show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of function calls when compared to the original NBI algorithm.", "paper_title": "On improving normal boundary intersection method for generation of Pareto frontier", "paper_id": "WOS:000310832400006"}
