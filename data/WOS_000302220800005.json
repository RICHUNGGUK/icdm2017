This paper focuses on the convergence analysis of these primal-dual algorithms and shows that their involved parameters (including step sizes) can be significantly enlarged if some simple correction steps are supplemented. Some new primal-dual-based methods are thus proposed for solving the saddle-point problem. We show that these new methods are of the contraction type: the iterative sequences generated by these new methods are contractive with respect to the solution set of the saddle-point problem. The global convergence of these new methods thus can be obtained within the analytic framework of contraction-type methods. The novel study on these primal-dual algorithms from the perspective of contraction methods substantially simplifies existing convergence analysis. Finally, we show the efficiency of the new methods numerically.", "paper_title": "Convergence Analysis of Primal-Dual Algorithms for a Saddle-Point Problem: From Contraction Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000302220800005"}
