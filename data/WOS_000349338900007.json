We propose a method to automatically segment the retinal layers in 3-D OCT data with serous retinal pigment epithelial detachments (PED), which is a prominent feature of many chorioretinal disease processes. The proposed framework consists of the following steps: fast denoising and B-scan alignment, multi-resolution graph search based surface detection, PED region detection and surface correction above the PED region. The proposed technique was evaluated on a dataset with OCT images from 20 subjects diagnosed with PED. The experimental results showed the following. 1) The overall mean unsigned border positioning error for layer segmentation is 7.87 +/- 3.36 mu m, and is comparable to the mean inter-observer variability (7.81 +/- 2.56 mu m). 2) The true positive volume fraction (TPVF), false positive volume fraction (FPVF) and positive predicative value (PPV) for PED volume segmentation are 87.1%, 0.37%, and 81.2%, respectively. 3) The average running time is 220 s for OCT data of 512 x 64 x 480 voxels.", "paper_title": "Automated 3-D Retinal Layer Segmentation of Macular Optical Coherence Tomography Images With Serous Pigment Epithelial Detachments", "paper_id": "WOS:000349338900007"}
