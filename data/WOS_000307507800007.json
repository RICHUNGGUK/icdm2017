This paper establishes bounds on the edge- and vertex-connectivity of visibility graphs. Unless all its vertices are collinear, a visibility graph has diameter at most 2, and so it follows by a result of Plesnik (Acta Fac. Rerum Nat. Univ. Comen. Math. 30:71-93, 1975) that its edge-connectivity equals its minimum degree. We strengthen the result of Plesnik by showing that for any two vertices v and w in a graph of diameter 2, if deg(v) <= deg(w) then there exist deg(v) edge-disjoint vw-paths of length at most 4. For vertex-connectivity, we prove that every visibility graph with n vertices and at most l collinear vertices has connectivity at least n-1/l-1, which is tight. We also prove the qualitatively stronger result that the vertex-connectivity is at least half the minimum degree. Finally, in the case that l=4 we improve this bound to two thirds of the minimum degree.", "paper_title": "On the Connectivity of Visibility Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000307507800007"}
