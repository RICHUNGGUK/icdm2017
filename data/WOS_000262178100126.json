In order to automatically differentiate the pulse patterns by using small samples in pulse diagnosis, a fuzzy neural network for classifying pulse images based on the knowledge of experts in traditional Chinese pulse diagnosis was designed. The designed classifier can make hard decision and soft decision for identifying 16 patterns of pulse images at the accuracy of 90.25%, which is better than the results that are achieved by back propagation neural network.
