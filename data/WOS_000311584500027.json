However, the WS-Security specification only guarantees the security on end-to-end level. We propose the architecture of Trust-based Web Services Registries Data Exchanging (TWSRDE) which is four-tier architecture composed of the users, Web Service Providers (WSP) in Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) server, Enhance Web Services Registry (EWSR), and extra Web Services Registries (WSReg). The EWSR provides the trust mechanism which considers physical space and concept space to infer the trust value of WS for WSReg data exchanging.", "paper_title": "A TRUST MECHANISM FOR WEB SERVICES REGISTRIES DATA EXCHANGING", "paper_id": "WOS:000311584500027"}
