The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation is used to determinate ET based on the data collected during the period 1980-2010 in Serbia. In order to forecast ET0, four soft computing methods were analyzed: genetic programming (GP), support vector machine-firefly algorithm (SVM-FFA), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine-wavelet (SVM-Wavelet). The reliability of these computational models was analyzed based on simulation results and using five statistical tests including Pearson correlation coefficient, coefficient of determination, root-mean-square error, absolute percentage error, and mean absolute error. The end-point result indicates that SVM-Wavelet is the best methodology for ET0 prediction, whereas SVM-Wavelet and SVM-FFA models have higher correlation coefficient as compared to ANN and GP computational methods.
