Fitting. Each modal language in this family is built on an underlying space of truth values, a Heyting algebra H. All the truth values are directly represented in the language, which is interpreted on relational frames with an H-valued accessibility relation. We define two notions of bisimulation that allow us to obtain truth invariance results. We provide game semantics and, for the more interesting and complicated notion, we are able to provide characteristic formulae and prove a Hennessy-Milner-type theorem. If the underlying algebra H is finite, Heyting-valued modal models can be equivalently reformulated to a form relevant to epistemic situations with many interrelated experts. Our definitions and results draw inspiration from this formulation, which is of independent interest to Knowledge Representation applications.", "paper_title": "Notions of Bisimulation for Heyting-Valued Modal Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000302309000003"}
