Given the buffer size, the transmission capability of a block fading Rayleigh channel is characterized from two aspects: (i) the buffer behavior when the input traffic rate is constant; and (ii) the traffic rate that can be supported by the channel for a given overflow probability constraint. For the first problem, the stationary distribution of the queue length in the buffer is derived by discretizing the queue length using a uniform quantization strategy. It is also shown that the overflow probability of the finite size buffer decreases exponentially with buffer size. An explicit upper bound on the overflow probability is also given. For the second one, a new concept of epsilon-overflow rate is proposed to measure the transmission capability of a block fading channel under overflow probability constraints. It will be shown that the epsilon-overflow rate is larger than the epsilon-outage capacity under the same outage constraint and will meet the great gap between outage capacity and ergodic capacity as the overflow probability constraint varies.
