One of its drawbacks is the appearance of incomplete artifacts between iterations. Consequently, well-known size-estimation methods can not be used in iterative development. This paper addresses the problem of size estimation in iterative development. We present a novel approach that enables early size estimation using Unified Modeling Language (UML) artifacts. The approach incorporates self-improvement steps that increase the estimation accuracy in subsequent iterations. The demonstration of its applicability and research results are also presented. The results anticipate the possibility of a significant improvement in size and effort estimates by applying the approach presented here. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
