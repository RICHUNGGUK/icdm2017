The off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11 PHY and MAC specifications support both multi-channel and multi-rate capabilities. However, designing an efficient channel assignment protocol that exploits both available channels and data rates is a critical issue to overcome the network performance degradation. In multi-rate wireless networks, high-rate links may severely suffer from throughput degradation due to the presence of low-rate links. This problem is often referred to as performance anomaly. In this paper, we design a Cooperative Channel Assignment (COCA) protocol to consider the performance anomaly problem in multi-channel multi-rate WMNs. Based on the proposed family architecture, CoCA exploits the Estimated Delivery Time (EDT) metric and an efficient balancing algorithm. Using the EDT metric, CoCA performs channel assignments to form Multi-channel Multi-hop Paths (MMPs) so that CoCA separates high-rate links from low-rate links over different channels and increases the channel diversity. In addition, CoCA considers the performance anomaly problem and throughput fairness during channel assignments by utilizing the balancing algorithm. We evaluated the performance of CoCA through extensive simulations and found that CoCA outperforms existing well-known channel assignment protocols for WMNs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
