They have become a common tool in many image processing applications. To integrate the local data information, the structure tensor is based on a local regularization of a tensorial product. In this paper, we propose a new regularization model based on the non-local properties of the tensor product. The resulting non-local structure tensor is effective in the restitution of the non homogeneity of the local orientation of the structures. It is particularly efficient in texture regions where patches repeat non locally. The new tensor regularization also offers the advantage of automatically adapting the smoothing parameter to the local structures of the tensor product. Finally, we explain how this new adaptive structure tensor can be plugged into two PDEs: an anisotropic diffusion and a shock filter. Comparisons with other tensor regularization methods and other PDEs demonstrate the clear advantage of using the non-local structure tensor. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
