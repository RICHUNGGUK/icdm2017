The complete control algorithm is validated through on-board, real-time implementation on a small autopilot having limited computational resources. We present two distinct real-time software frameworks for implementing the overall control architecture, including path planning, path smoothing, and path following. We emphasize, in particular, the use of a real-time kernel, which is shown to be an effective and robust way to accomplish real-time operation of small UAVs under non-trivial scenarios. By seamless integration of the whole control hierarchy using the real-time kernel, we demonstrate the soundness of the approach. The UAV equipped with a small autopilot, despite its limited computational resources, manages to accomplish sophisticated unsupervised navigation to the target, while autonomously avoiding obstacles.", "paper_title": "Real-time Implementation and Validation of a New Hierarchical Path Planning Scheme of UAVs via Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264484900010"}
