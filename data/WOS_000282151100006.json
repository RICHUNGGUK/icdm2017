These algorithms build on previous works. First, they rely on antichains to efficiently manipulate the state-spaces underlying the analysis of alternating automata. Second, they are abstract algorithms with built-in refinement operators based on techniques that exploit information computed by abstract fixed points (and not counter-examples as it is usually the case). The efficiency of our new algorithms is illustrated by experimental results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
