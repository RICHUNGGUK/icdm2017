We describe a factor 2 rho - rho/(3 rho - 2) approximation algorithm for the TST, where rho is the approximation factor of a given algorithm for the Steiner tree problem. Considering the current best value of rho, this improves a previous 3.10 factor to 2.52. For the TST restricted to instances where all edge costs are either 1 or 2, we improve the approximation factor from 1.60 to 1.42.
