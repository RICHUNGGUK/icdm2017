This bound is reached when n is not a power of 2, and the corresponding optimal solutions are the regular polygons when n is odd and clipped regular Reuleaux polygons when n is even but not a power of 2. Using a global optimization algorithm, we show that the optimal width for the quadrilateral is 1/4 root 2(3 root 3-3) with a precision of 10(-4). We propose two mathematical programs to determine the maximum width when n = 2(s) with s >= 3 and provide approximate, but near-optimal, solutions obtained by various heuristics and local optimization for n = 8, 16, and 32.", "paper_title": "Isoperimetric Polygons of Maximum Width", "paper_id": "WOS:000261831500003"}
