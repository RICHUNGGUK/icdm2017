To reduce the piggyback overhead of traditional causal message logging, we present a zoning causal message logging approach in this paper. The crux of the approach is to control the propagation of dependency information: the nodes in the system are divided into zones, and by a message fragment mechanism, the dependency information of a node is only visible in the zone scope. Simulation results show that the piggyback overhead of the proposed approach is lower than that of traditional causal message logging. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
