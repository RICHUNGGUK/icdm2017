These sampling criteria are based on functions defined by intrinsic properties of the surface: the strong convexity, radius and the injectivity radius. We establish inequalities that relate these functions to the local feature size, thus enabling a comparison between the demands of the intrinsic sampling criteria and those based on Euclidean distances and the medial axis.", "paper_title": "Surface sampling and the intrinsic Voronoi diagram", "paper_id": "WOS:000258223700009"}
