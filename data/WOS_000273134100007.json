It has been shown that for a maximum rate COD with 2m - 1 or 2m columns, a lower bound on decoding delay is (2m m - 1) and this delay is achievable when the number of columns is congruent to 0, 1, or 3 modulo 4. In this paper, the final case is addressed, and it is shown that when the number of columns is congruent to modulo 4, the lower bound on decoding delay cannot be achieved. In this case, the shortest decoding delay a maximum rate COD can achieve is twice the lower bound. New techniques for analyzing CODs are introduced with connections to binary vector spaces.", "paper_title": "The Final Case of the Decoding Delay Problem for Maximum Rate Complex Orthogonal Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000273134100007"}
