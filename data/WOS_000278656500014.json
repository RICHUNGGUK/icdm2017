Bioinformatics applications stand to gain in such a distributed environment in terms of increased availability, reliability and efficiency of computational resources. There is already considerable research in progress toward applying parallel computing techniques on bioinformatics methods, such as multiple sequence alignment, gene expression analysis and phylogenetic studies. In order to cope with the dimensionality issue, most machine learning methods either focus on specific groups of proteins or reduce the size of the original data set and/or the number of attributes involved. Grid computing could potentially provide an alternative solution to this problem, by combining multiple approaches in a seamless way. In this paper we introduce a unifying methodology coupling the strengths of the Grid with the specific needs and constraints of the major bioinformatics approaches. We also present a tool that implements this process and allows researchers to assess the computational needs for a specific task and optimize the allocation of available resources for its efficient completion.
