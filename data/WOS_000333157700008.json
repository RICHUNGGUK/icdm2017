To optimize cost & makespan, in this paper, we propose a Scalable Cost-Time Trade-off (SCTT) model for scheduling workflow tasks. We have developed a heuristic algorithm known as Scalable Cost-Time Trade-off Scheduling (SCTTS) with a lower runtime complexity based on the proposed SCTT model. We have compared the performance of our proposed approach with other heuristic and meta-heuristic based scheduling strategies using simulations. The results show that the proposed approach improves performance and scalability with different workflow sizes, task parallelism and heterogeneous resources. This method, therefore, outperforms other methods.", "paper_title": "SCTTS: Scalable Cost-Time Trade-off Scheduling for Workflow Application in Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000333157700008"}
