In this paper we propose an identifier-based adaptive control (or indirect adaptive control). The identifier uses two effective tools: multiple models and neural networks. A hysteresis switching algorithm is applied to select the best model. The adaptive controller also has a multi-model structure. We introduced three different multi-model neuro controllers. The convergence of the neuro identifier, switching property and the stability of neuro control are proved. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the performances of multiple neural identifiers and neural adaptive control on a pH neutralization process. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
