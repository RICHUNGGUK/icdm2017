A new family of change-point detection procedures is proposed, showing that cross-validation methods can be successful in the heteroscedastic framework, whereas most existing procedures are not robust to heteroscedasticity. The robustness to heteroscedasticity of the proposed procedures is supported by an extensive simulation study, together with recent partial theoretical results. An application to Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) data is provided, showing that robustness to heteroscedasticity can indeed be required for their analysis.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of the mean of heteroscedastic data via cross-validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293782700012"}
