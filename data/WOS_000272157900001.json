ITM knowledge representation language is based on topic maps. We show that these topic maps (and especially those describing the domain ontology and annotation base) can be naturally mapped to the SG family, a sublanguage of conceptual graphs. This mapping equips ITM with a reasoning service. We finally present a media monitoring system benefiting from this transformation and combining ITM with the conceptual graph engine CoGITaNT.", "paper_title": "Introducing reasoning into an industrial knowledge management tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000272157900001"}
