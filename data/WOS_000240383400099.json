Given a set of pattern templates, evolutionary computation is an appropriate tool to segment time series flexibly and effectively. In this paper, we propose a new distance measure based on pattern distance for fitness evaluation. Time sequence is represented by a series of perceptually important points and converted into piecewise trend sequence. Pattern distance measures the trend similarity of two sequences. Moreover, experiments are conducted to compare the performance of pattern-distance based method with the original one. Results show that pattern distance measure outperforms the original one in correct match, accurate segmentation.", "paper_title": "A pattern distance-based evolutionary approach to time series segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400099"}
