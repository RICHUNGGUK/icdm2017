CSO is generated by observing the behaviors of cats, and composed of two sub-models, i.e., tracing mode and seeking mode, which model upon the behaviors of cats. Experimental results using six test functions demonstrate that CSO has much better performance than Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).", "paper_title": "Cat Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500094"}
