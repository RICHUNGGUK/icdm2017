Time is considered as a discrete variable, which better represents some real-life scenarios. An optimal solution can be easily derived. A sensitivity study is provided through substantial numerical experiments to illustrate the use and robustness of the proposed model. The sensitivity analysis reveals some useful and significant insights.", "paper_title": "A discrete-in-time deteriorating inventory model with time-varying demand, variable deterioration rate and waiting-time-dependent partial backlogging", "paper_id": "WOS:000319503200009"}
