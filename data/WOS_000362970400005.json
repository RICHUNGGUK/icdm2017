Using the fuzzy Taylor expansion, the Euler method and its local and global truncation errors are defined for solving fuzzy initial value problems. Moreover, the consistency, convergence and stability of the Euler method are provided in details. Finally, for illustration some numerical examples are solved.", "paper_title": "A full fuzzy method for solving differential equation based on Taylor expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000362970400005"}
