In recent years numerous research and development projects, standardization activities, and a large number of publications have been devoted to fast-provisioning-enabled optical networks. However, in the related research activities less attention has been paid to network state evolution during the provisioning process. Our main scope is, based on a three-phase network development life cycle, to define different consolidation strategies to improve the performance of provisioning-oriented optical networks. The proposal is motivated by the inherent lack of capacity efficiency of optical channel provisioning processes.
