Synthesis methods corresponding to already existing digital methods are proposed. Among others - the following has been shown: a digital adaptation of the row strategy for analog cell design, as well as performance control of the circuits with respect to chip area, power consumption and speed operation. The proposed algorithms are integrated with the already-existing tools for automatic layout generation of analog circuits with behavioral description at the beginning. At each stage of the synthesis process - an architecture description in the VHDL-AMS language was used, which so far has been not useful to synthesize. On the basis of the elaborated expert system, layouts of a filter pair and a filter bank were generated. The circuits were fabricated in TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology and results of measurements are presented. The elaborated approach makes a contribution to the realization of current mode circuits with complexity not achievable up to now. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
