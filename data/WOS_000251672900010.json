Different from the previous mechanisms, each mobile host in our mechanism can select a different cell with a different wireless technology to subscribe each layer of a video stream, and each cell can deliver only a subset of layers of the video stream to reduce the bandwidth consumption. We formulate the Cell and Technology Selection Problem (CTSP) to multicast each layer of a video stream as an optimization problem. We use Integer Linear Programming to model the problem and show that the problem is NP-hard. To solve the problem, we propose a distributed algorithm based on Lagrangean relaxation and a protocol based on the proposed algorithm. Our mechanism requires no change of the current video multicasting mechanisms and the current wireless network infrastructures. Our algorithm is adaptive not only to the change of the subscribers at each layer, but also the change of the locations of each mobile host.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth efficient video multicasting in multiradio multicellular wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251672900010"}
