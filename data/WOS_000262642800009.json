We prove that, under the assumption that the model has only one clock, model-checking this class of models against the logic WCTL, CTL with cost-constrained modalities, is PSPACE-complete (while it has been shown undecidable as soon as the model has three clocks). We also prove that model-checking WMTL, LTL with cost-constrained modalities, is decidable only if there is a single clock in the model and a single stopwatch cost variable (i.e., whose slopes lie in {0, 1}).", "paper_title": "MODEL CHECKING ONE-CLOCK PRICED TIMED AUTOMATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000262642800009"}
