Garay and Mackenzie (GM) proposed such protocol based on private contract signatures, but it was later shown to be flawed by Chadha, Kremer and Scedrov (CKS); the authors CKS also provided a fix to the GM protocol by revising one of its sub-protocols. We show an attack on the revised GM protocol for any number (n > 4) of signers. Furthermore, we argue that our attack shows that the message exchange structure of GM's main protocol is flawed: whatever the trusted party does will result in unfairness for some signer. This means that it is impossible to define a trusted party protocol for Garay and MacKenzie's main protocol; we call this \"resolve-impossibility\". We propose a new optimistic multi-party contract signing protocol, also based on private contract signatures. We present a proof that our protocol satisfies fairness as well as its formal analysis in NuSMV model checker for the case of five signers. The protocol requires n(n - 1)([n/2] + 1) messages to be sent in the optimistic execution, which is about half the number of messages required by the state-of-the-art Baum-Waidner and Waidner protocol, and in contrast with. Baum-Waidner and Waidner, it does not use a non-standard notion of a signed contract. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
