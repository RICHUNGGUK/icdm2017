Complete definitions of controllability and observability, which imply the stabilisability and detectability, respectively, and determine the feasibility of eigenvalue assignment, are proposed for systems with delays in both state variables and input/output signals. Necessary and sufficient criteria are developed to check the controllability and observability efficiently. The proofs are based on the equivalent expanded system, but the criteria only involve the delays and matrices of the same dimension as the original system. Finally, the duality between the suggested controllability and observability is presented.", "paper_title": "On the controllability and observability of discrete-time linear time-delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300413300002"}
