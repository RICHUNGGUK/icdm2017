Patients benefit from such services after greater adoption of the services in healthcare systems. Unfortunately, conventional service development fails to thoroughly understand patient care support, making it difficult to achieve the desired design, and posing substantial challenges in adopting these services. Thus, previously developed services in many cases are not as patients expected, as evidenced by their low acceptance among patients. To solve this problem, adequate strategies must be developed by incorporating theoretical knowledge as a solid foundation in order to improve service design. This study develops technology-enabled diabetes support services based on the self-care theory. A set of self-care service scenarios is also established and combined with theoretical concepts. The developed services consist of a nurse-led consultation service and a mobile application service. Additionally, user acceptance is confirmed by assessing patient perceptions of the diabetes support services in a group of patients with diabetes (N = 27). Results of analysis reveal that patients respond favorably toward the services. Patient preference and perceived ease of use attest to their intention to use the services. Greater adoption of the services can be anticipated, owing to a higher levels of preference and higher perceived ease of use. This study demonstrated that the self-care theory can be linked to nursing informatics research and chronic care clinical practices.", "paper_title": "Development and Evaluation of Theory-Based Diabetes Support Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000315289300003"}
