Behavioural biometrics recognition and profiling systems should incorporate reliable schemes to determine and ascertain the psychological and physical status of a person. Behavioural biometrics find a special field of application in the case of Assisted Living, in which individuals suffering from various diseases in different stages need supervision in their daily activities as they cannot function on their own or are in need of help-minor or not. By using biometrics, unobtrusive support for daily life activities can be provided to elderly people through smart interfaces incorporating emotion classification, movement detection, person identification, pattern and activity recognition techniques integrated in their personal environment. Thus, an elderly individual's mood and activities could be determined and appropriate solutions suggested by the system, such as calls for help in case of a fall and alarms to relatives or doctors, and all this inside the framework of \"what are the patient's actions and status''.", "paper_title": "Case-based approach using behavioural biometrics aimed at Assisted Living", "paper_id": "WOS:000209325600002"}
