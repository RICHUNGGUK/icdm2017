The topology and the shape of the design depend on an iterative algorithm, which continually adds and removes material depending on the shape and distribution of the contour isolines of the required structural behaviour. In this study the von Mises stress was investigated. Several classic examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm, which provides quality solutions with very detailed contour without the need to interpret the topology in order to obtain a final design.
