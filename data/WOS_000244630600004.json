Our constructions have rami. cations of both theoretical and practical interest. First, our schemes give a new paradigm for achieving CCA-security; this paradigm avoids \"proofs of well-formedness\" that have been shown to underlie previous constructions. Second, instantiating our construction using known IBE constructions we obtain CCA-secure encryption schemes whose performance is competitive with the most efficient CCA-secure schemes to date. Our techniques extend naturally to give an efficient method for securing IBE schemes ( even hierarchical ones) against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks. Coupled with previous work, this gives the first efficient constructions of CCA-secure IBE schemes.", "paper_title": "Chosen-ciphertext security from identity-based encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000244630600004"}
