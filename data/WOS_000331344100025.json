In general, lumps in the breast are stiffer than surrounding tissues, allowing us to haptically detect them through self-palpation. The goal of the study is to assist self-palpation of lumps by haptically augmenting stiffness around lumps. The key steps are to estimate non-linear stiffness of normal tissues in the offline preprocessing step, detect areas that show abnormally stiffer responses, and amplify the difference in stiffness through a haptic augmented reality interface. The performance of the system was evaluated in a user-study, demonstrating the potential of the system.", "paper_title": "Haptically Assisting Breast Tumor Detection by Augmenting Abnormal Lump", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100025"}
