Four desirable WBSN features are identified, namely, interoperability, reusability, protection against WBSNs providers and indirect relationships. A protocol, called U+F, addressed interoperability and reusability of identity data, resources and access control policies between different WBSNs. In order to address the remaining couple of features, that is, achieving the protection of data against WBSNs providers and indirect relationships management across different WBSNs, this paper presents eU+F, an extension of U+F. A prototype is developed to verify the feasibility of implementing the proposed protocol in a real environment, as well as to compare its workload regarding three well-known VVBSNs, Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn.
