When it needs to be done under a low-resolution image, the accuracy will be impaired. So how to recover the lost information from down-sampled images is important for both authentication and preprocessing. Based on Super-Resolution through Neighbor Embedding algorithm and histogram matching, we propose an improved super-resolution approach to choose more reasonable training images. First, the training image are selected by histogram matching. Second, neighbor embedding algorithm is employed to recover the high-resolution image. Experiments in several images show that our improved super-resolution approach is promising for potential applications such as low-resolution mobile phone or CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) image person authentication.", "paper_title": "An improved super-resolution with manifold learning and histogram matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300101"}
