The system consists of two major parts, interrogator and transponder, for magnetic power and data transmission. The power and data can synchronously be transferred from the interrogator to the transponder with 10% amplitude shift keying modulation of mixing both carrier 13.56MHz and data rate 106 Kbps. Another data can be backward to the interrogator from the transponder with the mixed binary phase shift keying modulation. Simulation results to the whole chip based on TSMC 0.35 mu m CMOS process have approved using HSPICE.", "paper_title": "THE RF CIRCUIT DESIGN OF POWER AND DATA CONTACTLESS TRANSMISSION FOR ISO/IEC 14443-2 TYPE B", "paper_id": "WOS:000299250500011"}
