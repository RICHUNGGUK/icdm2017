The image blocks are DCT transformed and then encoded with different patterns. An optimal selection is adopted to find the best pattern for each block which results in better image quality. Both the recovery and check data are embedded for data protection. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to identify and localize regions having been tampered with. Furthermore, good image quality for both watermarked and recovered images are effectively preserved.", "paper_title": "Image Authentication and Recovery through Optimal Selection of Block Types", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466300009"}
