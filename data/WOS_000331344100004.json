However, current works have not considered the cost of updating data sets that were modified in a low-power mode, where a subset of nodes were powered off. In detail, when the system moves to a high-power mode, it must internally replicate the updated data to the reactivated nodes. Effectively reflecting the updated data is vital in making a distributed file system, such as the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), power proportional. In the current HDFS design, when the system changes power mode, the block replication process is ineffectively restrained by a single Name Node because of access congestion of the metadata information of blocks. This paper presents a novel architecture, a Name Node and Data Node Coupling Hadoop Distributed File System (NDCouplingHDFS), which effectively reflects the updated blocks when the system goes into high-power mode. This is achieved by coupling metadata management and data management at each node to efficiently localize the range of blocks maintained by the metadata. Experiments using actual machines show that NDCouplingHDFS is able to significantly reduce the execution time required to move updated blocks by 46% relative to the normal HDFS. Moreover, NDCouplingHDFS is capable of increasing the throughput of the system supporting Map Reduce by applying an index in metadata management.", "paper_title": "NDCouplingHDFS: A Coupling Architecture for a Power-Proportional Hadoop Distributed File System", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100004"}
