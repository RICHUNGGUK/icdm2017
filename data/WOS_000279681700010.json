Convex drawing is a straight-line drawing where every facial cycle is drawn as a convex polygon. In this paper, we prove that given an internally triconnected plane graph with symmetries, there exists a convex drawing of the graph which displays the given symmetries. We present a linear-time algorithm for constructing symmetric convex drawings of internally triconnected planar graphs. This is an extension of a classical result due to Tutte (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 10(3):304-320, 1960; Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 13:743-768, 1963) who proved that every triconnected plane graph with a given convex polygon as a boundary admits a convex drawing. Note that Tutte's barycenter mapping method can be implemented in O(n (1.5)) time and O(nlog n) space at best (Lipton et al. in SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 16:346-358, 1979). Our divide and conquer algorithm explicitly exploits the fundamental properties of symmetric drawing, which consists of congruent drawings of isomorphic subgraphs. We first find an isomorphic subgraph of a given symmetric plane graph, and compute an angle-constrained convex drawing of the subgraph. Finally, a symmetric convex drawing of the given graph is constructed by merging repetitive copies of the congruent drawings of isomorphic subgraphs. For this purpose, we define a new problem of angle-constrained convex drawing of plane graphs, where some of outer vertices have angle constraints. Our results also imply that there is a linear-time algorithm that constructs maximally symmetric convex drawings of triconnected planar graphs. Previous algorithm (Hong et al. in Discrete Comput. Geom. 36:283-311, 2006) constructs symmetric drawings of triconnected planar graphs with straight-lines.", "paper_title": "A Linear-Time Algorithm for Symmetric Convex Drawings of Internally Triconnected Plane Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000279681700010"}
