We characterize the discounted behaviors of weighted automata precisely as rational formal power series with a discounted form of the Cauchy product This extends a classical result of Kleene-Schutzenberger. Here we show that the very special case of Schutzenberger's result for free monoids over singleton alphabets suffices to deduce our generalization. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
