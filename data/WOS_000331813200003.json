However, the widely used pairwise constraints are not generally applicable for hierarchical clustering, where the goal is to derive a cluster hierarchy instead of a flat partition. Therefore, we propose for the hierarchical setting-based on the ideas of pairwise constraints-the use of must-link-before (MLB) constraints. In this paper, we discuss their properties and present an algorithm that is able to create a hierarchy by considering these constraints directly. Furthermore, we propose an efficient data structure for its implementation and evaluate its effectiveness with different datasets in a text clustering scenario.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000331813200003"}
