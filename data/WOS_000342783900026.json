Employing the Kronecker product to two known sets of q-phase ACSs, some sets of q-phase aperiodic complementary sequences with a new length are obtained. For an even integer q, some sets of q-phase ACSs with new parameters are generated, and their equivalent matrix representations are also presented.", "paper_title": "Aperiodic Complementary Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000342783900026"}
