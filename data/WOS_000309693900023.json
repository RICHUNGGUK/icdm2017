Keypoint descriptors of the SIFT features are used to construct distinctive facial feature vectors. Kullback Leibler divergence is used for the initial classification of the localized facial expressions and weighted majority voting based classifier is employed to fuse the decisions obtained from localized rectangular facial regions to generate the overall decision. Experiments on the Bosphorus and BU-3DFE databases illustrate that the D-SIFT is effective and efficient for facial expression recognition. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
