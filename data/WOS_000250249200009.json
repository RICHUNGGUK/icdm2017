Our formulation permits heterogeneous multimodal sensors and is extended easily to account for nonuniform sensor detection resulting from blockages, noise, fading, and so on. A greedy algorithm for solving the proposed general ILP is developed. Additionally, epsilon-approximation algorithms and a polynomialtime approximation scheme are proposed for the case of grid coverage. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over earlier algorithms for point coverage of grids by using heterogeneous sensors.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for sensor deployment", "paper_id": "WOS:000250249200009"}
