In this paper a kinematic model of the polygon action in large chains of loop-sorting-systems is proposed. Through optimization techniques the chain dynamics is improved by minimizing the polygon action using a parametric model of the track layout as design variables. Three formulations of the kinematic polygon action are tested on an average sized planer tracks layout to find a superior model. Verification of the proposed optimization method is performed using a state-of-the-art multi-body simulation model of the chain dynamics.", "paper_title": "Enhanced chain dynamics in loop-sorting-systems by means of layout optimization and a kinematic model of the polygon action", "paper_id": "WOS:000303532400010"}
