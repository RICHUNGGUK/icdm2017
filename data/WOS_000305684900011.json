The predictions included determination of protonation states for both host and guests, docking pose generation, and binding free energy calculations using thermodynamic integration. We found a root mean square error (RMSE) of from the reference experimental results, with an R (2) correlation of 0.51. The agreement with experiment for the largest contributor to this error, guest 6, is improved by when a periodicity-induced free energy correction is applied. The corrections for the other ligands were significantly smaller, and altogether the RMSE was reduced by . We link properties of the host-guest systems during simulation to errors in the computed free energies. Overall, we show that charged host-guest systems studied here, initialized in unconfirmed docking poses, present a challenge to accurate alchemical simulation methods.", "paper_title": "Thermodynamic integration to predict host-guest binding affinities", "paper_id": "WOS:000305684900011"}
