In this paper, we propose a new importance estimation method using a mixture of probabilistic principal component analyzers. The proposed method is more flexible than existing approaches, and is expected to work well when the target importance function is correlated and rank-deficient. Through experiments, we illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Direct Importance Estimation with a Mixture of Probabilistic Principal Component Analyzers", "paper_id": "WOS:000285488900019"}
