With reference to a segmented virtual memory space, we present an approach that is based on the use of symmetric-key cryptography to represent segment pointers, including access right specifications. Our design effort has been guided by three main objectives: (i) to maintain the simplicity of access privilege representation that characterizes classical capability and password-capability systems; (ii) to keep the memory requirements low even in the case of complex access privileges expressed in terms of several access rights; and (iii) to allow an easy implementation of effective techniques for access privilege review and revocation.", "paper_title": "Encrypted Pointers in Protection System Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000302300000012"}
