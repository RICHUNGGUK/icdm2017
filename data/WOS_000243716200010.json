Mean streamwise velocity profiles are in good agreement with experimental data. Results indicate that vortices originating from the longer side of the rectangular jet are dominant compared with that from the shorter side. Furthermore, entrainment is slight in the potential core, and significantly increases in the following vortex roll-up region. However, the jet entrains more with smaller AR. Power spectral density of the streamwise velocity indicates that the oscillations consist of a series of sub-harmonic frequencies, with the predominant frequencies reducing along the axial direction. Analysis shows that among multiple frequencies, there is a characteristic one at f = 0.22 which dominates the near field of the rectangular jet. The characteristic frequency is independent of velocity components, aspect ratios of the jet and locations. Based on this characteristic frequency, calculations with different forced frequencies imposed on the inlet nozzle are carried out. Results indicate that when the forced frequency is approximately equal to the characteristic frequency, development of the coherent structures is the most intense in the near field, and exhibits the strongest entrainment.
