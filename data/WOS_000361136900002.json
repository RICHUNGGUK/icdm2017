This has not been enough for the industry to accept agent technology as we expected. Our hypothesis is that the Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) community has not recognized the kind of development methods that industry actually demands. We propose to analyze this hypothesis starting with a more precise definition of what an AOSE methodology should be. This definition is the first step for a review of the current progress of an illustrative selection of methodologies, looking for missing elements and future lines of improvement. The result is an account of how well the AOSE community is meeting the software lifecycle needs. It can be advanced that AOSE methodologies are far from providing all the answers industry requires and that effort has grounded mainly in requirements, design, and implementation phases.", "paper_title": "Understanding Agent-Oriented Software Engineering methodologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000361136900002"}
