We formulate the problem as a mathematical model using integer programming that is a typical combination problem with a solution space exponentially related to the problem size. A variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm is developed to solve the problem with near-optimal solutions. Computational experiments are performed to test the VNS algorithm against a benchmark problem set. The results show that the VNS algorithm is an effective approach for solving the MTFWS problem, capable of discovering many large-one frequent itemset with time-windows (FITW) with a larger time-coverage rate than the lower bounds, thus laying a good foundation for mining ARTW.
