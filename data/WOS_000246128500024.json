On the basis of a size and power study we recommend that tests of fit for the exponential distribution be based on the Anderson-Darling statistic and the SW2 statistic recommended by Gulati and Neus [(2001). Goodness-of-fit statistics for the exponential distribution when the data are grouped. In: Huber-Carol, C., Balakrishnan, N., Nikulin, M.S., Mesbah, M., (Eds.), Goodness-of-Fit Tests and Validity of Models. Birkhauser, Boston, pp. 113-123 (Chapter 9)]. We also suggest that inference based on one of these be complemented by examination of the components of the X-2 statistic. We illustrate how to use these components to give improved models.
