Here we report measurement of log P for three types of aromatic quaternary ammonium halides at sub-micellar concentrations, refinement of earlier rules for log P calculation, and development of a hydrophobicity based QSAR, using both calculated and measured log P values, for the aquatic toxicity of quaternary ammonium halides to Daphnia magna. The QSAR for cationics has a substantially larger intercept than the log P-based QSARs for nonionic and anionic surfactants. This is rationalised in terms of the head group interactions with membrane phospholipid in a two-dimensional partitioning model. The effect of the positive nitrogen on the log P contributions of methylene groups along alkyl chains varies, depending on the other groups bonded to the positive nitrogen. We propose a mechanistic explanation, but until these effects can be put on a more predictable quantitative basis it is recommended that, for quaternaries other than the three types discussed here, calculated log P values should not be relied on and experimental values should be determined, e.g. for prediction of toxicity by the QSAR equation reported here.", "paper_title": "Aquatic toxicity of cationic surfactants to Daphnia magna", "paper_id": "WOS:000320185900005"}
