With this aim, we developed iPHACE, an integrative web-based tool to navigate in the pharmacological space defined by small molecule drugs contained in the IUPHAR-DB, with additional interactions present in PDSP. Extending beyond traditional querying and filtering tools, iPHACE offers a means to extract knowledge from the target profile of drugs as well as from the drug profile of protein targets.", "paper_title": "iPHACE: integrative navigation in pharmacological space", "paper_id": "WOS:000276045800026"}
