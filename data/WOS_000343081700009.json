To address this problem, a new pan-sharpening model based on PCA and variational technique is proposed to construct the substitute image of the first principal component (PC1). The energy functional consists of three terms. The first term injects PC1 with the geometric structure of the panchromatic (Pan) image. The second term preserves the spectral pattern of the multi-spectral image in the merged result. And the third term guarantees the smoothness of the functional optimization solution. The fusion result is given by the minimum of the energy functional, which is computed with the gradient descend flow. The experiments on QuickBird and IKONOS datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Compared with the state-of-the- art pan-sharpening approaches, this model exhibits a better trade-off between improving spatial quality and preserving spectral signature of the MS image.", "paper_title": "Variational PCA fusion for Pan-sharpening very high resolution imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000343081700009"}
