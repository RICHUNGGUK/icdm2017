Great efforts have been made to count the total number of sequence alignments, but little attention has been paid to specific alignments associated with conserved patterns. Methods: We propose a new combinatorial method to count specific alignments. First, we represent a sequence alignment as a system of cells. Using combinatorial techniques and Stirling's formula, we then count the numbers of specific alignments with a k-match or match section of size k. Results: We developed three theorems related to different types of specific alignments. We found that the number of the alignments with match sections of at least k was less than that of k-match sections and the number of specific alignments was significantly lower than the results reported by Covington. Discussion: The presence of a large number of alignments makes a direct search for the optimal alignment unfeasible for long sequences, whereas our proposed method based on specific alignments decreases the search space by many times. This facilitates the development of a faster algorithm for performing sequence comparisons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
