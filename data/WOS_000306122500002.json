Based on an extensive literature review followed by a case study, a parsimonious list of seven factors was identified that have an impact on the organizational adoption of OSS in Belgian organizations. An in-depth insight was provided into how these factors affected the adoption decision and how the findings compare to previous literature.", "paper_title": "A Qualitative Study on the Organizational Adoption of Open Source Server Software", "paper_id": "WOS:000306122500002"}
