Two such instances are: 1) significant throughput degradation resulting from automatic rate fallback (ARF) having difficulty distinguishing collision from channel noise and 2) scalable TCP-over-distributed coordination function (DCF) performance that is able to mitigate the negative performance effect of ARF by curbing multiple access contention even when the number of stations is large. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing complex cross-layer interactions in 802.11 WLANs, with the aim of providing effective tools for understanding and improving WLAN performance. We focus on cross-layer interactions between ARF, DCF, and TCP, where ARF adjusts coding at the physical layer, DCF mediates link layer multiple access control, and TCP performs end-to-end transport. We advance station-centric Markov chain models of ARF, ARF-DCF with and without RTS/CTS, and TCP-over-DCF that may be viewed as multiprotocol extensions of Bianchi's IEEE 802.11 model. We show that despite significant increase in complexity the analysis framework leads to tractable and accurate performance predictions. Our results complement empirical and simulation-based findings, demonstrating the versatility and efficacy of station-centric Markov chain analysis for capturing cross-layer WLAN dynamics.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Cross-Layer Interaction in Multirate 802.11 WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000264206800008"}
