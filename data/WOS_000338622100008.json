Particularly, sequencing of stages in a series or a parallel configuration impacts the responsiveness in addressing capacity change requirements. We analyze what type of configuration is more suitable for a manufacturer in terms of service level and cost. We propose a mixed integer programming model by incorporating various ramp-up time patterns, which define system scalability lead time. By solving the MIP model to optimality, we aim to see how capacity is allocated to RMS and DMS based on system cost, system responsiveness, and reconfiguration speed. A discrete event simulation model is used to validate the MIP results under uncertain demand scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
