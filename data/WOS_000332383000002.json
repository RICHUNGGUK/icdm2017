We formulate improved witnessing theorems for these two theories by using S-2(1) as a base theory for proving the correctness of the polynomial-space or exponential-time witnessing functions. We develop the theory of nondeterministic polynomial-space computation, including Savitch's theorem, in U-2(1). Kolodziejczyk et al. [2011] have introduced local improvement properties to characterize the provably total NP functions of these second-order theories. We show that the strengths of their local improvement principles over U-2(1) and V-2(1) depend primarily on the topology of the underlying graph, not the number of rounds in the local improvement games. The theory U-2(1) proves the local improvement principle for linear graphs even without restricting to logarithmically many rounds. The local improvement principle for grid graphs with only logarithmically-many rounds is complete for the provably total NP search problems of V-2(1). Related results are obtained for local improvement principles with one improvement round and for local improvement over rectangular grids.", "paper_title": "Improved Witnessing and Local Improvement Principles for Second-Order Bounded Arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000332383000002"}
