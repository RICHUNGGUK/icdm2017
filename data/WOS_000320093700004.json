The Hirsch bound holds for particular n and d if (d, n)n-d. Francisco Santos recently resolved a question open for more than five decades by showing that (d, 2d)d+1 for d=43; the dimension was then lowered to 20 by Matschke, Santos and Weibel. This progress has stimulated interest in related questions. The existence of a polynomial upper bound for (d, n) is still an open question, the best bound being the quasi-polynomial one due to Kalai and Kleitman in 1992. Another natural question is for how large n and d the Hirsch bound holds. Goodey showed in 1972 that (4, 10)=5 and (5, 11)=6, and more recently, Bremner and Schewe showed that (4, 11)=(6, 12)=6. Here, we show that (4, 12)=(5, 12)=7.", "paper_title": "More bounds on the diameters of convex polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000320093700004"}
