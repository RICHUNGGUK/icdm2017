The library is based on the LU decomposition included in the parallel linear algebra library PLAPACK and on its out-of-core extension POOCLAPACK. The library is complemented with a code which calculates the self-polarization charges and self-energy potential of axially symmetric nanostructures, following an induced charge computation method. Illustrative calculations are provided for hybrid semiconductor-quasi-metal zero-dimensional nanostructures. In these systems, the numerical integration of the self-polarization equations requires using a very fine mesh. This translates into very large and dense linear systems, which we solve for ranks up to 3 x 10(5). It is shown that the self-energy potential on the semiconductor-metal interface has important effects on the electronic wavefunction.

PLAPACK and POOCLAPACK are included in the distribution file. Nature of problem: Huge scale dense systems of linear equations, Ax = B. beyond standard LAPACK capabilities. Application to calculations of self-energy potential in dielectrically mismatched semiconductor quantum dots. Solution method: The linear systems are solved by means of parallelized routines based on the LU factorization, using efficient secondary storage algorithms when the available main memory is insufficient. The self-energy solver relies on an induced charge computation method. The differential equation is discretized to yield linear systems of equations, which we then solve by calling the HDSS library. Restrictions: Simple precision. For the self-energy solver, axially symmetric systems must be considered. Running time: About 32 minutes to solve a system with approximately 100000 equations and more than 6000 right-hand side vectors using a four-node commodity cluster with a total of 32 Intel cores.
