However, the use of the built-in matrix functions within spreadsheet programs, such as Excel, is not particularly straightforward, lowering the value of spreadsheet programs for matrix-based computations, such as multiple regression analyses. Therefore, this study first developed two applications for Excel to perform multiple regression analyses in a much more user-friendly manner. Then using earthquake time histories from a reputable database, a series of regression analyses were performed. A new framework for on-site earthquake early warning based on multiple regression analyses is presented as an alternative to conventional models which were developed with single regression analyses.
