However, the functions of Competitive Intelligence are often greatly restricted by the lack of sufficient information sources about the competitors. With the emergence of Web 2.0, the large numbers of customer-generated product reviews often contain information about competitors and have become a new source of mining Competitive Intelligence. In this study, we proposed a novel graphical model to extract and visualize comparative relations between products from customer reviews, with the interdependencies among relations taken into consideration, to help enterprises discover potential risks and further design new products and marketing strategies. Our experiments on a corpus of Amazon customer reviews show that our proposed method can extract comparative relations more accurately than the benchmark methods. Furthermore, this study opens a door to analyzing the rich consumer-generated data for enterprise risk management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
