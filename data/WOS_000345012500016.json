This approach includes a Markov chain model, simulations, and analytical derivations that are applied to the analysis of sensor networks using impulse radio ultra-wideband signals with noncoherent energy detection. This type of communication system has low-power transmission requirements and noise like signal characteristics with low interference to other wireless systems. The energy efficiency of different Reed-Solomon code rates and uncoded case are studied in a star topology network, where slotted Aloha, as defined in the IEEE 802.15.4a standard, is used as the medium access protocol. Analytical and simulation results clearly show the potential energy gains that can be achieved with the proposed optimization approach that can be also used in the evaluation and optimization of other combinations of physical and medium access control protocols.", "paper_title": "A Cross-Layer Optimization Approach for Lower Layers of the Protocol Stack in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345012500016"}
