This method uses a pseudorandom sequence to generate the nonlinear block-mapping and employs an optimized neighborhood characterization method to detect the tampering. Performance of the proposed method and its resistance to malicious attacks are analyzed. We also investigate three optimization strategies that will further improve the quality of tamper localization and recovery. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method allows image recovery with an acceptable visual quality (peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) approximate to 25 dB) up to 60% tampering.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of a Block-Neighborhood-Based Self-Recovery Fragile Watermarking Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000299440300006"}
