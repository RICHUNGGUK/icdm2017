In this new algorithm, the linear programming support vector machine (LPSVM) is employed to pre-select the hidden neurons, and then a stepwise selection algorithm based on ridge regression is introduced to select hidden neurons from the pre-selection. The main advantages of the new algorithm are that it can get rid of the influence of the ill conditioning of the matrix and deal with the problems that involve a great number of candidate neurons or a large size of samples. Four examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the new algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
