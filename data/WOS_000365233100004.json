Since its conception, several researchers, academic institutions, industries, and regulatory and standardization bodies have put their significant efforts toward the realization of CR technology. However, as this technology adapts its transmission based on the surrounding radio environment, several practical issues may need to be considered. In practice, several imperfections, such as noise uncertainty, channel/interference uncertainty, transceiver hardware imperfections, signal uncertainty, and synchronization issues, may severely deteriorate the performance of a CR system. To this end, the investigation of realistic solutions toward combating various practical imperfections is very important for the successful implementation of cognitive technology. In this direction, first, this survey paper provides an overview of the enabling techniques for CR communications. Subsequently, it discusses the main imperfections that may occur in the most widely used CR paradigms and then reviews the existing approaches toward addressing these imperfections. Finally, it provides some interesting open research issues.", "paper_title": "Cognitive Radio Techniques Under Practical Imperfections: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000365233100004"}
