The structures of secret sharing agreement, fair computation agreement, bit analysis agreement and the applications of these agreements on security multiparty computation are investigated in the study. Moreover, the study also explores network application technology, such as electronic auction, electronic voting, encrypted data computation and threshold cryptology. This paper further analyzes the combination of rational model and security multiparty computation and proposes a new rational secret sharing method with two rational participants to improve previous methods. Based on (m + n,t + 1) threshold, a new (m. + n,t(1) + t(2)) threshold, utilizing the definition of specific permission secret sharing, is proposed and a respondent rational secret sharing protocol is constructed. This paper further studies the theories of UC model and proposes a UC security high-performance voting agreement, which is based on bilinear pairing and secret sharing, by replacing zero-knowledge proof with the new encoding method. Furthermore, this paper studies other applications of security multiparty protocol, such as threshold cryptology and electronic auctions, and constructs more secure agreements with higher performance.", "paper_title": "THE STUDY ON GENERAL SECURE MULTI-PARTY COMPUTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400026"}
