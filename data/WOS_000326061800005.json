Finding a minimum FVS is N P-complete on bipartite graphs, but tractable on convex bipartite graphs and on chordal bipartite graphs. A bipartite graph is called tree convex, if a tree is defined on one part of the vertices, such that for every vertex in the other part, its neighborhood induces a subtree. When the tree is a path, a triad or a star, the bipartite graph is called convex bipartite, triad convex bipartite or star convex bipartite, respectively. We show that: (I) FVS is tractable on triad convex bipartite graphs; (2) FVS is N P-complete on star convex bipartite graphs and on tree convex bipartite graphs where the maximum degree of vertices on the tree is at most three.
