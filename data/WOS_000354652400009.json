Design/methodology/approach - The paper considers the results of the UK's 2014 Research Excellence Framework, and the potential of metrics to reduce the size of future exercises. Findings - The paper suggests that a battery of non-robust metrics selected by the higher education institutions could support a greatly reduced peer-reviewed exercise. Practical implications - Policy makers should reconsider the role of metrics in research assessment. Originality/value - The paper provides an alternative vision of the role of metrics in research assessment, and will be of interest to policy makers, bibliometricians, and anyone interested in HEI research assessment.", "paper_title": "Finding \"good enough\" metrics for the UK's research excellence framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000354652400009"}
