In this paper, several novel approaches are proposed to improve the overall performance of iris recognition systems. First, this paper proposes a new eyelash detection algorithm based on directional filters, which achieves a low rate of eyelash misclassification. Second, a multiscale and multidirection data fusion method is introduced to reduce the edge effect of wavelet transformation produced by complex segmentation algorithms. Finally, an iris indexing method on the basis of corner detection is presented to accelerate exhausted the 1: N search in a huge iris database. The performance evaluations are carried out on two popular iris databases, and the test results are experimentally more robust and accurate with less elapsed time compared with most existing methods.", "paper_title": "Novel Approaches to Improve Robustness, Accuracy and Rapidity of Iris Recognition Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299526800013"}
