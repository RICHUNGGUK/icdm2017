In this study, the authors propose a new tracking approach based on discriminative stable regions (DSRs). The DSRs are obtained based on the criterion of maximal local entropy and spatial discrimination, which enables the tracker to handle well distractors and appearance variations. The collaborative tracking incorporated hierarchical clustering can tolerate motion noise and occlusions. In addition, as an efficient tool, the principle component analysis is used to discover the potential affine relation between DSR and the target, which timely adapts to the shape deformation of the target. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in many challenging target tracking tasks.", "paper_title": "Locally discriminative stable model for visual tracking with clustering and principle component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000320882000001"}
