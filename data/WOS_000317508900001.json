In this paper, we focus on problems of user privacy leakage and end-to-end confidentiality invasion in content-based or interest-centric wireless opportunistic network. And we propose a public-encryption-with-fuzzy-keyword-search-(PEFKS-) and ciphertext-policy-attribute-based-encryption- (CPABE-) based distributed security scheme by refining and compromising two-pairing-based encryption, searchable encryption, and attribute-based encryption. Our scheme enables opportunistic forwarding according to fuzzy interests preserving full privacy of users and ensures end-to-end confidentiality with a fine-grained access control strategy in an interest-centric scenario of large-scale wireless opportunistic networks. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the scheme in terms of security and performance.", "paper_title": "A PEFKS- and CP-ABE-Based Distributed Security Scheme in Interest-Centric Opportunistic Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317508900001"}
