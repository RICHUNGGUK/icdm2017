Given two input curves to be matched, our approach establishes a dense correspondence field between them, where the characteristics of the matching field closely resemble those in an a priori learning set. We build a shape distance matrix from the values of a shape descriptor computed at every point along the curves. This matrix embeds the correspondence problem in a highly expressive and redundant construct and provides the basis for a pattern matching strategy for curve matching. We selected the previously introduced observed transport measure as a shape descriptor, as its properties make it particularly amenable to the matching problem. Synthetic and real examples are presented along with discussions of the robustness and applications of the technique.", "paper_title": "Learning shape correspondence for n-D curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000241228600003"}
