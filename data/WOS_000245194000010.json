Low-order modeling of HRTF with an HR filter is effeciive for the reduction of the computational load required in embedded applications. Although modeling of HRTFs with IIR filters has been studied earnestly, little attention has been paid to sound movement with HR filters, which is important for practical applications of 3-D sound. In this paper, a practical method for sound movement is proposed, which utilizes time-varying HR filters and variable delay filters. The computational cost for sound movement is reduced by about 50% with the proposed method, compared to conventional low-order FIR implementation. In order to facilitate efficient implementation of 3D sound movement, tradeoffs between the subjective quality of the output sound and implementation parameters such as the size of filter coefficient database and the update period of filter coefficients are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Efficient 3-d sound movement with time-varying IIR filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000245194000010"}
