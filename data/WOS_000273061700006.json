The goal in all games is to color the edges of the random graph G,,. according to certain rules without creating a monochromatic copy of some fixed forbidden graph H. Although in general, the three online games have different thresholds, we prove that for most graphs H, the offline threshold for all three problems is m(0)(n) = n(2-1/m2(H)), where m(2)(H) := max(H'subset of H) (e(H') - 1)/(nu(H') - 2).
