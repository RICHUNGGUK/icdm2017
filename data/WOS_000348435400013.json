The double-sampling fully-balanced SI bilinear integrator and current mirror are employed as the building cells in order to enhance overall performance and make circuit design more flexible. Also, explicit design formulas are derived by using coefficient matching. The third-order low-pass and band-pass filter are designed as the examples. Simulation results confirm that the presented filter structure is very suitable for the operation with high sampling-to-cutoff frequency ratio, and can synthesize arbitrary filter characteristics precisely and easily while keeping low sensitivity.", "paper_title": "Switched-current filter structure for synthesizing arbitrary characteristics based on follow-the-leader feedback configuration", "paper_id": "WOS:000348435400013"}
