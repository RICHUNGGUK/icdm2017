Two-dimensional matched filtering is followed by local entropy thresholding to produce binarized images from which roots are detected. After applying a root classifier to discriminate fine roots from unwanted background objects, a root labeling method is implemented to identify each root in the image. Once a root is detected, its length and diameter are measured using Dijkstra's algorithm for obtaining the central curve and the Kimura-Kikuchi-Yamasaki method for measuring the length of the digitized path. Experimental results from a collection of peach (Prunus persica) root images demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Detecting and measuring fine roots in minirhizotron images using matched filtering and local entropy thresholding", "paper_id": "WOS:000239729300005"}
