The objective is to minimize the makspan. It is assumed that all jobs have bounded processing times in between and , where and . We first improve a previous result by giving an optimal online algorithm for the non-preemptive version. For the preemptive version, we present an optimal preemptive algorithm without introducing idle time for all . If the algorithm is allowed to use idle time, we show that the semi-online information that jobs are tightly-grouped cannot help improve the bound of the pure online problem.", "paper_title": "Optimal online algorithms on two hierarchical machines with tightly-grouped processing times", "paper_id": "WOS:000352114300007"}
