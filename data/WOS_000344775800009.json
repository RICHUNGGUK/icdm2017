For that reason, temperature, AC resistivity over the steel bar, AC resistivity remote from the steel bar, and the DC resistivity over the steel bar are considered as input parameters and corrosion current density as output parameter. The ICA-ANN model has been compared with the genetic algorithm to evaluate its accuracy in three phases of training, testing, and prediction. The results showed that the ICA-ANN model enjoys more ability, flexibility, and accuracy.", "paper_title": "Corrosion current density prediction in reinforced concrete by imperialist competitive algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000344775800009"}
