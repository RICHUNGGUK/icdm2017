In VNs, vehicles have high mobility as they move from the coverage area of a Serving-RSU (S-RSU) to a Target-RSU (T-RSU). When moving from a S-RSU to another RSU, every vehicle should complete handover process. However, seamless handover is one of the major challenges in WiMaX while supporting real-time applications for VNs. Handover latency mainly results from the T-RSU selection and scanning of multiple channels. In this paper, we therefore propose an efficient network assisted handover scheme which attempts to reduce the T-RSU selection and scanning time of Mobile Stations (MSs) during the handover process. Our scheme allows a S-RSU to calculate the amount of time during which an MS can receive services from a forthcoming T-RSU based on its velocity and a coverage area of the T-RSU, which is defined as Coverage/Service Time. Later on, S-RSU uses this coverage time for the selection of the T-RSU. In addition, a serving RSU also aids an MS with channel information and estimated time to start scanning in order to get associated with its T-RSU. Thus, our scheme allows the MS to scan only one channel of the selected T-RSU. Using the NS-2 simulator, for evaluation, we compared our scheme with some existing solutions. The simulation results show that due to the pre-selection of a reliable T-RSU, our proposed scheme efficiently reduces the network overhead. Furthermore, aiding an MS with channel information of a T-RSU reduces overall scanning latency and increases the network throughput.", "paper_title": "Target RSU Selection with Low Scanning Latency in WiMAX-enabled Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352691700011"}
