The proposed simulation and verification environment (SVE) uses glTrace's ability to intercept and redirect an OpenGL vertical bar ES streams. The SVE simulates the behaviour of mobile 3D graphics pipeline during the playback of traces and produces the second geometry trace that can be used as a test vector for the Verilog/hardware discription language RT-level model. An architectural verification can be conducted by comparing the frame-by-frame results. The functionality of the SVE is demonstrated by designing a mobile 3D graphics architecture and implementing the verified architecture on field programmable gate array (FPGA) boards. An application development environment (ADE) is also presented that includes a mobile graphics application programming interface and a device driver interface. The proposed SVE and the ADE could be efficiently used for developing and testing mobile applications, architectural analysis and hardware designs.", "paper_title": "Simulation and development environment for mobile 3D graphics architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000250017300009"}
