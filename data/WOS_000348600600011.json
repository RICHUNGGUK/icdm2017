We suggest that a useful way to make sense of these digital service innovations and their novel implications is to recognize that they are materialized in practice. We thus need effective conceptual and analytical tools that allow us to take materiality seriously in our studies of service innovation. To this end, we propose some theoretical ideas relating to a sociomaterial perspective, and then highlight empirically how this perspective helps us analyze the specific service materializations enacted through the algorithmic configuring of crowd-sourced data, and how these make a difference in practice to the outcomes produced.", "paper_title": "THE ALGORITHM AND THE CROWD: CONSIDERING THE MATERIALITY OF SERVICE INNOVATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000348600600011"}
