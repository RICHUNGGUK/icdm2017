This steganographic method, which is immune against conventional attacks, performs the embedding in the difference of the values of pixel pairs. Therefore, the histogram of the differences of an embedded image is different as compared with a cover image. A number of characteristics are identified in the difference histogram that show meaningful alterations when an image is embedded. Five distinct multilayer perceptrons neural networks are trained to detect different levels of embedding. Every image is fed to all networks and a voting system categorizes the image as stego, or cover. The implementation results indicate 88.6% success in correct categorization of the test images that contained more than 20% embedding. Furthermore, using a neural network an estimator is presented which gives an estimate of the amount of the MPVD embedding in an image. Implementation of the estimator showed an average accuracy of 88.3% in the estimation of the amount of embedding. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
