We proposed an improved algorithm for 1 <= s <= 2, where s is the speed ratio between the fast machine and slow machine. The upper bounds are 2(s+1)/s+2 for 1 <= s <= root 2 and s+2/s+1 for root 2 < s <= 2, which are better than previous results. i.e. (s+1)(2)/s+2 for 1 <= s <= root 2 and s+1/s for root 2 < s <= 2 (Liu et al.. 2009 [7]).
