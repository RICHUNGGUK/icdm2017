Cellular Neural Networks (CNNs) could be an efficient way to apply to the image processing technique, since CNNs have high-speed parallel signal processing characteristics, Adaptive CNNs structure is designed for the reduction of Photon Shot Noise (PSN) changed according to the average number of photons, and the design of templates for adaptive CNNs is based on the genetic algorithm using real numbers. These templates are optimized to suppress PSN in corrupted images. The simulation results show that the adaptive GA-CNNs more efficiently reduce PSN than do the other noise reduction methods and can be used as a high-quality and low-cost noise reduction filter for PSN. The proposed method is designed for real-time implementation. Therefore, it can be used as a noise reduction filter for many commercial applications. The simulation results also show the feasibility to design the CNNs template for a variety of problems based on the statistical image model.", "paper_title": "Noise Reduction in CMOS Image Sensor Using Cellular Neural Networks with a Genetic Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537600021"}
