Only objects at one particular depth will be truly in focus while out-of-focus objects will become blurry. The ability to create a single image where all scene areas appear sharp is desired not only in digital photography but also in various vision-related applications. We propose a novel image fusion scheme for combining two or multiple images with different focus points to generate an all-in-focus image. We formulate the problem of fusing multifocus images as choosing the most significant features from a sparse matrix obtained by a newly developed robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposition method to form a composite feature space. The local sparse features that represent salient information of the input images (i.e. sharp regions) are integrated to construct the resulting fused image. Experimental results have demonstrated that it is consistently superior to the other existing state-of-the-art fusion methods in terms of visual and quantitative evaluations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
