There is little empirical evidence of the consequences of trust violation, with the recent exception of Pavlou and Gefen [40]. In this article, we provide a theoretical framework for the study of responses to trust violation. Within this framework, we have outlined five models, each focusing on a different dependent variable. The models also indicate some important covariates that need to be considered when studying the responses to trust violation. The proposed theoretical framework provides a good starting point for the study of trust violation.", "paper_title": "Responses to trust violation: A theoretical framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000249970500008"}
