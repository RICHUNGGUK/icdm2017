Recently, heterogeneous processors composed of different types of cores attracted much attention because of their flexible core configuration and high energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose a compressed sparse row (CSR) format based SpMV algorithm utilizing both types of cores in a CPU-GPU heterogeneous processor. We first speculatively execute segmented sum operations on the GPU part of a heterogeneous processor and generate a possibly incorrect result. Then the CPU part of the same chip is triggered to re-arrange the predicted partial sums for a correct resulting vector. On three heterogeneous processors from Intel, AMD and nVidia, using 20 sparse matrices as a benchmark suite, the experimental results show that our method obtains significant performance improvement over the best existing CSR-based SpMV algorithms.
