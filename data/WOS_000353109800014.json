First, face is detected using skin color method, and eyebrow and eye areas are located based on gray gradient in face. Next, pupil circles are determined using edge detection circle method. Finally, head postures are recognized based on eye location information. The proposed method has high recognition precision and is robust for facial expressions and different head postures, and can be used in mouse operation. The experimental results reveal the validity of proposed method.", "paper_title": "An Eye Location based Head Posture Recognition Method and Its Application in Mouse Operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000353109800014"}
