In this paper, a new neurostimulation method (the DeepFocus method) is presented, which avoids this limitation by using an indirect method of producing electric currents inside tissues: First, cylinder-shaped ferromagnetic rotating disks of non-permanent magnetic material are placed near the skin and magnetized by a non-rotating magnetic coil. Each of the disks rotates at high speed around its own axis of symmetry, thus producing a purely electric Lorentz force field having a non-zero divergence outside the disk, and therefore giving rise to charge accumulations inside the tissues. Subsequently, the magnetic field is switched off suddenly, causing a re-distribution of charge, and hence short-lived electrical currents, which can be used to activate neurons. Two magnet configurations are presented in this paper, and analyzed by computer simulation, showing that the DeepFocus method produces a maximum current density (the 'focus') deep inside the conducting body. The field strength thus created in the focus (7.9 V/m) is strong enough to activate thick myelinated fibers, but can be kept below the threshold for C-fibers, which makes the new method a possible tool for pain mitigation by targeted neurostimulation.", "paper_title": "A new method for spatially selective, non-invasive activation of neurons: concept and computer simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000243621200004"}
