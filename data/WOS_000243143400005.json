The paper assumes that the quality dimensions can be easily formulated as utility functions to express quality preferences for each task agent. The utility values are calculated by the user-supplied utility function that can be formulated with the task parameters. The QoS constraint Grid resource scheduling problem is formulated into a utility optimization problem. The QoS-based Grid resource scheduling optimization is decomposed into two subproblems by applying the Lagrangian method. In the Grid, a Grid task agent acts as a consumer paying for the Grid resource and the resource providers receive profits from task agents. A pricing-based QoS scheduling algorithm is used to perform optimally decentralized QoS-based resource scheduling. The experiments investigate the effect of the QoS metrics on the global utility and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other economical Grid resource scheduling algorithms.
