After a brief description of intelligent transportation system (ITS) architectures and the main already-established low-level standards, this tutorial elaborates on four particular aspects of vehicular networks, which are (i) the potential for a large set of innovative applications, (ii) a review of the main modeling approaches used for both roads and traffic, and finally two important communication primitives, that are (iii) data dissemination via broadcasting/geocasting, and (iv) routing in both highway and urban environments. A particular emphasis is on recent protocols that realistically consider the inherently complex nature of vehicular mobility, such as intermittent connectivity, speed variability, and the impact of intersections.
