From a set of experimental data, the GP may improve the adjustment of such formulas through the symbolic regression technique. Through a set of restrictions, and the indication of the terms of the expression to be improved, GP creates new individuals. The methodology allows us to study the need of including new variables in the expression. The proposed method is applied to the shear strength of concrete beams. The results show a marked improvement using this methodology in relation to the classic GP and international code procedures. (C) 2012 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
