For two Boolean matrices A and B of order n, with one of the matrices having at most m nonzero entries, the fastest known algorithms for computing the minimum witnesses of their product run in either O(n(2.575)) time or in O(n(2)+mn log(n(2)/m)/log(2) n) time. We present a new algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm runs either in time (O) over tilde (3/n(4-omega) m 1-1/(4-omega)) where omega < 2.376 is the matrix multiplication exponent, or, if fast rectangular matrix multiplication is used, in time O(n(1.939) m(0.318)). In particular, if omega-1 <alpha < 2 where m=n(alpha) , the new algorithm is faster than both of the aforementioned algorithms.", "paper_title": "On Minimum Witnesses for Boolean Matrix Multiplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000334062500009"}
