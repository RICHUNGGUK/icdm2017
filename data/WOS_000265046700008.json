The method shows negligible dependency on the perturbation magnitude, and can be easily incorporated to existing codes which handle complex algebra. Numerical results for elasticity problems show that the numerical accuracy of the sensitivities obtained with complex variable differentiation is competitive with other methods, and can be easily implemented in any other approximation methods as well.", "paper_title": "Boundary element sensitivity evaluation for elasticity problems using complex variable method", "paper_id": "WOS:000265046700008"}
