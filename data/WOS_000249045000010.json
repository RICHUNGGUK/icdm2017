However, for many emerging applications in the telecommunication and/or grid computing industries, a demand for a high bandwidth communication channel as well as a guarantee on resource availability certainly exists. Such applications include: remote surgery, remote experimentation with teleobservation capabilities, teleconferencing, and bulk transfers. We present what we believe to be a new model for reserving advance lightpath requests in a centralized system. This model attempts to \"migrate,\" i.e., move previously reserved lightpaths to candidate wavelengths in order to lower the system's blocking probability. We have tailored different lightpath migration algorithms to address two specific network objectives: (1) minimize the number of hops a new request traverses after migration, and (2) minimize the number of migrated lightpaths.
