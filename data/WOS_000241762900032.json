The operations in the GUI part transfer the information between the user and the operational system part. Detailed analysis of the communication information and the process is an important factor to the system. And current software development process is changed over component and internet environments. In this paper, I was design and implement the control system for factory automation in component and internet environments. The component logic makes up the remote status view of the GUI communication modules which has associating the message interrupt method and the timer. This research aimed the IC test handler and this system can display on the web for review and analysis. The proposed method improves the analyzability by catching the operational data under various operation statuses. And it is able to come under a system manager's observation.", "paper_title": "The component based factory automation control in the Internet environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900032"}
