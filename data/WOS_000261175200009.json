System design using Timed Automata relies on explicit manipulation of clock variables. A number of automated analyzers for Timed Automata have been developed. However, Timed Automata lack composable patterns for high-level system design. Specification languages like Timed Communicating Sequential Process (CSP) and Timed Communicating Object-Z (TCOZ) are well suited for presenting compositional models of complex real-time systems. In this work, we define a set of composable Timed Automata patterns based on hierarchical constructs in time-enriched process algebras. The patterns facilitate the hierarchical design of complex systems using Timed Automata. They also allow a systematic translation from Timed CSP/TCOZ models to Timed Automata so that analyzers for Timed Automata can be used to reason about TCOZ models. A prototype has been developed to support system design using Timed Automata patterns or, if given a TCOZ specification, to automate the translation from TCOZ to Timed Automata.", "paper_title": "Timed Automata Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000261175200009"}
