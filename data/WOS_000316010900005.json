In this paper we present the design rationale of a context-aware mobility management architecture for seamless handover in heterogeneous networks. Our proposal is a new cross-layer and interactive approach to seamless handover of users and their services. We present a simple though effective analytical model in typical deployment scenarios in heterogeneous networks with the use of the IEEE Media Independent Handover services. Such analytical model is used to evaluate the resulting handover delay when deploying common mobility protocols in our architecture, such as Mobile IP, Hierarchical MIP, and Proxy MIP.", "paper_title": "Design and analysis of an IEEE 802.21-based mobility management architecture: a context-aware approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000316010900005"}
