The v-nodes, called centers, are hyperconnected and interact with one another via many u-nodes, called satellites. This centralized architecture, widespread in gene networks, possesses two fundamental properties. Namely, this organization creates feedback loops that are capable of generating practically any prescribed patterning dynamics, chaotic or periodic, or having a number of equilibrium states. Moreover, this organization is robust with respect to random perturbations of the system.", "paper_title": "FLEXIBLE AND ROBUST NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302951300010"}
