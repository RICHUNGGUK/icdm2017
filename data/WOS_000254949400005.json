In such inventory problems, a fixed cost is incurred with each replenishment order, independent of the suppliers as well as the items involved in the order. Further, the item involves a minor fixed cost. In such a system, it includes the supplier selection problem when considering the quantity discounts as well as the general joint replenishment problem. We develop a hybrid genetic algorithm for this NP-hard decision problem and extend it to systems with resource restrictions.", "paper_title": "The joint replenishment problem involving multiple suppliers offering quantity discounts", "paper_id": "WOS:000254949400005"}
