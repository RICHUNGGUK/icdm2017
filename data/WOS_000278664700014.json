The range of the turbulent scales is enormous, especially when high-lift configuration flows are considered. For this reason, the prediction of high Reynolds number flow over the entire airfoil using LES requires huge computer resources To remedy this problem a zonal RANS-LES method for the flow over an airfoil in high-lift configuration at Re(c) = 1 0 x 10(6) is presented. In a first step, a 2D RANS solution is sought, from which boundary conditions are formulated for an embedded LES domain, which comprises the flap and a sub-part of the main airfoil. The turbulent fluctuations in the boundary layers at the inflow region of the LES domain are generated by controlled forcing terms, which use the turbulent shear stress profiles obtained from the RANS solution. The comparison with an LES solution for the full domain and with experimental data shows likewise results for the velocity profiles and wall pressure distributions. The zonal RANS-LES method reduces the computational effort of a full domain LES by approx. 50%.
