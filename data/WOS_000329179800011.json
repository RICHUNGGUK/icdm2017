Adaptive normalized radial basis function (ANRBF) network is used to shape reward. The reward-shaping mechanism propagates model knowledge to the learner in the form of the additional reward signal so that the initial performance and convergence speed can be improved effectively. A function approximation algorithm named ANRBF-GD-Sarsa(lambda) is proposed based on the ANRBF network. The convergence of ANRBF-GD-Sarsa(lambda) is analyzed theoretically. Experiments are conducted to show the good initial performance and high convergence speed of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A GRADIENT DESCENT SARSA(lambda) ALGORITHM BASED ON THE ADAPTIVE REWARD-SHAPING MECHANISM", "paper_id": "WOS:000329179800011"}
