This study, demonstrates how the conventional MPMP Linear Programming (LP) model may fail to utilize available capacity of machines, and also a novel Multi Objective Linear Programming (MOLP) model is developed to simultaneously minimize net present value of production costs and maximize machine utilization. The proposed model consists of production constraints such as available labor, inventory, maximum subcontracting levels and also forecasted demands. The proposed MOLP model is further converted to a Fuzzy Multi Objective Linear Programming (FMOLP) model utilizing piecewise linear membership functions. The model, accommodates the Decision Maker (DM) with a more systematic decision making approach enabling the DM to adjust the search direction during the solving procedure to achieve the most satisfactory result.", "paper_title": "Application of Fuzzy Multi-Objective Linear Programming Model in a Multi-Period Multi-Product Production Planning Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000290755800011"}
