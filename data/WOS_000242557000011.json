The hazardous waste management problem has additional requirements depending on the selected disposal method. In this paper we focus on incineration, for which the main additional requirement is to satisfy the air pollution standards imposed by the governmental restrictions. We propose a cost-based mathematical model in which the satisfaction of air pollution standards is also incorporated. We used the Gaussian Plume equation in measuring the air pollution concentrations at population centers. A large-scale implementation of the proposed model within Turkey is provided.
