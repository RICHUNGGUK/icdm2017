The equilibrium reached by the interaction of many competing TCPs, each implemented only on the source and destination computers, is effectively maximizing an objective function for the entire network. In this paper, a new utility function is derived for TCP Reno under the precise end-to-end drop probability. The results show theoretically that the TCP Reno model proposed by Kelly [1] is reasonable. And simulation results are provided.", "paper_title": "Utility function of TCP Reno under precise end-to-end drop probability", "paper_id": "WOS:000314426900018"}
