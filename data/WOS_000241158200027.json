We propose a novel approach which extends a frequent sequence with closed itemsets instead of single items. The motivation is that closed sequential patterns are composed of only closed itemsets. Hence, unnecessary item extensions which generates non-closed sequential patterns can be avoided. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is two orders of magnitude faster than previous works with a modest memory cost.", "paper_title": "COBRA: Closed sequential pattern mining using bi-phase reduction approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000241158200027"}
