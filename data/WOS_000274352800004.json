This paper proposes and implements a method for identifying the spatial patterns of road networks. The method first builds a node-edge topology, generates polygons from these edges, and then calculates a set of parameters, specifically consistent arrangement, shape similarity, and a grid shape index of the polygons. Finally, the method identifies spatial patterns via a multi-criteria decision method. Experimental testing of the method showed that it is a very competent feasible means to detect spatial patterns in road networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
