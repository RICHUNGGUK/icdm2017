The Windows Surface tablet is one such device, combining tablet mobility with familiar Microsoft Windows productivity tools. This research considers the acquisition and forensic analysis of the Windows Surface RT tablet. We discuss the artifacts of both the Windows RT operating system and third-party applications. The contribution of this research is to provide a road map for the digital forensic examination of Windows Surface RT tablets. (C) 2014 The Authors.
