In an effort to facilitate the discovery of HDAC8 inhibitors, two quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) classification models were developed using K nearest neighbours (KNN) and neighbourhood classifier (NEC). Molecular descriptors were calculated for the data set and database compounds using ADRIANA.Code of Molecular Networks. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to select the descriptors. The developed models were validated by leave-one-out cross validation (LOO CV). The performances of the developed models were evaluated with an external test set. Highly predictive models were used for database virtual screening. Furthermore, hit compounds were subsequently subject to molecular docking. Five hits were obtained based on consensus scoring function and binding affinity as potential HDAC8 inhibitors. Finally, HDAC8 structures in complex with five hits were also subjected to 5 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate the complex structure stability. To the best of our knowledge, the NEC classification model used in this study is the first application of NEC to virtual screening for drug discovery.", "paper_title": "A lazy learning-based QSAR classification study for screening potential histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000354712900001"}
