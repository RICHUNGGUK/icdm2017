As more and more consumers delegate their tasks to cloud providers, service level agreements (SLAs) between consumers and providers emerge as a key aspect. Because of the dynamic nature of the cloud, continuous monitoring on quality-of-service attributes is necessary to enforce SLAs. In this paper, we propose a trust mechanism-based task scheduling model for cloud computing. Referring to the trust relationship models of social persons, trust relationship is built among computing nodes, and the trustworthiness of nodes is evaluated by utilizing the Bayesian cognitive method. Integrating the trustworthiness of nodes into a dynamic level scheduling algorithm, the trust dynamic level scheduling algorithm for cloud computing is proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulations prove that the proposed algorithm can efficiently meet the requirement of cloud computing workloads in trust, sacrificing fewer time costs, and assuring the execution of tasks in a secure way in cloud environment.
