There is a conflict between the real experiments and the traditional signal detection theory for stochastic resonance because the latter treats the receiver as linear model. This paper presents a two-layer summing network of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons and a summing network of threshold devices to model the receiver, respectively. The simulation results indicate that the relevant index of signal delectability exhibit the stochastic resonance characteristics.", "paper_title": "Stochastic resonance enhancing detectability of weak signal by neuronal networks model for receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000003"}
