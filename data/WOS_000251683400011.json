A review on basic elements of TCM is provided to illuminate various challenges and progresses in its study using computational methods. Information on various TCM formulations, in particular resources on databases of TCM formulations and their integration to Western medicine, are analyzed in several facets, such as TCM classifications, types of databases, and mining tools. Aspects of computational TCM diagnosis, namely inspection, auscultation, pulse analysis as well as TCM expert systems are reviewed in term of their benefits and drawbacks. Various approaches on exploring relationships among TCM components and finding genes/proteins relating to TCM symptom complex are also studied. This survey provides a summary on the advance of computational approaches for TCM and will be useful for future knowledge discovery in this area. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
