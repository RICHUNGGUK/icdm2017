This problem is a natural graph-theoretic pattern matching variant where we are not interested in the actual structure of the occurrence of the pattern, we only require it to preserve the very basic topological requirement of connectedness. We give two positive results and three negative results that together give an extensive picture of tractable and intractable instances of the problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
