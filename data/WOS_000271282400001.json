The method was: (1) ideal hemodynamic responses for different stimuli were generated by convolving the theoretical hemodynamic response model with the stimulus timing, (2) considering the ideal hemodynamic responses as hypothetical signature vectors for different activity patterns of interest, OLT was used to extract the features of fMRI data. The resultant feature space had particular geometric clustering properties. It was then classified into different groups, each pertaining to an activity pattern of interest; the applied signature vector for each group was obtained by averaging, (3) using the applied signature vectors, OLT was applied again to generate fMRI composite images with high SNRs for the desired activity patterns. Simulations and a blocked fMRI experiment were employed to validate the proposed method. The simulation and the experiment results indicated the proposed method was capable of improving some conventional methods to be more sensitive to activations, having strong contrast between activations and inactivations, and being more valid for complex activity patterns.", "paper_title": "The optimal linear transformation-based fMRI feature space analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000271282400001"}
