This method uses a layer-based representation, where the 3-D scene is approximated by a set of depth planes with their associated constant disparities. The layers are extracted from a collection of images captured at multiple viewpoints and transformed using the 3-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The DWT consists of the 1-D disparity compensated DWT across the viewpoints and the 2-D shape-adaptive DWT across the spatial dimensions. Finally, the wavelet coefficients are quantized and entropy coded along with the layer contours. To improve the rate-distortion performance of the entire coding method, we develop a bit allocation strategy for the distribution of the available bit budget between encoding the layer contours and the wavelet coefficients. The achieved performance of our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art codecs for several data sets of varying complexity.", "paper_title": "Multiview Image Coding Using Depth Layers and an Optimized Bit Allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000307896800022"}
