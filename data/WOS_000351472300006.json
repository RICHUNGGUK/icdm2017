The proposed method, in which multi-layer SVM classifier is employed to estimate whether the action is an attack, KPCA is applied as a preprocessor of SVM to reduce the dimension of feature vectors and shorten training time. To shorten the training time and improve the performance of SVM, N-RBFis employed to reduce the noise generated by feature differences, and ICPSO is presented to optimize the punishment factorC, kernel parameters sigma and the tube size epsilon of SVM, which introduces chaos optimization and premature processing mechanism. Experimental results illustrate that the improved SVM model has faster computational time and higher predictive accuracy, and it can also shorten the training time and improve the performance of SVM.", "paper_title": "A novel SVM by combining kernel principal component analysis and improved chaotic particle swarm optimization for intrusion detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000351472300006"}
