The system used the Texas Instruments DaVinci platform, which contains a DaVinci TMS320DM6446 dual-core central processing unit with an ARM9 core and a C64+ digital signal processor as a general-purpose processor and an accelerated processor, to speed up image partitioning and transmission among different display devices. A protocol with less overhead to synchronize every frame in a distributed multimedia system was considered during the connection. In order to conquer the problems of net transmission delay and lost packets, the IEEE 1588 Standard Precision Time Protocol was applied and modified to attain a seamless partitioned images broadcasting system. Experiments, with and without considerations of synchronization or multithread, were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Experimental results showed that the proposed system can use smaller display devices to replace traditional screen walls and resemble the same resolution of the original video images.", "paper_title": "A Synchronous Display of Partitioned Images Broadcasting System via VPN Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000345620800003"}
