Koch and Pichler A complete axiomatization for a given fragment is a set of equivalences from which every other valid equivalence is derivable; equivalences can be thought of as (undirected) rewrite rules. Specifically, we axiomatize single axis fragments of Core XPath as well as full Core XPath Our completeness proofs use results and techniques from modal logic (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Complete axiomatizations for XPath fragments", "paper_id": "WOS:000276710600002"}
