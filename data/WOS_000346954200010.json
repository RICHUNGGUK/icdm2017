If the potential is composed of different parts with strongly varying dynamics, this multirate potential can be exploited by coupling force-gradient decomposition methods with splitting techniques for multi-time scale problems to further increase the accuracy of the scheme and reduce the computational costs. In this paper, we derive novel force-gradient nested methods and test them numerically. We apply them on the three-body problem, modified for a better observation of the advantageous properties, needed for the future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
