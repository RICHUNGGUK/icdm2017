By using the 3ds max(TM), we can visualize the chemical phenomena easily and quickly without knowing any special computer language and export the application to files which are compatible with the CAVE(TM) (Object or OpenGL files). After the participation in 3D animations at the CAVE(TM) students comprehended the molecules' structure and their changes during a chemical reaction better than during the 2D animations on the computer's desktop, as the limitations of human vision had been overcome. Furthermore, the students were enthusiastic, as they had the feeling that they were inside the chemical reactions and they were facing the 3D molecules as if they were real objects front of them.
