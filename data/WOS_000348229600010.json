Most of the previous works apply MBFFs without doing placement refinement of combinational logic cells. Such problem formulation may result in less power reduction due to tight timing constraints with fixed combinational logic cells. This paper introduces a novel placement flow with clock-tree aware flip-flop (FF) merging and MBFF generation, and proposes the corresponding algorithms to simultaneously minimize FF power and clock latency when applying MBFFs during placement. Experimental results based on the IWLS-2005 benchmark show that our approach is very effective in not only FF power but also clock latency minimization without degrading circuit performance. To our best knowledge, this is also the first work in the literature which considers clock trees when generating MBFFs during placement.", "paper_title": "Clock-Tree Aware Multibit Flip-Flop Generation During Placement for Power Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000348229600010"}
