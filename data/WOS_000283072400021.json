The relationship between OFDMA and the optimal M(3) solution is investigated from an information theoretical point of view. Specifically, the necessary and sufficient conditions of OFDMA being the capacity-maximizing M(3) transmission scheme is derived. In addition, OFDMA optimality is explicitly analyzed in some special cases.", "paper_title": "OFDMA Capacity Analysis in MIMO Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400021"}
