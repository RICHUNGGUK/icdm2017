The Semantic Body Browser is a web application for intuitively exploring the body of an organism from the organ to the subcellular level and visualising expression profiles by means of semantically annotated anatomical illustrations. It is used to comprehend biological and medical data related to the different body structures while relying on the strong pattern recognition capabilities of human users.", "paper_title": "Semantic Body Browser: graphical exploration of an organism and spatially resolved expression data visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000352268500030"}
