In this paper, we present a new algorithm for salt and pepper noise suppression in binary images. The algorithm consists of the computation of block prior probabilities from training noise-free images; noise level estimation; and the maximum a posteriori probability estimation of each image block. Our experiments show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the state of the art techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
