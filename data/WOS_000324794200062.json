(Bernoulli 6:73-90, 2000, Theorem 4.1). We should point out that Mao et al. (Bernoulli 6:73-90, 2000, Theorem 4.1) investigated the pth moment exponentially stable for a class of stochastic dynamical systems with constant delay; however, this theorem cannot apply to the case of variable time delays. It is also worthy to emphasize that Peng and Liu (Neural Comput Appl 20:543-547, 2011) discussed by Mao et al. (Bernoulli 6:73-90, 2000, Theorem 4.1) the pth moment exponentially stable for the Grossberg-Hopfield neural networks with variable delays, and therefore, there are some gaps between Peng and Liu (Neural Comput Appl 20:543-547, 2011, Theorem 1) and Mao et al. (Bernoulli 6:73-90, 2000, Theorem 4.1). In this paper, we fill up this gap. Moreover, a numerical example is also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Comments and further improvements on \"pth moment stability of stochastic neural networks with Markov volatilities\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200062"}
