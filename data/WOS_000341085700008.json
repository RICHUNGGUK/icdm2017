We consider SOM as an optimization problem with a nonsmooth, nonconvex energy function and investigated DC programming and DC algorithm (DCA), an innovative approach in nonconvex optimization framework to effectively solve this problem. Furthermore an appropriate training version of this algorithm is proposed. The numerical results on many real-world datasets show the efficiency of the proposed DCA based algorithms on both quality of solutions and topographic maps.", "paper_title": "Self-organizing maps by difference of convex functions optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000341085700008"}
