Compared to current indoor positioning systems using LED light, our system has the advantages of simple implementation, low cost, and high accuracy. In our system, a single photo diode receives pilot signals from LED panels on the ceiling. Then, the time differences of arrival of these pilot signals are used to estimate the position of the receiver. The system can be employed easily because it does not require embedding any ID to the pilot signal. In the paper, the estimation accuracy of the proposed system is analyzed through the simulation. The causes of estimation error are analyzed, and the estimation accuracy of the system in various conditions is shown by simulations.", "paper_title": "TDOA-based indoor positioning using visible light", "paper_id": "WOS:000333166600004"}
