The time series of explanatory variables are decomposed using wavelet bases, and a GA is employed to extract optimal time-scale feature subsets from decomposed features. These extracted time-scale feature subsets then serve as an input for an SVM model that performs final forecasting. Compared with neural networks, pure SVMs or traditional GARCH models, the proposed model performs best. The root-mean-squared forecasting errors are significantly reduced. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
