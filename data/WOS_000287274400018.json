The scheme allows a sender to prove the authenticity of a message to a specified receiver without permitting the receiver to prove that the message was authenticated by the sender. Non-interactive schemes are more attractive than interactive schemes in terms of communication overhead, and thus several non-interactive deniable authentication scheme have been proposed. In this paper, we propose an efficient non-interactive deniable authentication scheme based on trapdoor commitment scheme. We construct an efficient trapdoor commitment scheme which provides very efficient commitment evaluation operation. Then we design an efficient non-interactive deniable authentication scheme by using the trapdoor commitment scheme. We also prove the security of our scheme under firmly formalized security model.
