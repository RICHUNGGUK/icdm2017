The new scheme can identify the cheaters no matter if she/he is the original secret image holder or the participant; because each participant chooses her/his own secret shadow by her/himself, the new system doesn't need a security channel; Due to the same fact, the secret shadow of each participant can be reused. In addition, the size of each shadow image, same as the Thien-Lin scheme, is smaller than that of the original secret image. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
