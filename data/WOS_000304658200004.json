By formulating the power allocation problem of MISO-OFDM communication systems, the minimum subchannel transmission power is analyzed with power and capacity constraints. Simulation results indicate that there exists a specific minimum subchannel capacity threshold. Moreover, the energy efficiency of MISO-OFDM communication systems starts to increase only when the minimum subchannel capacity exceeds the specific threshold.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficiency Analysis of MISO-OFDM Communication Systems Considering Power and Capacity Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000304658200004"}
