For the 3-D segmentation method, we first employ a morphological recursive erosion operation to reduce the connectivity between the region of interest and its surrounding neighborhood; then we design a hybrid segmentation method to achieve an initial result. The hybrid approach integrates an improved fast marching method and a morphological reconstruction algorithm. Finally, a morphological recursive dilation is employed to recover any lost structure from the first stage of the multistage method. This approach is tested on 12 CT and 3 MRI images of the brain, heart, and kidney, to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of this technique across a variety of imaging modalities and organ systems. In order to validate the multistage segmentation method, a novel radial distance-based validation method is proposed that uses a global accuracy (GA) measure. The GA is calculated based on local radial distance errors (LRDE), where LRDE are calculated on, the radii emitted from points along the skeleton of the object rather than. the centroid, in order to accommodate more complicated organ structures. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multistage segmentation method is fast and accurate, with comparable performance to existing segmentation methods, but with a significantly higher execution speed.", "paper_title": "Novel multistage three-dimensional medical image segmentation: Methodology and validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241124900012"}
