Our attention is focused on the design of full-and reduced-order filters that guarantee the filtering error system to be asymptotically stable with a prescribed H-infinity performance. Sufficient conditions for the obtained filtering error system are proposed by applying an input-output approach and a two-term approximation method, which is employed to approximate the time-varying delay. The corresponding full-and reduced-order filter design is cast into a convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by standard numerical algorithms. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "A Novel Approach to Filter Design for T-S Fuzzy Discrete-Time Systems With Time-Varying Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000311853200010"}
