A desirable segmentation must be both spatially and topologically accurate, as well as robust and computationally efficient. We propose a novel algorithm, LOGISMOS-B, based on probabilistic tissue classification, generalized gradient vector flows and the LOGISMOS graph segmentation framework. Quantitative results on MRI datasets from both healthy subjects and multiple sclerosis patients using a total of 16 800 manually placed landmarks illustrate the excellent performance of our algorithm with respect to spatial accuracy. Remarkably, the average signed error was only 0.084 mm for the white matter and 0.008 mm for the gray matter, even in the presence of multiple sclerosis lesions. Statistical comparison shows that LOGISMOS-B produces a significantly more accurate cortical reconstruction than FreeSurfer, the current state-of-the-art approach (p << 0.001). Furthermore, LOGISMOS-B enjoys a run time that is less than a third of that of FreeSurfer, which is both substantial, considering the latter takes 10 h/subject on average, and a statistically significant speedup.", "paper_title": "LOGISMOS-B: Layered Optimal Graph Image Segmentation of Multiple Objects and Surfaces for the Brain", "paper_id": "WOS:000337125400002"}
