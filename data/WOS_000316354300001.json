In this special issue we present papers that discuss overviews of awareness aspects as well as research challenges for awareness in new settings and conditions. Awareness continues to be a topic of research especially in new (virtual) interaction environments and in various challenging domains in which collaboration is becoming an answer to the increasing complexity of interconnected systems and globalization.", "paper_title": "Differentiated Awareness-Support in Computer Supported Collaborative Work", "paper_id": "WOS:000316354300001"}
