To this end, backward Euler and time-splitting pseudospectral methods are proposed for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with the nonlocal Hartree potential approximated by solving a Poisson equation. The approximation approaches for the Hartree potential include fast convolution algorithms, which are accelerated by using FFT in 1D and fast multipole method (FMM) in 2D and 3D, and sine/Fourier pseudospectral methods. The inconsistency in 0-mode in Fourier pseudospectral approach is pointed out, which results in a significant loss of high-order of accuracy as expected for spectral methods. Numerical comparisons show that in ID the fast convolution and sine pseudospectral approaches are compatible. While, in 3D the fast convolution approach based on FMM is second-order accurate and the Fourier pseudospectral approach is better than it from both efficiency and accuracy point of view. Among all these approaches, the sine pseudospectral one is the best candidate in the numerics of the SPS system. Finally, we apply the backward Euler and time-splitting sine pseudospectral methods to study the ground state and dynamics of 3D SPS system in different setups. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
