Despite the huge processing cost, it has gained tremendous popularity due to the usefulness of association rules. Several efficient algorithms can be found in the literature. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art algorithms for association rule mining, specially when the data sets used for rule mining are not static. Addition of new data to a data set may lead to additional rules or to the modification of existing rules. Finding the association rules from the whole data set may lead to significant waste of time if the process has started from the scratch. Several algorithms have been evolved to attend this important issue of the association rule mining problem. This paper analyzes some of them to tackle the incremental association rule mining problem.
