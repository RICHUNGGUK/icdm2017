As any system of information needs of an authentication mechanism being the most used one those based on password, in this article we propose a set of metric of password management policies based on the most outstanding factors in this authentication mechanism. Together with the metrics, we propose a quality indicator derived from these metrics that allows us to have a global vision of the quality of the password management policy used and a complete example of calculation of the proposed metric. Finally, we will indicate the future works to be performed to check the validity and usefulness of the proposed metrics.", "paper_title": "Metrics of password management policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300106"}
