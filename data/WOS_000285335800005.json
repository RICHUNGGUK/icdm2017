Three hundred images with 0.67- or 5-mm section thickness were compressed to one of five compression ratios ranging from reversible compression to 15:1. The fidelity of each compressed image was measured by five radiologists' visual analyses (distinguishable or indistinguishable from the original) and the three metrics. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients of the PSNR, HDR-VDP, and MS-SSIM values with the number of readers responding as indistinguishable were 0.86, 0.94, and 0.86, respectively. Using the pooled readers' responses as the reference standard, the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for the HDR-VDP (0.99) was significantly greater than that for the PSNR (0.95) (p < 0.001) and for the MS-SSIM (0.96) (p = 0.003), and there was no significant difference between the PSNR and MS-SSIM (p = 0.70). In measuring the image fidelity, the HDR-VDP outperforms the PSNR and MS-SSIM, and the MS-SSIM and PSNR are comparable.", "paper_title": "A Comparison of Three Image Fidelity Metrics of Different Computational Principles for JPEG2000 Compressed Abdomen CT Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000285335800005"}
