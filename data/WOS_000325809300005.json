Given a globally exponentially stable neural network with Markovian switching, the problems to be addressed herein are how much noises or time delays that the neural networks can remain to be globally exponentially stable. We characterize the upper bounds of the time delays or noise intensity for the NNwMS to sustain global exponential stability. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Robustness analysis of global exponential stability of neural networks with Markovian switching in the presence of time-varying delays or noises", "paper_id": "WOS:000325809300005"}
