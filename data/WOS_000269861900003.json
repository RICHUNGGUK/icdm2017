This technique is aimed at the searching of optimum values of two complex factors depending on accuracy and convergence of a network, and also on the time of its training. Their conventional names are \"cross-validation coefficient\" and \"training iteration coefficient\". Near infrared spectroscopy data for gasoline samples are used to evaluate the efficiency of the method.", "paper_title": "Universal technique for optimization of neural network training parameters: gasoline near infrared data example", "paper_id": "WOS:000269861900003"}
