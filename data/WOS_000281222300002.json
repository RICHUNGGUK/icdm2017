Due to the separability property of the multi-dimensional HWT, the proposed architecture has been implemented using a cascade of three N-point one dimensional (1D) HWT and two transpose memories for a 3D volume of N x N x N suitable for real-time 3D medical imaging applications. These applications require continuous hardware servicing, hence DPR has been introduced. Two architectures were synthesised using VHDL and implemented on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs. Experimental results and comparisons between different configurations using partial and non-partial reconfiguration processes and a detailed performance analysis of the area, power consumption and maximum frequency are analysed in this paper.
