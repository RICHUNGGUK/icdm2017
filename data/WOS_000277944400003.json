Both methods are implemented in the framework of the mode space methodology where the electron confinements below the gates are pre-calculated to produce subbands along the vertical direction of the device while the transport along the horizontal channel direction is described by either approach. Each approach handles the open quantum system along the transport direction in a different manner. The NEGF treats the open boundaries with boundary self-energy defined by a Dirichlet to Neumann mapping, which ensures non-reflection at the device boundaries for electron waves leaving the quantum device active region. On the other hand, the Wigner equation method imposes an inflow boundary treatment for the Wigner distribution, which in contrast ensures non-reflection at the boundaries for free electron waves entering the device active region. In both cases the space-charge effect is accounted for by a self-consistent coupling with a Poisson equation. Our goals are to study how the device boundaries are treated in both transport models affects the current calculations, and to investigate the performance of both approaches in modeling the DG-MOSFET. Numerical results show mostly consistent quantum transport characteristics of the DG-MOSFET using both methods, though with higher transport current for the Wigner equation method, and also provide the current-voltage (I-V) curve dependence on various physical parameters such as the gate voltage and the oxide thickness.
