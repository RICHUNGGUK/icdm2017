However, N-P hard problems such as Job Shop Scheduling (JSSP) are difficult for most heuristic algorithms to solve. In this paper, two effective strategies are proposed to enhance the searching ability of the PSO. An alternate topology is introduced to gather better information from the neighborhood of an individual. Benchmarks of JSSP are used to test the approaches. The experiment results indicate that the improved Particle Swarm has a good performance with a faster searching speed in the search space of JSSP.", "paper_title": "PSO with improved strategy and topology for job shop scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100019"}
