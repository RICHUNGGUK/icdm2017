We apply phase resetting theory to two types of cross-frequency coupling that can occur when a slower oscillator periodically forces one or more oscillators: phase-phase coupling, in which the two oscillations are phase-locked, and phase-amplitude coupling, in which the amplitude of the driven oscillation is modulated. Our first result is that the shape of the phase resetting curve predicts the tightness of locking to a pulsatile forcing periodic input at any ratio of forced to intrinsic period; the tightness of the locking decreases as the ratio increases. Theoretical expressions were obtained for the probability density of the phases for a population of heterogeneous oscillators or a noisy single oscillator. Results were confirmed using two types of simulated networks and experiments on hippocampal CA1 neurons. Theoretical expressions were also obtained and confirmed for the probability density of N spike times within a single cycle of low frequency forcing. The second result is a suggested mechanism for phase-amplitude coupling in which progressive desynchronization leads to decreasing amplitude during a low frequency forcing cycle. Network simulations confirmed the theoretical viability of this mechanism, and that it generalizes to more diffuse input.", "paper_title": "Effect of Heterogeneity and Noise on Cross Frequency Phase-Phase and Phase-Amplitude Coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000332117500004"}
