The advantages of this approach are evident in any experimental field, including the area of Natural Language Processing. An outlook on state-of-the-art language technologies for Italian can be obtained by reflecting on the results of the recently held workshop \"Evaluation of NLP and Speech Tools for Italian\", EVALITA 2014. The motivations underlying individual shared tasks, the level of knowledge and development achieved within each of them, the impact on applications, society and economy at large as well as directions for future research will be discussed from this perspective.", "paper_title": "State of the Art Language Technologies for Italian: The EVALITA 2014 Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000358145300005"}
