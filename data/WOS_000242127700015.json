The method works by decomposing the system of constraints into finitely many explicit solution representations in terms of parameters with radicals using triangular decomposition and real quantifier elimination. For any given values of the parameters, if they verify some set of computed relations, the values of the dependent variables may be easily computed by direct evaluation of the corresponding explicit expressions. The effectiveness of our method and its experimental implementation is illustrated by some examples of diagram generation.", "paper_title": "Solving dynamic geometric constraints involving inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000242127700015"}
