Research and educational networks typically are state-of-the-art networks that facilitate such high-speed user-created network connections, possibly spanning multiple domains. However, there are many different high-speed optical data plane standards and implementations, and vendors do not always create compatible data plane implementations. These technology incompatibilities may prevent direct communication between domains and therefore complicate the configuration of connections. However, some domains may have adaptation capabilities that can lift the technology incompatibility constraint in establishing paths between incompatible domains. Within this context, we address two problems, namely: (1) how to model the technology incompatibilities of multi-domain multi-layer networks, and (2) how to optimally establish paths in such networks. We introduce the inclusion of the information of the supported technologies and adaptation capabilities of each domain and inter-domain link in our model. We subsequently propose technology-aware routing algorithms for finding the shortest feasible path in a multi-domain multi-layer network. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
