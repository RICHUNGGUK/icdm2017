In general, the sequence rearranged by one operation can be arbitrarily long and consist of many coding and non-coding blocks. We consider in this paper some simpler variants of the three operations, where only one coding block is rearranged at a time. We characterize in this paper the gene patterns that can be assembled through these variants. Our characterization is in terms of signed permutations and dependency graphs. Interestingly, we show that simple assemblies possess rather involved properties: a gene pattern may have both successful and unsuccessful assemblies and also more than one successful assembling strategy.", "paper_title": "Simple operations for gene assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093800008"}
