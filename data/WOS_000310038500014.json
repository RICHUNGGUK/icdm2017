Based on the common base domains, a bijective mapping between given models can be established. Experimental results show that the distortion in a cross-parameterization generated on our common base domains is much smaller than that of a mapping on domains constructed by prior methods. Different from prior algorithms that generate domains by a heuristic of having higher priority to link the shortest paths between anchor points, we compute the surface Voronoi diagram of anchor points to find out the initial connectivity for the base domains. The final common base domains can be efficiently generated from the initial connectivity. The Voronoi diagram of the anchor points gives better cues than the heuristic of connecting shortest paths greedily. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
