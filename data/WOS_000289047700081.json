As CBR systems become more frequently deployed in real-world situations and as large-scale case-bases become more commonly used in practice, the development and maintenance of the case-base becomes critical to CBR practitioners. In reality, adding cases to a case-base and updating cases in a case-base can be troublesome and time-consuming processes. It has become increasingly important for CBR practitioners to be able to implement an efficient way to develop and maintain the case base. However, techniques for case-base development and maintenance (such as adding cases and updating cases) have not received enough attention and are often neglected by CBR researchers. This paper discusses Wikis and XML (specifically, the Office Open XML format) and proposes an integrated approach to facilitate case-base development and maintenance in adding cases and in updating cases.
