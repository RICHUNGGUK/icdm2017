The problem takes into consideration the production time windows and capacities. We formulate the integrated problem as a linear mixed-integer program with a minimized total cost. A particle swarm optimization-based approach is developed to address the problem. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms a commercial optimization package. Some managerial insights are also explored and reported. Finally, concluding remarks and future research directions are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
