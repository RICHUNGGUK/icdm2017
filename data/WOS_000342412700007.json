We first give a categorized overview on the mainstream methodologies of crowd simulation. Then, we describe our recent research advances on crowd evacuation, pedestrian crowds, crowd formation, traffic simulation, and swarm simulation. Finally, we offer our viewpoints on open crowd simulation research challenges and point out potential future directions in this field.", "paper_title": "Crowd Simulation and Its Applications: Recent Advances", "paper_id": "WOS:000342412700007"}
