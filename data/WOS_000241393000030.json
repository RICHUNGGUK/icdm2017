We consider the question of how to compactly represent such concurrent state machines. To achieve compactness, we consider data structures for Approximate Concurrent State Machines (ACSMs) that can return false positives, false negatives, or a \"don't know\" response. We describe three techniques based on Bloom filters and hashing, and evaluate them using both theoretical analysis and simulation. Our analysis leads us to an extremely efficient hashing-based scheme with several parameters that can be chosen to trade off space, computation, and the impact of errors. Our hashing approach also yields a simple alternative structure with the same functionality as a counting Bloom filter that uses much less space. We show how ACSMs can be used for video congestion control. Using an ACSM, a router can implement sophisticated Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques for video traffic (without the need for standards changes to mark packets or change video formats), with a factor of four reduction in memory compared to full-state schemes and with very little error. We also show that ACSMs show promise for real-time detection of P2P traffic.", "paper_title": "Beyond bloom filters: From approximate membership checks to approximate state machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000241393000030"}
