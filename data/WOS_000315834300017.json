The answer appears to be neither straight forward nor unique. Convex hull, which gives a convex enclosure of the given set, concave hull, which generates non-convex polygons and other variants such as a-hull, poly hull, r-shape and s-shape etc. have been proposed. In this paper, we extend the question of finding a minimum area enclosure (MAE) to a set of closed planar freeform curves, not resorting to sampling them. An algorithm to compute MAE has also been presented. The curves are represented as NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines). We also extend the notion of a-hull of a point set to the set of closed curves and explore the relation between alpha hull (using negative alpha) and the MAE. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
