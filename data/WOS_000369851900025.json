Because sleep environments are various, and sensitivity to noise differs individually, it is difficult for current sleep-promoting systems to provide an adoptable solution. This paper develops a non-invasive sleep monitoring system with adaptive sleep-promoting sound according to sleep environments and sleep habits. For people who fall asleep in a quiet environment, a constant sound playing probably affects their sleep. The proposal is designed to distinguish the noise disturbances, and a sleep-promoting sound is triggered automatically. A device with multiple sensors: an infrared depth sensor, a RGB camera, and a four-microphone array, is used to detect sleep disturbances. When a noise is detected, an ambient sound is playing to cover the noise automatically. Besides, it also applies to people who are used to sleep with sound by providing additional sound playing from the beginning of their sleep. Moreover, from the input of depth signals and color images, the scores are calculated from the sleep information, and are record for sleep quality evaluation. An overnight experiment was carried out, and the results show the efficiency of the proposed system in diverse sleep environments. The adaptable method is feasible for individuals, and it is also convenient and cost-effective to be used in home context.", "paper_title": "A Sleep Monitoring System with Sleep-Promoting Functions in Noise Detection and Sound Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000369851900025"}
