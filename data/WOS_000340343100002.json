This chapter is a survey on ZKPs including their background, important concepts, applications for NP problems, and composition operations of ZKPs. The remarkable property of being both convincing and yielding nothing except that the assertion is indeed valid makes ZKPs very powerful tools for the design of secure cryptographic protocols. In this chapter, ZKPs are constructed for the exact cover and 0-1 simple knapsack problem.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Zero-Knowledge Proofs", "paper_id": "WOS:000340343100002"}
