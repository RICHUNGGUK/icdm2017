It builds upon the method introduced by Kropinski in 2001 [17], but improves on it by adding an interpolatory quadrature approach for handling near-singular integrals. Such integrals typically arise when drop boundaries come close to one another, and are difficult to compute accurately using standard quadrature rules. Adapting the interpolatory quadrature method introduced by Helsing and Ojala in 2008 [11] to the current application, very general drop configurations can be handled while still maintaining stability and high accuracy. The performance of the new method is demonstrated by some challenging numerical examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
