This algorithm is an improved version of the method originally proposed by Wang, Tsang, and Marsaglia (2003) based on a result from Durbin (1973). The new algorithm keeps the same numerical precision of the Wang et al. (2003) method, but is more efficient: it features linear instead of quadratic space complexity and has better time complexity for a common range of input parameters of practical importance. The proposed method is implemented in the R package kolmim, which also includes an improved routine to perform one-sample two-sided exact Kolmogorv-Smirnov tests.", "paper_title": "An Improved Evaluation of Kolmogorov's Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000365975800001"}
