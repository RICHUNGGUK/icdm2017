Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of finding the best-known solutions for 21 large random instances with 3000 to 7000 variables and boosts the performance of the basic TS in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency.", "paper_title": "Backbone guided tabu search for solving the UBQP problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000322137500010"}
