The crucible is a water-filled glass beaker. Water is used as the test fluid because of ease of experimentation, as well as the availability of correct thermo-physical properties. In addition, the Prandtl number of water matches those of molten oxides. A copper cylinder whose diameter is smaller than that of the beaker is placed centrally at the water surface. Convection patterns are set up by applying constant temperature difference between the crucible wall and the cylinder surface, in the temperature range of the liquid crystals. The cylinder is given a fixed rotation, thus creating mixed convection conditions in the test fluid. The LCT images recorded in the present study clearly reveal convective rolls, and the interaction of buoyancy-driven convection in the crucible with cylinder rotation. The resulting temperature distributions match numerical simulation quite well. The pure buoyancy and pure rotation experiments result in axisymmetric temperature fields, while in mixed convection, the field is unsteady and three dimensional.", "paper_title": "Experimental study of convection in a model Czochralski crucible using liquid crystal thermography", "paper_id": "WOS:000234554800019"}
