However, its performance is often influenced by some factors such as the initial location, illumination and so on, which will frequently lead to the local minima in optimization. Fully using the local information of each landmark we propose an improved method of ASM, in which we extend traditional local texture model to be three sub models by adding another two local models, combining with two models we construct a more robust model of ASM. Experiments show that the improved method solves the local minima problem efficiently and demonstrates the better accuracy performance and wider region in searching the target face image.", "paper_title": "Face alignment using an improved active shape model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300102"}
