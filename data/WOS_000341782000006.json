Design/methodology/approach - Based on the valid responses collected from a survey questionnaire, structural equation modeling (SEM) technology was employed to examine the research model. Findings - The results indicated that performance expectancy, trust in mobile payment and flow affect continuance usage. Among them, flow has a relatively larger effect. In addition, system quality has strong effects on performance expectancy and flow. Research limitations/implications - This research is conducted in China, where mobile internet is still in its early stage. Thus, the results need to be generalized to other countries that have developed mobile internet. Originality/value - Extant research has mainly focussed on the effects of instrumental beliefs such as perceived usefulness on mobile payment user behavior, and has seldom considered the effect of flow experience. This research tries to fill the gap.", "paper_title": "Understanding the determinants of mobile payment continuance usage", "paper_id": "WOS:000341782000006"}
