Traditional network component architecture model focuses on business logic, and takes little consideration for security problems. This paper proposes Secure Network Component Architecture Model (SNCAM). It classifies clients according to their credibility levels on component-side. Next, it presents the main idea of this paper, which is the security domain. To reduce the overhead introduced by the security mechanism, a method called security agent is also proposed.", "paper_title": "Security and performance in Network Component Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200167"}
