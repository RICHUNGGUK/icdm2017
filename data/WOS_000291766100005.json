In this paper, according to the characteristics of MPEG4/H.264 encoding methods, we propose a simple and low-complexity XOR-based FEC frame loss recovery scheme. Within an entire Group of Pictures (GOP), the proposed scheme shows the ability to recover simultaneously l-frame loss and one P-frame loss. The high frame loss resilience improves the playback QoS of compressed video streaming. The mathematical analysis reveals that the proposed scheme has 72.7% performance improvement than no frame loss protection in term of full GOP frames successful decoding rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
