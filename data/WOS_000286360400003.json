The proposed pipeline transforms a set of images taken by a single hand-held camera to a set of stabilized and rectified images augmented by the computed camera 3D trajectory and a reconstruction of feature points facilitating visual object recognition. The paper generalizes previous works on camera trajectory estimation done on perspective images to omnidirectional images and introduces a new technique for omnidirectional image rectification that is suited for recognizing people and cars in images. The performance of the pipeline is demonstrated on real image sequences acquired in urban as well as natural environments.", "paper_title": "Omnidirectional Image Stabilization for Visual Object Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000286360400003"}
