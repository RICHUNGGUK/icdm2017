This improves the long-standing result of Alt and Godau by an O(log(nm)) factor. Our solution is based on constructing a simple data structure which we call free-space map. Using this data structure, we obtain improved algorithms for several variants of the Fr,chet distance problem, including the Fr,chet distance between two closed curves, and the so-called minimum/maximum walk problems. We also improve the map matching algorithm of Alt et al. for the particular case in which the map is a directed acyclic graph.", "paper_title": "Improved Algorithms for Partial Curve Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000335752000008"}
