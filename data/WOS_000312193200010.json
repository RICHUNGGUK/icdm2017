In particular, we focus on three kinds of scenes: (1) two coplanar circles with the same radius; (2) a single circle with its discriminable center; (3) a single circle with geometric constraints for camera calibration. For two circles' situation, we first estimate the focal length based on the equality of the sizes of two coplanar circles, and then estimate the normal vector of the world circle plane. Inconsistencies in the angles among the normal vectors (Each circle determines a normal vector) are used as evidence of tampering. On the other hand, for the single circle case, we warp the circle to make metric measurement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we present results for synthetic and visually plausible composite images.", "paper_title": "Photographic composite detection using circles", "paper_id": "WOS:000312193200010"}
