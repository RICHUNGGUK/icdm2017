The condition that such a quaternion field gives rise to a conformal deformation is non-linear and in any case only admits Mobius transformations as solutions. We propose a particular decoupling of scaling and rotation which allows us to find near to conformal deformations as minimizers of a quadratic, convex Dirichlet energy. Applied to tetrahedral meshes we find deformations with low quasicon-formal distortion as the principal eigenvector of a (quaternionic) Laplace matrix. The resulting algorithms can be implemented with highly optimized standard linear algebra libraries and yield deformations comparable in quality to far more expensive approaches.", "paper_title": "Close-to-Conformal Deformations of Volumes", "paper_id": "WOS:000358786600022"}
