Hardware power measurement solutions can be very expensive, hence the appeal of software-based estimation methods. In this paper we present a practical approach to power consumption estimation of both individual application executions and whole computing nodes. We compare it to existing state-of-the-art solutions, provide accuracy figures, and discuss possible deployment scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
