In this paper, we propose a time synchronization framework for clustered, multi-hop sensor networks. We assume that relative node synchronization is sufficient, that is, consensus on one time value is not required. Our goal is to divide the network into connected synchronization regions (nodes within two-hops) and perform inter-regional synchronization in O(LLSync) x N-iter time, where O(LLSync) denotes the complexity of the underlying low-level synchronization technique (used for single-hop synchronization), and N-iter denotes the number of iterations where the low-level synchronization protocol is invoked. Thus, our main objective is rapid convergence. We propose novel fully distributed protocols, SYNC-IN and SYNC-NET, for regional and network synchronization, respectively, and prove that N-iter is O(1) for all protocols. Our framework does not require any special node capabilities (e.g., being global positioning systems (GPS)-enabled), or the presence of reference nodes in the network. Our framework is also independent of the particular clustering, inter-cluster routing, and low-level synchronization protocols. We formulate a density model for analyzing inter-regional synchronization, and evaluate our protocols via extensive simulations.
