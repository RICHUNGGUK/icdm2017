We introduce the concept of automatic content-based editing of preexisting semantic home video metadata. We propose a formal representation and implementation techniques for reusing and repurposing semantic video metadata in concordance with the actual video editing operations. A novel representation for metadata editing is proposed and an implementation framework for editing the metadata in accordance with the video editing operations is demonstrated. Conflict resolution and regularization operations are defined and implemented in the context of the video metadata editing operations.", "paper_title": "Metadata handling: A video perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000250871400006"}
