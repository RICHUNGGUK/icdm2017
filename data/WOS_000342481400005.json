Researchers seek unified simulation frameworks that can model heterogeneous architectures like CPU and GPU devices and their interactions as computing patterns move toward heterogeneous era. In this paper, we introduce MCMG (Multi-CPU Multi-CPU) simulator, a cycle accurate, modular and open-source toolset that enables simulating x86 CPUs and Nvidia G80 like CPUs simultaneously. Targeting heterogeneous architectural exploration, MCMG supports fully configuration of multiple CPUs, CPUs and their memory sub-system. Not only CPUs, relative running frequency of each CPU can be also defined conveniently. Simulation validation is demonstrated with a preliminary architectural exploration study. Then we present shared LLC access results of heterogeneous cores and show reasonable explanation. Finally, we conclude the job. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
