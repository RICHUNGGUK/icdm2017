We argue that these benefits can be further amplified across the system life-cycle. We present two contributions. First, we describe an approach to complementing existing informal pattern descriptions with precise pattern specifications. Our specification language captures the properties common across all applications of a pattern, while accommodating the variation that occurs across those applications. Second, we describe an approach to monitoring a system's runtime behavior to determine whether the appropriate pattern specifications are respected. The monitoring code is generated automatically from the pattern specifications underlying the system's design. We conclude with a discussion of how our contributions are beneficial across the software lifecycle.", "paper_title": "Amplifying the benefits of design patterns: From specification through implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236901100017"}
