The neural network is derived from an equivalent unconstrained minimization reformulation of the NCP which is based on the generalized Fischer-Burmeister function phi(p)(a, b) = parallel to(a, b)parallel to(p) - (a + b). We establish the existence and the convergence of the trajectory of the neural network, and study its Lyapunov stability, asymptotic stability as well as exponential stability. It was found that a larger p leads to a better convergence rate of the trajectory. Numerical simulations verify the obtained theoretical results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
