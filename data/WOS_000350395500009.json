Among the recommender system techniques, the collaborative filtering mechanism is the most successful; it leverages the similar tastes of similar users, which can serve as references for recommendation. However, a major weakness for the collaborative filtering mechanism is its performance in computing the pairwise similarity of users. Thus, the MapReduce framework was examined as a potential means to address this performance problem. This paper details the development and employment of the MapReduce framework, examining whether it improves the performance of a personal ontology based recommender system in a digital library. The results of this extensive performance study show that the proposed algorithm can scale recommender systems for all-pairs similarity searching.", "paper_title": "Ontology-based library recommender system using MapReduce", "paper_id": "WOS:000350395500009"}
