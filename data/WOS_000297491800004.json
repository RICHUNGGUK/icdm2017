Most of the previous researches on VM live migration were either limited within a LAN or focused on runtime status (memory and disk) transfer of singleVM. Few works have been done to preserve consistent communication status among VMs of Virtual Cluster (VC). In this paper, we are focused on communication status migration and presented a Live-Migration-Enabled Virtual Infrastructure (LimeVI) to support VC live migration over WAN. Firstly, a hybrid virtual network is presented to maintain communication relationships among VMs over WAN. Secondly, a virtual routing mechanism is designed to dynamically manage multiple isolated VCs' topology in runtime. Finally, a novel Adaptive Caching Protocol (ACP) is proposed to solve potential package loss during migration downtime. Analysis and experimental results illustrate that ACP is functional and LimeVI keeps the transparency of VC live migration from user applications.", "paper_title": "LimeVI: a platform for virtual cluster live migration over WAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000297491800004"}
