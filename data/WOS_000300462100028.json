Weak formulation is only created for the stationary residual, and the Runge-Kutta methods are specified via their Butcher's tables. Around 30 Butcher's tables for various Runge-Kutta methods with numerically verified orders of local and global truncation errors are provided. A time-dependent benchmark problem with known exact solution that contains a sharp moving front is introduced, and it is used to compare the quality of seven embedded implicit higher-order Runge-Kutta methods. Numerical experiments also include a comparison of adaptive low-order FEM and hp-FEM with dynamically changing meshes. All numerical results presented in this paper were obtained using the open source library Hermes (http://www.hpfem.org/hermes) and they are reproducible in the Networked Computing Laboratory (NCLab) at http://www.nclab.com.
