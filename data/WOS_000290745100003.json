In this paper, we address the problem of searching for patterns in model maps by putting forward the concept of symbol graph. A symbol graph will be constructed and stored for each model map in the preprocessing. Furthermore, an algorithm for submap isomorphism is presented based on symbol sequence searching in the symbol graphs. The computational complexity of this algorithm is quadratic in the worst case if we neglect the preprocessing step. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
