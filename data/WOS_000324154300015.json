In this paper we introduce so called cyclic fibonacenes and it turns out that their resonance graphs are isomorphic to Lucas cubes (together with two isolated vertices in even case). Further we establish a bijective correspondence between the maximal resonant sets of a cyclic fibonacene and the maximal hypercubes of its resonance graph t.i. Lucas cube, what gives us the insight into the structure of the latter.", "paper_title": "The Structure of Lucas Cubes and Maximal Resonant Sets of Cyclic Fibonacenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324154300015"}
