The entanglement between the nearest-neighbor and the next nearest-neighbor qubits are calculated by making use of concurrence. Our results show that the sudden death effect can be weakened when introducing the anisotropy Delta. In addition, we also find that the anisotropy Delta can protect the entanglement between the nearest-neighbor qubits from being completely destroyed by the intrinsic decoherence, but it cannot do this for the entanglement between the next nearest-neighbor qubits.", "paper_title": "EFFECTS OF ANISOTROPY ON DYNAMICS OF PAIRWISE ENTANGLEMENT IN THE FOUR-QUBIT HEISENBERG XXZ MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000271353300008"}
