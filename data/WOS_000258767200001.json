Like the real-world invisible ink, secret messages will be correctly revealed only after the marked works undergo certain prenegotiated manipulations, such as lossy compression and processing. Different from conventional data-hiding schemes where content processing or compression operations are undesirable, distortions caused by prenegotiated manipulations in DII-based schemes are indispensable steps for revealing genuine secrets' The proposed scheme is carried out based on two important data-hiding schemes: spread-spectrum watermarking and frequency-domain quantization,watermarking. In some application scenarios, the DII-based steganography system can provide plausible deniability and enhance the secrecy by taking cover with other messages. We show that DII-based schemes are indeed superior to existing plausibly deniable steganography approaches in many aspects. Moreover, potential security holes caused by deniable steganography systems are discussed.", "paper_title": "Digital-invisible-ink data hiding based on spread-spectrum and quantization techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000258767200001"}
