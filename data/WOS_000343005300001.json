Metalogical notions like, consistency and inconsistency are proposed as graded notions. The relationship between consequence relation and inconsistency, both fuzzy here, is studied. Another metalogical notion viz., equivalence of two sets of formulae that originates from Tarski is defined and investigated in this context when the premise is a fuzzy set.", "paper_title": "Graded Consequence with Fuzzy Set of Premises", "paper_id": "WOS:000343005300001"}
