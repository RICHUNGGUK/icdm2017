In the process of reconstruction, each shadow image plays an equivalent role. However, a general threshold access structure could have other useful properties for the application. In this paper, we consider the problem of secret shadow images with a hierarchical threshold structure, employing Tassa's hierarchical secret sharing to propose a hierarchical threshold secret image sharing scheme. In our scheme, the shadow images are partitioned into several levels, and the threshold access structure is determined by a sequence of threshold requirements. If and only if the shadow images involved satisfy the threshold requirements, the secret image can be reconstructed without distortion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
