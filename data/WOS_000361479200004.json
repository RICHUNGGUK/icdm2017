Conditions that ensure the stability of the defined recurrent neural network as well as its convergence toward the Drazin inverse are considered. Several illustrative examples present the results of computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Recurrent Neural Network Approach Based on the Integral Representation of the Drazin Inverse", "paper_id": "WOS:000361479200004"}
