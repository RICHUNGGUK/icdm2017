This paper reports our research in recognizing dotted abbreviations with MaxEnt model. The key points in our work include: (1) allowing the model to optimize with as many features as possible to capture the text characteristics of context words, and (2) utilizing simple lexical information such as sentence-initial words and candidate word length for performance enhancement. Experimental results show that this approach achieves impressive performance on the WSJ corpus.", "paper_title": "Abbreviation recognition with MaxEnt model", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700014"}
