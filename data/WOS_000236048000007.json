In this method the equation of motion is expressed in boundary integral form using elastostatic fundamental solutions. In order to transform the domain integral into an equivalent boundary integral, a general radial basis function is used for the derivation of the particular solutions. The dual reciprocity boundary element method is combined with an efficient subregion boundary element method to overcome the difficulty of a singular system of algebraic equations in crack problems. Dynamic stress intensity factors are calculated using the discontinuous quarter-point elements. Several examples are presented to show the formulation details and to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the method. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
