Therefore, it is of great importance to extract information from tables. However, many tables in Web pages are used not to transfer information but to decorate pages. One of the most critical tasks in Web table mining is thus to discriminate meaningful tables from decorative ones. The main obstacle of this task comes from the difficulty of generating relevant features for discrimination. This paper proposes a novel discrimination method using a composite kernel which combines parse tree kernels and a linear kernel. Because a Web table is represented as a parse tree by an HTML parser, it is natural to represent the structural information of a table as a parse tree. In this paper, two types of parse trees are used to represent structural information within and around a table. These two trees define the structure kernel that handles the structural information of tables. The contents of a Web table are manipulated by a linear kernel with content features. Support vector machines with the composite kernel distinguish meaningful tables from decorative ones with high accuracy. A series of experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
