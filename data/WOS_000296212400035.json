A delay-dependent feedback controller is derived to achieve the exponential synchronization based on the drive-response concept, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and Lyapunov functional method. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the derived theoretical results. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.
