The Bayesian approach usually assumes a prior Dirichlet distribution about the probabilities of the different possible values. However, there is no consensus on the parameters of this Dirichlet distribution. Here, it will be shown that this is not a simple problem, providing examples in which different selection criteria are reasonable. To solve it the Imprecise Dirichlet Model (IDM) was introduced. But this model has important drawbacks, as the problems associated to learning from indirect observations. As an alternative approach, the Imprecise Sample Size Dirichlet Model (ISSDM) is introduced and its properties are studied. The prior distribution over the parameters of a multinomial distribution is the basis to learn Bayesian networks using Bayesian scores. Here, we will show that the ISSDM can be used to learn imprecise Bayesian networks, also called credal networks when all the distributions share a common graphical structure. Some experiments are reported on the use of the ISSDM to learn the structure of a graphical model and to build supervised classifiers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
