Preserving the hue of the input image is crucial in a wide range of situations. We propose simple image enhancement algorithms, which conserve the hue and preserve the range (gamut) of the R, G, B channels in an optimal way. In our setup, the intensity input image is transformed into a target intensity image whose histogram matches a specified, well-behaved histogram. We derive a new color assignment methodology where the resulting enhanced image fits the target intensity image. We analyze the obtained algorithms in terms of chromaticity improvement and compare them with the unique and quite popular histogram-based hue and range preserving algorithm of Naik and Murthy. Numerical tests confirm our theoretical results and show that our algorithms perform much better than the Naik-Murthy algorithm. In spite of their simplicity, they compete with well-established alternative methods for images where hue-preservation is desired.", "paper_title": "Fast Hue and Range Preserving Histogram Specification: Theory and New Algorithms for Color Image Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366200007"}
