Thickness of the layers and fiber orientation angles in each finite element are considered as the design variables. It will be shown that the optimum design of composite laminates with varying fiber orientations and layers thicknesses may be found by using these optimality criteria in an efficient way, without performing the sensitivity analysis.", "paper_title": "Design of laminated composite structures for optimum fiber direction and layer thickness, using optimality criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000257332600004"}
