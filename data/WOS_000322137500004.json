In this paper we report on the application of a new Tabu Search algorithm to large scale Max-cut test problems. Our method provides best known solutions for many well-known test problems of size up to 10,000 variables, although it is designed for the general unconstrained quadratic binary program (UBQP), and is not specialized in any way for the Max-Cut problem.", "paper_title": "Solving large scale Max Cut problems via tabu search", "paper_id": "WOS:000322137500004"}
