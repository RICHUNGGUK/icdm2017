Two cases of adaptive metamodeling considering the best output point for optimization and the best fit in a specific output parameter space are considered. Three different metamodels, kriging, radial basis function, and multivariate polynomial, are employed in this study. Various test functions are used to create the sample data and evaluate the quality and efficiency of the adaptive metamodeling methods considering influences of noise and initial size of samples. The results of this research provide guidelines for selecting appropriate adaptive metamodeling methods to solve various engineering problems. Effectiveness of the developed guidelines has been demonstrated through case study applications.", "paper_title": "Comparative study on influencing factors in adaptive metamodeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000356047300013"}
