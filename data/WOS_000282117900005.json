We use a novel global harmony search algorithm (NGHS) to solve this problem, and the NGHS algorithm has demonstrated higher efficiency than the improved harmony search algorithm (IHS) on finding the near optimal task assignment. We also devise a new method called normalized penalty function method to tradeo (R) the costs and the constraints. A large number of experiments show that our algorithm performs well on finding the near optimal task assignment, and it is a viable approach for the task assignment problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
