However, it is difficult to ensure this characteristic if the systems operate with multisource images acquired under different setups. Changes in the illumination and acquisition devices alter the color of images and often reduce the performance of the systems. Thus, it is important to normalize the colors of dermoscopy images before training and testing any system. In this paper, we investigate four color constancy algorithms: Gray World, max-RGB, Shades of Gray, and General Gray World. Our results show that color constancy improves the classification of multisource images, increasing the sensitivity of a bag-of-features system from 71.0% to 79.7% and the specificity from 55.2% to 76% using only 1-D RGB histograms as features.", "paper_title": "Improving Dermoscopy Image Classification Using Color Constancy", "paper_id": "WOS:000356511900042"}
