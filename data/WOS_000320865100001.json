Through employing Lyapunov function method and stochastic bidirected halanay inequality, we constitute exponential stability of the stochastic impulsive high-order BAM neural networks with its estimated exponential convergence rate and feasible interval of impulsive strength. An example illustrates the main results.", "paper_title": "Exponential stability of stochastic high-order BAM neural networks with time delays and impulsive effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000320865100001"}
