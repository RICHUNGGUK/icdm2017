We use Multi-Objective optimization in order to estimate, and subsequently, make an offer for its assignment. The motivation is to provide a generic solution, independent of the domain, with an aim to better utilize resources such as time or energy. The algorithm provides a significant degree of flexibility, and can be implemented in a number of diverse domains, provided the modeling of the parameters follows the convention presented. For this, we take into account - besides the distance traveled - the efficiency of a robot in a specific task type. The system has been shown to demonstrate scalability, as the experimental results indicate. It is also capable of responding to changes in the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
