We believe that it is necessary to provide a viewer with more advanced capabilities than those of regular medical image viewers. In this paper, we propose an architecture that allows the use of contextual information to-assist the healthcare professional in his regular tasks. The proposed architecture for the context is composed of an ontology describing the hospital and an inference engine. The result is a Java-based implementation of the architecture, named Dynamic N-dimensional Image Viewer, (ODIN in Portuguese) that is able to adapt its behavior according to the contextual information.", "paper_title": "A contextual medical image viewer", "paper_id": "WOS:000249309900010"}
