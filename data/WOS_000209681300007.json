In doing so, we use recent bounds on the achievable rate in the finite blocklength regime. We formulate optimization problems for finding the minimum required number of channel uses such that the overall error probability in the decoding of the control information is below a given threshold. Three specific control signaling schemes are compared.", "paper_title": "Optimized Encoding of Scheduling Assignments Using Finite Blocklength Coding Bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300007"}
