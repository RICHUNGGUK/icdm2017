In this paper, we propose an analytical model for estimating the end-to-end delay performance of wireless networks employing a random access policy for managing node' transmissions on shared channels with time-varying capacity. To obtain the closed form expression, a new concept of residual effective capacity is presented using the definitions of effective bandwidth theory and effective capacity theory. This allows us to calculate the cumulative distribution function of the queuing delay. Based on this concept, we derive a formula to calculate the average end-to-end delay for multi-hop wireless networks, with the result including the effect of a random access protocol, which has not previously been considered. Finally, we validate our analysis through simulations and provide an example application for our results.", "paper_title": "End-to-end delay estimation for multi-hop wireless networks with random access policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000339228800012"}
