It generalizes such planes, admitting that some points are missing and then permits to adapt to noisy discrete data. Two recognition algorithms of such primitives are proposed: the first one is a geometrical algorithm and minimizes the Euclidean distance and the second one relies on linear programming and minimizes the vertical distance.", "paper_title": "Recognition of blurred pieces of discrete planes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241649600006"}
