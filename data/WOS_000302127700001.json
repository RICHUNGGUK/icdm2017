In this paper, we propose a combination of an improved clustering algorithm and Directed Diffusion (DD), a well-known data-centric routing paradigm in sensor networks. On one hand, clustering allows to save bandwidth required by rich and intensive data of video applications. On the other hand, the network lifetime is prolonged by implementing an energy-aware load-balancing feature through modifying Passive Clustering (PC) rules for building/maintaining its topology. We performed extensive computer simulations and show in this paper that our solution outperforms original DD as well as when it is combined with PC with energy considerations but without load balancing.", "paper_title": "On the use of passive clustering in wireless video sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000302127700001"}
