For sports video, most previous works detect events by video content itself. Some useful external knowledge has been researched recently. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised approach to extract semantic events from sports webcast text. First, unrelated words in the descriptions of webcast text are filtered out, and then the filtered descriptions are clustered into significant event categories. Finally, the keywords for each event category are extracted. According to our experimental results, the proposed approach actually extracts significant text events, which can be used for further video indexing and summarization. Furthermore, we also provide a hierarchical searching scheme for text event retrieval.", "paper_title": "A novel approach for semantic event extraction from sports webcast text", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387000043"}
