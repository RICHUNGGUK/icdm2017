CBR is a mature subfield of artificial intelligence based on the reuse of previous problem solutions - cases - to solve new ones. However, up until now, it lacked a reference toolkit for developing such systems. jCOLIBRI2 aims to become that toolkit and to foster the collaboration among research groups. This software is the result of the experience collected over several years of framework development and evolution. This experience is explained in the paper, together with a description of the specialized CBR tools that can be implemented with jCOLIBRI: CBR with textual cases, recommenders, knowledge/data intensive applications or distributed architectures.
