In the FLC the extant algorithmic PID controller (PIDC) model, which combines the proportional (P), derivative (D) and integral (1) control elements, is augmented with fuzzy logic for higher control precision. The fuzzy logic divides the PIDC control domain into finer control regions. Every region is then defined either by a fuzzy rule or a 'don't care' state. The GAC combines the PIDC model with the genetic algorithm, which manipulates the parametric values of the PIDC as genes in a chromosome. The FLC and GAC operations are based on the objective function {0,Delta}(2). The principle is that the controller should adaptively maintain the safety margin Delta around the chosen reference point (represent by the '0' of {0, Delta}(2)) at runtime. The preliminary experimental results for the FLC and GAC prototypes indicate that they are both more effective and precise than the PIDC. After repeated timing analyses with the lntel's VTune Performer Analyzer, it was confirmed that the FLC can better support real-time computing than the GAC because of its shorter execution time and faster convergence without any buffer overflow.
