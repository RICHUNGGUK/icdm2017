We introduce observable liveness and show that this new notion generalizes traditional liveness in various ways. In particular, liveness of a 1-bounded Petri net implies observable liveness, provided the only conflicts that can appear are between controllable transitions. This assumption refers to applications where the uncontrollable part models a deterministic machine (or several deterministic machines), whereas the user of the machine is modeled by the controllable part and can behave arbitrarily.", "paper_title": "Observable liveness of Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000351160200004"}
