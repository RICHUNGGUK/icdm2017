The three-dimensional graphical representation also avoids loss of information accompanying alternative 2D and 3D representation in which the curve standing for DNA sequence overlaps and intersects itself, and resolves sequences' degeneracy. The examination of similarities/dissimilarities among the DNA sequences belonging to eleven species illustrates the utility of our approach. The elements of the similarity matrix are used to construct phylogenic tree.", "paper_title": "3D graphical representation of DNA sequence without degeneracy and its applications in constructing phylogenic tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000240967000012"}
