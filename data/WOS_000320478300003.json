However, the coy values of soil parameters are difficult to determine with confidence due to the limited availability of high-quality data and inherent spatial variability. As a result, estimated coy values of soil parameters can vary within a wide range, which can result in overdesign or underdesign. In this paper, a confidence level (CL)-based method is proposed to address the problem of geotechnical design in the face of uncertainty. Here, CL is a measure of confidence that the target reliability index will be satisfied in the face of uncertainty in the estimated coy. The proposed method is demonstrated through the design of a cantilever retaining wall in sand. To ensure the practicality of the proposed method, a simplified approach was developed, which requires little extra effort over that required for traditional reliability-based design. To develop the CL-based method further, a metric called the \"true reliability index\" is proposed, which is the actual reliability index in the face of the uncertainty in the estimated parameter statistics (mainly coy).
