This study is motivated by the need to further clarify the connection between Koopman modes and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) dynamic modes. We apply DMD and POD to derive reduced order models (ROM) of the shallow water equations. Key innovations for the DMD-based ROM introduced in this paper are the use of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse in the DMD computation that produced an accurate result and a novel selection method for the DMD modes and associated amplitudes and Ritz values. A quantitative comparison of the spatial modes computed from the two decompositions is performed, and a rigorous error analysis for the ROM models obtained is presented.
