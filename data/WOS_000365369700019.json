In order to solve the proposed models, some hybrid intelligent algorithms are designed by integrating the network simplex algorithm, fuzzy random simulation, and genetic algorithm. Finally, some numerical examples about a container freight station problem are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the devised algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
