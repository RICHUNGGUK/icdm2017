However, dispatching the jobs in batches can have profound negative effects on important scheduling objective functions such as minimizing maximum tardiness. This paper considers a single machine scheduling problem with the aim of minimizing the maximum tardiness and delivery costs in a single-machine scheduling problem with batched delivery system. A mathematical model is developed for this problem which can serve to solve it with the help of a commercial solver. However, due to the fact that this model happens to be a mixed integer nonlinear programming model the solver cannot guarantee to reach the global solution. For this reason, a branch and bound algorithm (B&B) is presented to obtain the global solution. Besides, a heuristic algorithm for calculation of the initial upper bound is introduced. Computational results show that the algorithm can be beneficial for solving this problem, especially for large size instances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
