First, we construct fuzzy evaluating matrices for decision-makers with respect to the attributes of alternatives. Then, we calculate the weights of the attributes of the alternatives by using the proposed FIOWA operators. Then, we calculate the score (E) over tilde (j) of each alternative x; by using the proposed FIOWA operators, where 1 <= j <= n and the scores of the alternatives are represented by fuzzy sets. Then, we calculate the score S((E) over tilde (i) circle minus (E) over tilde (j)) of the weighted difference of membership values between (E) over tilde (i) and (E) over tilde (j). where 1 <= j <= n. The smaller the value of S((E) over tilde (i) circle minus (E) over tilde (j)), the better the choice of the alternative x(j), where 1 <= j <= n. The proposed method can handle fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making problems in a more flexible manner than Xu's method (2006) due to the fact that it allows the order inducing variables and the argument variables in the OWA pairs to be represented by fuzzy sets.
