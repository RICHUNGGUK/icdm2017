On account of much time consumption of global SVR, local machines are carried out to accelerate the computation. In this paper, we introduce local grey SVR (LG-SVR) integrated grey relational grade with local SVR for financial time series forecasting. Pattern search method and leave-one-out errors are adopted for model selection. Experimental results of three real financial time series prediction demonstrate that LG-SVR can speed up computing speed and improve prediction accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
