The upper level game is a discounted or mean-payoff game and the lower level game is a (undiscounted) reachability game. Two-l evel games model hierarchical and sequential decision making under uncertainty across different time scales. For both discounted and mean-payoff two-level games, we show the existence of pure memoryless optimal strategies for both players and an ordered field property. We show that if there is only one player (Markov decision processes), then the values can be computed in polynomial time. It follows that whether the value of a player is equal to a given rational constant in two-level discounted or mean-payoff games can be decided in NP boolean AND coNP. We also give an alternate strategy improvement algorithm to compute the value.", "paper_title": "DISCOUNTING AND AVERAGING IN GAMES ACROSS TIME SCALES", "paper_id": "WOS:000304003000004"}
