In this paper, we propose a novel depth sensation enhancement method to address the problems in multiple virtual view rendering. First, as the depth sensation is decreased when rendering intermediate multiple virtual views, the basic principle of depth sensation enhancement is derived according to the number of rendering views. Second, with the increase of the scene complexity, it is difficult to ensure the depth sensation of all neighboring objects. The saliency analysis is adopted to give preferred guarantee to the depth sensation between the salient object and its neighbors. Then, the depth sensation enhancement for multiple virtual view rendering is performed based on a defined energy function built by the number of rendering views and the saliency analysis. Finally, considering the temporal consistency between adjacent frames, the depth sensation enhancement is extended to video applications with a newly designed energy function with energy term of temporal consistency preservation. Experimental results on a public database demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain promising performance in depth sensation.", "paper_title": "Depth Sensation Enhancement for Multiple Virtual View Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000351586300001"}
