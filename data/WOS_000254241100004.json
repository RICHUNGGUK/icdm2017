In this contribution, we propose a more general approach in which the needle forces are determined directly from the equations of continuum mechanics using fully non-linear finite element procedures that account for large deformations (geometric non-linearity) and non-linear stress-strain relationship (material non-linearity) of soft tissues. We applied these procedures to model needle insertion into a swine brain using the constitutive properties determined from the experiments on tissue samples obtained from the same brain (i.e. the subject-specific constitutive properties were used). We focused on the insertion phase preceding puncture of the brain meninges and obtained a very accurate prediction of the needle force. This demonstrates the utility of non-linear finite element procedures in patient-specific modelling of needle insertion into soft organs such as, e.g. brain.", "paper_title": "Subject-specific non-linear biomechanical model of needle insertion into brain", "paper_id": "WOS:000254241100004"}
