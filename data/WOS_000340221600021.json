The imprecise and fuzzy information of the MADM problem is expressed by triangular fuzzy number. The Possibility theory is used to handle triangular fuzzy numbers under fuzzy environment. In the extended TOPSIS method, the possibilistic mean value matrix and the possibilistic standard deviation matrix are constructed to compute the integrated relative closeness coefficient of each alternative. According to the integrated relative closeness coefficient, we can rank the preference order of all alternatives and select the most suitable one. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the new proposed TOPSIS method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
