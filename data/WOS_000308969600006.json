The simplest input test signal model for the intersymbol interference analysis of high-speed data links is mathematically formulated. Since input test patterns for eye boundaries are determined analytically, it is considered very convenient and efficient. The proposed technique shows excellent agreement with the SPICE-based simulation in both eye height and jitter, i.e., within 5% error for nondiscontinuous data paths and 10% error for discontinuous data paths. The method is much more computation-time-efficient than the pseudorandom bit sequence-based SPICE simulation in the order of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Analytical Eye-Diagram Determination for the Efficient and Accurate Signal Integrity Verification of Single Interconnect Lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000308969600006"}
