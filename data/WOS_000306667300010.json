Determining the mechanisms that cause ACL injury is important in order to develop proper interventions. A failure locus defined as various combinations of loadings and movements, internal/external rotation of femur and valgus and varus moments at a 25 degrees knee flexion angle leading to ACL failure was obtained. The results indicated that varus and valgus movements were more dominant to the ACL injury than femoral rotation. Also, Von Mises stress in the lateral tibial cartilage during the valgus ACL injury mechanism was 83% greater than that of the medial cartilage during the varus mechanism of ACL injury. The results of this study could be used to develop training programmes focused on the avoidance of the described combination of movements which may lead to ACL injury.", "paper_title": "Failure locus of the anterior cruciate ligament: 3D finite element analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000306667300010"}
