This paper presents the Timed Hybrid Petri net (THPN) as a suitable tool for modelling and scheduling of hybrid systems. One of the major benefits over traditional methods is a significant reduction in complexity during problem formulation. A sugar milling plant containing both batch and continuous processing units is used to illustrate the application of the proposed scheduling algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
