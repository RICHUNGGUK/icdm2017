We validate this hypothesis for several large social, collaboration, rating, citation, and communication networks. Following these observations, we introduce two link prediction algorithms based on the learning of the changes to a network's spectrum. These new link prediction methods generalize several common graph kernels that can be expressed as spectral transformations. The first method is based on reducing the link prediction problem to a one-dimensional curve-fitting problem which can be solved efficiently. The second algorithm extrapolates a network's spectrum to predict links. Both algorithms are evaluated on fifteen network datasets for which edge creation times are known.", "paper_title": "Spectral evolution in dynamic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324652900001"}
