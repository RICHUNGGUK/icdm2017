In this paper we correct the errors of the proof of the paper [8], i.e., we prove that R-1(T) <= 15n+C/56 for all trees of order n >= 103, where C = -1. The structure of the Max Tree - the tree with maximum Randic index R-1, is as it was predicted by Clark and Moon. The Max Tree has only one vertex of the maximum degree and all adjacent vertices are of degree 4. Every vertex of degree 4 has 3 suspended paths of length 2 centered at it.", "paper_title": "More on \"solutions to two unsolved questions on the best upper bound for the Randic index R-1 of trees\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000248284000012"}
