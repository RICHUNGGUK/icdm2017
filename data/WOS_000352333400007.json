User authentication in WSNs is a critical security issue due to their unattended and hostile deployment in the field. In 2010, Yuan et al. proposed the first biometric-based user authentication scheme for WSNs. However, Yoon et al. pointed out that Yuan et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to insider attack, user impersonation attack, GW-node impersonation attack and sensor node impersonate attack. To improve security, Yoon et al. proposed an improved scheme and claimed their scheme could withstand various attacks. Unfortunately, we will show Yoon et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to denial-of-service attack (DoS) and sensor node impersonation attack. To overcome the weaknesses in Yoon et al.'s scheme, we propose a new biometric-based user authentication scheme for WSNs. The analysis shows our scheme is more suitable for practical applications.", "paper_title": "Robust Biometric-Based User Authentication Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352333400007"}
