The results of simulation are consistent with results of measurement for the antenna. The mode of the antenna is vertical and horizontal bidirectional radiations. The gain of antenna is 2.5 dB, and the resonance frequency approximately is 3 GHz. This fabrication can be compatible with antenna integration and CMOS process. The parameters of this antenna are for reference radar antenna system of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), satellite transmission, and communication.", "paper_title": "Design and fabrication of miniature antenna based on silicon substrate for wireless communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000255985100012"}
