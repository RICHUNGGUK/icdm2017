A special case of the embedding problem is that in which G is a balanced binary tree. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for embedding an n-vertex balanced binary tree BHT on a set S of n points inside a simple m-gon P in O(m(4/3+epsilon) + nlog(2) n + m log n) time with at most O(m) bends per edge.", "paper_title": "Constrained Point Set Embedding of a Balanced Binary Tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000354049200002"}
