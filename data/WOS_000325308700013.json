The objective function is minimum total cost, consisting of earliness, tardiness, due-window starting time and due-window size. A recent paper (Janiak et al., 2012) introduced a solution algorithm requiring O (n(5)/m(2)) time, where n is the number of jobs, and m is the number of machines. We propose a significantly faster procedure, requiring O(n(3)) only. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
