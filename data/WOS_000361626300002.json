In this article, we investigate algebraic structures formed by the definable sets and also by the rough sets determined by this pair of approximation operators. The definable sets are open sets of an Alexandrov topological space, and form a completely distributive lattice in which the set of completely join irreducible elements is join dense. The collection of rough sets also forms a similar structure. Representation results for such classes of completely distributive lattices as well as Heyting algebras in terms of definable and rough sets are obtained. Further, two unary operators on rough sets are considered, making the latter constitute a structure that is named a 'rough lattice'. Representation results for rough lattices are proved.", "paper_title": "Algebras of Definable and Rough Sets in Quasi Order-based Approximation Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000361626300002"}
