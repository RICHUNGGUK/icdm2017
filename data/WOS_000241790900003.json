It includes two phases. PE-VM (Li et al., 2004), which is based on NEH, is analyzed and we conclude that its good performance is partially due to the priority rule it used in phase I. Then, we propose a new measure to solve job insertion ties which may arise in phase II. The measure is based on the idea of balancing the utilization among all machines. Finally, we propose a heuristic NEH-D (NEH based on Deviation), which combines the priority rule of PE-VM and the new measure. Computational results show that the measure is effective and NEH-D is better than PE-VM. There is one parameter in NEH-D, and we design an experiment to try to find a near optimized value of it for tuning the performance of NEH-D.", "paper_title": "A more effective constructive algorithm for permutation flowshop problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900003"}
