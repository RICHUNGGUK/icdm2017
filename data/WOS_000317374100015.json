However, most of existing systems lack the ability to process data for real-time anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a 3-Tier Iterative Feature Selection Engine (IFSEng) for feature subspace selection. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is used for the pre-processing of data. Mahalanobis Distance Map (MDM) is used to discover hidden correlations between the features and between the packets. We also propose a novel Real-time Payload-based Intrusion Detection System (RePIDS) that integrates a 3-Tier IFSEng and the MDM approach. Mahalanobis Distance (MD) dissimilarity criterion is used to classify each packet as either a normal or an attack packet. The effectiveness of the proposed RePIDS is evaluated using DARPA 99 dataset and Georgia Institute of Technology attack dataset. The traffic for Web-based application is considered for validating our model. F-value, a criterion, is used to evaluate the detection performance of RePIDS. Experimental results show that RePIDS achieves better performance (high F-values, 0.9958 for DARPA 99 dataset and 0.976 for Georgia Institute of Technology attack dataset respectively, with only 0.85% false alarm rate) and lower computational complexity when compared against two state-of-the-art payload-based intrusion detection systems. Additionally, it has 1.3 time higher throughput in comparison with real scenario of medium sized enterprise network. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
