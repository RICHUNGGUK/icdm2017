Energy consumption is an important factor that influences the lifespan of WSNs. One of the ways to extend the lifespan of WSNs is to design wireless sensor nodes with low power consumption. This involves component selection and the optimisation of hardware architecture, monitoring software system and protocols to satisfy the requirements of the particular applications. This paper proposes a comprehensive model to describe the workflow of a wireless sensor node. Parameter setup and energy consumption calculation are demonstrated through the model simulation. It provides a mathematical approach to dynamically evaluate the energy consumption of a sensor node. This will benefit the development of wireless sensor nodes based on microprocessors with limited computational capability. Therefore, the model can be applied in dynamic power management systems for wireless sensor nodes or in wireless communication protocols with energy awareness, in particular, for WSNs with self-organisation. More importantly, the generalisation of the model may be employed as a standard paradigm for the development of wireless sensor node with energy awareness.
