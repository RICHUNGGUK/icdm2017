So far there has been little work done in this area. In this paper, we propose a novel fast search algorithm. We use global information derived from the relationship between the query fingerprint/digest and the reference fingerprints/digests in the database to guide fast search. This information can provide more accurate and robust clues for the selection of candidate matching database fingerprints. Because the quality of query fingerprints may degrade or vary in realistic applications, the construction of robust search clues is significant. To speed up the search process, we adopt a lookup table that is built on the separate-chaining hash table. The proposed algorithm has been tested using query images from real-world photos. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can well adapt to query fingerprints with different quality. It can achieve higher detection rates with lower computational cost than the traditional brute-force search algorithm and a pioneering fast search algorithm in literature.", "paper_title": "Fast source camera identification using matching signs between query and reference fingerprints", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200001"}
