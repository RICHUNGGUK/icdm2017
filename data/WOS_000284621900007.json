In this paper we explain the new techniques of analysis and briefly review some of the applications that have been made relevant to the field of drug design and chemical toxicity measures specifically in relation to DNA and RNA sequences. The review concludes with some remarks on the future directions that could be taken in development and applications of this nascent technique.", "paper_title": "New Approaches to Drug-DNA Interactions Based on Graphical Representation and Numerical Characterization of DNA Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000284621900007"}
