These ad hoc solutions are expensive and preclude widespread applications because they often address specific issues. This paper addresses some of these issues by proposing a business-to-business (b2b) electronic trading framework known as virtual electronic trading (VET). Design/methodology/approach - With personal computers and the internet, it is now possible to realize a generic electronic infrastructure for virtual trading. A modular approach has been adopted in the development of VET to ensure a high degree of flexibility, scalability, maintainability and upgradeability. Overall, the design goal is to make sure that the system performs effectively and reliably. Findings - A survey of existing b2b electronic trading systems has been conducted. Key attributes of these systems and areas of improvements are highlighted. These form the basis of VET. Research limitations/implications - The VET framework forms the basis for further research. Two examples are highlighted, namely: application of intelligent agents to perform the of market-maker task; and development into a mobile commerce system when mobile technology and infrastructure can support such services. Practical implications - An important contribution of our work is that the VET system provides a generic framework for a variety of business models and practices. Owing to the modular design, it can be easily customized to suit different (specialized) trading communities. Originality/value - It is a systematic approach in developing a b2b e-trading system that addresses users' needs by applying the most up-to-date computing and internetworking technology.", "paper_title": "A virtual electronic trading system for business-to-business e-commerce", "paper_id": "WOS:000238997900023"}
