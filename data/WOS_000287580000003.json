Most existing schemes require the tracked persons to be labeled with RFID tags. This requirement may not be satisfied for some activity sensing applications due to privacy and security concerns and uncertainty of objects to be monitored, e. g., group behavior monitoring in warehouses with privacy limitations, and abnormal customers in banks. In this paper, we propose TASA-Tag-free Activity Sensing using RFID tag Arrays for location sensing and frequent route detection. TASA relaxes the monitored objects from attaching RFID tags, online recovers and checks frequent trajectories by capturing the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) series for passive RFID tag arrays where objects traverse. In order to improve the accuracy for estimated trajectories and accelerate location sensing, TASA introduces reference tags with known positions. With the readings from reference tags, TASA can locate objects more accurately. Extensive experiment shows that TASA is an effective approach for certain activity sensing applications.", "paper_title": "TASA: Tag-Free Activity Sensing Using RFID Tag Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000287580000003"}
