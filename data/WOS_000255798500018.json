We present a framework, based on Pepper's root-metaphors (Formism, Contextualism, Mechanism, Organicism, and Animism/Mysticism) and we illustrate the use of the framework by looking at a common example of ICT: e-mail. It is argued that such a framework is potentially helpful to ICT teachers, especially when they work with pre-service education students who are struggling with how to integrate ICT critically into their future classrooms.
