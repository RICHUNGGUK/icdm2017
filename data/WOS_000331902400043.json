Using the techniques of the Malliavin calculus, we study the existence of this object and its properties. We then propose a continuous time model for financial modeling that captures the main properties observed in the empirical data, including the leverage effect. We illustrate our result by numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Multifractal Random Walks With Fractional Brownian Motion via Malliavin Calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000331902400043"}
