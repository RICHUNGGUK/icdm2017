The fabrication of electrophoretic display (EPD) was indicated as the key factor in future development of flexible display. Further, the critical technologies were obtained from cluster analysis, and the density index (DI) value of each cluster identified the invention of key materials for electro-optic display as the most important subject, especially in flexible EPD. Finally, recent journal publications and website reports using display key materials as electrophoretic ink could prove that development of EPD device was most important and close to marketing trend. The procedure of this patent network analysis presents significant insights quickly in the field of flexible display fabrication. This fruitful methodology is capable of supporting technological trends effectively for the researchers who are interested in scientific field. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
