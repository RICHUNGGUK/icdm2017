We first present a general algorithm for computing all the lambda-combinations of a given string, since they serve as candidates for both lambda-covers and lambda-seeds. The running time of this algorithm is O(n(2)). Relying on this result, we answer the above mentioned three problems all in O(n(2)) time.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for computing the lambda-regularities in strings", "paper_id": "WOS:000257115400004"}
