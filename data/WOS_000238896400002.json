Let V. be a set of n points in the unit disk selected uniformly and independently at random. Define G(lambda, n) to be the graph with vertex set V-n in which two vertices are adjacent if and only if their Euclidean distance is at most;L We call this graph a unit disk random graph. Let lambda = c root 1n n/n and let X be the number of isolated points in G(lambda, n). We prove that almost always X similar to n(1-c2) when 0 <= c < 1. It is known that if lambda = root(1n n + phi(n))/n where phi (n) -> infinity, then G(lambda,n) is connected. By extending a method of Penrose, we show that under the same condition on., there exists a constant K such that the diameter of G(lambda, n) is bounded above by K (.) 2/X. Furthermore, with a new geometric construction, we show that when lambda = c root In n/n and c > 2.26164 (...), the diameter of G(lambda, n) is bounded by (4 + o(1))/lambda; and we modify this construction to yield a function c(delta) > 0 such that the diameter is at most 2(1+delta+o(1))/lambda when c > c(delta).
