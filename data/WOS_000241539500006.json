Children's information seeking activities was captured by using HyperCam software. Children's success was assessed based on a measure the researchers developed. Children's perceptions of and affective experience in using the ICDL was gathered through group interviews. Findings revealed that children's information seeking behavior was characterized by browsing using a single function; that is, looking under \"Arabic\" from the Simple interface pull-down menu. Children were more successful on the fully self-generated, open-ended task than on the assigned and semi-assigned tasks. Children made suggestions for improving the Arabic collection and the design of the ICDL. The findings have implications for practitioners, researchers, and system designers. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
