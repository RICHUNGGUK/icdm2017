We employ network to quantify the defects of metal loss in outer pipe spool according to the w(m) l(m) and h(m) of MFL (magnetic flux leakage), which are the width, length and depth of the area of abnormal magnetic data. After quantifying, we obtain w, l and d, which are deemed to the width, length and depth of the defect. The data to train our networks are developed from MFL data which are picked by Pipe Pig moving in service pipe with a constant velocity parallel to pipe axis.", "paper_title": "Application of neural network in metal loss evaluation for gas conducting pipelines", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300183"}
