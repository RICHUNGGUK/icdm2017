This article develops a detailed non-linear and small-signal dynamic model of a microgrid that includes photovoltaic (PV), wind and conventional small-scale generation along with their power electronics interfaces and the filters. The role of the extent of generation mix of the distributed generators (DGs) for satisfactory operation of the system has been investigated through small-signal dynamic model. It was observed that there exist critical values of PV and wind power above which the microgrid performance degrades. The enhancement of performance of the microgrid through various control inputs have been evaluated through decomposition techniques. Simulation studies showed that an energy storage system-based central supervisory controller and also control of PV system can improve transient performance when violations of proper generation mix of the DGs occur.", "paper_title": "Evaluation and enhancement of dynamic performance of a microgrid including PV and wind generation systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317658200001"}
