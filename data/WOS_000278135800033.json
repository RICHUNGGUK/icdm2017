The key issue is how to assign correct enhancement levels for the local regions in an image, which makes previous methods incur much artifacts, e.g., over-enhancement, halo. In this paper, an example-based contrast enhancement algorithm is proposed, which works in the gradient domain. We utilize GMM model to describe the gradient distribution of an image. Then a GMM-based gradient mapping method is proposed to transfer the gradient of a reference image to the source image. The enhanced image is obtained by solving a Poisson equation defined by the altered gradient. Experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our method.", "paper_title": "Example-based contrast enhancement by gradient mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800033"}
