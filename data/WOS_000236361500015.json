The RBFNN uses a single neuron architecture whose input is proportional to the difference in error and the updating of its parameters is carried via a proportional value of the error. Also, the coefficients of the difference of error, error, and auxiliary signal used for improving damping performance are depicted by a genetic algorithm. The performance of the newly designed controller is evaluated in a four-machine power system subjected to different types of disturbances. The newly designed single-neuron RBFNN-based UPFC exhibits better damping performance compared to the conventional PIID as well as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) updating-based RBFNN scheme, making the unstable cases stable. Its simple architecture reduces the computational burden, thereby making it attractive for real-time implementation. Also, all the machines are being equipped with the conventional power system stabilizer (PSS) to study the coordinated effect of UPFC and PSS in the system.", "paper_title": "Neural-network-based adaptive UPFC for improving transient stability performance of power system", "paper_id": "WOS:000236361500015"}
