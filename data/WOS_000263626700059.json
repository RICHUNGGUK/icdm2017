The performance of these classifiers depends on the induction algorithms being used. In order to benefit from multiple different classifiers, and exploit their strengths we suggest using an ensemble method that will combine the results of the individual classifiers into one final result to achieve overall higher detection accuracy. In this paper we evaluate several combining methods using five different base inducers (C4.5 Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, VFI and OneR) on five malware datasets. The main goal is to find the best combining method for the task of detecting malicious riles in terms of accuracy, AUC and Execution time. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
