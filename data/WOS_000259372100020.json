Excellent despeckling in conjunction with feature preservation is achieved by incorporating a discontinuity-adaptive Markov random field prior within the unscented Kalman filter framework through importance sampling. The performance of this method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real examples.", "paper_title": "A recursive filter for despeckling SAR images", "paper_id": "WOS:000259372100020"}
