In this paper, we consider the impact of multiple proactive actions on proactive fault tolerance and periodic checkpointing. We extended Aupy's model in the presence of multiple proactive actions, including proactive checkpointing and task migration. We then propose optimal strategies for deciding when to trust predictions, and provide algorithms for the optimal storage interval for periodic checkpointing. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve system productivity. Our case study indicates that the recall of the predictor is more important for small platforms, and that precision becomes increasingly important as the scale of the system increases.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the fault-tolerance overheads of HPC systems using prediction and multiple proactive actions", "paper_id": "WOS:000361531500002"}
