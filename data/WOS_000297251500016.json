The criterion to be optimised is the long-run expected average cost, and several kinds of constraints are imposed on some associated costs. The existence of a constrained optimal policy is ensured under suitable conditions by using a martingale technique and introducing an occupation measure. Furthermore, for the unichain model, we transform this multiconstrained problem into an equivalent linear programming problem, then construct a constrained optimal policy from an optimal solution to the linear programming. Finally, we use an example of a controlled queueing system to illustrate an application of our results.", "paper_title": "Denumerable continuous-time Markov decision processes with multiconstraints on average costs", "paper_id": "WOS:000297251500016"}
