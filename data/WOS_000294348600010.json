A key step in this characterization is an open problem that any solution to BAR does not change sign.

They are semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions and piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.", "paper_title": "Nonnegativity of solutions to the basic adjoint relationship for some diffusion processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000294348600010"}
