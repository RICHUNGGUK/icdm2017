A Fourier-Chebyshev Petrov-Galerkin spectral method is described for the computation of the linear stability equations based on half a Gauss-Lobatto mesh. Complex basis functions presented here are exponentially mapped as Chebyshev functions, which satisfy the pole condition exactly at the origin, and can be used to expand vector functions efficiently by using the solenoidal condition. The mathematical formulation is presented in detail focusing on the solenoidal vector field used for the approximation of the flow. The scheme provides spectral accuracy in the present cases and the numerical results are in agreement with former works.
