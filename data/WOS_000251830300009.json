The study incorporates quantitative bibliometric methods of analysis and social network analysis in combination with a qualitative case study research approach. Conclusions drawn from the results emphasise, firstly, the importance of distinguishing between early and later phases of the evolution of a novel research field, and secondly, the application of a systemic view on learning processes and knowledge diffusion in a science-based technology field.", "paper_title": "Knowledge network hubs and measures of research impact, science structure, and publication output in nanostructured solar cell research", "paper_id": "WOS:000251830300009"}
