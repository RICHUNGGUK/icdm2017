Design/methodology/approach - The paper undertakes a critical literature review and a methodical evaluation of current knowledge on topics related directly and indirectly to EDM and systems theory. Findings - Findings suggest that the organizations that manage employee diversity effectively may gain a competitive advantage. An important outcome of a good EDM is increased innovativeness of employees. Effective EDM depends on system's thinking essentially. Hence, the dialectical system approach to EDM is very suitable as it supports interdisciplinary cooperation very well. Our new combination of the dialectical system's approach with De Bono's six thinking hats contributes to the effectiveness of the EDM, cases say. Practical implications - The application of the dialectical system's approach to the EDM as well as the combination of this approach with De Bono's six thinking hats result in greater effectiveness of EDM and hence, in increased competitive advantage of the organization. Originality/value - Application of the dialectical systems theory to EDM results in new support to effective EDM's and to its theoretical essence from the viewpoint of company efficiency.", "paper_title": "The systemic approach to the encouragement of innovativeness through employee diversity management", "paper_id": "WOS:000246779000013"}
