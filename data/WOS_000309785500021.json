The asymptotics of the Least Squares Dummy Variable (LSDV) and of the Pooled-OLS (POLS) estimators for the slope parameter are studied under various circumstances (serial correlation, strong cross-sectional dependence in the errors and in the regressors and mixed stationary/nonstationary errors) and a modified estimator of the asymptotic variance is derived. The asymptotic variance is computed up to a simple transformation of the residual and no nuisance parameters need to be estimated. The resulting t-statistics are shown to have a standard normal limiting distribution. Asymptotic tests based on the standardized version of the t-statistic are shown to have good power properties, and the correct size, even for n as small as 25. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
