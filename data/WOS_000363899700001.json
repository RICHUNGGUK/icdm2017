It offers a more expansive discussion of the use of behavior analysis for interactive systems that involve creativity, either for the producer or the consumer of such a system. We first summarise the two articles that appear in this second part of the special issue. We then discuss general questions and challenges in this domain that were suggested by the entire set of seven articles of the special issue and by the comments of the reviewers of these articles.", "paper_title": "Behavior Understanding for Arts and Entertainment", "paper_id": "WOS:000363899700001"}
