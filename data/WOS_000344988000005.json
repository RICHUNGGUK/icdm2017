In this paper the problem of scenes with repeated structures is addressed, dealing with the common case where the overlap between the images consists mainly of facades of a building. These facades may contain many repeated structures that can not be matched locally, causing state-of-the-art algorithms to fail. Assuming that the repeated structures lie on a planar surface in an ordered fashion the goal is to match them. Our algorithm first rectifies the images such that the facade is fronto-parallel. It then clusters similar features in each of the two images and matches the clusters. From them a set of hypothesized homographies of the facade is generated, using local groups of features. For each homography the epipole is recovered, yielding a fundamental matrix. For the best solution, it then decides whether the fundamental matrix has been recovered reliably and, if not, returns only the homography. The algorithm has been tested on a large number of challenging image pairs of buildings from the benchmark ZuBuD database, outperforming several state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Epipolar Geometry Estimation for Urban Scenes with Repetitive Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000344988000005"}
