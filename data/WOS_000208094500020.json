In our approach two transfer matrices need to be introduced, each of which is the transpose of the other. Some numerical results obtained by using Matlab are tabulated, which suggest the statement that the generalized Aztec diamonds and a type of related graphs have equal entropy constant. Then we prove the statement.", "paper_title": "Merrifield-Simmons index of generalized Aztec diamonds and related graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000208094500020"}
