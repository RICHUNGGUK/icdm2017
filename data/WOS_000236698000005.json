It is shown that N-k,N-n is asymptotically normal if ENk,n -> infinity and asymptotically Poisson distributed if ENk,n -> C > 0. If ENk,n -> 0, then the distribution degenerates. The same holds for rooted, unlabeled trees and forests. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "Nodes of large degree in random trees and forests", "paper_id": "WOS:000236698000005"}
