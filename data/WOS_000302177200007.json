Nonetheless, non-passive models may result from passive underlying structures due to numerical or measurement error/inaccuracy. A postprocessing passivity enforcement algorithm is therefore desirable to perturb the model to be passive under a controlled error. However, previous literature only reports such passivity enforcement algorithms for pole-residue models and regular systems (RSs). In this paper, passivity enforcement algorithms for descriptor systems (DSs, a superset of RSs) with possibly singular direct term (specifically, D+D-T or I-DDT) are proposed. The proposed algorithms cover all kinds of state-space models (RSs or DSs, with direct terms being singular or nonsingular, in the immittance or scattering representation) and thus have a much wider application scope than existing algorithms. The passivity enforcement is reduced to two standard optimization problems that can be solved efficiently. The objective functions in both optimization problems are the error functions, hence perturbed models with adequate accuracy can be obtained. Numerical examples then verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Passivity Enforcement for Descriptor Systems Via Matrix Pencil Perturbation", "paper_id": "WOS:000302177200007"}
