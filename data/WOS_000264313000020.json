Peyravian-Jeffries's scheme suffers from an active off-line password-guessing attack U. Munilla, A. Peinado, Off-line password-guessing attack to Peyravian-Jeffries's remote user authentication protocol, Computer Communications 30 (1) (2006) 52-54], and Holbl et al. state that their improved protocol overcomes this weakness. However, we show in this paper that although this proposed protocol prevents this active attack, it remains vulnerable to a passive (simpler) off-line password-guessing attack. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
