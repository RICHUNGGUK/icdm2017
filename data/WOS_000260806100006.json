Based on the robust L-2 gain (i. e. robust H-infinity performance) analysis of the SNNM with external disturbances, a state-feedback control law is designed for the SNNM to stabilize the closed-loop system and eliminate the effect of external disturbances. The control design constraints are shown to be a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved by various convex optimization algorithms (e. g. interiorpoint algorithms) to determine the control law. Most discrete-time recurrent neural network (RNNs) and discrete-time nonlinear systems modelled by neural networks or Takagi and Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models can be transformed into the SNNMs to be robust H-infinity performance analyzed or robust H-infinity controller synthesized in a unified SNNM's framework. Finally, some examples are presented to illustrate the wide application of the SNNMs to the nonlinear systems, and the proposed approach is compared with related methods reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "AN LMI APPROACH TO DESIGN H-infinity CONTROLLERS FOR DISCRETE-TIME NONLINEAR SYSTEMS BASED ON UNIFIED MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260806100006"}
