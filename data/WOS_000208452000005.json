It extracts principles of nature and uses them as an inspirational metaphor to propose novel solutions to different daunting scientific problems. Mimicking some rules of the 'game of life' has led to powerful optimum seeking algorithms. This paper attempts to develop a novel bio-inspired optimisation approach. It shows that predator-prey interaction can be inspired to develop an interesting optimum seeking algorithm that acts as a solver for a linear programming problem.", "paper_title": "Predator-prey system: an optimiser that solves a linear programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000208452000005"}
