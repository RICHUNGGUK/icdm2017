The primitive, called SWAPSTACK, can be used by any language implementation based on LLVM to build higher-level language structures such as continuations, coroutines, and lightweight threads. As part of adding the primitives to LLVM, we have also added compiler support for passing parameters across context switches. Our modified LLVM compiler produces highly efficient code through a combination of exposing the context switching code to existing compiler optimizations, and adding novel compiler optimizations to further reduce the cost of context switches. To demonstrate the generality and efficiency of our primitives, we add one-shot continuations to C++, and provide a simple fiber library that allows millions of fibers to run on multiple cores, with a work-stealing scheduler and fast inter-fiber sychronization. We argue that compiler-supported lightweight context switching can be significantly faster than using a library to switch between contexts, and provide experimental evidence to support the position.", "paper_title": "Compiler Support for Lightweight Context Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000313911800013"}
