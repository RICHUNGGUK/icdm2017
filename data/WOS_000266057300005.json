By standardization both, the attributes and the metrics, the description of software makes useful in its life cycle processes. Some of the proposed attributes and their metrics have been in use for decades, some are under development and some are proposed in this article for the first time. However. the proposed system is unique and it classifies attributes into four groups according to their properties: 1) task system; 2) software, hardware and data surrounding; 3) time limits and 4) history of execution. Which of the attribute groups and which individual attribute within a group we need to consider depend on the nature of the software and related demands. The attribute framework should be tailored to the needs of any software project. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
