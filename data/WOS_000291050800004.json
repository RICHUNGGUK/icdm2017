This requires both new theories and engineering practices that model cyber and physical resources in a unified framework, a challenge that few current approaches are able to tackle. The solution must break the boundary between the cyber world and the physical world by providing a unified infrastructure that permits integrated models addressing issues from both worlds simultaneously. This paper proposes a framework to integrate WoT and CPS. A case study is presented to demonstrate the advantage of the framework.
