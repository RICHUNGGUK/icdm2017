The tests utilize an integrated distance involving the empirical characteristic function (or the empirical Laplace transform) computed from properly standardized observations. A bootstrap version of the tests serves the purpose of studying the small sample behaviour of the proclaimed procedures in comparison with more classical approaches. Finally, all tests are applied to some financial data sets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
