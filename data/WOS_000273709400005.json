In the classification of cancer type research, available training datasets generally have a fairly small sample size compared to the number of genes involved. This fact poses an unprecedented challenge to some classification methodologies due to training data limitations. Therefore, a good selection method for genes relevant for sample classification is needed to improve the predictive accuracy, and to avoid incomprehensibility due to the large number of genes investigated. In this article, we propose to combine tabu search (TS) and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) for feature selection. BPSO acts as a local optimizer each time the TS has been run for a single generation. The K-nearest neighbor method with leave-one-out cross-validation and support vector machine with one-versus-rest serve as evaluators of the TS and BPSO. The proposed method is applied and compared to the 11 classification problems taken from the literature. Experimental results show that our method simplifies features effectively and either obtains higher classification accuracy or uses fewer features compared to other feature selection methods.", "paper_title": "Tabu Search and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization for Feature Selection Using Microarray Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000273709400005"}
