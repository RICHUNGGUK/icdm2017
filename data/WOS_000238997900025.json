Design/methodology/approach - An axiomatic approach is used for the measurement of information content of a given grey number. Findings - A new definition for information content of grey numbers is introduced. And, relevant results are proven. Originality/value - This work fills the vacancy on how to measure the information value contained in a grey number.", "paper_title": "On measures of information content of grey numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000238997900025"}
