A bond graph model to enable testing the PV system performance by computer simulation was developed. The PV-powered water pumping system investigated in this paper consists mainly of a PV generator, DC-DC and DC-AC converters, and induction motor-pump. The DC-DC converter control strategy is based oil pulse width modulation (PWM). However, the oriented field control is used for the induction machine control. Computer simulations were carried out for maximum power point tracking (MPPT). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
