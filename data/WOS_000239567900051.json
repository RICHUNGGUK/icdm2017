Fast and stable algorithms are proposed to efficiently implement a progressive version of the modified RBF Shepard's method. Comparisons with several well-known methods are presented, showing that the proposed algorithms can achieve good balance between geometric error reduction and time efficiency.", "paper_title": "An efficient implementation of RBF-based progressive point-sampled geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900051"}
