Weighted sets comprising three weights, namely 0, 1, and 0.5 have been successfully utilized so far for test pattern generation, since they result in both low testing time and low consumed power. In this paper an accumulator-based 3-weight test pattern generation scheme is presented; the proposed scheme generates set of patterns with weights 0, 0.5, and I. Since accumulators are commonly found in current VLSI chips, this scheme can be efficiently utilized to drive down the hardware of BIST pattern generation, as well. Comparisons with previously presented schemes indicate that the proposed scheme compares favorably with respect to the required hardware.", "paper_title": "Accumulator Based 3-Weight Pattern Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000299718000014"}
