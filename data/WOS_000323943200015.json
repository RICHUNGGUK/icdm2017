However, solving two everyday data analysis problems still requires expert judgment: (i) the detection of unknown molecules and (ii) the testing for presence of known molecules. Results: We developed a measure of spatial chaos of a molecular image corresponding to a mass-to-charge value, which is a proxy for the molecular presence, and developed methods solving considered problems. The statistical evaluation was performed on a dataset from a rat brain section with test sets of molecular images selected by an expert. The measure of spatial chaos has shown high agreement with expert judges. The method for detection of unknown molecules allowed us to find structured molecular images corresponding to spectral peaks of any low intensity. The test for presence applied to a list of endogenous peptides ranked them according to the proposed measure of their presence in the sample.", "paper_title": "Testing for presence of known and unknown molecules in imaging mass spectrometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000323943200015"}
