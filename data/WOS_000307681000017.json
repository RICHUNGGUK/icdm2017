The device includes a transducer for measuring the tractor front end reaction, an amplifier to amplify the transducer signal and a microcontroller to calculate and display the weight retained on the front axle. The developed device can be mounted on any 2WD tractor. The digital display unit was tested in the laboratory as well as in the field. A maximum of +3.74% variation in dynamic front wheel reaction was observed between the theoretically calculated and experimentally observed values under field conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
