This paper presents an idea for a base station to reliably and securely broadcast announcing messages to the network in an intrusion-tolerant way. Our Intrusion-Tolerant Broadcast Protocol based on Mutual Verification scheme guarantees that no forged information can be propagated to the network if an intruder is assumed to not compromise the base station. We show that our proposed protocol successfully runs and also demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol by introducing a theorem and the proof of the theorem.", "paper_title": "ITB: Intrusion-tolerant broadcast protocol in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300052"}
