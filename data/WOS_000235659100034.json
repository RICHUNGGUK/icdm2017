Better Solutions of this problem not only can prolong the lifetime of WSNs, but also can support more complex protocols to improve the network performance. We propose an approach of inductive charging, by using mobile nodes to deliver power to deployed active sensors. Infrequently visited by mobile nodes, the sensors can perpetually work without any human intervention. In order to power a WSN of a large number of sensor nodes in wide geographical range effectively, we propose three schemes for inductive charging. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms.", "paper_title": "Inductive charging with multiple charger nodes in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100034"}
