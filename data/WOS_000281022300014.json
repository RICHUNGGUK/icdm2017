Herein we report 3D-QSAR studies of 41 small molecule inhibitors based on the use of molecular interaction fields and docking experiments as part of an approach to generating predictive models of MDM2 affinity and shedding further light on the structural elements of the ligand-target interaction. These studies have yielded predictive models explaining much of the variance of the 41 compound training set and satisfactorily predicting with 75% success an external test set of 36 compounds. Not surprisingly, and in full agreement with previous data, inspection of the 3D-QSAR coefficients reveals that the major driving force for potent inhibition is given by the hydrophobic interaction between the inhibitors and the p53 binding cleft of MDM2. More surprisingly, and challenging previous suggestions, the projection of the 3D-QSAR coefficients back onto the experimental structures of MDM2 provides an intriguing hypothesis concerning an active role played by the N-terminal region of MDM2 in ligand binding.", "paper_title": "Molecular Interaction Fields and 3D-QSAR Studies of p53-MDM2 Inhibitors Suggest Additional Features of Ligand-Target Interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000281022300014"}
