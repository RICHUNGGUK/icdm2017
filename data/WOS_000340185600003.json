Complex discrete event simulations are often computationally intensive with long completion times. This paper describes our solution to the problem of orchestrating the execution of a stochastic, discrete event simulation where computational hot spots evolve spatially over time. Our performance benchmarks report on our ability to balance computational loads in these settings.
