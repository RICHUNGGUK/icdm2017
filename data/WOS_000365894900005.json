The focus of this study is a comprehensive examination of the process by which privacy assurance mechanisms influence trust and the moderating role of privacy concern in this process. We use the lens of the Elaboration Likelihood Model to investigate the way different individuals perceive and process privacy assurance mechanisms. We argue that the trust-enhancing role of these mechanisms depends on the individual's privacy concern. The results of this study articulate the process by which various privacy assurance mechanisms operate in enhancing an individual's trust, and show that there are distinct behavioral differences between individuals with high-vs low-privacy concern when forming their trust to disclose private information. The paper sheds new light on the role of elaboration in the trust building process, and shows why privacy assurance mechanisms have different impacts depending on individuals' privacy concerns.", "paper_title": "The role of privacy assurance mechanisms in building trust and the moderating role of privacy concern", "paper_id": "WOS:000365894900005"}
