Applications in these areas typically have stringent requirements for performance and scalability. To guarantee adequate quality-of-service, systems must be subjected to a rigorous performance and scalability analysis before they are put into production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive modeling methodology for message-oriented event-driven systems in the context of a case study of a representative application in the supply chain management domain. The methodology, which is based on queueing Petri nets, provides a basis for performance analysis and capacity planning. We study a deployment of the SPECjms2007 standard benchmark on a leading commercial middleware platform. A detailed system model is built in a step-by-step fashion and then used to predict the system performance under various workload and configuration scenarios. After the case study, we present a set of generic performance modeling patterns that can be used as building blocks when modeling message-oriented event-driven systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality and accuracy of the proposed modeling and prediction approach.", "paper_title": "Performance modeling and analysis of message-oriented event-driven systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326095600005"}
