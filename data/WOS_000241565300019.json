The schemes are tested on problems of the propagation of a initially discontinuous wave and of the transport of a sharp scalar cone. A benchmark problem of aeroacoustics is solved with the present scheme, giving satisfactory resolution. The scheme compares well with the existing schemes for the range of properties considered desirable in high resolution schemes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
