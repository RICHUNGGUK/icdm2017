A new procedure for structural vibration (or eigenproblem) reanalysis is developed based on iteration and inverse iteration method with frequency-shift and linear combination acceleration to reduce the high computational cost of structure reanalysis. With a suitable frequency-shift factor, the Frequency-Shift Combined Approximations (FSCA) method allows to calculate higher modes accurately. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. Excellent results can be obtained in cases where large modifications are made and higher modes are needed.", "paper_title": "Vibration reanalysis using frequency-shift combined approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000292884200006"}
