In this paper, we develop a distributed lighting system based on WSANs. Our design focuses on meeting users' preferences while reducing the total energy consumption. Sensor nodes are involved in detecting the presence of person and measuring the illuminance, while actuator nodes make decisions and then perform appropriate actions upon the environment. To accomplish effective sensing and acting tasks, a distributed control and estimate algorithm is proposed in this paper. Our solution incorporates PID neural network (PIDNN) with Kalman filter (KF). It schedules the corresponding nodes based on the characteristics of the current events, and utilizes a PIDNN controller inside each actuator node to improve the transient and steady-state responses of WSANs, and deals with the state-space estimation problem according to the KF algorithm. Experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness of our design.", "paper_title": "Distributed Lighting System Based on Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324972600003"}
