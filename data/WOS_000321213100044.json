Most prior SCV detection schemes have used data races as proxies for SCVs, which is highly imprecise. Other schemes that have targeted data-race cycles are either too conservative or are designed only for two-processor cycles and snoopy-based systems. This paper presents Volition, the first hardware scheme that detects SCVs in a relaxed-consistency machine precisely, in a scalable manner, and for an arbitrary number of processors in the cycle. Volition leverages cache coherence protocol transactions to dynamically detect cycles in memory-access orders across threads. When a cycle is about to occur, an exception is triggered. Volition can be used in both directory-and snoopy-based coherence protocols. Our simulations of Volition in a 64-processor multicore with directory-based coherence running SPLASH-2 and Parsec programs shows that Volition induces negligible traffic and execution overhead. In addition, it can detect SCVs with several processors. Volition is suitable for on-the-fly use.", "paper_title": "Volition: Scalable and Precise Sequential Consistency Violation Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000321213100044"}
