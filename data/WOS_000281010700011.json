Unfortunately, while the number of mobile devices implicated in crime activities is relevant and growing, the capability to perform the forensic analysis of such devices is limited both by technological and methodological problems. In this paper, we focus on Anti-Forensic techniques applied to mobile devices, presenting some fully automated instances of such techniques to Android devices. Furthermore, we tested the effectiveness of such techniques versus both the cursory examination of the device and some acquisition tools. (C) 2010 Digital Forensic Research Workshop.
