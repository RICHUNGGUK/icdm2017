Omnidirectional wheels are used in Omniclimbers in order to increase the robot's maneuverability on the structures. This paper studies application of omnidirectional wheels in climbing robots and associated problems such as vibrations. Such vibrations are more problematic on climbing robots than terrestrial robots. In this study we evaluated the design parameters of the wheels, in order to reduce such vibrations, increase the wheels traction and reduce their mass. As a result of this study a novel magnetic omnidirectional wheel was designed and developed. This wheel was integrated into the omniclimber and tested. Results of the study and tests are presented.
