This paper provides a convergence analysis of Canonical Correlation Analysis by defining a pattern function that captures the degree to which the features from the two views are similar. We analyse the convergence using Rademacher complexity, hence deriving the error bound for new data. The analysis provides further justification for the regularisation of kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis and is corroborated by experiments on real world data.", "paper_title": "Convergence analysis of kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis: theory and practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000262125400002"}
