Social networking services (SNS) allow users to gather together as an \"online community\", with connections to current personal relationships, such as friends/family, or to meet other people on the basis for friendship, activities, professional networking, or romance. SNS has incorporated a wide range of various applications. Prior studies on information systems adoption demonstrated users' motivation using perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. Intrinsic-extrinsic motivation frame was adopted to explain motivation of using SNS. This research aims to explore factors of users' motivation using SNS via qualitative methods. A research model was developed to examine the relationship between motivation, emotional response, and intention to use. Quantitative analysis, such as reliability and confirmatory factor analysis, correlation matrix of the constructs, and PLS structural analysis were used.", "paper_title": "SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE: MOTIVATION, PLEASURE, AND BEHAVIORAL INTENTION TO USE", "paper_id": "WOS:000294037500010"}
