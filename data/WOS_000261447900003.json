This paper develops an accurate and efficient thermal-via allocation considering the temporally and spatially variant thermal-power. The transient temperature is calculated by macromodel with a one-time structured and parameterized model reduction, which also generates temperature sensitivity with respect to thermal-via density. The proposed thermal-via allocation minimizes the time-integral of temperature violation, and is solved by a sequential quadratic programming algorithm with use of sensitivities from the macromodel. Compared to the existing method using the steady-state thermal analysis, our method in experiments is 126 x faster to obtain temperature, and reduces the number of thermal vias by 2.04 x under the same temperature bound.", "paper_title": "Thermal Via Allocation for 3-D ICs Considering Temporally and Spatially Variant Thermal Power", "paper_id": "WOS:000261447900003"}
