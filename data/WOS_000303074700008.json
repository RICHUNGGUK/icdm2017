However, currently available multi-cores are not feasible to be used in safety-critical environments with hard real-time constraints. Hard real-time tasks running on different cores must be executed in isolation or their interferences must be time-bounded. Thus, new requirements also arise for a real-time operating system (RTOS), in particular if the parallel execution of hard real-time applications should be supported. In this paper we focus on the MERASA(1) system software as an RTOS developed on top of the MERASA multi-core processor. The MERASA system software fulfils the requirements for time-bounded execution of parallel hard real-time tasks. In particular we focus on thread control with synchronization mechanisms, memory management and resource management requirements. Our evaluations show that all system software functions are time-bounded by a worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis.", "paper_title": "RTOS support for execution of parallelized hard real-time tasks on the MERASA multi-core processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000303074700008"}
