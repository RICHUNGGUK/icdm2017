In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive measurement study on Kankan, one of the leading VoD streaming service providers in China that is based on a hybrid CDN-P2P architecture. Our measurements are multi-fold, as follows. 1) Kankan adopts a loosely-coupled hybrid architecture, in which the user requests are handled by its CDN and P2P network independently. 2) Kankan deploys a small-scale CDN densely in three geographic clusters in China. It adopts specific redirection servers to dispatch the nationwide requests. 3) Kankan adopts a dual-server mechanism to enhance start-up video streaming. It also provides the CDN acceleration in case of inefficient P2P streaming performance. 4) According to our studies on the peer cache lists, the video contents stored in Kankan peers update quite slowly. The average lifetime of cached videos is longer than one week. Our results show that, by utilizing the slow-varying contents cached in peers and deploying various CDN enhancement mechanisms, Kankan provides a large-scale VoD streaming service with a small-scale fixed infrastructure. Insights obtained in this study will be valuable for the development and deployment of future hybrid CDN-P2P VoD streaming systems.", "paper_title": "Unreeling Xunlei Kankan: Understanding Hybrid CDN-P2P Video-on-Demand Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000348210500007"}
