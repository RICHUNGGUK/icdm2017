The talk will describe this new view on computing and the benefits driving users to adopt it. The changing roles for hardware and operating systems will be discussed along with what changes will be needed to efficiently and simply support this new computing model. I will conclude with a discussion of areas where industry could use input from the ASPLOS research community.", "paper_title": "Impact of virtualization on computer architecture and operating systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000202972600001"}
