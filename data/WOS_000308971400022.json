The model employs the finite volume concept and discretizes the primitive equations using the modified leapfrog scheme and fourth-order spatial approximation. The pressure Poisson equation is efficiently solved by the error vector propagation (EVP) method. Adaptive grid-coupling technique is further adopted to provide the required resolution for the targeted region without excessive computation. Besides, a user-friendly interface is introduced to simplify user customization. Two practical applications, global and dual-grid North Pacific Ocean modeling frameworks which are used to simulate the global and regional ocean-climate variability, clearly show the robustness, efficiency, and accuracy of the TIMCOM software.
