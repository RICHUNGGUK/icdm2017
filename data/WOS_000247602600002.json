It comprises variables, functions, constraints, and rules associated in a DNA shape allowing the construction of Decisional DNA. However, when having various dissimilar Sets of Experience as output of the same formal decision event, a negotiation and unification process has to be performed in order to generate a holistic Set of Experience. The purpose of this article is to show such processes and produce one holistic Set of Experience, making it an even more useful technology within many different intelligent systems and platforms.", "paper_title": "Dissimilar sets of experience knowledge structure: A negotiation process for decisional DNA", "paper_id": "WOS:000247602600002"}
