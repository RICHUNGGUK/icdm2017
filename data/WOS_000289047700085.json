A conventional monochrome laser printer serves as the platform for verification of the proposed optimal design approach. Besides performance, we incorporate two other practical indices, i.e., cost and energy consumption, into design objectives and formulate a multi-objective optimization problem. A fuzzy inference system is established to provide the nonlinear or linguistic mapping between the decision variables and the design objectives. For comparative purpose, the problem is solved using both single-objective and multi-objective optimization algorithms. Note that the proposed approach is also applicable to other complex systems.
