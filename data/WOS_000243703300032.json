Among the known sequences, cyclotomic families have the optimal auto-correlation property. In this paper, we decide the cross-correlation function of the known cyclotomic sequences completely. Moreover, to get our results, the relations between the multiplier group and the decimations of the characteristic sequence are also established for an arbitrary difference set.", "paper_title": "Cross-correlation properties of cyclotomic sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703300032"}
