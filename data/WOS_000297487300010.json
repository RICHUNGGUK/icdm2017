The empirical results from our Fourier unit test indicate that the null hypothesis of J(1) unit root in stock prices can be rejected for Canada, France, Italy and the UK. However, the empirical results from the rank test reveal that rational bubbles did not exist in the G-7 stock markets during the sample period. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
