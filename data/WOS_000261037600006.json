The hybrid evolutionary algorithm simultaneously uses simplex crossover and two mutation operators to generate the offspring population. Additionally, the adaptive constraint-handling technique consists of three main situations. In detail, at each situation, one constraint-handling mechanism is designed based on current population state. Experiments on 13 benchmark test functions and four well-known constrained design problems verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results show that integrating the hybrid evolutionary algorithm with the adaptive constraint-handling technique is beneficial, and the proposed method achieves competitive performance with respect to some other state-of-the-art approaches in constrained evolutionary optimization.", "paper_title": "Constrained optimization based on hybrid evolutionary algorithm and adaptive constraint-handling technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000261037600006"}
