The moisture and heat transfer is assumed to be governed by a coupled problem, while the mechanical behaviour accounting for slip between layers is described by strain-based beam finite elements. Hence the fire analysis is perfomed in two separate steps, of which the moisture and heat transfer analysis is performed first, followed by the mechanical analysis. The present novel finite-element formulation proves to be appropriate for the thermo-mechanical analysis of frame-like structures, as it is robust, reliable and accurate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
