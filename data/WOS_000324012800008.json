A novel simulation model for IoT is proposed. The effects of various terrains, node's mobility and traffic loads are investigated in this study. Many comprehensive studies are shown by comparing the simulations results from the packet delivery ratio, network goodput, average end-to-end delay and energy consumption metrics in different operation modes and traffic loads.
