A modified path-based gradient projection (GP) method combined with a column generation is suggested for solving the equivalent excess-demand reformulation of the problem in which the elastic demand problem is reformulated as a fixed demand problem through an appropriate modification of network representation. Numerical results using a set of real transportation networks are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the modified GP algorithm for solving the excess-demand formulation of the EDTAP. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the effects of the scaling parameter used in the elastic demand function on the estimated total demand, number of generated paths, number of used paths, and computational efforts of the modified GP algorithm.
