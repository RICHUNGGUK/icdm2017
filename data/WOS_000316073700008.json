In order to explain this performance, we develop a general framework for the application of smoothed analysis to partitioning algorithms for Euclidean optimization problems. Our framework can be used to analyze both the running-time and the approximation ratio of such algorithms. We apply our framework to obtain smoothed analyses of Dyer and Frieze's partitioning algorithm for Euclidean matching, Karp's partitioning scheme for the TSP, a heuristic for Steiner trees, and a heuristic for degree-bounded minimum-length spanning trees.", "paper_title": "Smoothed Analysis of Partitioning Algorithms for Euclidean Functionals", "paper_id": "WOS:000316073700008"}
