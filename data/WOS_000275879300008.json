Using one single model is limited to single binding modes, while the combination of several models bears a broader application scope. We demonstrate the generation of a complete and predictive 3D model set for cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitors, along with a selection and validation protocol optimized for parallel virtual screening. This model set was applied to explain the cyclooxygenase activity of an ethnopharmacologically known mixture of natural products, the Thai traditional medicine \"Prasaplai\". Results show that rationalizing natural product activity by modern in-silico approaches is promising and can be tremendously useful in the identification of the mechanisms of action for known biological effects of complex herbal remedies.", "paper_title": "Predicting Cyclooxygenase Inhibition by Three-Dimensional Pharmacophoric Profiling.
