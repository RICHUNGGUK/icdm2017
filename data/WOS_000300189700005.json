In this paper, we provide a new image resizing approach for efficiently determining the non-homogeneous warp that better preserves the global image configuration and concentrates the distortion in regions of the image where they are least-likely to be noticed. Considering the different properties of large displays and small displays, we design different strategies for upsizing and downsizing. We define a variety of quadratic metrics to measure image distortion. We introduce a patch-linking scheme that can better preserve the global image configuration. We formulate image resizing as a quadratic minimization problem, which can be efficiently solved. We experiment with our method on a variety category of images and compare our results to the state of the art.", "paper_title": "Image resizing via non-homogeneous warping", "paper_id": "WOS:000300189700005"}
