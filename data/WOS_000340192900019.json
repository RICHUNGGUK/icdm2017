Distributed iterative learning protocols are presented, which adopt the terminal laws to update the control input and are offline feedforward design approaches. It is shown that iterative learning protocols can guarantee all agents in a directed graph to reach the finite-time consensus. Furthermore, the multi-agent systems can be enabled to achieve a finite-time consensus at any desired terminal state/output if iterative learning protocols can be improved by introducing the desired terminal state/output to a portion of agents. Simulation results show that iterative learning protocols can effectively accomplish finite-time consensus objectives for both first-order and higher order multi-agent systems.", "paper_title": "Finite-time consensus protocols for networks of dynamic agents by terminal iterative learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000340192900019"}
