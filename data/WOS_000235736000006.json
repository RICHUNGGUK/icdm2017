The Kansei testbed at the Ohio State University features a heterogeneous hardware infrastructure, with dedicated node resources for local computation, storage, data retrieval, and back-channel communication. Kansei includes a time-accurate hybrid simulation engine that uses testbed hardware resources to simulate large arrays. It supports high-fidelity sensor data generation as well as real-time data and event injection. The testbed also includes software components and an associated job-control language for complex multi-tier experiments.", "paper_title": "Kansei: A high-fidelity sensing testbed", "paper_id": "WOS:000235736000006"}
