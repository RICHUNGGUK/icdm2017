New promising application fields such as the Semantic Web and Semantic Web Services are leveraging the potential of deploying those services, but face the problem of discovering and invoking them in a simple way for common users. GGODO is an experimental solution that combines natural language analysis and semantically-empowered techniques to let users express their goals in a guided way, which produces better results than previous non guided tools.", "paper_title": "Enabling Intelligent Service Discovery with GGODO", "paper_id": "WOS:000280434700001"}
