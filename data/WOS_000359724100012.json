This SPGSA algorithm utilizes the strength Pareto concept to assign the fitness values for agents and uses a fine-grained elitism selection mechanism to keep the population diversity. Furthermore, the recombination operators are modeled in this approach to decrease the possibility of trapping in local optima. Experiments are conducted on a series of benchmark problems that are characterized by difficulties in local optimality, non-uniformity, and nonconvexity. The results show that the proposed SPGSA algorithm performs better in comparison with other related works. On the other hand, the effectiveness of two subtle means added to the GSA are verified, i.e. the fine-grained elitism selection and the use of SBX and PMO operators. Simulation results show that these measures not only improve the convergence ability of original GSA, but also preserve the population diversity adequately, which enables the SPGSA algorithm to have an excellent ability that keeps a desirable balance between the exploitation and exploration so as to accelerate the convergence speed to the true Pareto-optimal front.", "paper_title": "A Strength Pareto Gravitational Search Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359724100012"}
