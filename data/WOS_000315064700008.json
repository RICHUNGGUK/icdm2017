In this study, the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters and their effects on slope stability prediction are evaluated, within the Bayesian framework, using the field measured temporal pore-water pressure data. The probabilistic back analysis and parameter uncertainty estimation is conducted using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. A case study of a natural terrain site is presented to illustrate the proposed method. The 95% total uncertainty bounds for the calibration period are relatively narrow, indicating an overall good performance of the infiltration model for the calibration period. The posterior uncertainty bounds of slope safety factors are much narrower than the prior ones, implying that the reduction of uncertainty in soil hydraulic parameters significantly reduces the uncertainty of slope stability.
