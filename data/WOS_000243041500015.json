However, EDF schedulers require traffic shapers to ensure flow protection. We propose quantum-based earliest deadline first scheduling (QEDF), a quantum-based scheduler that provides flow protection, throughput guarantee and delay bound guarantee for flows that require LR-coupled and LR-decoupled types of reservations. It classifies flows into time-critical (TC), jitter-sensitive (JS), and rate-based (RB) classes and uses a quality-of-service forwarding rule to determine the next packet to be serviced by the scheduler. It provides nonpreemptive priority service to TC queues. This allows LR-decoupled reservation for flows that have a low rate and intolerable delay. Packets from JS queues can be delayed by other packets if forwarding the latter will not result in the former missing its deadline. As a quantum-based scheduler, the QEDF scheduler provides throughput guarantees for RB queues. We present both analytical and simulation results of QEDF, whereby we evaluated QEDF in its deployment as a single-class as well as a multiservice scheduler.", "paper_title": "Quantum-based earliest deadline first scheduling for multiservices", "paper_id": "WOS:000243041500015"}
