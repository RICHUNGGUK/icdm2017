VoIP technology employs Internet infrastructure and protocols to transfer VoIP data between call parties. Unfortunately, none of the existing Internet transport layer protocols address VoIP application requirements. Typically, the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) application layer protocol and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) transport layer protocol are bound together to address VoIP application requirements. However, a combination of RTP and UDP reduces the quality of VoIP applications and causes inefficient bandwidth utilization. In the present work, a dedicated transport protocol named Internet Telephony Transport Protocol (ITTP) was designed to carry VoIP application data. ITTP is designed to address key VoIP requirements and handle the problems resulting from RTP/UDP. A simple mathematical model was used to evaluate ITTP bandwidth efficiency and compare it with RTP/UDP. ITTP was found to improve bandwidth usage substantially. In addition, ITTP was simulated using Network Simulation 2. The results showed that ITTP had better performance compared with RTP/UDP in terms of packet loss, delay and bandwidth usage.", "paper_title": "ITTP: A NEW TRANSPORT PROTOCOL FOR VOIP APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405300023"}
