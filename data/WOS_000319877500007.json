This paper investigates haptic assistance in combination with auditory feedback instead of visual feedback. A user test is carried out in which participants select fundamental frequencies from a continuous range to play brief musical melodies. Two control conditions are compared with two detent-based haptic assistance conditions. The detents gently guide the users toward locations of equal tempered fundamental frequencies. Results from the user test confirm improved accuracy brought about by the detents. It is further helpful to provide regulation of the strength of haptic assistance in real time, allowing the user to remain always in control. This concept motivated the force-sensitive detent condition, which enables the user to adjust the strength of the haptic assistance in real time by changing the downward force applied to the haptic device. The work implies that users of graphical user interfaces could similarly benefit from force-sensitive detents and more generally real-time regulation of the strength of haptic assistance.", "paper_title": "Force-Sensitive Detents Improve User Performance for Linear Selection Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319877500007"}
