A stochastic scenario-based approach is proposed to capture uncertainties of electrical and thermal loads, output power production of photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) units, market price, natural gas price, hydrogen selling price, operating temperature of the stack of fuel cells (FCs), and pressure of hydrogen and oxygen. The proposed economic model is tested on an MG with different types of power sources including FCs, PV and WT units, and microturbines (MTs).", "paper_title": "Impact of Hydrogen Production and Thermal Energy Recovery of PEMFCPPs on Optimal Management of Renewable Microgrids", "paper_id": "WOS:000362356000019"}
