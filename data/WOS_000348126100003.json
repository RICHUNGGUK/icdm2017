This paper explores mesoscopic patterns of human interactive activities from six real-world interaction networks with temporal-topological isomorphic subgraphs, i.e., temporal motifs. We discover two dominant mutual motifs, \"Star,\" \"Ordered-chain,\" and one dominant directed motif, \"Ping-Pong,\" which characterize the interactive patterns of \"Leader,\" \"Queue,\" and \"Feedback,\" respectively. Moreover, temporal dynamics shows that bursts are universal in human mesoscopic patterns, and the evolution of three dominant temporal motifs indicates the existence of characteristic time. Finally, we analyze temporal robustness and generalization to verify that 3-event temporal motifs are a simple yet powerful tool to capture the mesoscopic patterns of human interactive activities.", "paper_title": "Human Interactive Patterns in Temporal Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348126100003"}
