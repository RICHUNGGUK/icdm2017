Owing to the complexity, fuzziness and uncertainties of the objective things, the criterion values often take the form of linguistic variables, which can be expressed in interval-valued triangular fuzzy numbers. The purpose of this paper is to develop an extended grey relational analysis (GRA) method for solving MCDM problems with interval-valued triangular fuzzy numbers and unknown information on criterion weights. In order to determine the criterion weights, some optimization models based on the basic idea of traditional GRA method are established. Then, calculation steps of extended GRA method for MCDM are given. Finally, a numerical example is shown to verify the developed method and to demonstrate its practicality and feasibility.
