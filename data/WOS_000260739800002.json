This paper presents a new method for calculating distribution power flow using physically remote distributed processors. The proposed method requires the distribution system network model to be partitioned with each subsystem distributed to a remote processor. Models have been developed to represent the remaining network not explicitly retained in each partition. Results show the proposed method will converge to the same solution as that of an un-partitioned centralized power flow validating the accuracy of the proposed models and algorithm.", "paper_title": "Distributed Multi-Phase Distribution Power Flow: Modeling, Solution Algorithm and Simulation Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000260739800002"}
