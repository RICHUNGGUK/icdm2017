The experiments were intended to determine the operator variability of the procedure and its performance in comparison with a traditional pinning procedure using fluoroscopy. In the proposed procedure, a three-dimensional surface model is created from pre-operative computed tomography images and intra-operatively registered to the patient using ultrasound images. A graphical interface that communicates with an optical camera tracking the surgical tools, guides the surgeon during the procedure in real time. The results of the experiments revealed non-significant differences between operators for the error in the entry location of the drill hole (p=0.90); however, significant differences for the exit location (p < 0.05). Comparison with the traditional pinning procedure shows that the outcome of the recently proposed procedure appears to be more consistent.", "paper_title": "Ultrasound-guided percutaneous scaphoid pinning: Operator variability and comparison with traditional fluoroscopic procedure", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700066"}
