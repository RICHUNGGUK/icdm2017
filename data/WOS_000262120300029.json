This technique is based on guiding the search by constructing restricted regions that forbid new locations to be sited too close to the previously found locations In. this work, a restricted region is represented by a circle whose radius is initially set to a fixed value, based on the sparsity of the customers and the number of facilities, and then a scheme that dynamically adjusts the radius at each facility is proposed. A discretisation technique that divides a continuous space into a discrete number of cells while embedding the use of restricted regions within the search is also presented. The experiments show that the proposed region-rejection methods, though simple and easy to understand, provide encouraging results with regard to both solution quality and computational effort. Some future research avenues are also briefly highlighted. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
