We discuss the origins and importance of feature selection and outline recent contributions in a range of applications, from DNA microarray analysis to face recognition. Recent years have witnessed the creation of vast datasets and it seems clear that these will only continue to grow in size and number. This new big data scenario offers both opportunities and challenges to feature selection researchers, as there is a growing need for scalable yet efficient feature selection methods, given that existing methods are likely to prove inadequate.
