Design/methodology/approach - By lower semicontinuity and compactness the existence of best simultaneous approximation is obtained. Findings - If Y is a reflexive subspace of a Banach space X, then L-1(mu, Y) is simultaneously proximinal in L-1(mu, X). Furthermore, if Xis reflexive and mu(0) is the restriction of mu to a sub-sigma-algebra, then L-1(mu(0), X) is simultaneously proximinal in L-1(mu, X). Practical implications - Given a finite number of points in the Banach space X, is about finding a point in the subspace Y subset of X that comes close to all this points. Originality/value - By the property of reflexivity two types subspaces simultaneously proximinal in L-1(mu, X) are obtained.", "paper_title": "Some subspaces simultaneously proximinal", "paper_id": "WOS:000304024000011"}
