Mono-components are defined to be the functions for which non-negative analytic instantaneous frequency is well defined. We show that a great variety of functions are mono-components based on which adaptive decomposition of signals are theoretically possible. We justify the role of empirical mode decomposition in signal decomposition in relation to mono-components.", "paper_title": "Mono-components vs IMFs in signal decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000257762000002"}
