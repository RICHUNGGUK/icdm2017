This scheme is a second-order analytic extension of the first-order Godunov-scheme, based on time-derivatives of flow variables at cell-interfaces resulting from piecewise-linear data reconstruction in cells. The second-order time-integration is based on solutions to generalized Riemann problems at cell-interfaces, thus accounting for the full governing equations, including source terms. The source term due to variable bed elevation is treated in a well-balanced way so that quiescent flow is exactly replicated; this is done by adopting the Surface Gradient Method (SGM). Several problems of steady or unsteady open channel flow are considered, including the terms corresponding to variable channel width and bed elevation, as well as to shear stress at the fluid-channel interface (using the Manning friction model). In all these examples remarkable agreement is obtained between the numerical integration and the exact or accurate solutions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
