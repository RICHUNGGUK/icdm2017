It is based on the elliptic curve cryptosystem whose security refers to the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in the group E(F-p) of rational points of elliptic curve over the finite field. In comparision to similar schemes based on the RSA or DSS systems our solution requires application of significantly shorter cryptographic keys. The scheme is relatively simple in construction, has the property of unforgeability, non-repudation and admits the proactive security.", "paper_title": "Eliptic curve based threshold proxy signature scheme with known signers", "paper_id": "WOS:000242302000003"}
