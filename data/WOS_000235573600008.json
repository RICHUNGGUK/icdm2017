Computation of rigorous error bounds can be turned into a P-matrix linear interval system. Moreover, for the involved matrix being an H-matrix with positive diagonals, an error bound can be found by solving a linear system of equations, which is sharper than the Mathias-Pang error bound. Preliminary numerical results show that the proposed error bound is efficient for verifying accuracy of approximate solutions.", "paper_title": "Computation of error bounds for P-matrix linear complementarity problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235573600008"}
