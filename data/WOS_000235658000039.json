Relational database is the vital source that stores the structured knowledge today. Some prior work has contributed to the learning process from relational database to ontology. However, a majority of the existing methods focus on the schema dimension, leaving the data dimension not well exploited. In this paper we present a novel approach that exploits the data dimension by mining user query log to glorify the ontology learning process. In addition, we propose a set of rules for schema extraction which serves as the basis of our theme. The presented approach can be applied to a broad range of today's relational data warehouse.", "paper_title": "Mining query log to assist ontology learning from relational database", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000039"}
