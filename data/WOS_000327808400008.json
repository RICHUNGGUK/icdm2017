Fluid meshes surrounding a solid can slide each other to accommodate a rotational motion of the solid, and a fluid mesh outside the sliding interface can translate through a background fluid mesh. Because of relative motions of sliding fluid meshes and independently designed fluid and solid meshes, non-matching meshes occur at their common interfaces. The non-matching meshes are connected by using variable-node elements which guarantee the continuity, the compatibility and the force equilibrium across the interfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
