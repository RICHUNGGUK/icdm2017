We derive general expressions for the mean fields expressed as differential operators depending on densities and for the densities expressed in terms of derivatives of wave functions. These expressions are then specified to the case of spherical symmetry. We also present the computer program HOSPHE (v1.02), which solves the self-consistent equations by using the expansion of single-particle wave functions on the spherical harmonic oscillator basis.

Within the Local Density Approximation with gradient corrections up to (NLO)-L-3 1 I. the nuclear mean-field is local and contains derivative operators up to sixth order. The locality allows for an effective and fast solution of the self-consistent equations. Solution method: The program uses the spherical harmonic oscillator basis to expand single-particle wave functions of neutrons and protons for the nuclear state being described by the (NLO)-L-3 nuclear energy density functional [1]. The expansion coefficients are determined by the iterative diagonalization of the mean-field Hamiltonian, which depends non-linearly on the local neutron and proton densities. Restrictions: Solutions are limited to spherical symmetry. The expansion on the harmonic-oscillator basis does not allow for a precise description of asymptotic properties of wave functions. Running time: 50 seconds of CPU time for the ground-state of Pb-208 described by using N-0 = 50 as the maximum harmonic-oscillator shell included in the basis. References: [1] B.G. Carlsson, J.
