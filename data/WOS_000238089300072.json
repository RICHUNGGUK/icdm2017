An algorithm is proposed to control the difficulty of a game according to user's propensity in our previous work [1], [2]. But the searching spaces are very narrow and convergence of chromosomes is also slow because the game progresses step-by-step and chromosomes are evaluated simultaneously while playing the game. Thus, a method is presented to expand the searching spaces and converge quickly on the Genetic Algorithm in the domain of sequential progress.", "paper_title": "Cyclic reproduction scheme in genetic algorithm for evolutionary game", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300072"}
