However, they mainly focus on preserving data privacy. In this paper, we address another aspect of privacy preservation in data publishing, where some of the knowledge implied by a dataset are regarded as private or sensitive information. In particular, we consider that the data axe stored in a transaction database, and the knowledge is represented in the form of patterns. We present a data sanitization algorithm, called SanDB, for effectively protecting a set of sensitive patterns, meanwhile attempting to minimize the impact of data sanitization on the non-sensitive patterns. The experimental results show that SanDB can achieve significant improvement over the best approach presented in the literature.", "paper_title": "An effective approach for hiding sensitive knowledge in data publishing", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700013"}
