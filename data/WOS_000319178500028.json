In this work the numerical CVS was used to study the effect of interaction between mechanical ventilation and biventricular pacemaker by haemodynarnic and energetic point of view. Starting from literature data on patients with intra and/or inter-ventricular activation time delay and treated using biventricular pacemaker, we used in silico simulator to analyse the effects induced by mechanical ventilatory assistance (MVA). After reproducing baseline and CRT conditions, the MVA was simulated changing the mean intrathoracic pressure value. Results show that simultaneous application of CRT and MVA yields a reduction of cardiac output, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume when positive mean intrathoracic pressure is applied. In the same conditions, when MVA is applied, left ventricular ejection fraction, mean left (right) atrial and pulmonary arterial pressure increase. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
