The original GSOM algorithm is altered to accommodate for the issues related to massive high dimensional data. These modifications are presented in detail with experimental results of a massive real-world dataset.", "paper_title": "Clustering massive high dimensional data with dynamic feature maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100090"}
