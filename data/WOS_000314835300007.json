An efficient synthesizing technique with a single quadrature phase-locked loop (QPLL) is proposed for fast band switching. To suppress accumulating sidebands at the outputs, a clock buffer with I/Q calibration and distortion cancellation technique is proposed. Fabricated in TSMC 0.13-mu m CMOS technology and operated at 1.2 V, the synthesizer measures a maximum sideband rejection of 45 dB and a phase noise of -105 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset. The synthesizer covers frequency range from 6.2 to 9.4 GHz with band switching time less than 1.4 ns.", "paper_title": "A sideband-suppressed fast-hopping synthesizer for dual-carrier OFDM UWB transceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000314835300007"}
