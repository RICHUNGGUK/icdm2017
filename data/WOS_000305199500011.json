The SCECM adopts a differentiated sampling rate algorithm based on an improved Adaboost algorithm and further employs some unique classifier-selection strategy, novel classifier integration approach and original classification decision-making method. Comparative experimental results show that the proposed approach improves performance for the minority class while preserving the ability to recognize examples from the majority classes.", "paper_title": "New Construction of Ensemble Classifiers for Imbalanced Datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000305199500011"}
