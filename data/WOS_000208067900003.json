These principles are formulated based on some of the recurring themes in the developmental learning literature and in the author's own research. The five principles follow logically from the verification principle (postulated by Richard Sutton) which is assumed to be self-evident. This paper also gives an example of how these principles can be applied to the problem of autonomous tool use in robots.", "paper_title": "Some Basic Principles of Developmental Robotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000208067900003"}
