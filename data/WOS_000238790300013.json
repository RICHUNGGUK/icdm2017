Prototyping provides a framework for meaningful social interaction between system users and developers. This research examines the social contextual factors that determine the performance of information system projects and addresses the social perspectives of system development methodologies within the prototyping development framework. This study suggests that the full mediators of the prototyping approach were organizational technology learning and user-IS interaction effectiveness. Organizations should use prototyping in situations where these mediators are important to the development process and are not achieved through other organizational practice. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
