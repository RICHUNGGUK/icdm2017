FEA has been proven to be effective in studying various pavement failure problems; however, it is time consuming and error prone to manually generate the load sequences where non-regular tire footprints, non-uniform tire-pavement contact stresses, and transverse wheel wander distributions are used. After FEA, extracting the deformations for failure analysis is necessary but tedious. The 00 framework developed in this study handles the preprocessing and postprocessing tasks for the FEA of pavements. It has a graphical user interface and is platform independent. It was successfully used in developing a new criterion for characterizing pavement failures that involved approximately four hundred different FEA simulations.
