Intentionality denotes the process through which humans conceive future situations, plan actions, predict the sensory consequences of the action, and update the prediction with self-changing means. Intentionality extraction is fundamental to the human ability to understand both the general laws that govern events and the particular principle of how and why a specific event actually occurred. As intentionality is a cognitive concept defined as the directedness of the mind towards a content or object, no previous research effort clearly defines and extracts intentionality in discourse. This paper begins by analysing discourse and cognitive intentionality and constructs the CIES-PT system for intentionality extraction based on the P-Tree model (a working model to analyse discourse qua sensible behaviour). CIES-PT applies an ant colony system to cluster similar discourse P-nodes to ensure high cohesion and hierarchically aggregates discourse P-nodes within one cluster to guarantee high coherence. In the final step, CIES-PT identifies intention connections among sentences at discourse levels based on the thematization principle. CIES-PT is examined with elaborately designed experimental tasks using the Reuters-21578 database with three classic metrics (Precision, Recall and F-Measure) and average computing time. The experimental results have demonstrated CIES-PT correctness and effectiveness. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
