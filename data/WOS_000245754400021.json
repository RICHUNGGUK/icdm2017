There are four stages namely, user modelling, benchmarking of clustering algorithms, prediction analysis and recommendation. The first stage is to develop analytical models of common characteristics of Web-user data. These artificial data sets are then used to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms, in particular benchmarking the ART2 neural network with K-means clustering. Afterwards, it is evaluated the predictive accuracy of the clusters applied to a real-world data set derived from access logs to the citizen Web portal Infoville XXI (http://www.infoville.es). The results favour ART2 algorithms for cluster-based collaborative filtering on this Web portal. Finally, a recommender based on ART2 is developed. The follow-up of real recommendations will allow to improve recommendations by including new behaviours that are observed when users interact with the recommender system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
