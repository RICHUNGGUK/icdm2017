It proved to be very fast and effective especially for solving function approximation problems with a predetermined network structure. However, the method for determining the network structure of preliminary ELM may be tedious and may not lead to a parsimonious solution. In this paper, a systematic two-stage algorithm (named TS-ELM) is introduced to handle the problem. In the first stage, a forward recursive algorithm is applied to select the hidden nodes from the candidates randomly generated in each step and add them to the network until the stopping criterion achieves its minimum. The significance of each hidden node is then reviewed in the second stage and the insignificance ones are removed from the network, which drastically reduces the network complexity. The effectiveness of TS-ELM is verified by the empirical studies in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
