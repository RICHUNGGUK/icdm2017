The control system processing such fault tolerance capability is referred to as a fault tolerant control system (FTCS). The objective of FTC is to maintain system stability and current performance of the system close to the desired performance in the presence of system component and/or instrument faults; in certain circumstances a reduced performance may be acceptable. Various control design methods have been developed in the literature with the target to modify or accommodate baseline controllers which were originally designed for systems operating under fault-free conditions. The main objective of this article is to develop a novel FTCS design method, which incorporates both reliability and dynamic performance of the faulty system in the design of a FTCS. Once a fault has been detected and isolated, the reconfiguration strategy proposed in this article will find possible structures of the faulty system that best preserve pre-specified performances based on on-line calculated system reliability and associated costs. The new reconfigured controller gains will also be synthesised and finally the optimal structure that has the 'best' control performance with the highest reliability will be chosen for control reconfiguration. The effectiveness of this work is illustrated by a heating system benchmark used in a European project entitled intelligent Fault Tolerant Control in Integrated Systems (IFATIS EU-IST-2001-32122).", "paper_title": "Design of a fault tolerant control system incorporating reliability analysis and dynamic behaviour constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000283876900019"}
