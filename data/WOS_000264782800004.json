Knowledge discovery in databases is successfully applied for deriving models that estimate the value of one variable based on correlated others. The estimated values can then be used instead of the recorded ones of a measuring instrument with false reading. The aim is to reassure the correctness of data entered to an optimization software application that was developed for the Thermal Power Plants of Western Macedonia, Greece. The architecture of the application follows the Multi-Agent System approach in order to cope with its complexity and distributed nature. The application was tested on a case study and proved to be efficient. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
