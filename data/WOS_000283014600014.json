However, little effort exists in consolidating these fragments into an integrated model. We propose a model of designing that integrates product and process facets of designing by combining activities, outcomes, requirements, and solutions. Validation of the model using video protocols of design sessions demonstrates that all the constructs are used naturally by designers but often not to the expected level, which hinders the variety and resulting novelty of the concepts developed in these sessions. To resolve this, a prescriptive framework for supporting design for variety and novelty is proposed and plans for its implementation are created.
