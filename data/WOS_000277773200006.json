In this paper we propose a class of SR algorithms based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. These algorithms utilize a new multi-channel image prior model, along with the state-of-the-art single channel image prior and observation models. A hierarchical (two-level) Gaussian nonstationary version of the multichannel prior is also defined and utilized within the same framework. Numerical experiments comparing the proposed algorithms among themselves and with other algorithms in the literature, demonstrate the advantages of the adopted multichannel approach.", "paper_title": "Maximum a Posteriori Video Super-Resolution Using a New Multichannel Image Prior", "paper_id": "WOS:000277773200006"}
