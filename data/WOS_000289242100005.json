In simultaneous geometric embeddings, the same point in the plane is used to represent the same object as a way to preserve the viewer's mental map. In colored simultaneous embeddings this restriction is relaxed, by allowing a given object to map to a subset of points in the plane. Specifically, consider a set of graphs on the same set of n vertices partitioned into k colors. Finding a corresponding set of k-colored points in the plane such that each vertex is mapped to a point of the same color so as to allow a straight-line plane drawing of each graph is the problem of colored simultaneous geometric embedding. For n-vertex paths, we show that there exist universal pointsets of size n, colored with two or three colors. We use this result to construct colored simultaneous geometric embeddings for a 2-colored tree together with any number of 2-colored paths, and more generally, a 2-colored outerplanar graph together with any number of 2-colored paths. For n-vertex trees, we construct small near-universal pointsets for 3-colored caterpillars of size n, 3-colored radius-2 stars of size n+3, and 2-colored spiders of size n. For n-vertex outerplanar graphs, we show that these same universal pointsets also suffice for 3-colored K (3)-caterpillars, 3-colored K (3)-stars, and 2-colored fans, respectively. We also present several negative results, showing that there exist a 2-colored planar graph and pseudo-forest, three 3-colored outerplanar graphs, four 4-colored pseudo-forests, three 5-colored pseudo-forests, five 5-colored paths, two 6-colored biconnected outerplanar graphs, three 6-colored cycles, four 6-colored paths, and three 9-colored paths that cannot be simultaneously embedded.", "paper_title": "Colored Simultaneous Geometric Embeddings and Universal Pointsets", "paper_id": "WOS:000289242100005"}
