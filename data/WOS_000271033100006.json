The T-S fuzzy Systems can be Stabilized by a pre-designed state feedback controller. Our objective is to establish conditions concerning controller failure time and frequency, under which the systems still keep exponentially stable. For this purpose, the systems with controller failures are first formulated as a class of switched delay systems. Next, based on piecewise Lyapunov functional method, exponential stability of such systems is guaranteed by restricting unavailable rate and failure frequency of the controllers. All the results are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "CONTROLLER FAILURE ANALYSIS FOR T-S FUZZY SYSTEMS WITH TIME-VARYING DELAY VIA A SWITCHED APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033100006"}
