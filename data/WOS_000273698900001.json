NetGMM supports network-based mobility management and non-Mobile IP mobile environment. There are two design considerations. The first is that a future mobile network requires network-based mobility management, shifting the mobility management function from Mobile Nodes (MN) to Access Network (AN) nodes. The second is that future mobile networks will support IP multi-services, introducing a separation between network address and identity of a mobile node entity, allowing heterogeneous networks to work together without loss of functionality.", "paper_title": "A network-based global mobility management architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000273698900001"}
