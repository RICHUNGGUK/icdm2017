Therefore, utilization of an environment that guides the development process starting from the design of templates that can be reused multiple times up to the code generation and debugging is essential. In this manuscript we present advancements in the Agent Development Environment that can be used not only for the development of agents designed for high-level decision-making, but also for distributed low-level control that is automatically integrated.
