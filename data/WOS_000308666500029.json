The main task of this paper is to investigate three fundamental problems, which are composed of the identification of irregular target, locating multiple targets and tracking multiple targets. Firstly, the proposed objective function successfully gets the target's shape to discern eccentric target in the specific environment. Secondly, for the sake of locating multiple targets, the adaptive PSO algorithm divides the swarm into many subgroups, and adaptively adjusts the number of particles in each subgroup by the competition and cooperation technology. Thirdly, in order to track multiple targets in the dynamic environment, the proposed swarm optimization has the characteristic of the adaptively covered radius of the subgroup according to the minimum distance among other subgroups. To show the efficiency and high performance of the proposed algorithms, several algorithms chiefly concentrate on locating and tracking three ants in the practical systems. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
