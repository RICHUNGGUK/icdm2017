To describe the impact of each component state, we first introduce the performance function of the multi-state system. Then, we present the definition of IIM of component states. We demonstrate its corresponding physical meaning, and then analyze the relationships between IIM and Griffith importance, Wu importance, and Natvig importance. Secondly, we present the evaluation method of IIM for multi-state systems. Thirdly, the characteristics of IIM of component states are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate a numerical example, and an application to an offshore oil and gas production system for IIM to verify the proposed method. The results show that 1) the IIM of component states concerns not only the probability distributions and transition intensities of the states of the object component, but also the change in the system performance under the change of the state distribution of the object component; and 2) IIM can be used to identify the key state of a component that affects the system performance most.", "paper_title": "Integrated Importance Measure of Component States Based on Loss of System Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198500020"}
