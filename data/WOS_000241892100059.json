The multi-population genetic algorithm based on the independent evolution of different subpopulations is to prevent premature convergence of each subpopulation by migration. Experimental results with UCI standard data sets show that multi-population genetic algorithm outperforms simple genetic algorithm.", "paper_title": "Multi-population genetic algorithm for feature selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100059"}
