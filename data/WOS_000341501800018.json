In these architectures intelligence is put respectively at the product and through the network of workstation computers. The cost of embedded specialized hardware required for the first option is still very high. The second option needs the utilization of Automatic Identification and Data Capture technology close to the product to permit its identification and tracking by the computer system. These technologies enable the automated identification of objects, the collection of data about them, and the storage of that data directly into computer systems. Through this network, the computer system can access or update information in databases about the products and connect with software agents that represent production orders and resources and take in common decisions through negotiation and contract-based rules. The theory of the proposed solutions is based on the holonic manufacturing and product-driven automation concepts. The implementation methodology along with experimental results is presented, emphasizing the advantages of each solution.", "paper_title": "Distributed manufacturing control with extended CNP interaction of intelligent products", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800018"}
