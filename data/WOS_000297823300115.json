Currently, most research on document recovery focuses on image feature exaction and analysis. In this work, we have presented a complete procedure to recover a shredded document. The problem is different from solving jigsaw puzzles since curved boundaries and color information are not available. In our two-stage reconstruction approach, image-based techniques are first used to identify the shred images with high spatial proximity and evaluate the similarity between any pair of shreds. A graph-based algorithm is then used to derive the best shred sorting result for document reconstruction. Experiments are presented for both the synthetic and real datasets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
