For the purpose of effectively retrieving more similar images from the digital image databases, this paper uses the color distributions, the mean value and the standard deviation, to represent the global characteristics of the image. Moreover, the image bitmap is used to represent the local characteristics of the image for increasing the accuracy of the retrieval system. As the experimental results indicated, the proposed technique indeed outperforms other schemes in terms of retrieval accuracy and category retrieval ability. Furthermore, the total memory space for saving the image features of the proposed method is less than Chan and Liu's method.
