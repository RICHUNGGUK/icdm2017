The dispersion determination is however frequently ambiguous. To verify the signal analysis reliability and to estimate the dispersive character of the waves an algorithm for dispersive waveform calculation was designed. It is based on the summation of frequency components, with shifts corresponding to the velocity dispersion and distance. The knowledge of physical parameters of the medium is not required. The resulting waveform only contains an individual dispersive wave of the selected mode, thus being particularly suitable for testing of methodologies for dispersive wave analysis.
