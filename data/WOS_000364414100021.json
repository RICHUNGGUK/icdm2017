The odd-mode resonant frequency of the slotline SCLSR can be flexibly controlled by the stub, whereas the even-mode one is fixed. Meanwhile, a transmission zero near the odd-mode resonant frequency can be generated due to themain path signal counteraction. First, the wideband single-ended BPF and corresponding balanced BPF are designed based on the slotline SCLSR with the parallel coupled microstrip line input/ output (I/O). Ultra wideband high CM suppression that can be achieved for the slotline resonator structure has no resonant mode under CM excitation. Furthermore, by folding the parallel coupled microstrip line I/O, the source-load coupling is effectively decoupled to improve the CM suppression within the passband. The high suppression wideband balanced BPF is fabricated and measured, respectively. Good agreement between simulation and measurement results is obtained.", "paper_title": "High CM Suppression Wideband Balanced BPF Using Dual-Mode Slotline Resonator", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414100021"}
