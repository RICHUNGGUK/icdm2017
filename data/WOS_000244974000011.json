If the induced inertia force and torque are larger than the static friction force and torque, the carried objects begin to slip on the mobile robot. The final objective of this research was to construct a guidance controller that could travel as quickly as possible and prevent the carried objects from slipping. To achieve this, we modeled a mobile robot carrying plural objects to analyze their slipping motions and the influence slipping had on the traveling motion. The results of simulations were compared to actual slipping results obtained from experiments using a real mobile robot. The agreement between simulated and experimented results indicated that the proposed model could correctly describe the motion of the mobile robot carrying objects.", "paper_title": "Dynamical model of mobile robot including slipping of carrying objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000244974000011"}
