The problem was recently shown to be weakly NP-complete even on series-parallel graphs. We start by showing that the problem is strongly NP-complete and cannot be approximated in polynomial time (unless P = NP) up to any polynomially computable function even when the graph is bipartite and the given instance is guaranteed to admit a feasible solution. Moreover, we present a pseudo-polynomial-time exact algorithm and a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the problem on series-parallel graphs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
