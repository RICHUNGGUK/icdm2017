In this study, the laser marking process is applied to the fabrication of light guide panels as the new fabrication process. In order to obtain a light guide panel which has high luminance and uniformity, four principal parameters such as power, scanning speed, ratio of line gap, and number of line were selected. A web-based design tool was developed to generate patterns of light guide panel via the network, and the tool may assist the designer to develop various prototype patterns. Topcon-BM7 was used for luminance measurement of each specimen with 100 mm x 100 mm area. By Taguchi method, optimized levels of each parameter were found, and luminance of 3523 cd/cm(2) and uniformity of 92% were achieved using the laser machined BLU. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
