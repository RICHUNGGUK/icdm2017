Much of the previous work on this problem, and on other communication tasks in the setting of bounded error entanglement-assisted communication, is based on sophisticated information theoretic arguments. Our results are derived from first principles, using a simple linear algebraic technique. A direct consequence is a tight lower bound for the Inner Product function that has found applications to privacy amplification in quantum key distribution protocols.", "paper_title": "Limits on the ability of quantum states to convey classical messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000236521600005"}
