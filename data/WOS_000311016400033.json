Therefore, a variety of medical applications and medical semantic search engines have difficulty understanding and integrating healthcare data in a highly heterogeneous environment. OWL (Web Ontology Language) and Semantic Web technologies provide an infrastructure that can solve these problems. The aim of our study is to present a mechanism to ease the interpretation and automate the semantic transformation of XML healthcare data into the OWL ontology (S-Trans), which allows an easier and better semantic communication among hospital information systems. On the basis of the XML schemas (XSD or DTD), we extract the document structure and add more descriptions for XML elements. Moreover, to classify the semantic level of duplicate elements in an XML schema, we propose novel metrics to measure the similarity between them. Experimental results show that the proposed method reliably predicts semantic similarity of duplicates and produces a better-quality OWL ontology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
