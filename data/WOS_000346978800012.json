Motivated by the ideal of Bonferroni mean, the aggregation techniques called the trapezoid fuzzy linguistic Bonferroni mean (TFLBM) operator for aggregating the Trapezoid fuzzy linguistic information are proposed. For the situations where the input arguments have different importance, the Trapezoid fuzzy linguistic weighted Bonferroni mean (TFLWBM) operator is defined. The procedure for multiple attribute decision making based on the TFLWBM operator under the Trapezoid fuzzy linguistic environments is developed. Finally, a practical example for evaluating the investment project risk is given to verify the developed approach.", "paper_title": "Models for comprehensive evaluating modeling of investment project risk with trapezoid fuzzy linguistic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800012"}
