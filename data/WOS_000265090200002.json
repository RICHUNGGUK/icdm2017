Tree-like structures are frequently encountered in biomedical contexts; examples are the bronchial system, the vascular topology, and the breast ductal network. We use tree encoding techniques, such as the depth-first string encoding and the Prufer encoding, to obtain a symbolic string representation of the tree's branching topology; the problem of classifying trees is then reduced to string classification. We use the tf-idf text mining technique to assign a weight of significance to each string term (i.e., tree node label). Similarity searches and k-nearest neighbor classification of the trees is performed using the tf-idf weight vectors and the cosine similarity metric. We applied our approach to characterize the ductal tree-like parenchymal structure in X-ray galactograms, in order to distinguish among different radiological findings. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with classification accuracy reaching up to 86%, and also indicate that our method can potentially aid in providing insight to the relationship between branching patterns and function or pathology.", "paper_title": "A Representation and Classification Scheme for Tree-Like Structures in Medical Images: Analyzing the Branching Pattern of Ductal Trees in X-ray Galactograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000265090200002"}
