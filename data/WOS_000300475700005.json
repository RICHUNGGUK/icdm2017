First, we introduce the concept of semi-uninorms on a complete lattice. Then, we discuss two kinds of residual operators of semi-uninorms and give conditions such that the operators are implications. We also give equivalent conditions for infinitely boolean OR-distributive left- and right-conjunctive semi-uninorms. Furthermore, we define two classes of induced operators by implications on a complete lattice and give conditions such that they are semi-uninorms. We also provide the equivalent conditions for the infinitely boolean AND-distributive implications in their second variables. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
