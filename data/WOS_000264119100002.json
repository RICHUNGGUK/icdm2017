First, some nodes are selected as coordinators. Then a new node will use the exchanged hello messages to find the closest coordinator and obtain a new IP address from that coordinator. In order to efficiently maintain the IP-address pools, the distributed coordinators are organised in a tree topology by exchanging hello messages. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme has a low latency for obtaining a new IP address and that it can efficiently maintain consistent IP-address pools.", "paper_title": "A distributed IP address assignment scheme in ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000264119100002"}
