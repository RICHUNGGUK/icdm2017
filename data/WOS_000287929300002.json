The anisotropic evolution is steered by a matrix constructed from a structure tensor for matrix valued data. An important novelty is an intrinsically one-dimensional directional variant of the matrix-valued upwind schemes such as the Rouy-Tourin scheme. It enables our method to complete or enhance anisotropic structures effectively. A special advantage of our approach is that upwind schemes are utilised only in their basic one-dimensional version, hence avoiding grid effects and leading to an accurate algorithm. No higher dimensional variants of the schemes themselves are required. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data substantiate the gap-closing and line-completing properties of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Continuous-Scale Morphology for Matrix Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000287929300002"}
