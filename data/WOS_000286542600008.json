We classify hierarchical queries into core and non-core hierarchical queries and show that the existing methods can only generate safe plans for core hierarchical queries. Inspired by the bucket elimination framework, we give the sufficient and necessary conditions for the answer relation of every candidate sub-query to be used as a base relation. Finally, the proposed algorithm generates safe plans for extensional query evaluation on non-boolean hierarchical queries and invokes the SPROUT algorithm [24] for intensional query evaluation on boolean queries. A case study on the TPC-H benchmark reveals that the safe plans of Q7 and Q8 can be evaluated efficiently. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that safe plans generated by the proposed algorithm scale well. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
