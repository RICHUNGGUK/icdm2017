In this article, we revisit these naive Bayes text classifiers and empirically compare their classification performance on a large number of widely used text classification benchmark datasets. Then, we propose a locally weighted learning approach to these naive Bayes text classifiers. We call our new approach locally weighted naive Bayes text classifiers (LWNBTC). LWNBTC weakens the attribute conditional independence assumption made by these naive Bayes text classifiers by applying the locally weighted learning approach. The experimental results show that our locally weighted versions significantly outperform these state-of-the-art naive Bayes text classifiers in terms of classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Naive Bayes text classifiers: a locally weighted learning approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000318153800007"}
