Most of the current devices are constrained, preventing their performance from being optimized. This paper proposes the MHC-MAC protocol. It has asynchronous assembly line mode cognitive MAC aimed at improving the HC-MAC protocol performance with low throughput and channel utilization rate. From the sensing time, task number, licensed channel number and data packet length aspects, mathematical model and program simulation results are presented to demonstrate that MHC-MAC is better than HC-MAC in spectrum utilization and network capacity.
