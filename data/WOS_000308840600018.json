Design/methodology/approach - Grey clustering evaluations are important contents of grey system. Starting from the investigation on the evaluations in coal railway transportation on the \"Datong-Qinhuangdao\" line, the authors realize that the reasonable plan developed from the real equipment and wagon flow conditions for optimal organizing of trains to achieve minimum unloading time is becoming the goal of the organizing optimization. According to the theory of grey clustering evaluations, all the system parameters such as, transportation volume per year and cost of transportation, can be combined with each other through some methods. This allows the authors to apply the theory of grey clustering evaluations on the \"Datong-Qinhuangdao\" heavy haul railway line, and provide a reliable selection plan for heavy haul railway transportation. The results of the statistical analysis can be used as the basic theory to serve the coal railway transportation, and are applicable to provide reliable transportation. Findings - This paper presents the theory of grey clustering evaluations in coal railway transportation on \"Datong-Qinhuangdao\" heavy haul railway line. The convincing results of the grey classes are reported, and can be used as the basic theory to provide reliable transportation. Practical implications - The method exposed in the paper can be used at each company's level for providing a reliable selection plan for heavy haul railway transportation. The results can also be used as the basic theory to provide reliable transportation. Originality/value - The paper succeeds in providing a reliable selection plan for heavy haul railway transportation by using one of the newest developed theories: grey systems theory.", "paper_title": "Application of grey clustering evaluations in coal railway transportation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308840600018"}
