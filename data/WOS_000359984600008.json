One security criterion for a human identification protocol is the number of challenge-response pairs the adversary needs to observe before it can deduce the secret. In order to increase this number, protocol designers have tried to construct protocols that cannot be represented as a system of linear equations or congruences. In this paper, we take a closer look at different ways from algebra, lattices, and coding theory to obtain the secret from a system of linear congruences. We then show two examples of human identification protocols from literature that can be transformed into a system of linear congruences. The resulting attack limits the number of authentication sessions these protocols can be used before secret renewal. Prior to this paper, these protocols had no known upper bound on the number of allowable sessions per secret.", "paper_title": "On the Linearization of Human Identification Protocols: Attacks Based on Linear Algebra, Coding Theory, and Lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000359984600008"}
