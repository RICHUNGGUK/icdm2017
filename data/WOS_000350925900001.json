Mutual Information is a popular image similarity measure for performing multi-modal image registration. However, it is recognised that there are limitations with the technique that can compromise the accuracy of the registration, such as the lack of spatial information that is accounted for by the similarity measure. In this paper, we present a two-stage non-rigid registration process using a novel similarity measure, Feature Neighbourhood Mutual Information. The similarity measure efficiently incorporates both spatial and structural image properties that are not traditionally considered by MI. By incorporating such features, we find that this method is capable of achieving much greater registration accuracy when compared to existing methods, whilst also achieving efficient computational runtime. To demonstrate our method, we use a challenging medical image data set consisting of paired retinal fundus photographs and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope images. Accurate registration of these image pairs facilitates improved clinical diagnosis, and can be used for the early detection and prevention of glaucoma disease. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
