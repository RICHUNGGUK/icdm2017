However, existing solutions do not consider random recharging rates and staled battery level information, resulting in an activation schedule that is not realizable by sensor nodes. Henceforth, we propose a Stochastic Programming (SP) based approach that considers random battery levels. Experimental results show our SP approach achieves 80% of the theoretically achievable coverage lifetime.", "paper_title": "On Complete Target Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks With Random Recharging Rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000373738600013"}
