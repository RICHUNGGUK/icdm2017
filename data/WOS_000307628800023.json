It is a gradual trend that competitors continuously innovate on their product and product life cycle becomes shorter. The manager intends to achieve the highest customer satisfaction, product value and product continuity. In this study, we develop an effective quality assessment system to manage quality of new product development (NPD) process. First, the quality factors related to NPD process are selected by expert questionnaires. Second, the DEMATEL approach is used to explore the relevance of the quality factors of NPD process. Then, the DEMATEL is combined with ANP method to a new DANP approach to calculate the influential weights of quality factors. Finally, VIKOR is used to evaluate and improve the total performance of NPD process by using empirical analysis on a case study, to find out the performance gaps and to improve its scores. The results of this study will provide NPD team a guidance to continuously improve, track and meet the quality assurance of NPD process; consequently, the customers' needs can be satisfied.", "paper_title": "PROBING THE INNOVATIVE QUALITY SYSTEM STRUCTURE MODEL FOR NPD PROCESS BASED ON COMBINING DANP WITH MCDM MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800023"}
