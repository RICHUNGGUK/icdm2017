Exposing or sharing personal information with these communities has risks as well as benefits and there is always a trade off between the risks versus the benefits of using these technologies. Life-logs are pervasive tools or systems which sense and capture contextual information from the user's environment in a continuous manner. A life-log produces a dataset, which consists of continuous streams of sensor data. Sharing this information has a wide range of advantages for both user and society. On the other hand, in terms of individual privacy, life-log information is very sensitive. Although social media enable users to share their information, due to life-log data structure, current sharing models are not capable of handling life-log information while maintaining user privacy. Our approach here is to describe the sharing of life-log information with society based on the identification of associated risks and benefits. Subsequently, based on the identified risks, we propose a data model for sharing life-log information. This data model has been designed to reduce the potential risks of life-logs. Furthermore, ethics for providing and using life-logs will be discussed. These ethics focus on reducing risks as much as possible while sharing life-log information.", "paper_title": "Towards sharing life-log information with society", "paper_id": "WOS:000310840100002"}
