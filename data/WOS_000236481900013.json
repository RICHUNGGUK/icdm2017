By examining different elements of the pawn structure, the method checks whether the Pawns form a blockage which prevents the King from penetrating into the opponent's camp. It then checks several criteria to find out whether the blockage is permanent.", "paper_title": "Blockage detection in pawn endings", "paper_id": "WOS:000236481900013"}
