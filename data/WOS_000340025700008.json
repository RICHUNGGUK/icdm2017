The proposed solution involves the use of the geoavailability grid, a lightweight, distributed spatial indexing structure. The index can also be used in nondistributed settings, and performs competitively with other spatial indexing technologies.", "paper_title": "Evaluating Geospatial Geometry and Proximity Queries Using Distributed Hash Tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000340025700008"}
