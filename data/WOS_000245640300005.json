Unfortunately, a minimum in terms of set inclusion can be non-existent even when an intuitive \"minimum\" exists. We suggest an alternative to set inclusion, called \"leanness\", show that leanness is a partial order on quasi-orderings, and provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a \"leanest\" member of a set of total well-founded quasi-orderings.
