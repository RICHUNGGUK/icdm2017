The VTPE mechanism allows the implementation of real-time (RT) applications upon legacy bus-based industrial networks, enforcing the adequate timing behavior of the supported applications. It enables the traffic separation between legacy Ethernet stations and enhanced (RT) stations. A set of experiments has been performed, which allowed to measure the message access delay and the token rotation time. The achieved results clearly demonstrate that the VTPE architecture enables the support of RT communication upon legacy bus-based industrial Ethernet networks, even when the communication medium is shared with uncontrolled traffic sources.
