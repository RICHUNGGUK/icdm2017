For effective use of SSDs for enterprise purposes, SSDs must be designed considering requirements such as those related to performance, lifetime, and cost constraints. However, SSDs have numerous hardware and software design options, such as flash memory types and block allocation methods, which have not been well analyzed yet, but on which the SSD performance depends. Furthermore, there is no methodology for determining the optimal design for a particular I/O workload. This paper proposes SSD-Tailor, a customization tool for SSDs. SSD-Tailor determines a near-optimal set of design options for a given workload. SSD designers can use SSD-Tailor to customize SSDs in the early design stage to meet the customer requirements. We evaluate SSD-Tailor with nine I/O workload traces collected from real-world enterprise servers. We observe that SSD-Tailor finds near-optimal SSD designs for these workloads by exploring only about 1% of the entire set of design candidates. We also show that the near-optimal designs increase the average I/O operations per second by up to 17% and decrease the average response time by up to 163% as compared to an SSD with a general design.", "paper_title": "SSD-Tailor: Automated Customization System for Solid-State Drives", "paper_id": "WOS:000353509300014"}
