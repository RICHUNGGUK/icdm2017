Based on the information systems management and marketing literature, this study explores how customer convenience in using functions and services affects e-commerce systems success. It proposes and analyzes a re-specified e-commerce system model based on the updated DeLone and McLean Information Systems Success Model with a new variable, e-commerce/electronic service convenience. The proposed model re-specifies and validates e-commerce systems success where continuance intention is proposed as a dependent variable and its relationship with independent variables such as information quality, system quality, e-service convenience, perceived usefulness and satisfaction are discussed. Partial least squares structural equation modeling technique is employed to analyze data collected by 210 users of business-to-consumer e-commerce systems in Taiwan. Findings indicate that continuance intention was found to be influenced by both satisfaction and perceived usefulness, which were found to be significant precursors of information quality, system quality, and e-service convenience. These results strongly support our contention that e-service convenience is an important factor affecting e-commerce systems success. They also offer practitioners and managers deeper insights into successful e-commerce systems implementation as well as aid researchers interested in testing related theories.", "paper_title": "E-SERVCON and E-Commerce Success: Applying the DeLone & McLean Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000343389000001"}
