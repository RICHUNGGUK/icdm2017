We further prove a corresponding theorem for the number of nodes of degree two in labeled planar graphs. The proof method is based on generating functions and singularity analysis. In particular, we need systems of equations for multivariate generating functions and transfer results for singular representations of analytic functions. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
