Bridging the discrepancy between these two knowledge representations, this paper introduces Datalog(DL) as a family of hybrid languages, where Datalog rules are parameterized by various DL (description logic) languages ranging from ALC to SHIQ. Making Datalog(DL) a decidable system with complexity of EXPTIME, we propose independent properties in the DL body as the restriction to hybrid rules, and weaken the safeness condition to balance the trade-off between expressivity and reasoning power. Building on existing well-developed techniques, we present a principled approach to enrich (RuleML) rules with information from (OWL) ontologies, and develop a prototype system combining a rule engine (OO jDREW) with a DL reasoner (RACER).", "paper_title": "The Datalog(DL) combination of deduction rules and description logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000248270600005"}
