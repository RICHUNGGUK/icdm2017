Clustering becomes more challenging when data are categorical and the amount of available memory is less than the size of the data set. In this paper, we introduce CBC (Clustering Based on Compressed Data), an extension of the Birch algorithm whose main characteristics refer to the fact that it can be especially suitable for very large databases and it can work both with categorical attributes and mixed features. Effectiveness and performance of the CBC procedure were compared with those of the well-known K-modes clustering algorithm, demonstrating that the CBC summary process does not affect the final clustering, while execution times can be drastically lessened.", "paper_title": "Clustering based on compressed data for categorical and mixed attributes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100090"}
