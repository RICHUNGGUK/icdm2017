The flow is solved on a fixed Cartesian grid and the solid objects are represented by surface elements. Our strategy is based on two main originalities: the generation and management of the objects are ensured by computer graphics software and front-tracking methods, while the coupling between the flow and the obstacle grids is ensured by a fictitious domain approach and new high-order penalty techniques. Several validation problems are presented to demonstrate the interest and accuracy of the method.
