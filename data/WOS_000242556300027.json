A flatten 3dB loss spectrum LPG with bandwidth over 100nm is designed as an example to show the effectiveness of the PSO algorithm. To improve the capability of optimization algorithm, we use the improved LPSO version proposed recently. This 3dB LPG is a key component of multi-channel filter in optical communications and optical sensors. The results showed that the intelligent PSO algorithm is very powerful and can be used for complex optimization problem.", "paper_title": "Optimal designing of multi-channel WDM filter using intelligent particle swarm optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300027"}
