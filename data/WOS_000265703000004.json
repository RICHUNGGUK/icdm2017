In this paper, assuming that an update script between original and updated DTDs is available, we consider inferring a transformation algorithm from the original DTD and the update script such that the algorithm transforms each document valid against the original DTD into a document valid against the updated DTD. We first show a transformation algorithm inferred from a DTD and an update script. We next show a sufficient condition under which the transformation algorithm inferred from a DTD d and an update script is unambiguous, i.e., for any document valid against d, elements to be deleted/inserted can unambiguously be determined. Finally, we show a polynomial-time algorithm for testing the sufficient condition.", "paper_title": "An XML Transformation Algorithm Inferred from an Update Script between DTDs", "paper_id": "WOS:000265703000004"}
