Motivated by wavelength assignment for multicasts in optical networks, we introduce and study n-fibre colourings of labelled digraphs. These are colourings of the arcs of D such that at each vertex nu, and for each colour alpha. in(nu,alpha) + out(nu,alpha) <= n with in (nu, alpha) the number of arcs coloured alpha entering nu and out(nu, alpha) the number of labels l such that there is at least one arc of label l leaving nu and coloured with alpha. The problem is to find the minimum number of colours lambda(n)(D) such that the m-labelled digraph D has an n-fibre colouring. In the particular case when D is 1-labelled, lambda(1) (D) is called the directed star arboricity of D, and is denoted by dst(D). We first show that dst(D) <= 2 Delta(-)(D) + 1. and conjecture that if Delta(-)(D) >= 2. then dst(D) <= 2 Delta(-)(D). We also prove that for a subcubic digraph D, then dst(D) <= 3, and that if Delta(+)(D), Delta(-)(D) <= 2, then dst(D) <= 4. Finally. we study lambda(n)(m,k) = max{lambda(n)(D) vertical bar D is m-labelled and Delta(-)(D) <= k}. we show that if m >= n, then [m/n [k/n] + l/n] <= lambda(n)(m,k) <= [m/n[k/n] + k/n] + C m(2) logk/n for some constant C. We conjecture that the lower bound should be the correct value of lambda(n)(m, k).", "paper_title": "WDM and Directed Star Arboricity", "paper_id": "WOS:000275237800001"}
