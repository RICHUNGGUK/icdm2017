Design/methodology/approach - The first approach study leading to optimize the rotor's structure and parameters, realized using finite element method-based software is presented. Rotor with two layers and rotor with ferromagnetic so-called \"teeth\" crossing external layer are discussed. Findings - It is shown that the rotor with teeth ensures higher torque and efficiency, but a negative slot effect appears, which is, however, possible to reduce. Research limitations/implications - Limitations in the 3D simulations, especially lack of the movement modeling possibility. For the future the study of some other parameters such as the influence of the magnetic material's saturation, the geometrical from of the tooth and the appearance of the higher harmonics in the signal connected to the non-sinusodial coupling between the rotor and the stator is considered, as well as the experimental confirmation. Originality/value - New structure of the spherical actuator's rotor and its advantages are presented.", "paper_title": "Finite element modeling of a two-degree of freedom spherical actuator", "paper_id": "WOS:000237037300013"}
