In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling a workforce consisting entirely of part-time workers. The part-time workers have availabilities, preferences for the shifts, and also a seniority level. We propose an integer programming model to maximize employee satisfaction and to meet the demand requirements for each shift. The model is tested on randomly generated instances. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of branch-and-cut methods in reducing computation time. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
