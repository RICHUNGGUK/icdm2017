Despite of its short history, georeferenced media has been attracting attentions from several major research communities of Computer Vision, Multimedia, Digital Libraries and KDD. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on recent research and applications on online georeferenced media. Specifically, the survey focuses on four aspects: (1) organizing and browsing georeferenced media resources, (2) mining semantic/social knowledge from georeferenced media, (3) learning landmarks in the world, and (4) estimating geographic location of a photo. Furthermore, based on the current technical achievements, open research issues and challenges are identified, and directions that can lead to compelling applications are suggested.", "paper_title": "Research and applications on georeferenced multimedia: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000286103800004"}
