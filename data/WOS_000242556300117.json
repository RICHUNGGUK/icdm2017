We pointed out that he peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed image degrades a little while the complexity decreases sharply when adding pretreatment block before DWT. On the other hand, OFDM can get good performance in the frequency selective fading channel. So in this paper, a JSCC scheme based on adaptive wavelet pretreatment for image transmission over MIMO-OFDM system was analyzed. What's more, the wavelet pretreatment block is loaded adaptively according to the channel condition. Simulation shows that: after adding the pretreatment block before DWT and post-treatment to the reconstructed image in good channel condition, the complexity of the SPIHT and the channel coder decreases sharply due to the compression ratio, but the PSNR of the receivedimage loses only a little; when the channel condition is getting worse the pretreatment block is deleted accordingly.", "paper_title": "Joint source-channel coding based on adaptive wavelet pretreatment for image transmission over frequency selective fading channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300117"}
