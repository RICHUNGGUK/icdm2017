The corresponding equivalence classes either coincide or are disjoint. This behaviour is lost when moving on to a fuzzy T-equivalence relation. However, none of the existing studies on fuzzy rough set theory tries to exploit the fact that an element can belong to some degree to several \"soft similarity classes\" at the same time. In this paper we show that taking this truly fuzzy characteristic into account may lead to new and interesting definitions of lower and upper approximations. We explore two of them in detail an e investigate under which conditions they differ from the commonly used definitions. Finally we show the possible practical relevance of the newly introduced approximations for query refinement.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy rough sets: The forgotten step", "paper_id": "WOS:000244803400010"}
