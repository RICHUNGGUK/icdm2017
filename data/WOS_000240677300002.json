The residual is generated using full-order proportional-integral ( PI) observers. The approach is based on a result for PI observer design recently proposed. In terms of the design degrees of freedom provided by the parametric PI observer design and a group of introduced parameter vectors, a sufficient and necessary condition for PI observer design with disturbance decoupling is established. By properly constraining the design parameters according to this proposed condition, the effect of the disturbance to the residual signal is decoupled, and a simple algorithm is presented. The presented approach offers all the degrees of design freedom. A numerical example illustrates the effect of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Robust fault detection in linear systems based on PI observers", "paper_id": "WOS:000240677300002"}
