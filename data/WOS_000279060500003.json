By taking the relationship among the time-varying delay, its upper bound and their difference into account, some less conservative LMI-based delay-dependent stability criteria are obtained without ignoring any useful terms in the derivative of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the merits of the proposed methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
