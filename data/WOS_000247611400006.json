The algorithm of discrete rotations that we consider is the discretized rotation. It simply consists in the composition of a Euclidean rotation with a rounding operation, as studied in [B. Nouvel, E. Remila, On colorations induced by discrete rotations, in: DGCI, in: LNCS, vol. 2886, 2003, pp. 174-183; B. Nouvel, E. Remila, Characterization of bijective discretized rotations, in: International Workshop on Combinatorial Images Analysis, 10th International Conference, IWCIA 2004, Auckland, New Zealand, December 1-4, 2004, in: LNCS, vol. 3322, 2004, pp. 248-259; B. Nouvel, E. Remila, Configurations induced by discrete rotations: Periodicity and quasiperiodicity properties, Discrete Appl. Math. 2-3 (147) (2005) 325-343]. It is possible to encode all the information concerning a discrete rotation as two multidimensional words C-alpha and C-alpha' that we call configurations. In this paper, we introduce two discrete dynamical systems defined by a Z(2)-action on the two-dimensional torus that allow us to describe the configurations C-alpha and C-alpha' via a suitable symbolic coding; a we then deduce various combinatorial properties for both families of configurations, and in particular, results concerning densities of symbol occurrence.
