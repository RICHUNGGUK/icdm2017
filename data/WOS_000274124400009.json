The minimum transmission time encoding problem in multi-rate wireless networks was investigated. Firstly, the problem is formulated as a minimum weighted clique partition of graph and proven to be NP-complete. Moreover, a heuristic minimum transmission rate first encoding (MTRFE) algorithm is proposed. The simulation results show that the MTRFE algorithm can decrease up to 16% the transmission time than the minimum number of transmissions encoding algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
