We employ unidimensional (1-D) integer lattice codes and 1-D perfect difference codes to construct the 2-D hybrid codes. This proposed system can suppress the phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) and has the multiuser interference (MUI) cancellation property. In comparison with the other systems using the 2-D maximal-area matrices codes (2-D MM codes), the 2-D perfect difference codes (2-D PD codes), and the 2-D spatial division multiplexing balanced incomplete block design codes (2-D S-BIBD codes), the numerical results show that the proposed system has the superior performance.", "paper_title": "Noncoherent Spectral/Spatial OCDMA System Using Two-Dimensional Hybrid Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000284851400001"}
