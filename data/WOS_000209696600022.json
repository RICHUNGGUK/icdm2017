CEDEEP takes advantage of spatiotemporal correlation of wireless sensor nodes' reporting in event driven WSN and uses collaborative communication to conserve more energy. The presented analytical results prove viability of this approach and show that CEDEEP offers considerable improvements in energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Event Driven Energy Efficient Protocol (CEDEEP)", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696600022"}
