One of the observations made from the high-volume production test data is that dies that fail due to a systematic failure have a tendency to form certain unique patterns that manifest as defect clusters at the wafer level. Identifying and categorising such clusters is a crucial step towards manufacturing yield improvement and implementation of real-time statistical process control. Addressing the semiconductor industry's needs, this research proposes an automatic defect cluster recognition system for semiconductor wafers that achieves up to 95% accuracy (depending on the product type).
