The most important feature of the algorithm is that it is immune against an adversary that may scramble a certain number of communication steps. The previous algorithms presented in the literature provide false estimations if an adversary causes certain communication collisions.", "paper_title": "Adversary immune size approximation of single-hop radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800014"}
