First, a kinematics model of the nonholonomic CLMR is introduced. Then, according to the Lagrange formula, a dynamic model of the CLMR is created. For a real time trajectory tracking problem, an optimal controller capable of effectively driving the CLMR to track the desired trajectory is necessary. Therefore, an AFSMDC is proposed to accomplish the tracking task and to reduce the effect of the external disturbances and system uncertainties of the CLMR. The proposed controller could reduce the tracking errors between the output of the velocity controller and the real velocity of the CLMR. Therefore, the CLMR could track the desired trajectory without posture and orientation errors. Additionally, the stability of the proposed controller is proven by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed AFSMDC.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Control of Dynamic Model Based Car-Like Mobile Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000274602000006"}
