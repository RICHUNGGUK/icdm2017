The presented strategy discriminates the best mobility protocol to be used based on a scheduling policy. It is specifically designed for an integrated network architecture to provide PSDR organizations using TETRA and TETRA2 systems with the capability to exploit WiFi and WiMAX broadband access technologies in order to enjoy advanced services. The article presents the operational scenarios where integration between TETRA and WiFi/WiMAX is needed and the main resulting benefits. Performances of the suggested VHO management scheme are described and evaluated against other protocol solutions.", "paper_title": "Performance comparison of vertical handover strategies for PSDR heterogeneous networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257074400010"}
