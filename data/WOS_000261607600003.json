Our development is motivated by sensor placement applications in engineering, which requires optimizing certain complicated \"black-box\" objective function. The proposed method is able to enhance the optimization efficiency and effectiveness as compared to a few alternative strategies. AEMC falls into the category of adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms and is the first adaptive MCMC algorithm that simulates multiple Markov chains in parallel. A theorem about the ergodicity property of the AEMC algorithm is stated and proven. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method by applying it to a sensor placement problem in a manufacturing process, as well as to a standard Griewank test function.", "paper_title": "Adaptive evolutionary Monte Carlo algorithm for optimization with applications to sensor placement problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000261607600003"}
