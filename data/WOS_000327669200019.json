For the first time, silicon strip detectors have been fabricated over an area as large as 20.25 cm(2) with an ultra low thickness of 20 or 10 mu m in order to reduce the material budget and hence the beam degradation provoked by the sensor. In this work, we describe the novel design and its fabrication process. Afterwards, we present the first electrical characterizations compared to the application requirements. The novel devices and their fabrication process are validated through measurements and simulations. A low strip-to-strip behavior variation is demonstrated as well as a very good interstrip insulation and a very low leakage current. These novel fabricated devices constitute a very promising technology for future hadron therapy beam monitoring.", "paper_title": "VALIDATION OF A NOVEL ULTRA-THIN SILICON STRIP DETECTOR FOR HADRON THERAPY BEAM MONITORING", "paper_id": "WOS:000327669200019"}
