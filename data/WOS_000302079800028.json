We formalize this new problem and we extend security results by Tillich et al. on this very problem. This enables us to prove the security of this protocol using information theoretical arguments.", "paper_title": "Code Reverse Engineering Problem for Identification Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000302079800028"}
