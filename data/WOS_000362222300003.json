Objective - The objective of this study is to identify the challenges of the existing tools used in GSD projects. Method - The authors applied the systematic literature review (SLR) approach and a survey-based empirical study approach to address the research objective. Results - From both data sets, the authors identified eight challenges of the existing tools used in GSD projects. The top-ranked challenges in the SLR are the inappropriate use of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools' and difficulties in adopting and learning to use the existing tools'. The top-ranked challenges in the questionnaire-based empirical study are the lack of awareness of existing tools used in GSD projects' and the lack of support for collaboration and group decision making'. The results show a weak negative correlation between the ranks obtained from the SLR and the questionnaire-based empirical study ((r(s)(8) = -0.313), p = 0.450) Conclusion: GSD organisations should address the challenges of the existing tools used in GSD projects, especially the most common ones.", "paper_title": "Empirical investigation of the challenges of the existing tools used in global software development projects", "paper_id": "WOS:000362222300003"}
