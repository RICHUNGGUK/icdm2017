In addition, communication links between nodes are unpredictable and unstable. These factors make the design of routing protocols for such a network very challenging. We propose a scalable, efficient and reliable routing protocol called EAR that provides reliable data delivery from nodes to hubs in a wireless sensor network. Simulation results have shown EAR outperforming existing routing protocols.", "paper_title": "A scalable, efficient and reliable routing protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600042"}
