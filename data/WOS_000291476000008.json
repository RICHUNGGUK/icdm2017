However, there have been few studies on multilingual document clustering to date. In particular, it is not known whether clustering techniques are effective in medium- or large-scale multilingual document sets. For scalability, techniques should be based on dictionary-based translation and a single- or double-pass clustering algorithm. This article reports on experiments of applying multilingual document clustering to medium-scale sets of English, French, German and Italian documents (Reuters news articles). The results show that the double-pass algorithm has a positive effect in the case that each document is translated. On the other hand, the cluster translation strategy in which clusters obtained by applying a clustering algorithm to each language document set are translated has almost no effect. Also, translation disambiguation techniques can improve, but only slightly, the effectiveness of clustering.", "paper_title": "Double-pass clustering technique for multilingual document collections", "paper_id": "WOS:000291476000008"}
