Many methods have been provided to predict the functions of proteins based on sequence similarity. However, they are often inadequate in the absence of similar sequences or when the sequence similarity among known protein sequences is statistically weak. This study aimed to choose some nearest samples dataset at length for identifying protein function, irrespective of sequence and structural similarities. The results of our experiment show that our method is efficient.", "paper_title": "An Approach for Data Selection of Protein Function Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000289039800012"}
