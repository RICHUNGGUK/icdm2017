We observe that the outer codes are nothing but the constituents of the quasi-cyclic code in the sense of Ling-Sole. This concatenated structure enables us to recover some earlier results on quasi-cyclic codes in a simple way, including one of our recent results which says that a quasi-cyclic code with cyclic constituent codes are 2-D cyclic codes. In fact, we obtain a generalization of this result to multidimensional cyclic codes. The concatenated structure also yields a lower bound on the minimum distance of quasi-cyclic codes, as noted by Jensen, which we call Jensen's bound. We show that a recent lower bound on the minimum distance of quasi-cyclic codes that we obtained is in general better than Jensen's lower bound.", "paper_title": "The Concatenated Structure of Quasi-Cyclic Codes and an Improvement of Jensen's Bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000313728800018"}
