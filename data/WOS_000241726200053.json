Motivated by the fact that the main applications of semistructured data involve distributed data sources, we focus next on the distributed evaluation of the weight-enhanced path queries. We present a distributed algorithm for evaluating our proposed queries in a multi-source setting. Our algorithm is general in the sense that it does not assume a known topology of the network and it can work using asynchronous communication. This algorithm can also be used to solve multi-source shortest path problems for which the full graph is not known in advance. To the best of our knowledge our algorithm is the first to address this problem in such a setting.", "paper_title": "Enhanced regular path queries on semistructured databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200053"}
