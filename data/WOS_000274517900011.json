Design/methodology/approach - The problem of optimal current commutation control is solved by off-line selection of switching-on and switching-off angles. Selection of optimal values of angles is provided on computer model of the drive with help of particle swarm optimisation method. The optimal angle values are detected as functions of phase current and rotor speed. These calculated optimal values are stored in microcomputer control system memory in form of two-input look-up tables. The results are validated on laboratory set up. Findings - Three different criteria of optimal control, which are taken into account: the maximum electromagnetic torque for given reference current, the maximum ratio of electromagnetic torque to root mean square value of phase current and the minimum electromagnetic torque ripples, gave a good results validated by simulation and experimental investigations. Practical implications - A simple control method is proposed to optimise switched reluctance motors drive behaviour Such an approach can be recommended for practical implementations. Originality/value - The off-line optimisation of switching angles, which is realised on computer model, is sufficient to obtain a good control effect.", "paper_title": "Optimal control of current switching angles for high-speed SRM drive", "paper_id": "WOS:000274517900011"}
