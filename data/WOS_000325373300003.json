In order to compensate the uncertainties of the stator and rotor resistances and the off set of measured current, sliding mode feedbacks were added to the voltage model observer. To reduce the effect of the errors that are injected from the observer to the prediction model in the sensorless application, the prediction model was also reinforced by a sliding mode feedback. The feedback gains for the prediction and observer models are assigned by a robustness H infinity analysis. This method reduces the sensitivity of the sensorless predictive algorithm to the parameter variation. In order to verify the proposed method, simulation and experimental results are presented in a wide speed range.", "paper_title": "Robust sensorless predictive control of induction motors with sliding mode voltage model observer", "paper_id": "WOS:000325373300003"}
