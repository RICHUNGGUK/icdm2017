Our coefficients differ from the preceding one by that every point has its own weight. The results show that our algorithm could give a better answer, especially when a single point cloud has folded parts as well as thick parts.", "paper_title": "An adaptive variation model for point cloud normal computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000358327400014"}
