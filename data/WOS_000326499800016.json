We first present a new total relationship flow management theorem (TRFMT), which, combined with the two previously published TRFMTs, provides a theoretical foundation for the OD framework. We then apply the TRFMTs to determine the factors of OD and their logical relationships, which constitute an OD framework with a focus on the design of the total relationship flow of an organization. As an example, we conduct an OD exercise following the framework with a set of preselected parameters, and produce an organization sample, called an OD sample. The OD framework and sample enable managers to develop a blueprint of their organization, facilitating their work on conducting systematic and efficient OD. The TRFMTs, and the OD framework and sample suggest the emergence of a new organization theory-the total relationship flow management theory.", "paper_title": "Developing an Organization Design Framework and Sample Based on the Total Relationship Flow Management Theorems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326499800016"}
