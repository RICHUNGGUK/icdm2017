We approximately characterize (within a universal constant) the capacity region for the Gaussian IC with intermittent feedback. We exactly characterize the capacity region of the linear deterministic version of the problem, which gives us insight into the Gaussian problem. We find that the characterization only depends on the forward channel parameters and the marginal probability distribution of each feedback link. The result shows that passive and unreliable feedback can be harnessed to provide multiplicative capacity gain in Gaussian ICs. We find that when the feedback links are active with sufficiently large probabilities, the perfect feedback sum-capacity is achieved to within a constant gap. In contrast to other schemes developed for IC with feedback, our achievable scheme makes use of quantize-map-and-forward to relay the information obtained through feedback, performs forward decoding, and does not use structured codes. We also develop new outer bounds enabling us to obtain the (approximate) characterization of the capacity region.", "paper_title": "Gaussian Interference Channel With Intermittent Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900009"}
