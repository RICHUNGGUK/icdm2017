One of the possibilities for improving teaching and learning processes, and consequently, the knowledge flow, is to explore successful past experiences, resulting from the modeling and execution of previous processes. This work presents Thoth, a web-environment which aims at knowledge reuse, during the planning, design and execution of teaching and learning activities. This approach is integrated with a Case Based Reasoning approach, also described in this paper, with workflow systems and the use of ontologies.", "paper_title": "Reusing experiences for an effective learning in a web-based context", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000102"}
