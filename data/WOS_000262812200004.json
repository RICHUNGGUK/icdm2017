An intensity independent PSF was first deduced by statistical approximation. Based oil the PSF, a motion adaptive deblurring filter was proposed to restore the original image. The simulation of motion blurred and deblurred natural images were presented. The results indicate that the proposed deblurring filter can significantly reduce the visible blurring artifact on LCD, which has a simple one-dimensional structure and call be integrated into other video processing algorithms, e.g. frame rate doubling, to further improve the image quality.
