In this work, we introduce the concept of trusted attribute to build a novel framework for hierarchical trusted access and feasible remediation. The categorization of trusted attribute is justified primarily in terms of the point in the boot cycle of a system at which the respective attributes are measured. The concept of trusted attribute is extended to the notion of a \"trusted grade\" that is granted by a new added module so-called trusted level division function. Also we give a reasonable example of dividing trusted grades. We discuss the promising applications of our presented framework and the access procedure of terminal. The simulations show that by the proposed framework, not only the security and reliability of network can be ensured, but also the flexibility of terminal to access network is improved. And that the presented framework can provide necessary supports for interoperability of different equipment manufacturers. It also can be concluded that the presented remediation framework is easy to be deployed, by which the convenient and reliable remediation services are able to be offered to those terminals without achieving the security standards of local network.
