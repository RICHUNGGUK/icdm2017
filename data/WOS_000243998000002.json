In contrast to the Itai-Rodeh algorithm, our algorithms are finite-state. So they can be analyzed using explicit state space exploration; we used the probabilistic model checker PRISM to verify, for rings up to size four, that eventually a unique leader is elected with probability one. Furthermore, we give a manual correctness proof for each algorithm.", "paper_title": "Variations on Itai-Rodeh leader election for anonymous rings and their analysis in PRISM", "paper_id": "WOS:000243998000002"}
