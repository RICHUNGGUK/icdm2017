Yet, HRIS adoption remains an under-researched phenomenon. The purpose of this paper to isolate the factors that influence the organizational adoption of HRIS in public sector organizations. Design/methodology/approach - Adopting the technology-organization-environment model as an analytical framework, the paper draws on qualitative evidence from 16 interviews across 11 Australian public sector organizations. Findings - The authors find that champions in public sector organizations should demonstrate HRIS benefits before their adoption can succeed. With standardization trends adopted by HRIS vendors, complete organizational fit between adopted HRIS and business processes may be elusive for adopters suggesting that post-adoption vendor support must be negotiated if costly customizations are to be minimized. In addition to various organizational factors, including management commitment and human capability, the authors also find that broader environmental factors including regulatory compliance can have a deep impact on the success of HRIS adoption by creating urgency in adoption intentions. Originality/value - There is paucity of research concerning HRIS adoption in the public sector which presents unique challenges due to its idiosyncrasies. This paper contributes to the existing body knowledge by investigating the role of technological, organizational, and environmental factors and their interactions. It provides an improved understanding of the challenges related to HRIS adoption in public sector organizations.", "paper_title": "Exploring the public sector adoption of HRIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291136900008"}
