In this algorithm, spectral and spatial features are selected from seizure and non-seizure EEG signals by Gabor functions and principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, four features based on heart rate acceleration are extracted from ECG signals to form feature vector. Then a neural network classifier based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) learning algorithm is developed to determine an optimal nonlinear decision boundary. This classifier allows to adjust the parameters of the neural network classifier, efficiently. This algorithm can automatically detect the presence of seizures with minimum delay which is an important factor from a clinical viewpoint. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 154 h records and 633 seizures from 12 patients. The results indicate that the algorithm can recognize the seizures with the smallest latency and higher good detection rate (GDR) than other presented algorithms in the literature.
