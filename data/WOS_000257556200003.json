There are two difficulties for commercial crude oil optimizing controllers: (1) the optimization is stable only in some special conditions, the simplex-base algorithm is not robust; (2) the optimal control should be realized on-line and it cannot be analyzed off-line based on the history data. In this paper, we propose a neural networks approach to overcome these two drawbacks. We first we use a recurrent neural networks to solve the linear programming with bias update. Then we use a static neural networks to modeling crude oil blending process based on the history data. Input-to-state stability approach is applied to access robust learning algorithms of the neural networks. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the successful application of neural networks on optimization.", "paper_title": "Optimization of crude oil blending with neural networks and bias update scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000257556200003"}
