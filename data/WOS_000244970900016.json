Typically, face representations obtained by ICA involve unsupervised learning and high-order statistics. In this paper, we develop an enhancement of the generic ICA by augmenting this method by the Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA); hence, its abbreviation, FICA.. The FICA is systematically developed and presented along with its underlying architecture. A comparative analysis explores four distance metrics, as well as classification with support vector machines (SVMs). We demonstrate that the FICA approach leads to the formation of well-separated classes in low-dimension subspace and is endowed with a great deal of insensitivity to large variation in illumination and facial expression. The comprehensive experiments are completed for the facial-recognition technology (FERET) face database; a comparative analysis demonstrates that FICA comes with improved classification rates when compared with some other conventional approaches such as eigenface, fisherface, and the ICA itself.", "paper_title": "Face recognition using an enhanced independent component analysis approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000244970900016"}
