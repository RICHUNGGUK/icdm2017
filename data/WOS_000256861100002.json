To realize this system, several techniques to model and capture the personal characteristics instantly in face, body, gesture, hair and voice by combining computer graphics, computer vision and speech signal processing technique. Anyway, all of the modeling, casting, character synthesis, rendering and compositing processes have to be performed on real-time without any operator, In this paper, first a novel entertainment system, Future Cast System (FCS), is introduced which can create DIM movie with audience's participation by replacing the original roles' face in a pre-created CG movie with audiences' own highly realistic 3D CG faces. Then the effects of DIM movie on audience experience are evaluated subjectively. The result suggests that most of the participants are seeking for higher realism, impression and satisfaction by replacing not only face part but also body, hair and voice. The first experimental trial demonstration of FCS was performed at the Mitsui-Toshiba pavilion of the 2005 World: Exposition in Aichi Japan. Then, 1,640,000 people have experienced this event during 6 months of exhibition and FCS became one of the most popular events at Expo.2005.", "paper_title": "Dive into the Movie audience-driven immersive experience in the story", "paper_id": "WOS:000256861100002"}
