We report the first example for a successful application of the structure-based virtual screening to identify the novel inhibitors of MKP-1. It is shown that the efficiency of virtual screening can be enhanced significantly by the incorporation of a new solvation energy term in the scoring function. The newly found inhibitors have desirable physicochemical properties as a drug candidate and reveal a moderate potency with IC(50) values ranging from 20 to 50 mu M. Therefore, they deserve a consideration for further development by structure-activity relationship studies to optimize the inhibitory activities. Structural features relevant to the stabilization of the inhibitors in the active site of MKP-1 are discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Identification of novel inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 with structure-based virtual screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000291261700007"}
