However, it can be equivalently implemented via image-row-based principal component analysis. This paper presents a structured 2-D method called nuclear norm-based 2-DPCA (N-2-DPCA), which uses a nuclear norm-based reconstruction error criterion. The nuclear norm is a matrix norm, which can provide a structured 2-D characterization for the reconstruction error image. The reconstruction error criterion is minimized by converting the nuclear norm-based optimization problem into a series of F-norm-based optimization problems. In addition, N-2-DPCA is extended to a bilateral projection-based N-2-DPCA (N-B2-DPCA). The virtue of N-B2-DPCA over N-2-DPCA is that an image can be represented with fewer coefficients. N-2-DPCA and N-B2-DPCA are applied to face recognition and reconstruction and evaluated using the Extended Yale B, CMU PIE, FRGC, and AR databases. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Nuclear Norm-Based 2-DPCA for Extracting Features From Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000362358800003"}
