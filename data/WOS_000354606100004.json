Thus, a key issue is the coordination of plant operations considering the supply of intermediates between various plants. Time-consuming setup and cleaning activities require production to be carried out in campaigns. We propose an application-oriented approach for supply network planning in the pharmaceutical industry which is based on a novel aggregation scheme and a disjunctive graph representation of the problem. A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed based on a continuous representation of time. Our approach generates a comprehensive schedule which coordinates the production activities, including the campaigns in the network. Numerical results show that our approach yields solutions for small- and medium-sized problem instances very quickly and is even capable of coping with the complexity of real world problems.
