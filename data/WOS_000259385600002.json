Cellular Systems present several challenges, Such as channel assignment, which are exacerbated by Multimedia service traffic and all increasing number of subscribers. Recently, a clustered multihop cellular network (cMCN) architecture that complements traditional cellular systems has been proposed and studied using fixed channel assignment (FCA). However, the performance of FCA is limited when the traffic pattern varies in a service area. This paper proposes the use of dedicated information ports (DIPs) as clusterheads in cMCN, followed by a multihop dynamic channel assignment (mDCA) scheme. The mDCA works by assigning channels based on information about interference in Surrounding cells. Two different channel searching strategies are developed and evaluated. Through computer simulation, we show that the proposed mDCA is able to achieve it significantly improved capacity which is maintained when the number of system channels is increased. Finally, issues regarding the implementation of the mDCA and future work on this topic are discussed.
