Two-dimensional RCWFs are nonseparable and oriented, which improves characterization of oriented textures. Robust and efficient isotropic rotationally invariant features are extracted from DT-RCWF and DT-CWT decomposed subbands. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this new set of features on four different sets of rotated and nonrotated databases. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves retrieval accuracy from 83.17% to 93.71% on a small size (208 images) nonrotated database D1, from 82.71% to 90.86% on a small size (208 images) rotated database D2, from 72.18% to 76.09% on a medium-size (640 images) rotated database D3, and from 64.17% to 78.93% on a large size (1856 images) rotated database D4, compared with the discrete wavelet transform-based approach. New method also retains comparable levels of computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Rotation-invariant texture image retrieval using rotated complex wavelet filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000242690600009"}
