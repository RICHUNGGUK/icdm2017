However, efficient content-based searching remains a serious challenge of large scale peer-to-peer network. In this paper, we present SemreX, a peer-to-peer system for sharing literature documents. Two main features of SemreX networks are 1) semantic supported literature document retrieval function is provided and 2) peers are self-organized into a semantic overlay according to the similarity of documents which belongs to different topics and queries are routed to semantically similar peers to reduce messages. Experiment results show that SemreX improves search efficiency for literature document retrieval in peer-to-peer network.", "paper_title": "SemreX: A semantic peer-to-peer system for literature documents retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800064"}
