In this paper, we propose a discriminative semi-Markov model approach, and define a set of features over boundary frames, segments, as well as neighboring segments. This enable us to conveniently capture a combination of local and global features that best represent each specific action type. To efficiently solve the inference problem of simultaneous segmentation and recognition, a Viterbi-like dynamic programming algorithm is utilized, which in practice is able to process 20 frames per second. Moreover, the model is discriminatively learned from large margin principle, and is formulated as an optimization problem with exponentially many constraints. To solve it efficiently, we present two different optimization algorithms, namely cutting plane method and bundle method, and demonstrate that each can be alternatively deployed in a \"plug and play\" fashion. From its theoretical aspect, we also analyze the generalization error of the proposed approach and provide a PAC-Bayes bound. The proposed approach is evaluated on a variety of datasets, and is shown to perform competitively to the state-of-the-art methods. For example, on KTH dataset, it achieves 95.0% recognition accuracy, where the best known result on this dataset is 93.4% (Reddy and Shah in ICCV, 2009).", "paper_title": "Human Action Segmentation and Recognition Using Discriminative Semi-Markov Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000288673000002"}
