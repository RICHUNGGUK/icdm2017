The problem seeks to find an optimal clustering of traffic demands in the network such that the total cost of optical add-drop multiplexer (OADM) and optical cross-connect (OXC) is minimized, while satisfying the OADM ring capacity constraint, the node cardinality constraint, and the OXC capacity constraint. We formulate the problem as an integer programming model and propose several alternative modeling techniques designed to improve the mathematical representation of the problem. We then develop various classes of valid inequalities to tighten the mathematical formulation of the problem and describe an algorithmic approach that coordinates tailored routines with a commercial solver CPLEX. We also propose an effective tabu search procedure for finding a good feasible solution as well as for providing a good incumbent solution for the column generation based heuristic procedure that enhances the solvability of the problem. Computational results exhibit the viability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A ring-mesh topology design problem for optical transport networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254202000004"}
