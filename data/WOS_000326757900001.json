This is because an efficient topology structure significantly affects the quality of service and lifetime of WSNs. In the present work, we study the sensor deployment problem and propose novel distributed decision schemes to guide sensor movement to achieve k-coverage deployment. In our schemes, the kth order Voronoi diagram is used to discover the regions that do not meet the k-coverage requirement. Two different movement strategies are designed to determine the optimal location of each mobile sensor through local topological information. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed schemes.", "paper_title": "Distributed k-Coverage Decision Scheme for System Deployment in Mobile Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326757900001"}
