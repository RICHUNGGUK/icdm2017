Often, these capacity gains are achievable only with some form of adaptive transmission. In this paper, we study the capacity loss (defined as the rate loss in bits/s/Hz) of the MIMO wireless system when the covariance matrix of the transmitted signal vector is designed using a low rate feedback channel. For the MIMO channel, we find a bound on the ergodic capacity loss when random codebooks, generated from the uniform distribution on the complex unit sphere, are used to convey the second order statistics of the transmitted signal from the receiver to the transmitter. In this case, we find a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity loss as a function of the number of bits fed back at each channel realization. These results show that the capacity loss decreases at least as O(2(-B/(2MMt-2))) where B is the number of feedback bits, M-t is the number of transmit antennas, and M = min{M-r, M-i} where M-r is the number of receive antennas. In the high SNR regime, we present a new bound on the capacity loss that is tighter than the previously derived bound and show that the capacity loss decreases exponentially as a function of the number of feedback bits.", "paper_title": "Feedback rate-capacity loss tradeoff for limited feedback MIMO systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237147400028"}
