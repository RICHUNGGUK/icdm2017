The effectiveness of STATCOM gain and phase modulation channels to improve the damping characteristics is investigated. The coordination among the internal ac and dc voltage controllers and the proposed damping controllers on each channel is designed. Differential evolution as an intelligent optimization technique is considered to design the STATCOM supplementary damping controllers. The STATCOM-based stabilizer is implemented on a real-time digital simulator (RTDS). The RTDS experimental setup of STATCOM with a power system is verified. The nonlinear time domain simulation of the considered power system is presented to validate the proposed damping stabilizers of low frequency oscillations. Comparisons with the reported results in the literature demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stabilizer.", "paper_title": "RTDS Implementation of STATCOM-Based Power System Stabilizers", "paper_id": "WOS:000339449300006"}
