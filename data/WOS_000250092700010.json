Fault tolerant programming environments should be used to guarantee the safe execution of critical applications. Research in fault tolerant MPIs has led to the development of several fault tolerant MPI environments. Different approaches are being proposed using a variety of fault tolerant message passing protocols based on coordinated checkpointing or message logging. The most popular approach is with coordinated checkpointing. In the literature, two different concepts of coordinated checkpointing have been proposed: blocking and non-blocking. However they have never been compared quantitatively, and their respective scalabilities remain unknown. The contribution of this paper is to provide the first comparison between these two approaches and a study of their scalabilities. We have implemented the two approaches within the MPICH environments and evaluate their performance using the NAS parallel benchmarks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
