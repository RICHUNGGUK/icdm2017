An n-vertex graph G is said to be hypoenergetic if E(G) < n and strongly hypoenergetic if E(G) < n - 1. A connected graph with cyclomatic number k is called a k-cyclic graph. In this paper, we consider hypoenergetic and strongly hypoenergetic k-cyclic graphs. We first show that there exist hypoenergetic and strongly hypoenergetic k-cyclic graphs of order n and maximum degree Delta for all (suitable large) n and Delta. Then we show that for Delta >= 4 there exist hypoenergetic unicyclic, bicyclic and tricyclic graphs for all n except very few small values of n. For Delta <= 3 we show that K(2,3) is the unique hypoenergetic graph among all unicyclic and bicyclic graphs.", "paper_title": "Hypoenergetic and Strongly Hypoenergetic k-Cyclic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000281508800004"}
