We develop variational approximations for Bayesian inference in geoadditive regression models to provide a computationally attractive, fast alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Therefore we consider the class of latent Gaussian regression models where the distribution of the response can be represented as a location-scale mixture of Gaussians such that the calculation of quasi-full conditionals in the variational approximations is considerably facilitated. As special cases, we consider mean and quantile regression and evaluate the novel variational Bayes approaches in a simulation study. As an application, we focus on the analysis of technical efficiencies of British and Welsh farms where the response variable of interest is the output produced by a farm given specific input covariates.", "paper_title": "Variational approximations in geoadditive latent Gaussian regression: mean and quantile regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000361831500012"}
