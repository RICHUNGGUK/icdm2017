As error or uncertainty will not likely ever be completely eliminated, a better understanding of its impacts is necessary. Spatial analytical approaches, in particular, must somehow address data-quality issues. This can range from evaluating impacts of potential data uncertainty in planning processes that make use of methods to devising methods that explicitly account for error/uncertainty. To date, little has been done to structure methods accounting for error. This article develops an integrated approach to address data uncertainty in spatial optimization. We demonstrate that it is possible to characterize uncertainty impacts by constructing and solving a new multi-objective model that explicitly incorporates facets of data uncertainty. Empirical findings indicate that the proposed approaches can be applied to evaluate the impacts of data uncertainty with statistical confidence, which moves beyond popular practices of simulating errors in data.", "paper_title": "An integrated approach for addressing geographic uncertainty in spatial optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000306525900005"}
