The algorithm that, given a connected graph G, outputs a spanning tree of G, is a 1/2-approximation. Indeed, if n is the number of vertices in G, any spanning tree in G has n-1 edges and any series-parallel graph on n vertices has at most 2n-3 edges. We present a 7/12 -approximation for this problem and results showing the limits of our approach.", "paper_title": "Maximum Series-Parallel Subgraph", "paper_id": "WOS:000299482700007"}
