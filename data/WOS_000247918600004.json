The power allocation with SINR feedback increases overall throughput for the decentralized systems., The advantages of the proposed scheme is that the first beam is not interfered by other beams guaranteeing quality of service (QoS) and other orthogonal beams are operated opportunistically to obtain multi user diversity. The computer simulation demonstrates that the proposed scheme is effective at a small number of users, which is common in cellular systems, and outperforms conventional spatial division multiple access (SDMA) opportunistic beamforming methods.", "paper_title": "Combined oportunistic beamforming methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000247918600004"}
