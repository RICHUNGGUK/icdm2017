In this paper, we propose a novel method for fitting a given 3D garment model onto human models of various body shapes and poses. The fitting is accomplished by deforming the garment mesh to match the shapes of the human models by using a combination of the following: skeleton-driven volumetric deformation, garment-human shape similarity matching and evaluation, the constraints of garment-human contact, and garment-human ease allowance. Experiments show that our approach performs very well and has the potential to be used in the garment design industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
