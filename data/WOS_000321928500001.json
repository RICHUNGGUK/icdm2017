The channel matrices of the legitimate users are fixed and revealed to all the terminals, whereas the channel matrices of the eavesdropper are arbitrarily varying and only known to the eavesdropper. The secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) region under a strong secrecy constraint is characterized. A transmission scheme that orthogonalizes the transmit signals of the two users at the intended receiver, and uses a single-user wiretap code for each user, is shown to achieve the s.d.o.f. region. The converse involves establishing an upper bound on a weighted-sum-rate expression. This is accomplished by using induction, where at each step one combines the secrecy and multiple-access constraints associated with an adversary eavesdropping a carefully selected group of sub-channels.", "paper_title": "MIMO Multiple Access Channel With an Arbitrarily Varying Eavesdropper: Secrecy Degrees of Freedom", "paper_id": "WOS:000321928500001"}
