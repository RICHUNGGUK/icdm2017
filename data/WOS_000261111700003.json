The verifier is able to prove memory safety of x86 machine code programs compiled from code that uses algebraic datatypes. The tool's Soundness theorem is expressed in tern-is of the bit-level semantics of x86 programs, so its correctness depends oil very few assumptions. We take advantage of Coq's support for programming with dependent types and modules ill the structure of the development. The approach is based oil developing a library of reusable functors for transforming a verifier at one level of abstraction into a verifier at a lower level. Using this library, it is possible to prototype a verifier based on a new type system with a minimal amount of work. while obtaining a very strong Soundness theorem about the final product.", "paper_title": "Modular development certified program verifiers with a proof assistant", "paper_id": "WOS:000261111700003"}
