In the work presented here, five different CKMs (Clinical Knowledge Managers) have been downloaded and the archetypes have been translated to OWL. This translation is based on an existing translator that has been improved to solve programming problems with certain structures. As part of the repository a tool has been developed to keep it always up-to-date. So, any change in one of the CKMs (addition, elimination or even change of an archetype) will involve translating the changed archetypes once more. The repository is accessible through a Web interface (http://www.openehr.es/).", "paper_title": "A Repository of Semantic Open EHR Archetypes", "paper_id": "WOS:000362593900008"}
