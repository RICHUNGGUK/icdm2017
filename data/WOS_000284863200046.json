First, the global trend indicator (GTI) is defined for evaluating the price change trend of the funds in the future. Then, based on GTI, we derive the monitoring indicator (MI) to measure whether the fund market is in the bull or bear state. Finally, to decide the signal for buying or selling funds, a genetic algorithm is invoked to dynamically select funds according to their past performances (profitability). In our experimental results from January 1999 to December 2008 (10 years in total), we achieve the annual profit higher than 10%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
