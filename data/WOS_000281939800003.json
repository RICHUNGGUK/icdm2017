Different examples of application are shown including the simultaneous analysis of multiple data sets and the implementation of local rank and trilinearity constraints, basic tools to reduce and eliminate rotation ambiguities. The program allows for an easy check of the extent of rotation ambiguity remaining in Multivariate Curve Resolution solutions in the investigation of a particular system and it also allows for the checking of the effect of applied constraints. In this way, conditions and limitations to achieve optimal solutions in Multivariate Curve Resolution are easily assessed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
