To replace conventional DRAMs with non-volatile PRAMs as the main memory components, comparable memory access latency, overall cost, power dissipation, and memory cell endurance should be supported. For these goals, we propose a new main memory system consisting of a DRAM converter and an array of single-level cell (SLC)/multi-level cell (MLC) PRAMs. The DRAM converter consists of an aggressive fetching superblock buffer to assure better use of spatial locality and a selective filtering buffer for better use of temporal locality. The array of the SLC/MLC hybrid PRAM structure includes a combination of SLC and MLC PRAMs to enhance the lifetime of the MLC PRAM main memory and hide asymmetric read/write access latency. The proposed structure is evaluated by a trace-driven simulator using SPEC CPU 2006 and SPLASH-2 traces. Experimental results show that the proposed DRAM converter can reduce the miss rate by similar to 37% and write count by similar to 55% in comparison with the uniform buffer case. Also, the SLC/MLC PRAM with DRAM converter shows performance in terms of access latency and power consumption close to that of the conventional memory architecture. Thus, our proposed memory architecture can be used to replace the current DRAM-based main memory system.", "paper_title": "Data Classification Management with its Interfacing Structure for Hybrid SLC/MLC PRAM Main Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000365157000005"}
