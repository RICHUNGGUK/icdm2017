We consider a MANET that consists of ns multicast sessions. Each multicast session has one source and p destinations. Each source sends identical information to the p destinations in its multicast session, and the information is required to be delivered to all the p destinations within D time-slots. Assuming the wireless mobiles move according to a 2-D independently and identically distributed mobility model, we first prove that the capacity per multicast session is O(min{1, (log p)(log(n(s) p))(D/n(s))(1/2)}). 1 We then propose a joint coding/scheduling algorithm achieving a throughput of Theta (min{1, (D/ns)(1/2)}). Our simulation results suggest that the same scaling law also holds under random walk and random waypoint models.", "paper_title": "On Delay Constrained Multicast Capacity of Large-Scale Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361486800028"}
