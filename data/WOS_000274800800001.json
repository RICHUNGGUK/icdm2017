The proposed algorithm employs SVD to represent a mesh sequence with a small number of basis vectors, and encodes those basis vectors with a bit plane coder. We analytically derive the contribution of each bit plane to the reconstructed mesh quality, and transmit the bit planes in the decreasing order of their amounts of contribution. As the decoder receives more bit planes, it reconstructs higher quality mesh sequences progressively. Moreover, we develop a temporal prediction mode to improve the rate-distortion (R-D) performance further, which also supports temporal scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields significantly better R-D performance than conventional SVD-based coders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
