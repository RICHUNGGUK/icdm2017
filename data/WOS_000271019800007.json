The main challenge of dynamic frequency adaptation is to adjust the processing speed of each element to match the quality-of-service requirements in the presence of workload variations. In this paper, we present a control theoretic approach to dynamic voltage/frequency scaling for data-flow models of computations mapped to multiprocessor systems-on-chip architectures. We discuss, in particular, nonlinear control approaches to deal with general streaming applications containing both pipeline and parallel stages. Theoretical analysis and experiments, carried out by means of a cycle-accurate energy-aware multiprocessor simulation platform, are provided. We have applied the proposed control approach to realistic streaming applications such as Data Encryption Standard and software-based FM radio.", "paper_title": "A Feedback-Based Approach to DVFS in Data-Flow Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019800007"}
