We introduce a simple evaluation model: triangular constraint tradeoffs model (TCTM) to grasp the essence of the architecture design consideration under transient wireless media characteristic and stringent limitation on energy and computing resource of WSNs. Based on this evaluation framework, we investigate the existing architectures proposed in literature from three main competing constraint aspects, namely generality, cost, and performance. Two important concepts: performance efficiency and deployment efficiency are identified and distinguished in overall architecture efficiency. With this powerful abstract and simple model, we describe the motivations of major body of WSNs architectures proposed in current literature. We also analyse the fundamental advantage and limitations of each class of architectures from TCTM perspective. We foresee the influence of evolving technology to futuristic architecture design. We believe our efforts will serve as a reference to orient researchers and system designers in this area", "paper_title": "TCTM: an evaluation framework for architecture design on wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326932600004"}
