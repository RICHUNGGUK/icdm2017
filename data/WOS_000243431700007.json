The Reynolds number (Re) was kept in the range of 100-716 to ensure laminar environment for animal cell culture. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (k(L)a) was determined from the oxygen concentration distribution. It was found that the effect of the cell consumption on kLa could be negligible. A correlation was proposed to predict the liquid-phase oxygen transfer coefficient (k(Lm)) as a function of Re. The overall oxygen transfer coefficient (k(L)) was obtained by the two-resistance model. Another correlation, within an error of 15%, was proposed to estimate the minimum oxygen concentration to avoid cell hypoxia. By combination of the correlations, the maximum cell density, which the present micro-bioreactor could support, was predicted to be in the order of 10(12) cells m(-3). The results are comparable with typical values reported for animal cell growth in mechanically stirred bioreactors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
