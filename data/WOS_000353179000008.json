Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known of the actual metrics use in Agile teams. Objective: The objective of this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the used metrics. Method: This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process. Results: The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning, progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate. Conclusion: The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as they can offer the largest impact to the software industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
