Then, within the framework of propositional logic, this paper proposes Belnap valuations as a truth model for bipolar propositions. The truth value of bipolar proposition is meant to be one of four values: absolutely true, absolutely false, borderline, and inconsistent. The borderline and inconsistent cases represent the truth-gap and truth-glut of a bipolar proposition, respectively. In order to reduce inconsistency two truth normalization methods, strong truth normalization and Kleene truth normalization, are proposed to approximate the original Belnap valuations. By integrating uncertainty of the true interpretations of bipolar propositions this paper introduces the following bipolar belief measures: positive and negative belief measures, lower and upper belief measures, and Kleene lower and upper belief measures. A mass function characterization of these bipolar belief measures are further explored. The relationship with Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval fuzzy sets is also discussed in detail. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
