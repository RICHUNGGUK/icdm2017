For this reason, we present a novel framework for resolving these issues. The proposed framework incorporates and unifies techniques from a variety of disciplines such as information extraction, information retrieval, fuzzy clustering, and ontology. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we use it to solve the itembank integration and knowledge sharing problem faced by many e-Learning systems. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework can not only effectively integrate information available in the Internet, but it can also properly organize the information into a unified itembank of an e-Learning system, thus making it possible for the users of such a system to not just find but share all the information.", "paper_title": "An Ontology-based Framework for Itembank Integration and Knowledge Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000280616500004"}
