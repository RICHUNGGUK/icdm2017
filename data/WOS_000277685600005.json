In this work, we address the issue of designing the topology of deployed WOBANs. Namely, we consider the case where the coverage of a Ethernet-based Passive Optical Network (EPON) is extended by an additional wireless segment which features multi-hop wireless links operated either according to the IEEE 802.11 standard, or to the IEEE 802.16 one. We propose a mathematical programming model which optimizes the overall WOBAN topology in terms of deployment cost, while accounting for the specific traffic requirements of the residential users, and the specific features of the technological components. The potentials of the proposed model are show-cased by deriving and commenting numerical results obtained when planning realistic WOBAN scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
