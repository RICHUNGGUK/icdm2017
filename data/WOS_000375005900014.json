Nevertheless, little is known about therapists' perception of a combined model that uses computerized methods as adjuncts to face-to-face (FTF) therapy. Current study surveyed 87 Israeli therapists' attitudes towards such combined model. Results show that more than half of therapists find it as potentially more effective than regular therapy, better for providing feedback and maintaining continuity of care. More than a third of the therapists found it may elicit better patient satisfaction and engagement. With respect to different modalities, therapists indicated that e-mail correspondence are better suited for combining with FTF treatments. Theoretical orientation had little effect on practitioners' attitudes. Finally, more than half of the therapists showed willingness to undergo training for a combined model. Compared to previously researched computerized interventions, current study indicates more positive attitudes and acceptability among therapists towards an integrative model.", "paper_title": "Combining Face-to-face Therapy with Computerized Techniques: A therapists' Attitudes Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000375005900014"}
