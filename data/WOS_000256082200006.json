A set S of vertices in a graph G is a total dominating set of G if every vertex in G is adjacent to some vertex in S. The maximum cardinality of a minimal total dominating set of G is the upper total domination number of G, denoted by Gamma(t) (G). We prove that the product of the upper total domination numbers of any graphs G and H without isolated vertices is at most twice the upper total domination number of their Cartesian product; that is, Gamma(t) (G)Gamma(t) (H) <= 2 Gamma(t) (G square H).", "paper_title": "On the upper total domination number of Cartesian products of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000256082200006"}
