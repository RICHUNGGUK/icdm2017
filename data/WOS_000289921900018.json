Therefore, this paper proposes a novel grid resource discovery method based on association rule hypergraph partitioning algorithm which analyzes user behavior in history transaction records to provide personality service for user. And this resource discovery method gives a new way to improve resource retrieval and management in grid research.", "paper_title": "An Association Rule Based Grid Resource Discovery Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000289921900018"}
