Here we describe the iterative reflection (M) over cap as the monad of free iterative Eilenberg-Moore algebras for M. This yields numerous concrete examples: if M is the free-semigroup monad, then (M) over cap is obtained by adding a single absorbing element; if M is the monad of finite trees then (M) over cap is the monad of rational trees, etc. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
