Traditionally, maximum power point (MPP) locus was used to provide such a fast response. However, the algorithm requires extra control loop or intermittent disconnection of the PV module. Hence, this paper proposes a simpler fast-converging MPPT technique, which excludes the extra control loop and intermittent disconnection. In the proposed algorithm, the relationship between the load line and the I-V curve is used with trigonometry rule to obtain the fast response. Results of the simulation and experiment using single-ended primary-inductor converter showed that the response of the proposed algorithm is four times faster than the conventional incremental conductance algorithm during the load and solar irradiation variation. Consequently, the proposed algorithm has higher efficiency.", "paper_title": "A Fast-Converging MPPT Technique for Photovoltaic System Under Fast-Varying Solar Irradiation and Load Resistance", "paper_id": "WOS:000350356000018"}
