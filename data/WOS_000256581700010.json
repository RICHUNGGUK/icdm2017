In order to exploit the benefit of simultaneous transmissions provided by MIMO, researchers have proposed a number of cross-layer optimizations and MAC layer designs to increase the throughput of wireless mesh or ad hoc networks, where the number of elements in the antenna arrays are preallocated or evenly assigned to the routers. In this paper, we argue that using the same number of elements in each antenna array in all routers is not a necessary condition for the improvement of system performance. Tills is because the requirement for the number of elements is quite different for each router. Especially at those critical routers that have huge aggregate traffic toward the gateway, more elements are needed not only for the traffic relay but also for the interference suppression.. Based oil this observation, we define the joint problem of bandwidth allocation, element assignment and scheduling to characterize the throughput benefits of cross-layer optimizations. We propose a Cost-Aware Element Assignment (CAEA) technique to minimize the total number of the antenna elements when still achieving the optimal bandwidth allocation. In addition, to verify the efficiency of the CAEA assignment, a heuristic Traffic-aware Stream-controlled Link Scheduling (TSLS) algorithm is proposed to provide a schedulable bandwidth allocation. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that our solutions (CAEA, TSLS) not only effectively save the total cost on antenna elements but also perform close to optimal on the average.
