However BRISK relies on intensity, color information in the image is ignored. In view of the importance of color information in vision applications, we propose CBRISK, a novel method for taking into account color information during keypoint detection and description. Instead of grayscale intensity image, the proposed approach detects keypoints in the photometric invariant color space. On the basis of binary intensity BRISK (original BRISK) descriptor, the proposed approach embeds binary invariant color presentation in the CBRISK descriptors. Experimental results show that CBRISK is more discriminative and robust than BRISK with respect to photometric variation.", "paper_title": "CBRISK: Colored Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints", "paper_id": "WOS:000315243600026"}
