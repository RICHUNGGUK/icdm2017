This is achieved by approximating the reliability constraints based on the reliability analysis results. The proposed approach does not use inverse first-order reliability analysis as other existing decoupled approaches, but uses direct reliability analysis. This strategy allows a modular approach and the use of more accurate methods, including Monte-Carlo-simulation (MCS)-based methods for highly nonlinear reliability constraints where first-order reliability approximation may not be accurate. The use of simulation-based methods also enables system-level reliability estimates to be included in the RBDO formulation. The efficiency of the proposed RBDO approach is further improved by identifying the potentially active reliability constraints at the beginning of each reliability analysis. A vehicle side impact problem is used to examine the proposed method, and the results show the usefulness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A direct decoupling approach for efficient reliability-based design optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000235447600003"}
