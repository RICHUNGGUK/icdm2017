Mobility protocols at several layers are designed to support handover, but they need to be optimized to ensure high-quality application performance. Existing optimization techniques are not sufficient to take care of interdomain and intertechnology handovers involving different access technologies, such as Wi-Fi, GSM, CDMA, and WiMAX. We categorize several types of handover, describe handover delay components, and propose a handover optimization framework called Media Independent Pre-Authentication that can provide optimizations for interdomain and intertechnology handover in a manner that is transparent to mobility management protocols. In addition, we also present experimental results demonstrating that this framework can achieve a significant reduction in handover delays for both network-layer and application-layer mobility management protocols.", "paper_title": "Media-independent pre-authentication supporting secure interdomain handover optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000258033500008"}
