However, multicast real-time video communications for interactive service applications with a very high number of users, like for example multipoint videoconferences and interactive video games, remains a challenging research topic for the presence of very strict requirements in terms of end-to-end delay and perceived quality. The target of this paper is to propose a video distribution platform that is able to provide a huge number of users with a delay constrained multicast video streaming. To this purpose, the proposed content delivery platform is based on a peer-to-peer approach that exploits multicast overlay organization of the peers to address the challenges due to bandwidth heterogeneity. To improve reliability and flexibility, video is coded using a scalable multiple description approach. Some design guidelines are provided taking into account some requirements in terms of delay, average PSNR, robustness against underlying network bandwidth fluctuations, and fairness.
