The new formula is then applied to polynomial hyperinterpolation of degree n in three variables, in which coefficients of the product Chebyshev orthonormal basis are computed by a fast algorithm based on the 3-dimensional FFT. Moreover, integration of the hyperinterpolant provides a new Clenshaw-Curtis type cubature formula in the 3-cube.", "paper_title": "New cubature formulae and hyperinterpolation in three variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000263890000004"}
