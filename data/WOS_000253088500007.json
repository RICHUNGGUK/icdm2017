A rough set knowledge discovery framework is formulated for the analysis of interval-valued information systems converted from real-valued raw decision tables. The minimal feature selection method for information systems with interval-valued features obtains all classification rules hidden in a system through a knowledge induction process. Numerical examples are employed to substantiate the conceptual arguments. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
