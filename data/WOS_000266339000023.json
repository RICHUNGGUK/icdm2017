The approach is based on coupling a high-order Pade-type non-reflecting boundary condition with plane wave finite element formulations. It is shown that for some numerical examples the approximate solution of suitable accuracy can be obtained using a small number of degrees of freedom. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
