This survey provides a description of key projected features of the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers of 802.16m, as a major candidate for providing aggregate rates at the range of Gbps to high-speed mobile users. Moreover, a new unified method for simulation modeling, namely the Evaluation Methodology (EVM), introduced in 802.16m, is also presented.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Next Generation Mobile WiMAX Networks: Objectives, Features and Technical Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000272323300002"}
