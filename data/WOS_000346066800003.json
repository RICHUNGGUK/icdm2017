In order to investigate the mechanical mechanism and the haemodynamic validity of the bypassing treatment for DeBakey III aortic dissection, patient-specific models of DeBakey III aortic dissection treated with different bypassing strategies were constructed. One of the bypassing strategies is bypassing between ascending aorta and abdominal aorta, and the other is bypassing between left subclavian artery and abdominal aorta. Numerical simulations under physiological flow conditions based on fluid-structure interaction were performed using finite element method. The results show that blood flow velocity, pressure and vessel wall displacement of false lumen are all reduced after bypassing. This phenomenon indicates that bypassing is an effective surgery for the treatment of DeBakey III aortic dissection. The effectiveness to cure through lumen is better when bypassing between left subclavian artery and abdominal aorta, while the effectiveness to cure blind lumen is better when bypassing between ascending aorta and abdominal aorta.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction in bypassed DeBakey III aortic dissection", "paper_id": "WOS:000346066800003"}
