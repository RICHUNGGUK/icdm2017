While there exist examples like Bin Packing, which does not admit any kernel unless P = NP, there apparently is a strong relation between these two polynomial-time techniques. We add to this picture by showing that the natural decision versions of all problems in two prominent classes of constant-factor approximable problems, namely MIN F+I (1) and MAX NP, admit polynomial problem kernels. Problems in MAX SNP, a subclass of MAX NP, are shown to admit kernels with a linear base set, e.g., the set of vertices of a graph. This extends results of Cai and Chen (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 54(3): 465-474, 1997), stating that the standard parameterizations of problems in MAX SNP and MIN F+I (1) are fixed-parameter tractable, and complements recent research on problems that do not admit polynomial kernelizations (Bodlaender et al. in J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75(8): 423-434, 2009).", "paper_title": "Polynomial Kernelizations for MIN F+I (1) and MAX NP", "paper_id": "WOS:000299482700025"}
