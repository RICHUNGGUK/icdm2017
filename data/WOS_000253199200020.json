(in: Ivanov et al. (ed.) Groups, combinatorics, and geometry, 2003) [3]. We study the Phan amalgams and their universal completions that occur for q = 3 in rank n = 3 for the diagram A(3) = D-3, corresponding to SU(4, 3(2)) congruent to Spin(-) (6, 3). We show that the associated geometries admit universal 9-fold coverings, by showing that the universal completion of the Phan amalgam is the central extension of SU(4, 3(2)) by its Schur multiplier. This information provides the last missing piece of information in the full classification of Phan amalgams and their universal completions for A(n) and D-n .", "paper_title": "On the Phan system of the Schur cover of SU(4,3(2))", "paper_id": "WOS:000253199200020"}
