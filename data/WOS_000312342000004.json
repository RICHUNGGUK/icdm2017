The definition of this concept is further extended when virtual worlds such as Second Life (R) (SL) are included. Through cultural events such as concerts and operas, we will see that the main goal of these kinds of projects is not simply to offer a video and audio broadcast of these events in the digital dimension. The current challenge is to create interactions between the individuals who are in different shared spaces. By studying the unfolding of these events in its various phasesbefore, during, and afterwe examine the culture of the event. We question how the culture of the event can be transposed in a mixed reality display, and how this kind of event can affect people on both sides of the membrane made by the technical configuration. Beyond the alignments and adjustments that we can see between the different individuals involved in these events, we examine more broadly the changes and mutations of the culture of the event in this specific configuration.", "paper_title": "To a cultural perspective of mixed reality events: a case study of event overflow in operas and concerts in mixed reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000312342000004"}
