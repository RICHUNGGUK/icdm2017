We use a dual-slope path loss model that is well supported empirically, wherein a \"close-in\" pathloss exponent alpha(0) is used for distances less than a corner distance R-c, and then changes to alpha(1) > alpha(0) outside R-c. We extend recent 2D coverage probability and potential throughput results to d dimensions, and prove that if the close-in path loss exponent alpha(0) < d, then the SINR eventually decays to zero. For example, alpha(0) <= 3 results in an eventual SINR of 0 for all users in a 3D network, which is a troubling fact. We also show that the potential (i.e. best case) aggregate throughput decays to zero for alpha(0) < d/2. Both of these scaling results also hold for the more realistic case that we term 3D(+), where there are no BSs below the user, as in a dense urban network with the user on or near the ground.", "paper_title": "SINR and Throughput Scaling in Ultradense Urban Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377706800008"}
