We assess the performances of the estimators through numerical simulations for three particular cases of the family explored here. We observe that the two analytical proposals display very similar behavior for these distributions and that all proposed estimators are effective in reducing bias and mean square error of the MLEs.", "paper_title": "Nearly unbiased estimation in a biparametric exponential family", "paper_id": "WOS:000257291200001"}
