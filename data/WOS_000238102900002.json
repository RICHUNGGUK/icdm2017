The decision result is obtained by proving that a formula of our fragment is satisfiable if and only if it admits a parametric \"canonical\" model, whose existence can be tested by solving a suitable unquantified formula, expressed in the decidable language of Tarski's theory of reals and involving the numerical variables of the initial formula plus various other parameters. This paper generalizes a previous decidability result concerning a more restrictive fragment in which predicates relative to infinite intervals or stating strict concavity and convexity were not expressible.
