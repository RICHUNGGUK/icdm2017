We mainly focus on a radar illusion device, a microwave bend structure, a flattened Luneburg lens, a planar focusing lens antenna, and a three-dimensional broadband carpet cloak. These devices are designed with either general transformation optics or quasi-conformal mapping, which are implemented using metamaterials and validated by experiments, showing high performances.
