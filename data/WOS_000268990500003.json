Coherence Domains of water act as devices able to collect low-grade energy in the environment and to transform it into high-grade energy able to produce electronic excitations. Water is the most important constituent of all living organisms (70% of the total mass and 99% of all molecules). Other biomolecules, proteins, fats, sugars, vitamins, salts, which are usually considered the only molecules playing a remarkable role in molecular biology, make up only 1% of the total. So, biological activity is assumed to involve 1% of all molecules only. What is the role of water then? Is it possible that 99% of all biomolecules are necessary only as a solvent whereas the \"really essential\" biomolecules enact all productive activity? The driving and regulatory role of water in governing the biochemical activity has begun to be recognized in recent times (Voeikov, 2007). In order to unravel this puzzle, we should take another enigma, which is the existence of biochemical codes (Barbieri, 2004), into account. Apart from the living matter or more generally far from catalysts, molecules are usually subjected to a polygamous regime; each biomolecule can interact with many others, thus producing a great number of reactions. In living matter, instead, biomolecules live inside each particular biochemical cycle in a monogamous condition (at least within definite time intervals), i.e. a biomolecule interacts only with well-defined partners and ignores the other biomolecules, with which interaction would be possible in empty space. Living matter therefore produces a \"context\" capable of preventing a great number of chemical interactions, which would theoretically be possible. The possibility of molecular interactions is governed by biochemical codes (the genetic code is the most widely known among them), to which particular biological processes correspond. Within the world of biomolecules, there are thus the prerequisites for communication. Indeed, biochemical cycles are open and capable of reacting against new influences. In this way all the codes build up and adopt flexible features, which are typical of a language. The emergence of these biochemical codes from the dynamics of matter is undoubtedly the main problem of biology.", "paper_title": "THE ROLE OF WATER IN THE LIVING ORGANISMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268990500003"}
