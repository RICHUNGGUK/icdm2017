The algorithm we propose hybridizes a novel placement procedure with a genetic algorithm based on random keys. We propose also a new fitness function to drive the optimization. The approach is tested on a set of instances taken from the literature and compared with other approaches. The experimental results validate the quality of the solutions and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A parallel multi-population genetic algorithm for a constrained two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000292571000005"}
