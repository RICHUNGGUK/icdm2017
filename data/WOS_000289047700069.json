This study is an extension of the work described in Qin and Bao (2005). First, the order and frequency modifications for the current McKusick and Langley (M-L) optimization are proposed; next, by combining optimization and pruning together, the Pruning-And-One-Optimization-Composite (PAOOC) processing method is raised; and finally, a modified fuzzy fusion scheme using improved SGNN is put forward. Experimental results demonstrate that the posed fuzzy fusion scheme outperforms region-based fusion using wavelet multi-resolution (MR) segmentation, and region-based fusion using tree-structure wavelet MR segmentation, both in visual effect and objective evaluation criteria. In the meantime, simulations also show the effectiveness of our modifications for the current optimization and pruning methods, visually and objectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
