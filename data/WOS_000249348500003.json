The programme logic extends our earlier logic for alias-free imperative higher-order functions with new operators which serve as building blocks for clean structural reasoning about programms and data structures in the presence of aliasing. This has been an open issue since the pioneering work by Cartwright-Oppen and Morris twenty-five years ago. We illustrate usage of the logic for description and reasoning through concrete examples including a higher-order polymorphic Quicksort. The logical status of the new operators is clarified by translating them into (in)equalities of reference names.", "paper_title": "A logical analysis of aliasing in imperative higher-order functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000249348500003"}
