We provide extensive theoretical analysis and experimental results for multipliers based on the new representations on 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. They provide a clear picture about the advantages of the new method in 64-bit hardware implementations compared to array-based classical multiplier and radix-8-based multiplier. The proposed multipliers have better area and power consumption compared to reference multipliers.", "paper_title": "Area-Efficient Multipliers Based on Multiple-Radix Representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000285599400006"}
