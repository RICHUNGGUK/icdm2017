The main ingredients of the algorithm are (i) a \"morphing\" technique that can be viewed as a variant of simulated annealing and (ii) a new rounding algorithm to put a convex body in near-isotropic position. The complexity is O*(n(4)), improving on the previous best algorithm by a factor of n. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
