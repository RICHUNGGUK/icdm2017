To remedy this problem, a MIMO detection method based on fractional lower order statistics (FLOS) for PLC channel with impulse noise is proposed in this paper. The alpha stable distribution is used to model impulse noise, and FLOS is applied to construct the criteria of MIMO detection. Then the optimal detection solution is obtained by recursive least squares algorithm. Finally, the transmitted signals in PLC MIMO system are restored with the obtained detection matrix. The proposed method does not require channel estimation and has low computational complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed method has a better PLC MIMO detection performance than the existing ones under impulsive noise environment.", "paper_title": "A Fractional Lower Order Statistics-Based MIMO Detection Method in Impulse Noise for Power Line Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000348772500012"}
