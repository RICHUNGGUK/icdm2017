This has emphasized the importance of the development of efficient indexes over large geographic databases. The most common simplification of geographic objects used for indexing purposes is a two-dimensional rectangle. Furthermore, one of the primitive operations that must be supported by every geographic index structure is the orthogonal range query, which retrieves all the geographic objects that have at least one point in common with a rectangular query region. In this work, we study several space-efficient representations of rectangle datasets that can be used in the development of geographic indexes supporting orthogonal range queries.
