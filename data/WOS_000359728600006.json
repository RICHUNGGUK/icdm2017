This method has to take into account the interaction of the different alternatives and a parameter modelling the flexibility of this method has to be introduced. More precisely, this method uses fuzzy preference relations, aggregated by means of weighted ordered weighted averaging aggregation operators (WOWA). For the exploitation phase the extended weighted voting algorithm is introduced and studied in detail. Finally, the goodness of this approach is analyzed using it to combine different points of view (people, environment, assets and reputation impact for the company) in the assessment of risk associated with human reliability.
