First, we construct a box spline based on the four principal directions of the BCC lattice that allows for a linear C-0 reconstruction. Then, the design is extended for higher degrees of continuity. We derive the explicit piecewise polynomial representations of the C-0 and C-2 box splines that are useful for practical reconstruction applications. We further demonstrate that approximation in the shift-invariant space-generated by BCC-lattice shifts of these box splines-is twice as efficient as using the tensor-product B-spline solutions on the Cartesian lattice ( with comparable smoothness and approximation order and with the same sampling density). Practical evidence is provided demonstrating that the BCC lattice not only is generally a more accurate sampling pattern, but also allows for extremely efficient reconstructions that outperform tensor-product Cartesian reconstructions.", "paper_title": "Practical box splines for reconstruction on the body centered cubic lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000252254200007"}
