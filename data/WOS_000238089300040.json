Under the hybrid P2P network, we implement and integrate two core components for collaborative GIS environment: P2P GIS super-node and client-node. Using these core components, we build a collaborative GIS application for the exploratory spatial data analysis to discover distribution patterns and spatial associations of geographical phenomena in cooperative way.", "paper_title": "Collaborative GIS environment for exploratory spatial data analysis based on hybrid P2P network", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300040"}
