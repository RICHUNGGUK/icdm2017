The controller is developed based upon a class of SISO nonlinear systems whose nonlinear part can be linearly parameterized. The advantage of such a controller is that parametric uncertainties and unknown disturbances can be dealt with, which is essential for a high precision of the control of linear-motor-driven X-Y table. With the prior knowledge of the bounds of the system parameters, a discontinuous projection is utilized in the adaptive law to ensure the boundedness of the parameters estimates. The algorithm is then implemented on a real X-Y table driven by the linear motors. In the modeling of such a system, fiction effects are also considered, which is useful for the derivation of the adaptive law. Experiments on the X-Y table are carried out and the results show excellent tracking performance of the system. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
