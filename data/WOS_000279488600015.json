The industry is constantly challenged to meet the rising standards of manufacturing quality and safety through rigorous regulatory requirements As a consequence, ensuring regulatory compliance and managing a myriad of validation documents constitutes a major informatics challenge. This study addresses this challenge by developing an ontological infrastructure to support decision making in regulatory compliance The proposed ontological informatics system. called OntoReg, is integrated with a reasoner and a rule engine through a Java integrated development environment The system is demonstrated through industrial case studies based on regulation examples taken from the Eudralex Guide 2007.
