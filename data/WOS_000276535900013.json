The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase sequence to ensure smooth flow of traffic with minimal waiting time and length of queue. Usually fuzzy traffic controllers are optimized to maximize traffic flows/minimize traffic waiting time under typical traffic conditions. Consequentially, these are not the optimal traffic controllers under exceptional traffic cases such as roadblocks and road accidents. We apply state-space equations to formulate the average waiting time vehicles in traffic network at fixed time control. also, We propose a novel fuzzy model and new fuzzy traffic controller that can optimally control traffic flows under both normal and exceptional traffic conditions. Results show that the performance of the proposed traffic controller at novel fuzzy model is better that of conventional fuzzy traffic controllers under normal and abnormal traffic conditions.", "paper_title": "A Novel Fuzzy Model and Control of Single Intersection at Urban Traffic Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000276535900013"}
