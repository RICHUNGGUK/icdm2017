In these cases, the pyrosequencing software fails to provide correct nucleotide sequences. Accordingly, the objective was to develop the AdvISER-PYRO algorithm, performing an automated, fast and reliable analysis of pyrosequencing signals that circumvents those limitations. Results: In the current mycobacterial amplicon genotyping application, AdvISER-PYRO performed much better than the pyrosequencing software in the following two situations: when converting Single Amplicon Sample (SAS) signals into a correct single sequence (97.2% versus 56.5%), and when translating Multiple Amplicon Sample (MAS) signals into the correct sequence pair (74.5%).", "paper_title": "AdvISER-PYRO: Amplicon Identification using SparsE Representation of PYROsequencing signal", "paper_id": "WOS:000322337400006"}
