Given a set of genes and protein-gene and/or protein-protein interaction patterns, this approach can be used to synthesize a transcription control induced by these interaction patterns, and as a consequence, determine the behavior of the gene network. This proposed approach is demonstrated in the synthesis of a transcription control that produces the observed (logical) behavior in the induction of a phage. lysogen.", "paper_title": "A discrete-event approach to transcription control with dynamic event-controllability", "paper_id": "WOS:000242770400002"}
