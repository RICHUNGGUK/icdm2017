To diminish inherent harmonic distortion introduced by the bootstrapped switch, the auxiliary circuit is adopted to achieve high-order compensation. Under the appropriate design, harmonic distortion introduced by the auxiliary circuit and that introduced by the bootstrapped switch can cancel out with each other. A 1.5 bit MDAC circuit based on the proposed switch has been fabricated in SMIC 0.18 mu m CMOS process. In 10 MHz input with 100 MHz sample frequency, the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio of 102.72 dB, spurious-free dynamic range of 107.7 dB and total harmonic distortion of 106.1 dB have been measured.", "paper_title": "A low distortion CMOS analogue switch with high-order compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000348435400015"}
