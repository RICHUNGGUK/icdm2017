The security of remote authentication mechanisms mostly relies on one of or the combination of three factors: 1) something users know-password; 2) something users have-smart card; and 3) something users are-biometric characteristics. This paper introduces an efficient generic framework for three-factor authentication. The proposed generic framework enhances the security of existing two-factor authentication schemes by upgrading them to three-factor authentication schemes, without exposing user privacy. In addition, we present a case study by upgrading a secure two-factor authentication scheme to a secure three-factor authentication scheme. Furthermore, implementation analysis, formal proof, and privacy discussion are provided to show that the derived scheme is practical, secure, and privacy preserving.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Generic Framework for Three-Factor Authentication With Provably Secure Instantiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000353290200011"}
