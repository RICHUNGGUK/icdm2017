One primary goal of VCys is to identify bladder lesions with abnormal bladder wall thickness, and consequently a precise segmentation of the inner and outer borders of the wall is required. In this paper, we propose a unified expectation-maximization (EM) approach to the maximum-a posteriori (MAP) solution of bladder wall segmentation, by integrating a novel adaptive Markov random field (AMRF) model and the coupled level-set (CLS) information into the prior term. The proposed approach is applied to the segmentation of T-1-weighted MR images, where the wall is enhanced while the urine and surrounding soft tissues are suppressed. By introducing scale-adaptive neighborhoods as well as adaptive weights into the conventional MRF model, the AMRF model takes into account the local information more accurately. In order to mitigate the influence of image artifacts adjacent to the bladder wall and to preserve the continuity of the wall surface, we apply geometrical constraints on the wall using our previously developed CLS method. This paper not only evaluates the robustness of the presented approach against the known ground truth of simulated digital phantoms, but further compares its performance with our previous CLS approach via both volunteer and patient studies. Statistical analysis on experts' scores of the segmented borders from both approaches demonstrates that our new scheme is more effective in extracting the bladder wall. Based on the wall thickness calibrated from the segmented single-layer borders, a three-dimensional virtual bladder model can be constructed and the wall thickness can be mapped onto the model, where the bladder lesions will be eventually detected via experts' visualization and/or computer-aided detection.
