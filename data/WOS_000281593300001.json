We propose an effective and fast method, valid not only for fractional Brownian fields indexed by a manifold, but for any Gaussian fields indexed by a manifold. The performance of our method is illustrated with different manifolds (sphere, hyperboloid).", "paper_title": "On Simulation of Manifold Indexed Fractional Gaussian Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000281593300001"}
