In this study, the influence of partial-slip boundary conditions on the laminar flow properties past a circular cylinder was examined. Shallow-water equations are solved by using the finite element method accommodating SU/PG scheme. Four Reynolds numbers (20, 40, 80, and 100) and six slip lengths were considered in the numerical simulation to investigate the effects of slip length and Reynolds number on characteristic parameters such as wall vorticity, drag coefficient, separation angle, wake length, velocity distributions on and behind the cylinder, lift coefficient, and Strouhal number. The simulation results revealed that as the slip length increases, the drag coefficient decreases since the frictional component of drag is reduced, and the shear layer developed along the cylinder surface tends to push the separation point away toward the rear stagnation point so that it has larger separation angle than that of the no-slip condition. The length of the wake bubble zone was shortened by the combined effects of the reduced wall vorticity and wall shear stress which caused a shift of the reattachment point closer to the cylinder. The frequency of the asymmetrical vortex formation with partial slip velocity was increased due to the intrinsic inertial effect of the Navier-slip condition.
