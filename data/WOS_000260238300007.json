In OntoZilla, peers supporting the same concept are grouped into the same cluster, and the relationships between clusters are modeled according to the concepts they specialize in. Therefore, a query belonging to a specific concept can be routed to the suitable group of peers in a systematic way, thus supporting efficient concept search. Moreover, since peer relationships are based on peers' expertises which may change over time, our semi-structured system can flexibly cope with the changing environment as peers evolve.
