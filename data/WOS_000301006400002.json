In this situation, super-Turing hardness manifests in both the modeling process performed by the scientist and the models produced. We start with an introduction to the conventional formal \"science-of-sciences\" paradigm and present modifications that require the scientist to provide an explanation for the models/theories provided. We then show that in this framework the process of formulating an economic theory, and the theories produced can, potentially, be hypercomputational.", "paper_title": "Perhaps the Rigorous Modeling of Economic Phenomena Requires Hypercomputation", "paper_id": "WOS:000301006400002"}
