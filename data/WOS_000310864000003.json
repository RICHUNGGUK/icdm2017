For special choices of the values of f, such processes model consensus issues and have been studied under names such as local majority processes or iterative polling processes in a large variety of contexts especially in distributed computing. Our contributions concern computational aspects related to the minimum cardinality r(f)(G) of sets of vertices with initial label 1 such that during the process on Gall vertices eventually change their label to 1. Such sets are known as dynamic monopolies or dynamos for short. We establish a hardness result and describe efficient algorithms for restricted instances on paths and cycles. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
