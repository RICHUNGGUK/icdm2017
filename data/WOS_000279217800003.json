The problem is converted into a set of problems in convex geometry. The latter problems are solved using algorithms in combinatorial geometry. This method provides a deterministic algorithm and never falls into an infinite loop. The number of resulting sectors depends on the algorithm of triangulation. Our test implementation shows smaller number of sectors comparing with other existing methods with iterations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
