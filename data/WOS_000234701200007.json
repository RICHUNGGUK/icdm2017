In this study, phone-triplets are used as crude approximates for a syllable-length sub-word segmental unit. The proposed pseudo-syllabic length framework is subsequently used for both qualitative and quantitative examination of the contributions made by acoustic, phonotactic and prosodic information sources, and trialled in accordance with the NIST 1996 LID protocol. Firstly, a series of experimental comparisons are conducted which examine the utility of using segmental units for modelling short term acoustic features. These include comparisons between language specific Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), language specific GMMs for each segmental unit, and finally language specific hidden Markov models (HMM) for each segment, undertaken in an attempt to better model the temporal evolution of acoustic features. In a second tier of experiments, the contribution of both broad and fine class phonotactic information, when considered over an extended time frame, is contrasted with an implementation of the currently popular parallel phone recognition language modelling (PPRLM) technique. Results indicate that this information can be used to complement existing PPRLM systems to obtain improved performance. The pseudo-syllabic framework is also used to model prosodic dynamics and compared to an implemented version of a recently published system, achieving comparable levels of performance.
