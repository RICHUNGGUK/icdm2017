In the first one, the data structures used to enforce arc consistency are shared between all subproblems where a domain is reduced to a singleton. This new algorithm is not optimal but it requires far less space and is often more efficient in practice than the optimal algorithm SAC-Opt. In the second approach, we perform several runs of a greedy search (where at each step, arc consistency is maintained), possibly detecting the singleton arc consistency of several values in one run. It is an original illustration of applying inference (i.e., establishing singleton arc consistency) by search. Using a greedy search allows benefiting from the incrementality of arc consistency, learning relevant information from conflicts and, potentially finding solution(s) during the inference process. We present extensive experiments that show the benefit of our two approaches.", "paper_title": "Efficient algorithms for singleton arc consistency", "paper_id": "WOS:000286117200002"}
