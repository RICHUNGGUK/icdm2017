We show that lower bounds on the solvability of renaming can be formulated as a purely topological question about the existence of an equivariant chain map from a \"topological disk\" to a \"topological annulus\". Proving the non-existence of such a map implies the non-existence of a distributed renaming algorithm in several related models of computation.", "paper_title": "An Equivariance Theorem with Applications to Renaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000339935200003"}
