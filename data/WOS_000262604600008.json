However, traditional method message authentication code (MAC) employs a symmetric cryptographical technique and it needs to keep a shared private key between two parties. For convenience, people now begins to use public key techniques to provide message authentication. In wireless communication, we shall save more space for message itself because of the limited resources. Therefore, we believe that our proposed digital signature scheme will be more fitful for this kind of communication due to the following merits: (1) in addition to inheriting the merits of RSA signature such as high verification efficiency, the proposed scheme also shows its advantage over RSA by resisting low public key exponent attack; (2) comparing with 1024 bits RSA, our digital signature scheme can sign 2048-bit long message once, and generate a signature with 1025 bits length which doubles the capacity of the 1024-bit RSA signature; (3) the scheme is provably secure and its security is tightly related to the hardness of conic-based (CB)-RSA assumption.
