The derivative evaluation is performed by a Fortran code resulting from the analysis and transformation of the original program that defines the function of interest. OpenAD/F has been designed with a particular emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and the use of open source components. While the code transformation follows the basic principles of automatic differentiation, the tool implements new algorithmic approaches at various levels, for example, for basic block preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most other automatic differentiation tools, OpenAD/F uses components provided by the OpenAD framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of the code transformations in a language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results implemented in the OpenAnalysis component. The interface to the language-independent transformation engine is an XML-based format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation algorithms allow efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences of vertex, edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes, OpenAD/F supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics, a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, yet simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields such as bottom topography as independent (control) variables.", "paper_title": "OpenAD/F: A modular open-source tool for automatic differentiation of Fortran codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000257829500002"}
