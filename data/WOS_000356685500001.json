In this paper, we propose a novel interest detection-based video dissemination algorithm under flash crowd in mobile ad hoc networks (IDVD). IDVD classifies the user behavior of requesting video content in terms of the popularities and playback time of video and considers the demand of popular video as the cause of flash crowd. IDVD makes use of the prediction of necessary bandwidth and period time of intensive request to be aware of period time and scale of flash crowd. IDVD employs a resource dissemination algorithm which can fast discover interested nodes and achieve the on-demand dissemination of video resources in neighboring geographical area, in order to handle imbalance between supply and demand. IDVD uses the epidemic model to describe the state transition of nodes and define the convergence condition of resource dissemination algorithm. Extensive tests show how IDVD achieves much better performance results in comparison with other state of the art solutions.", "paper_title": "A Novel Interest Detection-Based Video Dissemination Algorithm under Flash Crowd in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356685500001"}
