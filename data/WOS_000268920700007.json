Commercial database management systems allow to store sequential data, but they do not support efficient querying of such data. To increase the efficiency of analysis of sequential data new index structures need to be developed. In this paper we propose an indexing scheme for non-timestamped sequences of sets, which supports set subsequence queries. Our contribution is threefold. First, we describe the index logical and physical structure, second, we provide algorithms for set subsequence queries utilizing this structure, and finally we perform experimental evaluation of the index, which proves its feasibility and advantages in set subsequence query processing.", "paper_title": "How to improve efficiency of analysis of sequential data?", "paper_id": "WOS:000268920700007"}
