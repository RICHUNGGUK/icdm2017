We first propose a model of a sensory neuron whose axon is able to switch between passive conduction and persistent firing states, thereby triggering short term retention to the stimulus. Then we propose a model of a habituating synapse and explore all nine of the behavioral characteristics of short term habituation in a two neuron circuit. We couple the persistent firing neuron to the habituation synapse and investigate the behavior of short term retention of habituating response. Simulations show that, depending on the amount of synaptic resources, persistent firing either results in continued habituation or maintains the response, both leading to longer recovery times. The effectiveness of the model as an element in a bio-inspired memory system is discussed.", "paper_title": "PRESYNAPTIC LEARNING AND MEMORY WITH A PERSISTENT FIRING NEURON AND A HABITUATING SYNAPSE: A MODEL OF SHORT TERM PERSISTENT HABITUATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000306838400005"}
