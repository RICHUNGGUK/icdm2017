Conventional methodologies for complexity reduction use logic-centric approaches focusing on the total number of adders.,Therefore, there is a need to consider interconnects to reduce communication costs while synthesizing reduced-complexity filters. In this paper, we integrate high-level synthesis and floorplan to obtain improvement in both computational complexity and interconnect delay. In our experiments, we could achieve 15% improvement in critical-path delay over conventional methodologies.", "paper_title": "Layout-driven architecture synthesis for high-speed digital filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000236131600010"}
