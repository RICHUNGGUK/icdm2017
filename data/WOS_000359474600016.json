We show that the problem to find a minimum irreversible 2-conversion set can be solved in O(n(2) log(6) n) time for graphs with maximum degree at most 3 (subcubic graphs) by reducing it to the graphic matroid parity problem, where n is the number of vertices in a graph. This affirmatively settles an open question posed by Kyncl et al. (2014).", "paper_title": "A Note on Irreversible 2-Conversion Sets in Subcubic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000359474600016"}
