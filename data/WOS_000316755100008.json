However, most prior approaches assume that the multiple representations share the same dimension, limiting their applicability to homogeneous environments. In this paper, we present a novel tensor-based framework for integrating heterogeneous multiview data in the context of spectral clustering. Our framework includes two novel formulations; that is multiview clustering based on the integration of the Frobenius-norm objective function (MC-FR-OI) and that based on matrix integration in the Frobenius-norm objective function (MC-FR-MI). We show that the solutions for both formulations can be computed by tensor decompositions. We evaluated our methods on synthetic data and two real-world data sets in comparison with baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed formulations are effective in integrating multiview data in heterogeneous environments.", "paper_title": "Multiview Partitioning via Tensor Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000316755100008"}
