Therefore, we have developed a new FlyExpress mobile application that makes available a growing collection (>100 000) of standardized in situ hybridization images containing spatial patterns of gene expression from Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) embryogenesis. Using this application, scientists can visualize and compare expression patterns of >4000 developmentally relevant genes. The FlyExpress app displays the expression patterns of the selected gene for different visual projections (e. g. lateral) and displays them according to their developmental stages, which developmental time. Ultimately, we envision the use of FlyExpress app in the laboratory where scientists may wish to immediately conduct a visual comparison of a known expression pattern with the one observed on the bench top or to display expression patterns of interest during scientific discussions at large.", "paper_title": "Exploring spatial patterns of gene expression from Fruit Fly embryogenesis on the iPhone", "paper_id": "WOS:000310155300020"}
