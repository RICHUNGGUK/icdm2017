The properties of Blaschke basis and the approximation behavior of Blaschke basis expansions are studied. Each Blaschke product is analytic and mono-component. An explicit expression of the phase function of Blaschke product is given. The convergence results for Blaschke basis expansions show that it is suitable to approximate a signal by a linear combination of Blaschke products. Experiments are presented to illustrate the general theory.", "paper_title": "Mono-component decomposition of signals based on blaschke basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000251514900006"}
