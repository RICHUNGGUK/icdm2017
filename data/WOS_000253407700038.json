The restriction on contraction in the type system is useful for managing the thorny issue of sharing of physical circuits. We use a semantic model inspired by game semantics and the geometry of interaction, and express it directly as a certain class of digital circuits that form a cartesian, monoidal-closed category. A soundness result is given, which is also a correctness result for the compilation technique.", "paper_title": "Geometry of synthesis - A structured approach to VLSI design", "paper_id": "WOS:000253407700038"}
