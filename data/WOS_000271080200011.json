The proposed radiating slot consists of a centered longitudinal slot, which is cut in the broad wall of a single wiggly ridge waveguide. The wiggly ridge is placed exactly under the slot and the wiggly part is in V-shape. It is shown that by varying the wiggle depth of the proposed slot, the amount of power coupled to the slot can be adjusted. Some Stegen's like design graphs are obtained for the proposed slot. Then, two linear arrays consist of five and six elements are designed using the obtained graphs and by neglecting the mutual coupling between slots. The arrays have Dolph-Chebyshev distribution with 20 and 30 dB of side lobe levels. For a better comparison between the proposed slotted arrays and the conventional longitudinal shunt slot arrays, two other slotted arrays in conventional topology and with the same specifications following the well known Elliott's design procedure are designed and simulated. Comparison of the simulated results shows that the second order beams of the designed array are effectively eliminated, while the other antenna specifications are also achieved.
