However, our recent attempts to execute large-scale parameter sweep applications (PSAs) for real-world climate studies with the Nimrod/G tool have exposed problems in the areas of fault tolerance, data storage and trust management. In response, we have implemented a task-splitting approach that facilitates breaking up large PSAs into a sequence of dependent subtasks, improving fault tolerance; provides a garbage collection technique that deletes unnecessary data, and employs a trust delegation technique that facilitates flexible third party data transfers across different VOs.
