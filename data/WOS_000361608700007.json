The outcome of the proposed approach to image complementing is that the transformation function maps a complemented image to a shape that is usually not a straight line based on pixels and image information. The proposed approach lends support to decision-making in image analysis and image understanding. A practical application of the proposed to image complementing is given in terms of the analysis of medical images.", "paper_title": "Gini index-based digital image complementing in the study of medical images", "paper_id": "WOS:000361608700007"}
