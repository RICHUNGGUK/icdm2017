The aim of this research is to provide a simple and efficient way of handling constrained optimization problems in the GA framework without the need for tuning the values of penalty factors for any given optimization problem. After a short review on the most popular and effective exterior penalty formulations, the proposed penalty strategy is presented and tested on five different benchmark problems. The obtained results are compared with the best solutions provided in the literature, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A double-multiplicative dynamic penalty approach for constrained evolutionary optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000254206600004"}
