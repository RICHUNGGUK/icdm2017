The acyclic chromatic index of G, denoted by chi(a)'(G), is the least number of colors in an acyclic edge coloring of G. Let G be a planar graph with maximum degree Delta(G). In this paper, we show that chi(a)'(G) <= Delta(G) + 4, if G contains no 4-cycle; chi(a)'(G) <= Delta(G) + 5, if G contains no intersecting triangles; and chi(a)'(G) <= Delta(G) + 6 if G contains no adjacent triangles.
