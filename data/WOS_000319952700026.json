We establish the basic methodological framework, data selection, organization and their relation to neural networks features. We also describe a skill score to compare regressors' performance and finally the paleoclimatic variable's reconstruction. We show a case study focused on winter precipitation reconstruction in the Mediterranean back to 1700, using multi-layer perceptrons, and the comparison of the obtained results to that of the existing alternative methodologies.
