The lifting based Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) architecture has been selected for exploiting the correlation among the image pixels. In addition, we provide a study on what storage elements are required for the wavelet coefficients. A modified SPIHT (Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees) algorithm is presented for encoding the wavelet coefficients. The modifications include a simplification of coefficient scanning process, use of a I-D addressing method instead of the original 2-D arrangement for wavelet coefficients and a fixed memory allocation for the data lists instead of the dynamic allocation required in the original SPIHT. The proposed algorithm has been illustrated on both the 2-D Lena image and a 3-D MRI data set and is found to achieve appreciable compression with a high peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
