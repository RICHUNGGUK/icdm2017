These OCS-LDPC codes are quasi-cyclic, and their parity-check matrices are composed of circulant permutation matrices. Generally, the cycle structures in these codes are determined by the shift values of circulant permutation matrices, and the existence of cycles in the corresponding Tanner graph is governed by certain cycle-governing equations (CGEs). Therefore, finding the proper shift values is the key point to increase the girth of these codes. In this paper, we provide an effective method to systematically find out the CGEs for these codes of girth 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Then, one less computation-intensive algorithm is used to generate the proper shift values for constructing the OCS-LDPC codes of large girth. Simulation results show that significant gains in signal-to-noise ratio over an additive white-Gaussian noise channel can be achieved by increasing the girth of the OCS-LDPC codes.", "paper_title": "Construction of One-Coincidence Sequence Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes of Large Girth", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900034"}
