In the network communication channel, the effects of signal quantisation and measurement missing, which appears typically in a network environment, are taken into consideration simultaneously. A stochastic variable satisfying the Bernoulli random binary distribution is utilised to model the phenomenon of the measurements missing. The aim is to design a fault detection filter such that, for all unknown input and incomplete measurements, the error between the residual and weighted faults is made as small as possible. A sufficient condition for the existence of the desired fault detection filter is established in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Robust fault detection for Markovian jump systems with unreliable communication links", "paper_id": "WOS:000320099900004"}
