In contrast to a kernel-based SVM, the FCM-SVM has a smaller number of parameters while retaining the SVM's good generalisation ability. In FCM-SVM, input training data is clustered by FCM. The output of FCM-SVM is a weighted sum of the degrees where each input data belongs to the clusters. To achieve high generalisation ability, FCM-SVM weights are learned through linear kernel based SVM. Computer simulations illustrate the performance of the suggested network, where the FCM-SVM is used as a channel equaliser. Simulations with white Gaussian and coloured Gaussian noise are performed. This paper also compares simulation results from the FCM-SVM, the Gaussian kernel based SVM and the optimal equaliser.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy C-means based support vector machine for channel equalisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000263871500002"}
