Furthermore, by employing the multiplexer model, the algorithm is extended to optimize multi-level multi-output mixed-polarity RM forms. The proposed algorithm is implemented in C language and tested using some MCNC benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain a more compact RM form than that under fixed polarity. Compared with published results, the proposed algorithm makes a significant speed improvement, with a small increase in the number of literals.", "paper_title": "Reed-Muller function optimization techniques with onset table", "paper_id": "WOS:000289803000004"}
