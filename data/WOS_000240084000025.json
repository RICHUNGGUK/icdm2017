By using the AP(access point)assisted percolation model, and utilizing sufficiently wide bandwidth under perlink power constraint, we find the asymptotic per-node throughput capacity of a UWB hybrid network in a unit disk area, as a function of the number of randomly distributed nodes, the number of randomly distributed AP, and the path loss exponent. This result shows an asymptotically significant factor of improvement in capacity by deploying AP, compared to the recent result for UWB pure ad-hoc network. An extension of the result in the more general D-dimensional space is also obtained.", "paper_title": "Throughput capacity of UWB ad-hoc networks with infrastructure support", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000025"}
