Using a new Lyapunov function method, we prove that this delayed neural network has a unique almost periodic solution, which is globally exponentially stable. Moreover, the obtained conclusion on the almost periodic solution is applied to prove the existence and stability of periodic solution (or equilibrium point) for this delayed neural network with periodic coefficients (or constant coefficients).
