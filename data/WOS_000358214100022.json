Our method is based on a combination of the Blind Source Separation (BSS) technique and Maximum A posteriori (MAP) estimator. We have additionally introduced a new geometrical BSS method based on the minimum range of mixed sources which reduces the computational cost of the proposed steganalysis. The high efficiency of this new combined method has been confirmed by enough experiments. These experiments show that, compared to the previous active steganalysis methods our active steganalysis method not only reduces the error rate but also causes a low computational cost.", "paper_title": "A new fast and efficient active steganalysis based on combined geometrical blind source separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214100022"}
