The first step of any analysis with genotyping arrays is typically the conduct of a thorough data clean up and quality control to remove poor quality genotypes and generate metrics to inform and select individuals for downstream statistical analysis. We have developed pyGenClean, a bioinformatics tool to facilitate and standardize the genetic data clean up pipeline with genotyping array data. In conjunction with a source batch-queuing system, the tool minimizes data manipulation errors, accelerates the completion of the data clean up process and provides informative plots and metrics to guide decision making for statistical analysis.", "paper_title": "pyGenClean: efficient tool for genetic data clean up before association testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000321746100064"}
