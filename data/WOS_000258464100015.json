Studies about natural networks focused on the central role of emerging structures in distributed environments, and pointed out some properties such as small-world effect and communities which are of the most importance to guarantee a fast and efficient communication among nodes. In this paper we propose a model for P2P networks which mimics behaviours of peers in social and biological networks and naturally evolves to a robust graph of peers with some interesting properties, including small-world effect and community decomposition.
