The maximum cardinality of a minimal paired-dominating set of G is the upper paired-domination number of G, denoted by I\"(pr)(G). We establish bounds on I\"(pr)(G) for connected claw-free graphs G in terms of the number n of vertices in G with given minimum degree delta. We show that I\"(pr)(G)a parts per thousand currency sign4n/5 if delta=1 and na parts per thousand yen3, I\"(pr)(G)a parts per thousand currency sign3n/4 if delta=2 and na parts per thousand yen6, and I\"(pr)(G)a parts per thousand currency sign2n/3 if delta a parts per thousand yen3. All these bounds are sharp. Further, if na parts per thousand yen6 the graphs G achieving the bound I\"(pr)(G)=4n/5 are characterized, while for na parts per thousand yen9 the graphs G with delta=2 achieving the bound I\"(pr)(G)=3n/4 are characterized.", "paper_title": "Upper paired-domination in claw-free graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000292571000008"}
