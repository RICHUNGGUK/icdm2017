The algorithm is adaptive in the sense that it can adjust the amount of compression applied based on the bandwidth, CPU, and workload availability. It is discriminative in the sense that it can judiciously apply partial compression by selecting a subset of attributes that can provide good reduction in the used bandwidth at a low cost. The algorithm relies on the significant differences that exist among stream attributes with respect to their relative sizes, compression ratios, compression costs, and their amenability to application of custom compressors. As part of this study, we present a modeling of uniform and discriminative mixing, and provide various greedy algorithms and associated metrics to locate an effective setting when model parameters are available at run-time. Furthermore, we provide online and adaptive algorithms for real-world systems in which system parameters that can be measured at run-time are limited. Wepresent a detailed experimental study that illustrates the superiority of discriminative mixing over uniform mixing.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Fine-Grained Mixing for Adaptive Compression of Data Streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000343886200010"}
