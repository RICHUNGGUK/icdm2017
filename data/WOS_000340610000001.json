In this paper, we investigate into different confidence-learning methods for handwritten Chinese text recognition and propose a string-level confidence-learning method, which estimates confidence parameters by directly optimizing the performance of character string recognition. We first compare the performances of parametric (class-dependent and class-independent parameters) and nonparametric (isotonic regression) confidence-learning methods. Then, we propose two regularized confidence estimation methods and particularly, a string-level confidence-learning method under the minimum classification error criterion. In experiments of online handwritten Chinese text recognition, the string-level confidence-learning method is shown to effectively improve the string recognition performance. Using three character classifiers, the character correct rates are improved from 92.39, 90.24 and 88.69 % to 92.76, 90.91 and 89.93 %, respectively.", "paper_title": "Learning confidence transformation for handwritten Chinese text recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000340610000001"}
