The objective of this research is to identify current trends and future research directions in this field, and to propose a classification framework based on the following elements: production, inventory and routing aspects, modelling aspects of the objective function structure and solution approach. All these criteria are expected to be relevant for readers, and will provide researchers and practitioners a starting point for optimization models in the production and routing area at the tactical level.
