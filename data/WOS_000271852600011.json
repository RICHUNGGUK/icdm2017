Challenges in face recognition include illumination variation, pose variation, facial expression, aging, hair and glasses. In this paper, an AdaBoost committee machine is applied to improve face recognition accuracy. The commit machine consists of several classifiers of radial basis Junction neural networks (RBFNN). To speed up the training process and increase the generalization of RBFNNs, the principal component analysis (PCA) technique is applied to select adequate centers for the RBFNN classifiers and a novel weight updating mechanism is adopted to update the connection weights between the hidden neurons and output neurons. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a high recognition rate and requires a short training time.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS TO A RADIAL-BASIS FUNCTION COMMITTEE MACHINE FOR FACE RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852600011"}
