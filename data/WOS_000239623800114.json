Managing the genetic information of data has significance to the information discrimination, auditing, tracing and lookup. This paper presents Data Genome Model (DGM) and its algebra to manage the genetic information of data in its lifecycle according to the gene of life. A structure named data genome is used to carry the genetic information of data and querying algebras are defined to manipulate the genetic information.", "paper_title": "Model and algebra for genetic information of data", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800114"}
