This result is based on a protocol and intruder model which is powerful enough to uncover known attacks on the Authenticated Group Diffie-Hellman (A-DH.2) protocol suite. To prove our results, we develop a general framework in which the Dolev-Yao intruder is extended by generic intruder rules. This framework is also applied to obtain complexity results for protocols with commuting public key encryption.", "paper_title": "Complexity results for security protocols with Diffie-Hellman exponentiation and commuting public key encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000259432200001"}
