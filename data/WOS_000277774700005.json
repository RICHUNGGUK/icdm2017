In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms for reputation establishment-one for systems solely consisting of smart insiders and the other for systems in which both smart insiders and naive attackers are present. The theoretical analysis and performance evaluation show that our reputation-establishment algorithms can significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection against insider attacks in terms of the tradeoff between detection and false positives.", "paper_title": "Maintaining Defender's Reputation in Anomaly Detection Against Insider Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000277774700005"}
