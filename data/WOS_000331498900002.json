Demand from customers arrives randomly at a retailer one unit at a time. The retailer replenishes inventory from the manufacturer upon receiving a customer's order after its inventory depleted to zero. The manufacturer's production rate is assumed to be a finite constant. A production cycle starts when the manufacturer's inventory falls to or below zero and stops when its on-hand inventory reaches its optimal level. During the uptime in a production cycle, inventory is being built while randomly arriving orders from retailer are being fulfilled. The order arrival times from customers are independently and identically distributed, hence the inventory processes at both the manufacturer and the retailer become a renewal process that is difficult to solve analytically for a general distribution of order arrival time. Therefore, a numerical approach is used in developing a search procedure to obtain the optimal solution to the problem. Employing such a numerical approach, we also investigate how optimal solutions in different cases will change over the spectrum of some key parameters of the problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
