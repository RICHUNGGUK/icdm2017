This study utilizes three model approaches to predict runoff discharge in the Laonong Creek basin in southern Taiwan: the hydrological engineering center hydrological modeling system (HEC-HMS) model and two hybrid models which combine the HEC-HMS model with a genetic algorithm neural network (GANN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system approach (ANFIS). Hourly runoff discharge data during seven heavy rainfall/typhoon events were collected for model calibration (training) and validation. Six statistical indicators [i.e., mean absolute error, root-mean-square error, coefficient of correlation, error of time to peak discharge, error of peak discharge, and coefficient of efficiency (CE)] were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy. The simulation results indicate that the HEC-HMS model cannot satisfactorily predict hourly runoff discharge during the typhoon events. Both hybrid approaches that use the HEC-HMS model in conjunction with the GANN and ANFIS models can significantly improve the prediction accuracy for the n-h-ahead runoff discharge.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithm and fuzzy neural networks combined with the hydrological modeling system for forecasting watershed runoff discharge", "paper_id": "WOS:000360005900010"}
