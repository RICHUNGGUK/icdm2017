It is estimated that more than around 50% of the world electric energy generated is consumed by electric machines such as induction motor, dc motor. So, improving efficiency in electric drives is important and control strategy for minimum energy loss is needed as one of optimal operation strategies. The vector control of induction motor has been widely used to operate in a wide speed range by using flux weakening at rated speed. However, it is still necessary to advance because of coupling is behavior between fluxes in motor. In this paper, vector control approach is suggested for an optimal operation of induction motor using variable acceleration and GA-PSO tuning method through simulation. We can obtain satisfactory results for energy saving control. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
