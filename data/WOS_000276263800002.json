These applications handle multidimensional data structures (mainly arrays) to deal with the various dimensions of the data (space, time, frequency). A specification language allowing the direct manipulation of these different dimensions with a high level of abstraction is a key to handling the complexity of these applications and to benefit from their massive potential parallelism. The Array-OL specification language is designed to do just that. We introduce here an extension of Array-OL to deal with states or delays by the way of uniform inter-repetition dependences. We show that this specification language is able to express the main patterns of computation of the intensive signal processing domain.", "paper_title": "Array-OL with delays, a domain specific specification language for multidimensional intensive signal processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000276263800002"}
