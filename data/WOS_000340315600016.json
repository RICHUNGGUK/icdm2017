Web search result clustering systems, also called Web Clustering Engines, seek to increase the coverage of documents presented for the user to review, while reducing the time spent reviewing them. Several algorithms for clustering web results already exist, but results show room for more to be done. This paper introduces a new description-centric algorithm for the clustering of web results, called WDC-CSK, which is based on the cuckoo search meta-heuristic algorithm, k-means algorithm, Balanced Bayesian Information Criterion, split and merge methods on clusters, and frequent phrases approach for cluster labeling. The cuckoo search meta-heuristic provides a combined global and local search strategy in the solution space. Split and merge methods replace the original Levy flights operation and try to improve existing solutions (nests), so they can be considered as local search methods. WDC-CSK includes an abandon operation that provides diversity and prevents the population nests from converging too quickly. Balanced Bayesian Information Criterion is used as a fitness function and allows defining the number of clusters automatically. WDC-CSK was tested with four data sets (DMOZ-50, AMBIENT, MORESQUE and ODP-239) over 447 queries. The algorithm was also compared against other established web document clustering algorithms, including Suffix Tree Clustering (STC), Lingo, and Bisecting k-means. The results show a considerable improvement upon the other algorithms as measured by recall, F-measure, fall-out, accuracy and SSLk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
