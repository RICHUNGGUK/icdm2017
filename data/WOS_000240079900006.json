This left open the following tantalizing question: does there exist a non-interactive witness indistinguishable proof, where the Prover sends a single message to the Verifier for some non-trivial NP-language? In 2003, Barak, Ong and Vadhan answered this question affirmatively by derandomizing Dwork and Naor's construction under a complexity theoretic assumption, namely that Hitting Set Generators against co-nondeterministic circuits exist. In this paper, we construct non-interactive Zaps for all NP-languages. accomplish this by introducing new techniques for building NonInteractive Zero Knowledge (NIZK) Proof and Argument systems, which we believe to be of independent interest, and then modifying these to yield our main result. Our construction is based on the Decisional Linear Assumption, which can be seen as a bilinear group variant of the Decisional Diffie-Hellman Assumption. Furthermore, our single message witness-indistinguishable proof for Circuit Satisfiability is of size O(k vertical bar C vertical bar) bits, where k is a security parameter, and vertical bar C vertical bar is the size of the circuit. This is much more efficient than previous constructions of 1- or 2-move Zaps.", "paper_title": "Non-interactive Zaps and new techniques for NIZK", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079900006"}
