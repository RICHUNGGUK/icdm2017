A node a is a Social Leader if the number of cycles of length 3 passing through u is greater than the corresponding number for its neighbors. This concept is used to visualize large graphs, identify influent agents in social networks (word of mouth effect) and find communities.", "paper_title": "Social leaders in graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400030"}
