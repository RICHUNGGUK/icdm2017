It has been proved theoretically and empirically to be better than single classifiers in many scenarios. Creating diverse sets of classifier is one of the key issues in building MCSs. Feature grouping is one of the methods to create diverse classifiers and it has been shown to improve the accuracy of an MCS. In this paper, we propose a new feature grouping method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the localized Generalization Error Model as the evaluation criterion. The combined individual classifiers using the weighted sum are examined in this paper. Moreover, several feature grouping methods are compared with the proposed method in this work. The experimental results on benchmark dataset show that the MCS trained by the proposed method is promising.", "paper_title": "A novel feature grouping method for ensemble neural network using localized generalization error model", "paper_id": "WOS:000254194700011"}
