In this paper we describe a new descriptor, POEM (patterns of oriented edge magnitudes), by applying a self-similarity based structure on oriented magnitudes and prove that it addresses all three criteria. Experimental results on the FERET database show that POEM outperforms other descriptors when used with nearest neighbour classifiers. With the LFW database by combining POEM with GMMs and with multi-kernel SVMs, we achieve comparable results to the state of the art. Impressively, POEM is around 20 times faster than Gabor-based methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
