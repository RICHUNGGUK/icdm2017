The models consist of transport equations for the two phases, two coupled momentum equations, and a volume-averaged incompressibility constraint. Multigrid with Vanka-type box-relaxation scheme is used as preconditioner for the Krylov subspace solver (GMRES) to solve the momentum and incompressibility equations. Through numerical experiments of a model problem, the efficiency, robustness and scalability of the algorithm are illustrated.
