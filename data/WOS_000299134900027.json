This paper presents a multi-disciplinary strategy for computer-aided clothing thermal engineering design. It provides a systematical approach to integrate multi-disciplinary knowledge and transfer it into engineering-oriented design tools, thus the designers and manufacturers can easily carry out 1D, 2D and even 3D clothing thermal engineering designs according to the practical design requirements with a short design cycle and low design cost. The research work of this strategy begins from the investigation of the role of the thermal functions of clothing in the thermal comfort of human body. Then the framework is proposed to integrate the multi-disciplinary knowledge and illustrate the process to achieve the thermal engineering design of clothing. The important issues in the realization of computational simulation are addressed, including multi-scale model integration, data availability of characteristic parameters and hierarchical computational scheme. To issue easy-to-use design tools, the thermal functional design of clothing is quantified with important influence parameters, and the user-friendly wizard is designed for the CAD system development. Finally, the design applications of this strategy are discussed in terms of 1D, 2D and 3D thermal engineering designs with versatile CAD systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
