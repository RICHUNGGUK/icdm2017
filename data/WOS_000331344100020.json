This scheme has a higher diversity degree than conventional QRD-M detection. According to the simulation results, the performance of proposed QRD-M detection is 0.5dB to 5.5dB better than the performance of conventional QRD-M detection and average iteration time is approximately 1 in the value of M = 1, 2, 3. Therefore, the proposed QRD-M detection has better performance than conventional QRD-M detection, particularly in a high SNR environment and low modulation order.", "paper_title": "Advanced QRD-M Detection with Iterative Scheme in the MIMO-OFDM System", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100020"}
