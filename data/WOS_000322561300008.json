However, through a comprehensive literature review, we found that most research in information security focus on technical perspectives including evaluation methods and mathematical approaches for securities, risk mitigation algorithms, with some research focus on economic perspective of information security and even a few talked about social engineering of information security. There is not a unique framework to integrate different types of research in information security. We believe that information security research apply the theories and methodologies in systems engineering to investigate the problems, that is, information security engineering. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework of information security engineering. This framework explicitly illustrates the methodological system, content system, procedures and strategies for information security engineering research and practices.", "paper_title": "Information Security Engineering: a Framework for Research and Practices", "paper_id": "WOS:000322561300008"}
