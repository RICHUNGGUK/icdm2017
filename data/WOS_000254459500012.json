[Proceedings of the 26th Annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), Montreal, QC, 1994, ACM, New York, pp. 273-282]. We give a poly(n/epsilon)-time algorithm for learning a mixture of k arbitrary product distributions over the n-dimensional Boolean cube {0, 1}(n) to accuracy epsilon, for any constant k. Previous polynomial-time algorithms could achieve this only for k = 2 product distributions; our result answers an open question stated independently in [M. Cryan, Learning and Approximation Algorithms for Problems Motivated by Evolutionary Trees, Ph. D. thesis, University of Warwick, Warwick, UK, 1999] and [Y. Freund and Y. Mansour, Proceedings of the 12th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, 1999, pp. 183-192]. We further give evidence that no polynomial-time algorithm can succeed when k is superconstant, by reduction from a difficult open problem in PAC (probably approximately correct) learning finally, we generalize our poly(n/epsilon)-time algorithm to learn any mixture of k = O(1) product distributions over {0, 1,..., b - 1}(n), for any b = O(1).", "paper_title": "Learning mixtures of product distributions over discrete domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000254459500012"}
