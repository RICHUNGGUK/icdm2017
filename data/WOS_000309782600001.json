Rule 62, a member of Wolfram's class II and Chua's robust period-3 rules, believed to be simply before, is shown to have rich and complex dynamics. It is proved that the global map of rule 62 defines a subsystem with complicated dynamical properties such as topologically mixing and positive topological entropy. and is thus chaotic in the sense of both Li-Yorke and Devaney. This work also provides a systematic analysis of glider dynamics and interactions in the evolution of the rule, including several natural gliders and a catalog of dicier collisions, which were particularly studied in Wolfram's complex rules 54 and 110.", "paper_title": "Chaos and Gliders in Periodic Cellular Automaton Rule 62", "paper_id": "WOS:000309782600001"}
