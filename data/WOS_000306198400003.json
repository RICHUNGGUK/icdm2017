PWC) spiking neuron model is presented. It is shown that the generalization enables the model to reproduce 20 activities in the Izhikevich model. Among the activities, we analyze tonic bursting. Using an analytical one-dimensional iterative map, it is shown that the model can reproduce a burst-related bifurcation scenario, which is qualitatively similar to that of the Izhikevich model. The bifurcation scenario can be observed in an actual hardware.", "paper_title": "A Generalized PWC Spiking Neuron Model and Its Neuron-Like Activities and Burst-Related Bifurcations", "paper_id": "WOS:000306198400003"}
