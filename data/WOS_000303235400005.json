The uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator and the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) are obtained for the stress-strength parameter. Based on the exact distribution of the MLE of R, an exact confidence interval of R has been obtained. Bayes estimate of R and the associated credible interval are also obtained under the assumption of independent inverse gamma priors. An extensive computer simulation is used to compare the performances of the proposed estimators. One data analysis has been performed for illustrative purpose.", "paper_title": "On estimation of R = P(Y < X) for exponential distribution under progressive type-II censoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000303235400005"}
