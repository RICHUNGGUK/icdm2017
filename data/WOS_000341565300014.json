Concurrently, as process technology scales, the design effort for realizing very large scale integrated circuits and the associated costs are becoming critically high. A possible solution to address this performance/costs challenge is given by customizable multiprocessor system-on-chips. The approach proposed in this paper leads to the customization of multi/many processor system-on-chip at two levels of abstraction: 1) customization through application-specific hardware accelerators implemented on configurable datapath that can target three kinds of structured application-specific integrated circuit technologies: metal, via, and runtime programmable and 2) customization of the architectural parameters of the platform. The proposed platform is equipped with a design framework that assists the user in the high-level design-space exploration of signal processing applications described using the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) language. A peculiar added value of the flow is to support the migration of OpenCL kernels and tasks into pipelined hardware accelerators described using a C-level language. The platform is able to provide an average performance of 90 GOPS on a set of reference signal processing applications, and an average computational energy efficiency of 130 GOPS/W in its metal-programmable configuration. This result shows the benefits in terms of energy efficiency of hardware customization applied to multiprocessor systems with respect to many core devices such as general-purpose graphic processing units, able to provide on average 2.5 GOPS/W for the applications under analysis.", "paper_title": "Multicore Signal Processing Platform With Heterogeneous Configurable Hardware Accelerators", "paper_id": "WOS:000341565300014"}
