Our study is focused in the characterization of families of Algebraic Riccati Equations in terms of strictly positive real (of zero relative degree) substitutions applied to the associated H(infinity)-norm bounded system, each substitution characterizing then a particular member of the family. We also consider here Algebraic Riccati Equations associated with systems characterized by both an H(infinity)-norm constraint and an upper bound on their corresponding McMillan degree.", "paper_title": "SPR0 substitutions and families of algebraic Riccati equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000243430200006"}
