In order to ensure the stability and efficiency of grey forecasting control model, the data transformation for a raw series is an important and useful method for enhancing accuracy and improving ill-condition of the non-equigap GM(1,1) model Findings - This paper discusses the quantitative relations between the multiple transformation and the parameters of the non-equigap GM(1,1) model in detail, and studies the effect of the multiple transformation on the condition number of the non-equigap GM(1,1) model. Research limitations/implications - Accessibility and availability of data are the main limitations based on which model will be applied Practical implications - Choosing an appropriate multiple of transformation cannot only eliminate dimension, lessen computation and maintain high accuracy, but also largely reduce the condition number of the model and improve the ill-condition of non-equigap GM(1,1) model effectively Originality/value - This paper seems to be the first to discuss the stability problems for the non-equigap GM(1,1) model.", "paper_title": "Research on the stability of non-equigap grey control model under multiple transformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500007"}
