In this paper, we propose a new OMR system to recognize the music symbols without segmentation. We present a new classifier named combined neural network (CNN) that offers superior classification capability. We conduct tests on fifteen pages of music sheets, which are real and scanned images. The tests show that the proposed method constitutes an interesting contribution to OMR. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
