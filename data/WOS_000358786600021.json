Embracing the viewpoint of surfaces from circles, we characterize discrete conformality for such meshes, in which the invariants are circles, cross-ratios, and mutual intersection angles. Such transformations are important in practice for editing meshes without distortions or loss of details. In addition, they are of substantial theoretical interest in discrete differential geometry. Our framework allows for handle-based deformations, and interpolation between given meshes with controlled conformal error.", "paper_title": "Conformal Mesh Deformations with Mobius Transformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000358786600021"}
