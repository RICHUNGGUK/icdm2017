To solve the NP hard optimization problem, SBGA adopts genetic algorithm, which can choose the optimal summary on global aspect. To improve the accuracy of term frequency, SBGA employs a novel method TFS, which takes word sense into account while calculating term frequency. The experiments on DUC04 data show that our strategy is effective and the ROUGE-1 score is only 0.55% lower than the best participant in DUC04.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithm based multi-document summarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500149"}
