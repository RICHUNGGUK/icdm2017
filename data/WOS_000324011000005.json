Many errors of CNC machine tools have an effect on the accuracy and repeatability of part manufacturing. Some of these errors can be reduced by controlling the machining process and environmental parameters. However geometrical errors which have a big portion of total error need more attention. In this paper a virtual machining system which simulates the dimensional and geometrical errors of real three-axis milling machining operations is described. The system can read the machining codes of parts and enforce 21 errors associated with linear and rotational motion axes in order to generate new codes to represent the actual machining operation. In order to validate the system free form profiles and surfaces of virtual and real machined parts are compared in order to present the reliability and accuracy of the software.
