To be specific, we construct an adjacency graph to model the intra-class variation, which characterizes the modes of variability of the face images, of the values of face images from the same class, and inter-class variation which encodes the discriminating information, and then incorporate the modes of variability and discriminating information into the objective function of dimensionality reduction. Thus, 2DNMVE is robust to intra-class variation and has better generalization capability on testing data. Experiments on four face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
