To justify the use of the decentralized holonic approach and assess its performance compared to conventional scheduling systems, a series of evaluation tests and a simulation study are carried Out. As illustrated by the results obtained from the simulation study, the decentralized holonic approach is capable of delivering competitive feasible Solutions in, practically, real-time.
