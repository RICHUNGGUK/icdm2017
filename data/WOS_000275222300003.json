In this paper, we propose a portable and lightweight authentication and access control scheme for embedded devices located in a distributed environment, where maintaining consistent access control among embedded devices is difficult. A portable list of accessible resources with privileges granted to a user is encrypted in. the smart card issued to the user. Without pre-configuring access control information, an embedded system can effectively authenticate a user and deter,mine user privileges. In addition to specific features for distributed embedded systems, the proposed scheme provides many advantages over previous approaches, in terms of implementation. cost, access control facility, and security Protection.", "paper_title": "A PORTABLE INTEGRATED AUTHENTICATION AND ACCESS CONTROL SCHEME FOR DISTRIBUTED EMBEDDED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222300003"}
