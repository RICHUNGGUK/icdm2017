A way to solve this problem is feature transformation (FT). In this study, a novel unsupervised feature transformation (UFT) which can transform non-numerical features into numerical features is developed and tested. The UFT process is MI-based and independent of class label. MI-based FS algorithms, such as Parzen window feature selector (PWFS), minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection (mRMR), and normalized MI feature selection (NMIFS), can all adopt UFT for pre-processing of non-numerical features. Unlike traditional FT methods, the proposed UFT is unbiased while PWFS is utilized to its full advantage. Simulations and analyses of large-scale datasets showed that feature subset selected by the integrated method, UFT-PWFS, outperformed other FT-FS integrated methods in classification accuracy.
