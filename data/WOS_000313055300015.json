Notion of the tag for a subset defined earlier by one of the authors is extended to a submultiset. A new concept t-(v, k, lambda) list design is defined and studied. Basic existence theory for designs is extended to a new set up of list designs. In particular tags are used to prove that signed t-list designs exist whenever necessary conditions are satisfied. The concepts of homomorphisms and block spreading are extended to this new set up.", "paper_title": "Studying designs via multisets", "paper_id": "WOS:000313055300015"}
