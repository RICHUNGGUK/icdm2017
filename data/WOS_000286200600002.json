Due to the ubiquitous presence of WLAN networks, positioning techniques in these environments are the scope of intense research. This paper explores two strategies for space partitioning when utilizing cascade-connected Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) structures for indoor WLAN positioning. A set of cascade-connected ANN structures with different space partitioning strategies are compared mutually and to the single ANN structure. The benefits of using cascade-connected ANNs structures are shown and discussed in terms of the size of the environment, number of subspaces and partitioning strategy. The optimal cascade-connected ANN structures with space partitioning show up to 50% decrease in median error and up to 12% decrease in the average error with respect to the single ANN model. Finally, the single ANN and the optimal cascade-connected ANN model are compared against other well-known positioning techniques.", "paper_title": "SPACE PARTITIONING STRATEGIES FOR INDOOR WLAN POSITIONING WITH CASCADE-CONNECTED ANN STRUCTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000286200600002"}
