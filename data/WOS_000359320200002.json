A new model of computation is defined with the capability of performing runtime changes. Theoretical properties, including time and space complexities, of the defined models are presented and proven. A number of simple empirical tests are conducted in order to prove the ability to perform runtime changes as well as support obtained theoretical results. The paper concludes that the defined model has virtually no affect on performance when there are no changes and the performance with changes is easily manageable. Moreover, the results can be used to develop runtime change capabilities for a wide range of programming languages and paradigms.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Random-Access Stored-Program Machine for Runtime Code Modification", "paper_id": "WOS:000359320200002"}
