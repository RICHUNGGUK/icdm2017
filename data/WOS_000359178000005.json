In most of these scenarios, applications can be decomposed into tasks that collectively produce their results; tasks interactions give rise to arbitrarily complex workflows. In this paper we propose methods and tools for designing crowd-based workflows as interacting tasks. We describe the modelling concepts that are useful in this framework, including typical workflow patterns, whose function is to decompose a cognitively complex task into simple interacting tasks for cooperative solving. We then discuss how workflows and patterns are managed by Crowd Searcher, a system for designing, deploying and monitoring applications on top of crowd-based systems, including social networks and crowdsourcing platforms. Tasks performed by humans consist of simple operations which apply to homogeneous objects; the complexity of aggregating and interpreting task results is embodied within the framework. We show our approach at work on a validation scenario and we report quantitative findings, which highlight the effect of workflow design on the final results.", "paper_title": "DESIGNING COMPLEX CROWDSOURCING APPLICATIONS COVERING MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AND TASKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000359178000005"}
