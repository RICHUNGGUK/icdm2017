In addition, encapsulated partitions are used to share the computational resources of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) among software modules of multiple application subsystems. This paper investigates the benefits of the DECOS architecture as an electronic infrastructure for future car generations. The shift to an integrated architecture will result in quantifiable cost reductions in the areas of system hardware cost and system development. In the paper we present a current federated Fiat car E/E architecture and discuss a possible mapping to an integrated solution based on the DECOS architecture. The proposed architecture provides a foundation for mixed criticality integration with both safety-critical and non safety-critical subsystems. In particular, this architecture supports applications up to the highest criticality classes (10(-9) failures per hour), thereby taking into account the emerging dependability requirements of by-wire functionality in the automotive industry.", "paper_title": "An integrated architecture for future car generations", "paper_id": "WOS:000247168600006"}
