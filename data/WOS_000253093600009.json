The two main reasons for failure to converge arc: (1) the fulfillment of the assumptions for a specific method of analysis; (2) the limitation of the numerical method in evaluating the factor of safety. It will be demonstrated that there are problems where convergence for the \"rigorous\" methods is not achieved by the conventional iteration analysis, but physically acceptable results may exist for sonic of these \"non-converged\" problems, if the failure to converge is due to the second reason as given above. With reference to sonic of the designs by the engineers in Hong Kong, the authors will also demonstrated that the minimum factors of safety obtained by the current design practice may be over-estimated due to the convergence problem in the stability analysis.
