It is known that this sorting problem can be solved in polynomial time on the basis of breakpoint graphs, when block-interchanges are weighted 2 (or >= 3) and the others are weighted 1. In this study, we design a novel and easily implemented algorithm for this problem by utilizing the permutation group theory in algebra.", "paper_title": "Sorting by Reversals, Generalized Transpositions, and Translocations Using Permutation Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000279272400003"}
