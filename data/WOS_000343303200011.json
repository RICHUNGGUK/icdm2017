However, the majority of the existing FTC methods continue to force the system to follow the pre-fault trajectories without considering the reduction in available control resources caused by actuator faults. Forcing the system to follow the same trajectories as before fault occurrence may result in actuator saturation and system's instability. Thus, pre-fault objectives should be redefined in function of the remaining resources to avoid potential saturation. The main contribution of this paper is a flatness-based trajectory planning/re-planning method that can be combined with any active FTC approach. The work considers the case of over-actuated systems where a new idea is proposed to evaluate the severity of faults occurred. In addition, the trajectory planning/re-planning approach is formulated as an optimisation problem based on the analysis of attainable efforts domain in fault-free and fault cases. The proposed approach is applied to two satellite systems in rendezvous mission.", "paper_title": "Trajectory planning/re-planning for satellite systems in rendezvous mission in the presence of actuator faults based on attainable efforts analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303200011"}
