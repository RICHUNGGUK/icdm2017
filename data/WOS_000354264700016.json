When stirred, however, the mud substance flows like a liquid and again begins settling out. Mud is composed of various sized particles, and they produce different effects when it is blended with water. This paper classifies the mud particles into three types and proposes different simulation methods for the types. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively produce visually plausible muddy water effects.
