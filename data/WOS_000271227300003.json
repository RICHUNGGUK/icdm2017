In order to limit the amount of information potentially available in a video we adopt a description of the video content based on the use of local scale-invariant features, both oil the object modeling (training sequence) and the recognition phase (test sequences). Then, by means of an ad hoc matching procedure, we look for similar groups Of features both in modeling and recognition The final pipeline we propose is based oil the construction of an incremental model of the test sequence. thanks to which we perform on-line recognition We present experimental results on objects recognition in videos, showing how our approach can be effectively applied to rather complex settings (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Spatio-temporal constraints for on-line 3D object recognition in videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000271227300003"}
