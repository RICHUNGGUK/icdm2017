The first stage for this kind of classification methods is to select a pre-specified number of genes, which are likely to be the most relevant to the occurrence of a disease, and passes these genes to the second stage for classification. In this paper, we use four gene selection mechanisms and two classification tools to compose eight two-stage classification methods, and test these eight methods on eight microarray data sets for analyzing their performance. The first interesting finding is that the genes chosen by different categories of gene selection mechanisms are less than half in common but result in insignificantly different classification accuracies. A subset-gene-ranking mechanism can be beneficial in classification accuracy, but its computational effort is much heavier. Whether the classification tool employed at the second stage should be accompanied with a dimension reduction technique depends on the characteristics of a data set. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
