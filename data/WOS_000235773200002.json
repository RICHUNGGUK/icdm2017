We introduce as a new shape feature shape orientability, i.e. the degree to which a shape has distinct (but not necessarily unique) orientation. A new method is described for measuring shape orientability, and has several desirable properties. In particular, unlike the standard moment based measure of elongation, it is able to differentiate between the varying levels of orientability of n-fold rotationally symmetric shapes.", "paper_title": "Shape orientability", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200002"}
