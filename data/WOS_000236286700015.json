The transform allows the estimation of image moments from measured sinogram data without the need for matrix inversion or the intermediate step of image reconstruction. The transform is invertible and, thereby, gives insight into the connection between image moments and tomographic image reconstruction. It also suggests an alternative method for the efficient Computation of Zernike moments of an image. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
