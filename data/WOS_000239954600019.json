This content covers the derivative side of calculus and is being used by students in the LEACTIVEMATH learning environment. LEAM-CALCULUS is the first collection trying to make use of most of the features of the learning environment including advanced usages Of OPENMATH and OMDOC. It has been written in OQMATH, a readable XML-syntax. This paper describes the tools to produce it, how they were used and combined, the resulting content and the experience gained. It argues that the declaration of new OPENMATH symbols is a requirement and explains challenges of authoring semantic mathematical content. Finally, it presents the management activities to support the authoring process.", "paper_title": "Authoring LeActiveMath calculus content", "paper_id": "WOS:000239954600019"}
