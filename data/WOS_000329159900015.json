In this framework, both the feature extraction and classification are obtained by solving corresponding convex optimization problem with trace norm regularization. For feature extraction, robust principle component analysis (robust PCA) via minimization a combination of the nuclear norm and the l(1)-norm is used to extract low-rank matrix features which are robust to white noise and gross corruption for audio signal. These low-rank matrix features are fed to a linear classifier where the weight and bias are learned by solving similar trace norm constrained problems. For this linear classifier, most methods find the parameters, that is the weight matrix and bias in batch-mode, which makes it inefficient for large scale problems. In this article, we propose a parallel online framework using accelerated proximal gradient method. This framework has advantages in processing speed and memory cost. In addition, as a result of the regularization formulation of matrix classification, the Lipschitz constant was given explicitly, and hence the step size estimation of the general proximal gradient method was omitted, and this part of computing burden is saved in our approach. Extensive experiments on real data sets for laugh/non-laugh and applause/non-applause classification indicate that this novel framework is effective and noise robust.", "paper_title": "Audio Classification with Low-Rank Matrix Representation Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000329159900015"}
