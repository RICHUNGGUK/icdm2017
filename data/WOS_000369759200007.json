Computational prediction of the residue location of PTMs enhances the functional characterization of proteins. ADP-Ribosylation is an important type of PTM, because it is implicated in apoptosis, DNA repair, regulation of cell proliferation, and protein synthesis. However, mass spectrometric approaches have difficulties in identifying a vast number of protein ADP-Ribosylation sites. Therefore, a computational method for predicting ADP-Ribosylation sites of human proteins seems useful and necessary. Four types of sequence features and an incremental feature selection technique are utilized to predict protein ADP-Ribosylation sites. The final feature set for ADPR prediction modeling is optimized, based on a minimum redundancy maximum relevance criterion, so as to make more accurate predictions on aspartic acid ADPR modified residues. Our prediction model, ADPRtool, is capable to predict Asp-ADP-Ribosylation sites with a total accuracy of 85.45%, which is as good as most computational PTM site predictors. By using a sequence-based computational method, a new ADP-Ribosylation site prediction model - ADPRtool, is developed, and it has shown great accuracies with total accuracy, Matthew's correlation coefficient and area under receiver operating characteristic curve.", "paper_title": "ADPRtool: A novel predicting model for identification of ASP-ADP-Ribosylation sites of human proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000369759200007"}
