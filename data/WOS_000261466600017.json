For the WLAN security, the IEEE 802.1X standard provides an authentication framework that is based on the Extensible Authentication Protocols (EAP). In the EAP framework, there are many authentication protocols that have been proposed, in which each authentication protocol has some strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Most EAP authentication protocols lack two features: identity protection and withstanding man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, we first propose a novel symmetric-key based certificate distribution scheme based on Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) cards in a cellular network. The symmetric-key based certificate distribution scheme allows mobile subscribers to obtain temporary certificates from the corresponding cellular network. Combining the proposed certificate distribution scheme with the EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol, we present a new EAP authentication protocol called USIM-based EAP authentication protocol. The new EAP authentication protocol combining with USIM cards is an extension of the EAP-TLS protocol and also follows the EAP framework in the IEEE 802.1X standard. Compared to other EAP authentication protocols, the proposed protocol provides mutual authentication, strong identity protection and roaming capability between the cellular network and the WLAN networks.
