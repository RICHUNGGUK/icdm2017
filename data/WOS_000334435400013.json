Subsets of cell counts called minimal patterns are defined, corresponding to non-singular design matrices and leading to potentially uncontaminated maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters and thereby the expected cell counts. A criterion to easily produce minimal patterns in the two-way case under independence is derived, based on the analysis of the positions of the chosen cells. A simulation study and a couple of real-data examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the newly developed outlier identification algorithm, and to compare it with other existing methods.", "paper_title": "Outlier detection in contingency tables based on minimal patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000334435400013"}
