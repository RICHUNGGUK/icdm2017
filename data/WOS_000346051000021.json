When molecular typing requires to genotype multiple DNA stretches, several pyrosequencing primers could be used simultaneously but this would create overlapping primer-specific signals, which are visually uninterpretable. Accordingly, the objective was to develop a new method for signal processing (AdvISER-M-PYRO) to automatically analyze and interpret multiplex pyrosequencing signals. In parallel, the nucleotide dispensation order was improved by developing the SENATOR ('SElecting the Nucleotide dispensATion Order') algorithm. Results: In this proof-of-concept study, quintuplex pyrosequencing was applied on eight bacterial DNA and targeted genetic alterations underlying resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Using SENATOR-driven dispensation order, all genetic variants (31 of 31; 100%) were correctly identified with AdvISER-M-PYRO. Among nine expected negative results, there was only one false positive that was tagged with an 'unsafe' label. Availability and implementation: SENATOR and AdvISER-M-PYRO are implemented in the AdvISER-M-PYRO R package (http://sites.uclouvain. be/md-ctma/index.php/softwares) and can be used to improve the dispensation order and to analyze multiplex pyrosequencing signals generated in a broad range of typing applications.", "paper_title": "Amplicon identification using SparsE representation of multiplex PYROsequencing signal (AdvISER-M-PYRO): application to bacterial resistance genotyping", "paper_id": "WOS:000346051000021"}
