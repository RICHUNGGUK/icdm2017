Instead of focusing on the minimal rule set, this algorithm hierarchically extracts rules in multistages from data sets to suit changing environments in learning and classification. In addition, a heuristic strategy is employed in the algorithm to improve its performance and reduce the time consumed in inducing. Experiments are carried out, and the results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in inducing rules which can enhance their adaptive capacities.", "paper_title": "A multistage rule induction algorithm in classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000251312600006"}
