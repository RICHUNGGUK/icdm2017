This paper aims to develop scheduling heuristics and to present application experience for reducing power consumption of parallel tasks in a cluster with the Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) technique. In this paper, formal models are presented for precedence-constrained parallel tasks, DVFS-enabled clusters, and energy consumption. This paper studies the slack time for non-critical jobs, extends their execution time and reduces the energy consumption without increasing the task's execution time as a whole. Additionally, Green Service Level Agreement is also considered in this paper. By increasing task execution time within an affordable limit, this paper develops scheduling heuristics to reduce energy consumption of a tasks execution and discusses the relationship between energy consumption and task execution time. Models and scheduling heuristics are examined with a simulation study. Test results justify the design and implementation of proposed energy aware scheduling heuristics in the paper.
