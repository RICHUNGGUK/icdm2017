This paper considers the problem of communication over a finite-ring matrix channel Y = AX + BE, where X is the channel input, Y is the channel output, E is random error, and A and B are random transfer matrices. Tight capacity results are obtained and simple polynomial-complexity capacity-achieving coding schemes are provided under the assumption that A is uniform over all full-rank matrices and BE is uniform over all rank-t matrices, extending the work of Silva, Kschischang, and Kotter (2010), who handled the case of finite fields. This extension is based on several new results, which may be of independent interest, that generalize concepts and methods from matrices over finite fields to matrices over finite chain rings.", "paper_title": "Communication Over Finite-Chain-Ring Matrix Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900006"}
