Nontree clock network has been recognized as a promising approach to overcome the variation problem. Existing nontree clock routing methods are restricted to a few simple or regular structures, and often consume excessive amounts of wirelength. This paper suggests to construct a low-cost nontree clock network by inserting crosslinks in a given clock tree. The effects of the link insertion on clock skew variability are analyzed. Based on the analysis, this paper proposes two link insertion schemes that can quickly convert a clock tree to a nontree with significantly lower skew variability and very limited wirelength increase. In these schemes, the complicated nontree delay computation is circumvented. Further, they can be applied to the recently popular nonzero skew routing easily. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques has been validated through SPICE-based Monte Carlo simulations.", "paper_title": "Reducing clock skew variability via crosslinks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237956000020"}
