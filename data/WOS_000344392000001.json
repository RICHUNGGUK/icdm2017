Realizers are written in a classical version of Girard's System F and can be viewed as programs that learn by interacting with the environment. We show that the realizers of any Pi(0)(2)-formula represent terminating learning processes whose outcomes are numerical witnesses for the existential quantifier of the formula.", "paper_title": "Interactive Realizability for second-order Heyting arithmetic with EM1 and SK1", "paper_id": "WOS:000344392000001"}
