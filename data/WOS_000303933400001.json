Two possible subcarrier allocation methods are considered for soft hand-over. One method is to use an identical subcarrier set between the two cells participating in the hand-over. The other is to use different subcarrier sets between the two cells. As expected, the different subcarrier strategy is better in terms of diversity order and BER than the identical subcarrier strategy. It will be shown that the BER performance difference between the two strategies is more noticeable with contiguous subcarrier allocation. But the different subcarrier strategy consumes twice more frequency resources than the other, and there is a trade-off between the two strategies in terms of BER and frequency resources. By considering the trade-off, we also propose a subcarrier allocation strategy for soft hand-over.", "paper_title": "On OFDM Subcarrier Allocation Strategies for Soft Hand-off in Cellular Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000303933400001"}
