BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) is the de facto standard in the Web service community. The purpose of this paper is to design and implement a workflow management system based on BPEL in a grid environment. The approach to integrating BPEL with WSRF (Web Services Resource Framework), is to put forward a simple cluster model of BPEL engines and application component oriented workflow defining respectively to satisfy the specific requirements in a grid environment, such as stateful interactions, dynamic service binding, high throughput and scalability, and friendly workflow defining. Finally, a prototype of a workflow system implemented in ChinaGrid Supporting Platform (CGSP) is also given.", "paper_title": "Grid-enabled workflow management system based on BPEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000258920200002"}
