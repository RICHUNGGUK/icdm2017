However, these techniques have two critical disadvantages, i.e., manual collection of training data set and time-consuming training process; furthermore, trained classifiers are hard to generalize from a specific railway to the others. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a fast template matching-based algorithm, named FTM, in this paper. Firstly, we use a template matching method to locate the bolts with constrains of the railway geometric structure. Then, we use a nearest neighbor classifier to determine whether a bolt is in position or not. At last, we use GPU with CUDA architecture to accelerate the most time-consuming part of FTM. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed FTM algorithm achieves the accuracy of 98.57% in average, and the average false positive is only 0.89%. The overall speedup of FTM by GPU is 6.11, and the most time-consuming part gets speedup of 17.73. Furthermore, FTM only need to collect several samples in a new railway without laborious training work.", "paper_title": "A fast template matching-based algorithm for railway bolts detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000348041000002"}
