Frame rules allow the hiding of irrelevant parts of the state during verification, whereas the anti-frame rule allows the hiding of local state from the context. We discuss the semantic foundations of frame and anti-frame rules, and present the first sound model for Chargueraud and Pottier's type and capability system including both of these rules. The model is a possible worlds model based on the operational semantics and step-indexed heap relations, and the worlds are given by a recursively defined metric space. We also extend the model to account for Pottier's generalised frame and anti-frame rules, where invariants are generalised to families of invariants indexed over preorders. This generalisation enables reasoning about some well-bracketed as well as (locally) monotone uses of local state.", "paper_title": "A step-indexed Kripke model of hidden state", "paper_id": "WOS:000312392100001"}
