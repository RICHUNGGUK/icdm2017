However, it consumes a big amount of time and memory especially for large images/videos, limiting its practical usage. In this paper, we propose an efficient manifold preserving edit propagation method. We accelerate the original method from two aspects. First, instead of using a fixed neighborhood size in building the manifold structure, we adaptively determine neighborhood size for each pixel based on its local complexity in feature space, which largely reduces average neighborhood size. Secondly, following Xu et al. (2009) [2], we adaptively cluster all pixels, and solve the edit propagation problem on clusters instead of pixels. Our experiment shows that, compared to the original method (Chen et al., 2012) [1], our method significantly reduce time and memory costs without reducing visual fidelity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
