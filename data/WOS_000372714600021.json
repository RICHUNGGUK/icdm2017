VPHL features propositional, rather than additive, assertions and a simple set of rules for reasoning about these assertions using the standard axioms of probability theory. VPHL's assertions are partial correctness assertions, meaning that their conclusions are dependent upon (deterministic) program termination. The underlying simple probabilistic imperative language, PrImp, includes a probabilistic toss operator, probabilistic guards and potentially-non-terminating while loops.", "paper_title": "VPHL: A Verified Partial-Correctness Logic for Probabilistic Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000372714600021"}
