Moreover, we derive the asymptotic exponential growth rate of the weight distributions in the limit of large codelength. Interestingly, we show that the normalized typical minimum distance does not monotonically increase with the size of the field.", "paper_title": "Weight Distributions of Non-binary LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000289922100006"}
