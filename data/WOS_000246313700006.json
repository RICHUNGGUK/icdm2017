We address the issues of automatically processing speech data into a usable voice using automatic segmentation techniques and how the knowledge obtained at labelling time can be exploited at synthesis time. We describe target cost and join cost implementation for such a system and describe the outcome of building voices with a number of different sized datasets. We show that, in a competitive evaluation, voices built using this technology compare favourably to other systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
