It is assumed that only the receivers have (perfect) knowledge of the channel state and that fading correlation is receiver-sided. The main purpose of the paper is accomplished by introducing a few very simple concepts and performing some clear-cut algebraic manipulations, making the presentation virtually self-contained. The results show a substantial capacity reduction in the presence of correlation between receiver antennas. It is also shown that employing linear arrays with nonuniform spacings may improve the system capacity, and a simple technique to exploit this possibility is presented. Isotropic and nonisotropic propagation scenarios are studied.", "paper_title": "On the derivation of the exact, closed-form capacity formulas for receiver-sided correlated MIMO channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000253602200013"}
