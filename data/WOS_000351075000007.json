To improve the data rate both for users served by macro base stations (BSs) and those by RRH nodes, this paper proposes a joint selection interference control (JSIC) based scheme, where each user equipment (UE) in the cell feeds its channel state information back to the corresponding BS based on the best companion cluster (BCC) method. After sharing users' information through the high-speed backhaul, macro-BS and RRH node make beam and UE selection simultaneously in order to avoid too much interference. To compare with JSIC-based scheme, we also discuss a related work prioritized selection interference control (PSIC)-based scheme. Simulation results show that JSIC-based scheme has a better performance of total throughput than PSIC-based scheme, providing fairness between macro users and RRH-users.", "paper_title": "Interference Control Based on Beamforming Coordination for Heterogeneous Network with RRH Deployment", "paper_id": "WOS:000351075000007"}
