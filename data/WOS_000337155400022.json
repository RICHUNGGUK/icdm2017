Scheduling in the medium access control layer, i.e., the selection of active communication links, plays an important role in improving efficiency of communication in CPS. Different from traditional scheduling algorithms designed for pure data communication networks, the scheduling in CPS is for the purpose of optimizing the physical dynamics and needs to be designed with awareness of the dynamics. In this paper, the scheduling problem in CPS is fitted into the framework of the hybrid systems, in which different selections of links correspond to different dynamic modes. Both centralized and distributed scheduling algorithms are designed. The proposed algorithms are also applied in the background of voltage control of distributed generations (DGs). Numerical simulations show that the proposed framework and algorithms achieve good performances.", "paper_title": "Data Traffic Scheduling for Cyber Physical Systems With Application in Voltage Control of Distributed Generations: A Hybrid System Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000337155400022"}
