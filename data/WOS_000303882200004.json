Virtual screening was conducted on a number of p38 alpha MAPK crystal structures using a library of 46 known p38 alpha MAPK inhibitors containing a heterocyclic core substituted by pyridine and fluorophenyl rings (structurally related to SB203580) and a set of decoy compounds. Multiple protonation states and tautomers of active and decoy compounds were considered. Each docking model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and enrichment factors. The two best performing single crystal structures were found to be 1BL7 and 2EWA, with enrichment factors of 14.1 and 13.0 at 2 % of the virtual screen respectively. Ensembles of up to four receptors of similar conformations were generated, generally giving good or very good performances with high ROC AUCs and good enrichment. The 1BL7-2EWA ensemble was able to outperform each of its constituent receptors and gave high enrichment factors of 17.3, 12.0, 8.0 at 2, 5 and 10 % respectively, of the virtual screen. A ROC AUC of 0.94 was obtained for this ensemble. This method may be applied to other proteins where there are a large number of inhibitor classes with different binding site conformations.", "paper_title": "Virtual screening using a conformationally flexible target protein: models for ligand binding to p38 alpha MAPK", "paper_id": "WOS:000303882200004"}
