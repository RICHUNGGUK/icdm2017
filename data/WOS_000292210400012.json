Database researchers are one of the key players and main sources to the growth of the database systems. They are playing a foundational role in creating the technological infrastructure from which database advancements evolve. We analyze the database research publications of nine top-tier and prestigious database research venues. In particular, we study the publications of four major core database technology conferences (SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, EDBT), two main theoretical database conferences (PODS, ICDT) and three database journals (TODS, VLDB Journal, TKDE) over a period of 10 years (2001-2010). Our analysis considers only regular papers as we do not include short papers, demo papers, posters, tutorials or panels into our statistics. In this study, we report the list of the authors with the highest number of publications for each conference/journal separately and in combined. We analyze the preference of the database research community towards publishing their work in prestigious conferences or major database journals. We report about the most successful co-authorship relationships in the database research community in the last decade. Finally, we analyze the growth in the number of research publications and the size of the research community in the last decade.", "paper_title": "A decade of database research publications: a look inside", "paper_id": "WOS:000292210400012"}
