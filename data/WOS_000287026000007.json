The developed research model is tested empirically using a field survey of 230 users. This study finds that users' past service encounters (NCIs), belief (perceived ease of use and usefulness), satisfaction (quality attributes cumulative satisfaction and overall satisfaction) and attitude are key antecedents of continued usage intention. Four dimensions of both NCIs and quality attributes in e-learning (administration procedures, e-learning system functionality, instructional process and human interaction) are explored in this study. Results indicate that NCIs in teaching and administration are comparatively more important in determining user satisfaction and continuance intention. Further analysis finds that the recorded lecture content and the response time to users are the most critical problems in teaching and administration. In practice, this model can identify the key problems of satisfaction and continuance intention to help managers and teachers react promptly or make right decisions about how to better achieve higher user retention rates.", "paper_title": "Understanding e-learning continuance intention: a negative critical incidents perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000287026000007"}
