Complex workflows required by the end users are dissected into smaller workflows that can be combined freely to larger meta-workflows. General quantum chemical workflows are described here as well as the real use case of a spectroscopic analysis resulting in an end-user desired meta-workflow. All workflow features are implemented via Web Services Parallel Grid Runtime and Developer Environment and submitted to UNICORE. The workflows are stored in the Molecular Simulation Grid repository and ported to the SHIWA repository.
