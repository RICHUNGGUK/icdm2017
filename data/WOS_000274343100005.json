In this paper, we combine swarm intelligence and node-disjoint multipath routing to alleviate these problems. A novel approach called ant-based energy-aware disjoint multipath routing algorithm (AEADMRA) is proposed. AEADMRA is based on swarm intelligence and especially on the ant colony-based meta heuristic. AEADMRA can discover multiple energy-aware node-disjoint routing paths with a low routing overhead. Simulation results indicate that the performance of AEADMRA outperforms other pertinent algorithms.", "paper_title": "Ant-based Energy-aware Disjoint Multipath Routing Algorithm for MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000274343100005"}
