Molecular simulations are conducted to validate the force field by calculating thermal expansion coefficients, crystal bulk and Young's moduli, power spectra, self-diffusion coefficients, and activation energies of self-diffusions for benzene and n-hexane. The calculated results are in good agreement with available experimental data. The proposed force field is suitable for simulations of adsorption or diffusion of organic molecules with flexible frameworks.", "paper_title": "An all-atom force field developed for Zn4O(RCO2)(6) metal organic frameworks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332180100040"}
