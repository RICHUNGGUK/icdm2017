The application of a multiple linear regression analysis indicated that a combination of distance-based topological indices with the ad hoc molecular descriptors and the indicator parameters yielded a statistically significant model for the activity, log K (the reduction of arornatic nitro compounds by xanthine oxidase). The final selection of a potential aromatic nitro compound for the reduction by xanthine oxidase is made by quantum molecular modeling. We have found that, among the various parameters, the quantum Mulliken charge parameters on the fourth atom or para position relative to the nitro group correlated best with the activity.", "paper_title": "QSAR and SAR studies on the reduction of some aromatic nitro compounds by xanthine oxidase", "paper_id": "WOS:000235021200014"}
