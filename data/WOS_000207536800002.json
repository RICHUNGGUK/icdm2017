A switchedbased model developed in-house for the GaN power device is used extensively for analysing and designing the 1 GHz CMCD PA in hybrid technology. The load coupling network, comprising a load transformation network, a higher harmonic impedance termination tank and a balun, measures only 3.7 cmx7.6 cm while providing suitable means for tuning the performance of the amplifier. The fabricated hybrid CMCD PA delivers an output power of around 36 dBm with an DC-to-RF efficiency of 65% over a wide frequency band.", "paper_title": "1 GHz Current Mode Class-D Power Amplifier in Hybrid Technology Using GaN HEMTs", "paper_id": "WOS:000207536800002"}
