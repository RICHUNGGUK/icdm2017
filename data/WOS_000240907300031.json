Our approach is founded on the definition of patterns of dialogues between groups of agents, expressed as protocols. Our protocols are flexible and directly executable. Furthermore, our language allow us to specify the connection between communication and knowledge transfer in a way that is independent of the specific reasoning techniques used.", "paper_title": "Specifying protocols for knowledge transfer and action restriction in multiagent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240907300031"}
