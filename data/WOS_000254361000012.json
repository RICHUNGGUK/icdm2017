Despite some controversy in the literature, careful analysis supported by theoretical studies leads to the conclusion that decomposition to P-III derivatives proceeds via an elimination reaction.", "paper_title": "The decomposition of alpha-aminophosphine oxides to phosphonic acid derivatives (P-III)", "paper_id": "WOS:000254361000012"}
