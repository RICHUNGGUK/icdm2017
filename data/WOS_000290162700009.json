As the core of modern communication systems, active devices such as field effect transistors (FETs) require up-to-date models to accurately integrate such effects, especially in terms of noise performance since most of communication systems operate in noisy environments. Furthermore, to keep low-noise amplification over a wide frequency band, the transistor noise resistance R(n) must be substantially reduced to make the system insensitive to impedance matching. Since this can be realized through large gate-width devices, a novel large gate-width FET noise model is proposed which efficiently integrates EM wave propagation effects, one of the most important EM effects in mm-wave frequencies.", "paper_title": "Advanced CAD tool for noise modeling of RF/microwave field effect transistors with large gate widths", "paper_id": "WOS:000290162700009"}
