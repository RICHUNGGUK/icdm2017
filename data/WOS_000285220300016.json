Laboratory and field tests of compaction grouting have been carried out. In this paper, a numerical model is used to simulate the compaction grouting process with the primary purpose of investigating relationships among various control parameters, such as injection pressure, void ratio and excess pore water pressure at various radial distances from the injection point. The compaction process is treated as a cavity expansion process in the numerical simulation. The soil is modelled with an elasto-plastic Mohr-Coulomb model using the commercial finite element program ABAQUS. In addition to numerical simulations, pressure-controlled cavity expansion laboratory tests were carried out on completely decomposed granite (CDG) soil specimens. Data collected from laboratory tests are compared with the finite element simulation to validate the finite element analyses. Factors that control the compaction process, such as the coefficient of earth pressure (K), initial void ratio, number of loading cycles and effective confining pressure, are explored in the numerical simulations.
