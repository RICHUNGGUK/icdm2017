Feng, Intrapersonal subspace analysis with application to adaptive Bayesian algorithm for face recognition, Pattern Recognition 38(4) (2005) 617-621], we proposed a subspace distance. However, whether the subspace distance satisfies the triangle inequality was left open. In this note, we give positive answer to the open problem and prove our assertion.
