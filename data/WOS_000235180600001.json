Clustered data arise in many applications such as longitudinal data and repeated measures. The GEE approach focuses on models for the mean of the correlated observations within clusters without fully specifying the joint distribution of the observations. It has been widely used in statistical practice. This paper illustrates the application of the GEE approach with geepack through an example of clustered binary data.", "paper_title": "The R Package geepack for Generalized Estimating Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000235180600001"}
