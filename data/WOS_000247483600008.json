Major changes in appearance are due to different and varying illumination conditions and the deformable geometry of people. These effects are hard to estimate and take into account in real-life applications. Thus, in this paper we propose an illumination-tolerant appearance representation, which is capable of coping with the typical illumination changes occurring in surveillance scenarios. The appearance representation is based on an online k-means colour clustering algorithm, a data-adaptive intensity transformation and the incremental use of frames. A similarity measurement is also introduced to compare the appearance representations of any two arbitrary individuals. Post-matching integration of the matching decision along the individuals' tracks is performed in order to improve reliability and robustness of matching. Once matching is provided for any two views of a single individual, its tracking across disjoint cameras derives straightforwardly. Experimental results presented in this paper from a real surveillance camera network show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Tracking people across disjoint camera views by an illumination-tolerant appearance representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000247483600008"}
