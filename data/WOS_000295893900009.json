Dynamic consistency is the requirement that ex-ante contingent choices are respected by updated preferences. Such updating, in this context, implies dependence on the feasible set of payoff vectors available in the problem and/or on an ex-ante optimal act for the problem. Despite this complication, the algorithms are formulated concisely and are easy to implement, thus making dynamically consistent updating operational in the presence of ambiguity.
