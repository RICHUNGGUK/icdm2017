This paper proposes a new scheduling algorithm for real-time tasks using multiobjective hybrid genetic algorithm (mohGA) on heterogeneous multiprocessor environment. In solution algorithms, the genetic algorithm (GA) and the simulated annealing (SA) are cooperatively used. In this method, the convergence of GA is improved by introducing the probability of SA as the criterion for acceptance of new trial solution. The proposed algorithm has a multiobjective to minimize the total tardiness and completion time simultaneously. For these conflicting objectives, this paper combines adaptive weight approach (AWA) that utilizes some useful information from the current population to readjust weights for obtaining a search pressure toward a positive ideal point. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown through simulation studies. In simulation studies, the results of the proposed algorithm are better than that of other algorithms.
