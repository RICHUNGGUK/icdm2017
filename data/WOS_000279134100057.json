The SPNNs includes the projection neural network as its special case. Based on the Lyapunov method, the global exponential stability of the SPNNs is derived and proved under some mild conditions. In addition, simulation results on numerical examples show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed SPNNs. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.
