Locality preserving projection (LPP) is a recently proposed method for unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction. LPP seeks to preserve the local structure which is usually more significant than the global structure preserved by principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In this paper, we investigate its extension, called supervised locality preserving projection (SLPP), using class labels of data points to enhance its discriminant power in their mapping into a low dimensional space. The GSLPP method, which is robust to variations of illumination and facial expression, applies the SLPP to an augmented Gabor feature vector derived from the Gabor wavelet representation of face images. We performed comparative experiments of various face recognition schemes, including the proposed GSLPP method, principal component analysis (PCA) method, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method, locality preserving projection method, the combination of Gabor and PCA method (GPCA) and the combination of Gabor and LDA method (GLDA). Experimental results on AR database and CMU PIE database show superior of the novel GSLPP method.", "paper_title": "Gabor feature based face recognition using supervised locality preserving projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100059"}
