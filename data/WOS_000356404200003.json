In typical processing flow of multichannel interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), techniques based on statistical methods or iterative methods does not work very well with limits of specific BiSAR configurations. Moreover, the tradeoff between the correctness and precision of the reconstruction of different baselines needs to be overcome as well. Based on the advantages of multichannel BiSAR configuration, basic idea is the joint utilization of amplitude data, iterative reconstruction results and ML results to help the optimization of the total MRF energy function. Thus, a multichannel DEM reconstruction method based on Markov Random Fields (MRFs) for BiSAR, which concerns much about discontinuities and energy functions, is proposed to achieve not only correct but also more precise results. Afterward, the strategy to determine the weight parameter and processing flow is presented. Finally, simulated and real data experiments are given to validate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Multichannel DEM reconstruction method based on Markov random fields for bistatic SAR", "paper_id": "WOS:000356404200003"}
