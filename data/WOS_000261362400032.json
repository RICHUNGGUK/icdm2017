The deployment goal is modeled by a graph that describes the session structure. From this graph, the proposed decentralized deployment algorithm finds out the optimal configuration of services which satisfies the relevant session node. In accordance with the self-management paradigms, the service configuration found is automatically deployed on node. A deployment platform called collaborative deployment system (CDS) has been designed and implemented on top of a peer-to-peer layer to carry on the whole deployment process. CDS is mainly composed of: (1) deployment entities modeling services; (2) P2P communication services (announcements, search and retrieval services) adapted for deployment: and (3) deployment algorithm implementation. Performance is assessed by focusing on the most important parts of the platform: (1) the deployment algorithm assessment and (2) the P2P networking assessment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
