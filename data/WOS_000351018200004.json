Increased power density, coupled with spatio-temporal variability of chip workloads, causes on-die temperature non-uniformities. The assumption of a uniform temperature for the delay and power analysis of a large CMOS circuit produces inaccurate results. For this reason, significant design margins are taken to ensure safe operation. To improve design quality, we need precise localization of hotspots at detailed spatial resolution which is very computationally intensive. Consequently, thermal analysis needs to be done at multiple levels of granularity using a versatile thermal floorplan. We propose MiMAPT, an approach for analyzing delay, power and temperature in digital circuits. MiMAPT integrates seamlessly into major industrial Front-end and Back-end chip design flows. It accounts for temperature non-uniformities and self-heating while performing analysis. Thermal analysis is done at register-transfer (RT) and then gate-level considering non-regular shapes of on-die units with multiple scales of resolution and speed. To demonstrate the capability of MiMAPT in temperature variation aware delay/power estimation, a widely used IP block is chosen and four different chips are implemented using 65 nm and 40 nm (LVT, HVT) technology nodes. Different temperature patterns are then applied to the design. Accuracy improvements of up to 28% for static power and 16% for minimum clock period are reported in comparison with uniform averaged temperature assumption. Evaluating the ability of MiMAPT in multi-scale thermal analysis, a speed-up of 98x is reported compared to fine-grained method, while keeping false negatives at zero and the error of temperature estimation below 0.05 degrees C.
