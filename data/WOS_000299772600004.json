From a dual perspective, this research examined the effects of trust, satisfaction as enablers, and switching barrier as inhibitors on the postadoption usage of mobile services. A survey was used to collect data, and data analysis was conducted with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that trust, satisfaction, and switching barrier have significant effects on the postadoption usage. In addition, service quality and perceived value strongly affect trust and satisfaction, whereas switching cost determines switching barrier. These results advance our understanding of mobile users' postadoption usage as extant research has focused on using a single perspective of enablers such as perceived usefulness to examine mobile user behavior.", "paper_title": "Examining Postadoption Usage of Mobile Services From a Dual Perspective of Enablers and Inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000299772600004"}
