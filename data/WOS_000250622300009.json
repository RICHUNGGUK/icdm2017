The hypothesis is Supported by published analyses of nine major superfolds. Here, we have generated multiple sequence alignments for the nine superfolds with PDB codes Ithb, lilb, 256b, 2rhe, laps, 2stv, 4fxn (2fox), 1Ubq and 7tim and have analvsed the degree of conservation at the loop ends. Seventy percent of these loop ends are found to be well conserved and the peak in the distribution of distances between these well conserved regions lies at around 25 residues; both observations are consistent with the Berezovsky and Trifonov's hypothesis.
