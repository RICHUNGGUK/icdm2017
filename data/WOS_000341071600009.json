Fault-tolerant reconfiguration reorganizes fault-free PEs to a new regular topology by changing the interconnection among PEs. This paper investigates the problem of constructing as large as possible logical array with short interconnects from a physical array with faults. A flexible rerouting scheme is developed to improve the efficiency of utilizing fault-free PEs. Under the scheme, two efficient reconfiguration algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm is able to generate the maximum logical array (MLA) in linear time. The second algorithm reduces the interconnect length of the MLA, and it is capable of producing nearly optimal logical arrays in comparison to the lower bound of the interconnect length, that is also proposed in this paper. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the flexible rerouting schemes and the proposed algorithms. For 128 x 128 host arrays with 30% unavailable PEs, the proposed approaches improve existing algorithm up to 44% in terms of logical array size, while reducing the interconnection redundancy by 49.6%. In addition, the proposed algorithms are more scalable than existing approaches. On host arrays with 50% unavailable PEs, our algorithms can produce logical arrays with harvest over 56% while existing approaches fail to construct a feasible logical array. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
