Define its Alexander dual as the simplicial complex X* = {sigma subset of V vertical bar V \\ sigma is not an element of X}. The combinatorial Alexander duality states that the ith reduced homology group of X is isomorphic to the (vertical bar V vertical bar - i - 3) th reduced cohomology group of X* (over a given commutative ring R).
