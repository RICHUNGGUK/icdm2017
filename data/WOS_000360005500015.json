This has motivated a significant amount of research on heterogeneous computing techniques, along with the design of CPU-GPU fused chips and petascale heterogeneous supercomputers. In this article, we survey Heterogeneous Computing Techniques (HCTs) such as workload partitioning that enable utilizing both CPUs and GPUs to improve performance and/or energy efficiency. We review heterogeneous computing approaches at runtime, algorithm, programming, compiler, and application levels. Further, we review both discrete and fused CPU-GPU systems and discuss benchmark suites designed for evaluating Heterogeneous Computing Systems (HCSs). We believe that this article will provide insights into the workings and scope of applications of HCTs to researchers and motivate them to further harness the computational powers of CPUs and GPUs to achieve the goal of exascale performance.", "paper_title": "A Survey of CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Computing Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000360005500015"}
