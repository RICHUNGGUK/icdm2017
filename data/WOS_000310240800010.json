In two particular cases, defects were added in the carbon nanotube wall. These defects are a double oxygenated vacancy (Vac(2)O(2)) and a double vacancy but without oxygen which creates two pentagons and an octagon. Our results show how geometries using QM/MM and energies calculations carried out with QM, change on both the gold nanocluster and the carbon nanotube. In addition, an application of ONIOM methodology in a comparative study to predict behavior of structures as hybrid materials based in carbon nanotubes combined with gold nanoclusters is shown. In this work we examine geometry changes on both the gold nanocluster and the carbon nanotube. A comparison is made with the binding energy resulting values as well as with the orbital energies such as the frontier orbitals HOMO and LUMO.", "paper_title": "Computational study of Au_4 cluster on a carbon nanotube with and without defects using QM/MM methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000310240800010"}
