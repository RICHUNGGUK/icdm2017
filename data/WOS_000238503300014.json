Such situations are frequently dealt with in microarray analysis where the number of tests is much larger than the sample size. The proposed test statistic is based on a certain distance between the distributions from which the samples under study are drawn. In a simulation study, the proposed permutation test is compared with permutation counterparts of the t-test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The usefulness of the proposed test is discussed in the context of microarray gene expression data and illustrated with an application to real datasets. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
