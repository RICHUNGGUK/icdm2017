Generally trust metrics endorse the principle \"the higher the trust, the more legitimate that user will be\"; a consequence is that getting trusted must require some effort, otherwise all participants would easily achieve high trustworthiness. In this work we study how a user can achieve and preserve a good trust and what costs it requires over time; we also investigate some heuristics that allow reducing the complexity in exploring the rank-effort space especially for large networks.", "paper_title": "THE COST OF TRUST IN THE DYNAMICS OF BEST ATTACHMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000357750700008"}
