A data is characterized by a set of values. Without loss of the generality, it is assumed that the data with a set of smaller values is preferred. The classification is to label if a particular data belongs to a specified group according to a set of predetermined characteristic or attribute values. We treat such a data as a decision making unit (DMU) with these given attribute values as input and an artificial output of identical value 1. Then classifying a data is equivalent to testing if the DMU is in the production possibility set, called acceptance domain, constructed by a sample training data set. The proposed DEA classification machine consists of an acceptance domain and a classification function. The acceptance domain is given by an explicit system of linear inequalities. This makes the classification process computationally convenient. We then discuss the preference cone restricted classification process. The method can be applied to classifying large amount of data. Furthermore, the research finds that DEA classification machines based on different DEA models have the same format. Input-oriented and output-oriented DEA classification machines have similar properties. The method developed has great potential in practice with its computational efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
