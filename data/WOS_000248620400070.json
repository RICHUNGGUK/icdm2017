A fast and cost-efficient approach to identify large numbers of novel candidates is the SNP mining of large scale sequencing projects. The increasing availability of sequence trace data in public repositories makes it feasible to evaluate SNP predictions on the DNA chromatogram level. MAVIANT, a platform-independent Multipurpose Alignment VIewing and Annotation Tool, provides DNA chromatogram and alignment views and facilitates evaluation of predictions. In addition, it supports direct manual annotation, which is immediately accessible and can be easily shared with external collaborators. Results: Large-scale SNP mining of polymorphisms bases on porcine EST sequences yielded more than 7900 candidate SNPs in coding regions (cSNPs), which were annotated relative to the human genome. Non-synonymous SNPs were analyzed for their potential effect on the protein structure/function using the PolyPhen and SIFT prediction programs. Predicted SNPs and annotations are stored in a web-based database. Using MAVIANT SNPs can visually be verified based on the DNA sequencing traces. A subset of candidate SNPs was selected for experimental validation by resequencing and genotyping. This study provides a web-based DNA chromatogram and contig browser that facilitates the evaluation and selection of candidate SNPs, which can be applied as genetic markers for genome wide genetic studies.", "paper_title": "SNP mining porcine ESTs with MAVIANT, a novel tool for SNP evaluation and annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400070"}
