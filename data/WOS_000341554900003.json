Its system models comprise abstract descriptions of the application and the underlying execution platform. They provide the input to our analysis and optimization techniques that enable the automated exploration of design alternatives for applications with reliability requirements. The automated generation of source code and platform configuration files speeds up the development process. Our contribution is to advance reliability-aware design further into practice by providing an integrated tool framework and removing unrealistic assumptions in the analyzes. The case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
