We demonstrate how geometric properties of the relative state map can be used to develop operationally well-defined measures of the total correlation in bipartite quantum systems of arbitrary state space dimension. These measures are invariant under local unitary transformations and non-increasing under local operations. We show that some known correlation measures have a natural interpretation in terms of relative states.", "paper_title": "RELATIVE STATE MEASURES OF CORRELATIONS IN BIPARTITE QUANTUM SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300538000008"}
