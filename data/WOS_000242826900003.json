Interesting features of this approach include learning without manual tuning, learning from very few training samples, incremental learning of characters, and adaptation to the user-specific needs. The proposed system can deal with two-dimensional graphical shapes such as Latin and Asian characters, command gestures, symbols, small drawings, and geometric shapes. It can be used as a building block for a series of recognition tasks with many applications.", "paper_title": "Online handwritten shape recognition using segmental hidden Markov models", "paper_id": "WOS:000242826900003"}
