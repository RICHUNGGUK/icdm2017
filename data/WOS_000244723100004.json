This code is known to have good performance with an iterative decoding algorithm, as shown by Johnson and Weller in ( Proceedings at the ICEE Globe com conference, Sanfrancisco, CA, 2003). We shall prove that C has a double cyclic structure and that by shortening in a suitable way H it is possible to obtain new codes which have higher code-rate. We shall also present a simple way to constructing the matrix H via a geometric approach.", "paper_title": "LDPC codes from the Hermitian curve", "paper_id": "WOS:000244723100004"}
