In this problem, adaptive choice of input signal is allowed. This problem is discussed in various settings. It is proved that adaptive choice does not improve the exponential error rate in these settings. These results are applied to quantum state discrimination.", "paper_title": "Discrimination of Two Channels by Adaptive Methods and Its Application to Quantum System", "paper_id": "WOS:000268107200029"}
