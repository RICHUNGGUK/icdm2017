An emphasis on keeping costs down results into sensor networks that do not warrant high connectivity, thereby making routing a more crucial activity. In the purview of routing, ZigBee consortium has developed a PAN routing protocol. Other notable efforts are underway chartered by IETF as 6LoWPAN working group. In this paper, we have revisited the routing approaches suggested both for intra-PAN and mesh. Our contribution here is first to identify the plausibility of using gateways in routing functionality in 6LoWPAN networks. Second, we propose a protocol that defines the role of gateways for enhancing the routability of 6LoWPANs. Through NS2-based simulation study, our performance analysis amenably supports the applicability of our protocol.", "paper_title": "GARPAN: Gateway-assisted inter-PAN routing for 6LoWPANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100020"}
