However, if a mobile node ( MN)'s session activity is high and its mobility is relatively low, HMIPv6 may degrade end-to-end data throughput due to the additional packet tunneling at the MAP. In this paper, we propose an adaptive route optimization ( ARO) scheme to improve the throughput performance in HMIPv6 networks. Depending on the measured session-to-mobility ratio ( SMR), ARO chooses one of the two different route optimization algorithms adaptively. Specifically, an MN informs a correspondent node ( CN) of its on-link care-of address ( LCoA) if the CN's SMR is greater than a predefined threshold. If the SMR is equal to or lower than the threshold, the CN is informed with the MN's regional CoA ( RCoA). We analyze the performance of ARO in terms of balancing the signaling overhead reduction and the data throughput improvement. We also derive the optimal SMR threshold explicitly to achieve such a balance. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that ARO is a viable scheme for deployment in HMIPv6 networks.", "paper_title": "Adaptive route optimization in hierarchical mobile IPv6 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247246300004"}
