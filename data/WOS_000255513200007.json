The main shortcomings of podcasts are two. The first one is that there is no formal description of the contents of a podcast session, apart from a textual description only available in HTML. The second problem is that a podcast session consists of a single audio file. Thus, it is very difficult to seek into one of the music tracks that compose a podcast. Our proposal to cope with these problems uses traditional audio signal processing - such as speech versus music segmentation, and audio identification -, and semantic web techniques to automatically describe and decompose the audio content of a podcast session. Yet, we believe that adding semantics to the podcast to explain its content, and decomposing it into smaller and meaningful chunks ( that permits seeking into the inner parts of the file) will ease important music information retrieval tasks, such as recommendation, filtering and discovery.
