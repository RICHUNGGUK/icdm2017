These layers consist of the semantic information found in the data sets, whose information allows the system executing data analysis processes to understand the data to a certain extent and to reason based on this analysed information. Such processes are executed by semantic data analysis systems which are called cognitive categorisation systems in the introduced classification of cognitive systems dedicated to analyses in various fields of application. Cognitive data analysis systems are also expanded by adding processes of learning new solutions hitherto unknown to the system because it had no appropriate pattern defined or because it had no data allowing the analysed data to be unambiguously assigned to its corresponding pattern. The ability to train the system so that it would correctly interpret the analysed data marks the beginning of the development of a new class of systems analysing data/individual features in the course of biological modelling, personalisation and personal identification processes. Identification systems are enhanced by adding elements of cognitive categorisation systems in order to execute an in-depth, more detailed personal analysis using the information collected in the system, whose information concerns not only the anatomical and physical features, but also, or maybe primarily, lesions found in various human organs. Such systems could be used in personal identification cases in which there are doubts and a risk arises due to reasoning from incomplete data sets. Adding semantic analysis modules to personal identification systems represents a novel scientific proposition which marks the beginning of the use of semantic analysis processes for biological modelling and personalisation tasks. The solutions proposed are illustrated with the example of selected E-UBIAS systems which analyse medical image data in combination with the identity analysis. The use of DNA cryptography and DNA code to analyse personal data makes it possible to unanimously assign analysed data to an individual at the personal identification stage. This publication presents also the system with semantic analysis processes conducted based on semantic interpretation and cognitive processes allows the possible lesions that the person suffers from to be identified and authorised.
