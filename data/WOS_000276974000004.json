This shows that the topological complexity of an omega-language accepted by a 1-counter Buchi automaton or of an infinitary rational relation accepted by a 2-tape Buchi automaton is not determined by the axiomatic system ZFC. We show that a similar result holds for the class of languages of infinite pictures which are recognized by Buchi tiling systems. We infer from the proof of the above results an improvement of the lower bound of some decision problems recently studied by the author.", "paper_title": "THE COMPLEXITY OF INFINITE COMPUTATIONS IN MODELS OF SET THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000276974000004"}
