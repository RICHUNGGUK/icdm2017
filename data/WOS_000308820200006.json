However, the Taguchi method is unable to deal with multi-response problems that are of main interest today, owing to increasing complexity of manufacturing processes and products. Several recent studies have been conducted in order to solve this problem. But, they did not effectively treat situations where responses are correlated and situations in which control factors have continuous values. This study proposed an integrated model for experimental design of processes with multiple correlated responses, composed of three stages which (1) use expert system, designed for selecting an inner and an outer orthogonal array, to design an actual experiment, (2) use Taguchi's quality loss function to present relative significance of responses, and multivariate statistical methods to uncorrelate and synthesise responses into a single performance measure, (3) use neural networks to construct the response function model and genetic algorithms to optimise parameter design. The effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated with three examples. Results of analysis showed that the proposed approach could yield a better solution in terms of the optimal parameters setting that results in a higher process performance measure than the traditional experimental design.", "paper_title": "An integrated approach to optimise parameter design of multi-response processes based on Taguchi method and artificial intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000308820200006"}
