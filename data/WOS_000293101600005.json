The application of B-spline based elastic registration during interventional treatment is seriously hampered by its considerable computation time. The graphics processing unit (GPU) can be used to accelerate the calculation of such elastic registrations by using its parallel processing power, and by employing the hardwired tri-linear interpolation capabilities in order to efficiently perform the cubic B-spline evaluation. In this article it is shown that the similarity measure and its derivatives also can be calculated on the GPU, using a two pass approach. On average a speedup factor 50 compared to a straight-forward CPU implementation was reached. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
