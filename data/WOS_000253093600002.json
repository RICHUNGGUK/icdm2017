By treating the pile as it one-dimentional bar and the half space as a three-dimensional poroelastic continuum, the dynamic interaction between the pile and poroelastic medium is formulated in a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the influence of pile flexibility, geometrical properties of pile-saturated soil system and frequency of excitation on the pile's torque, torsional angle and coupled impedances. The conclusions obtained can serve as guidelines for the design and dynamic pile testing of practical engineering. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
