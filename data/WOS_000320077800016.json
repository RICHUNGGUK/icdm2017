Using an abstract model mechanism with specific signal interfaces for user callback, the unified structured analysis data, shared by the electronic system level design, functional verification, and performance evaluation, enables efficient management review, auto-generation of code, and modeling in the transaction level. We introduce the class tree, flow parameter diagram, structured flow chart, and event-driven finite state machine as structured analysis models. As a sand table to carry maps from different perspectives and levels via an engine, this highly reusable platform provides the mapping topology to search for unintended consequences and the graph theory for comprehensive coverage and smart test cases. Experimental results show that the engine generates efficient test sequences, with a sharp increase in coverage for the same vector count compared with a random test.", "paper_title": "A novel intelligent verification platform based on a structured analysis model", "paper_id": "WOS:000320077800016"}
