However, due to the computational cost of these high fidelity simulations, the use of neural networks, kernel methods, and other surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable. Surrogate models are compact and cheap to evaluate, and have proven very useful for tasks such as optimization, design space exploration, prototyping, and sensitivity analysis. Consequently, in many fields there is great interest in tools and techniques that facilitate the construction of such regression models, while minimizing the computational cost and maximizing model accuracy. This paper presents a mature, flexible, and adaptive machine learning toolkit for regression modeling and active learning to tackle these issues. The toolkit brings together algorithms for data fitting, model selection, sample selection (active learning), hyperparameter optimization, and distributed computing in order to empower a domain expert to efficiently generate an accurate model for the problem or data at hand.", "paper_title": "A Surrogate Modeling and Adaptive Sampling Toolbox for Computer Based Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000282523000004"}
