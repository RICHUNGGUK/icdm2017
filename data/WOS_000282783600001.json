The environment is equipped with a relatively sparse set of passive RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) tags. The robot can detect the presence of the tags when traveling in their proximity and combines this information with the one given by other sensors (e.g. odometry). The RFID measurements are characterized by a highly non Gaussian noise: for this reason in the literature Particle Filter (PF) methods have often been used to fuse these data with the measurements coming from other sensors. In this paper a different approach is pursued, based on the observation that RFID readings can be considered as noisy quantized measurements of the pose of the robot or as noisy dynamic constraints on the pose itself. This allows to exploit the rich literature on Kalman quantized filtering or Kalman constrained estimation, to realize reliable methods with a satisfactory performance which require a computational time significantly lower with respect to the one needed by a PF. Simulative and experimental results will be reported to illustrate the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Constrained and quantized Kalman filtering for an RFID robot localization problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000282783600001"}
