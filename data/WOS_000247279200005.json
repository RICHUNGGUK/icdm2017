We focus on the case where the connection cache has a size of one and show that this problem is not equivalent to standard paging, even if there are only two locations for the pages, by giving the first lower bound that is strictly higher than k for this problem. We then give the first upper bound below the trivial value of 2k for this problem. Our upper bound is k + 4l where E is the number of locations where the requested pages in a phase come from. This algorithm groups pages by location. In each phase, it evicts all pages from one location before moving on to the next location. In contrast, we show that the LRU algorithm is not better than 2k-competitive. We also examine the resource augmented model and show that the plain FIFO algorithm is optimal for the case h = 2 and all k >= 2. where h is the size of the offline document cache. We show that also in this case FIFO is better than LRU, although this is not true for standard paging. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
