The hybrid model is important to large-scale real-time network simulations, where the packet-level emulation traffic is handled by discrete events and the majority of the background traffic is described more efficiently as fluids. We present a simple performance analysis of this hybrid approach. We propose three techniques-namely, pointer caching, update dampening, and dynamic time stepping-in an implementation of the hybrid model. Experiments show that these techniques can significantly improve the performance of the fluid-based network simulation.
