We propose a constructive scheme based on a set of curves on the surface of a 2N-dimensional sphere. Our approach shows that the design of good codes for this communication problem relies on geometrical properties of spherical codes and projections of N-dimensional rectangular lattices. Theoretical comparisons with some previous works in terms of the mean squared error as a function of the channel SNR, as well as simulations, are provided.", "paper_title": "Curves on Flat Tori and Analog Source-Channel Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324573500031"}
