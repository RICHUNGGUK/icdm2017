The nonlinearity of a S-box f : F-2(m) -> F-2(n) is the minimum nonlinearity of its component (Boolean) functions upsilon center dot f, upsilon epsilon F-2(n)\\ {0}. This notion quantifies the level of resistance of the S-box to the linear attack. In this paper, the distribution of the nonlinearity of (m, n)-functions is investigated. When n = 1, it is known that asymptotically, almost all m-variable Boolean functions have high nonlinearities. We extend this result to (m, n)-functions.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic nonlinearity of vectorial Boolean functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000332599900001"}
