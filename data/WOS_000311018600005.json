The computational complexity of this problem was open in the past. In this paper, we first show that this problem is NP-hard by a reduction from Exact 3-Cover. Subsequently, we present a parameterized algorithm based on a refined search tree technique with a running time of O(4.612(k) + vertical bar V vertical bar(4.5)), which improves the trivial algorithm of running time O(6(k) + vertical bar V vertical bar(4-5)).
