A simplified coupled-mode theory (CMT) approach is proposed for what we believe to be the first time, whose validity is demonstrated by comparing its simulation results with that of the complete CMT equations. With the simplified CMT approach, a theoretical spectral analysis of coupling from core mode to counter-propagating radiation modes in reflective tilted fiber Bragg gratings is presented. The influence of grating length, refractive index modulation amplitude and tilt angle is exhaustively investigated on the transmission spectrum characteristics. The different dependences between s-polarized and p-polarized radiation-mode coupling on grating tilt angle are discussed, and the coupling strength of 45A degrees-tilted gratings shows the greatest polarization dependence with the limitation of backward-propagating radiation-mode coupling.", "paper_title": "Analysis of coupling from core mode to counter-propagating radiation modes in tilted fiber Bragg gratings", "paper_id": "WOS:000277417400017"}
