In this study, we propose a new noise removal algorithm that relies on noise detection, motion detection, and an adaptive filter. In order to compute the filter parameters and increase filtering effectiveness, we design the adaptive filter using five fields. Image quality is improved through adaptive spatial and temporal processing. Experimental results show that this method can be effective in reducing large region TV noise while maintaining the original TV image information. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed method can provide better picture quality in a shorter processing time.", "paper_title": "High-efficiency TV video noise reduction through adaptive spatial-temporal frame filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000359746300008"}
