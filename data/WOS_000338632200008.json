In this work, the structural, energetic, and electronic properties of the metallo base pairs T-Hg-T and U-Hg-U were investigated using density functional theory. In order to evaluate the geometric and energetic effects on the stacking interaction, the systems (T-Hg-T)(3) and (U-Hg-U)(3) systems as well as the dinucleotide systems d(T-Hg-T)(2) and d(U-Hg-U)(2) were examined. Results show that the exchange-correlation functionals B3LYP-D3 and M06-L yield reasonable information on these systems that is in agreement with the available experimental data.", "paper_title": "DFT investigation of the mismatched base pairs (T-Hg-T)(3), (U-Hg-U)(3), d(T-Hg-T)(2), and d(U-Hg-U)(2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000338632200008"}
