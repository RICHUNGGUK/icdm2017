Therefore, this paper developed a decision support model with genetic algorithms, called SCHEMA (SCHeduling Exhibitions for Museum of Art). In the model the galleries are the resource which the exhibitions utilize in the sequence of their priority values The model's evaluation shows to be significantly effective in planning time, percent usage of the gallery. and the number of exhibitions scheduled. Because all the complex computations are done by the model. the decision making process of the scheduling stage is speeded up considerably. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
