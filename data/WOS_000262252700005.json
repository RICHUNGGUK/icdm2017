Recently, Ren et at. proposed an authentication and access control scheme for preserving privacy in pervasive computing environments (PCEs). However, in this paper, it is demonstrated that the so-called secure, privacy preserving authentication and access control scheme proposed by Ren et al. is vulnerable to service abuse attacks and, as a result. illegitimate users can freely access the service through the service provider without any worries and this flaw would lead to a serious accounting problem with their scheme. Therefore, we proposed a security improvement to their scheme to neutralize this weakness and an efficiency improvement to enhance the performance of their scheme in the user operational phase. More importantly, a new improved proposal for a scheme can still allow the mobile user to anonymously interact with the service provider in a PCE is demonstrated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
