However, most studies so far on video detection investigate the global similarity between two short clips using a pre-defined distance function. Although there are a few works on video subsequence detection, all these proposals fail to provide an effective query processing mechanism. In this paper, we first generalize the problem of video similarity matching. Then, a novel solution called consistent keyframe matching (CKM) is proposed to solve the problem of subsequence matching based on video segmentation. CKM is designed with two goals: (1) good scalability in terms of the query sequence length and the size of video database and (2) fast video subsequence matching in terms of processing time. Good scalability is achieved by employing a batch query paradigm, where keyframes sharing the same query space are summarized and ordered. As such, the redundancy of data access is eliminated, leading to much faster video query processing. Fast subsequence matching is achieved by comparing the keyframes of different video sequences. Specifically, a keyframe matching graph is first constructed and then divided into matched candidate subgraphs. We have evaluated our proposed approach over a very large real video database. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "paper_title": "Efficient subsequence matching over large video databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000306510200003"}
