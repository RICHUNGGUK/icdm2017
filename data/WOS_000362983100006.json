We construct distributional-thesauri-based networks from data at different time points and cluster each of them separately to obtain word-centric sense clusters corresponding to the different time points. Subsequently, we propose a split/join based approach to compare the sense clusters at two different time points to find if there is 'birth' of a new sense. The approach also helps us to find if an older sense was 'split' into more than one sense or a newer sense has been formed from the 'join' of older senses or a particular sense has undergone 'death'. We use this completely unsupervised approach (a) within the Google books data to identify word sense differences within a media, and (b) across Google books and Twitter data to identify differences in word sense distribution across different media. We conduct a thorough evaluation of the proposed methodology both manually as well as through comparison with WordNet.", "paper_title": "An automatic approach to identify word sense changes in text media across timescales", "paper_id": "WOS:000362983100006"}
