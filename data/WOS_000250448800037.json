This improves a recent result of Bazzi and Mitter, (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 52, pp. 3210-3219, 2006). The proof is based on the study of a particular class of codes invariant under dihedral groups using a blend of representation theory and probabilistic arguments. The methods are closely related to those used in Bazzi and Mitter. In order to complete the proof a number theoretical result of Hasse is needed.", "paper_title": "Self-dual doubly even 2-quasi-cyclic transitive codes are asymptotically good", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800037"}
