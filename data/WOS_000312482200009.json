However, the effects of quantization on the statistics have not yet been accounted for. This paper therefore reconciles the previous papers to the underlying mathematical theory, develops a mathematical model of quantized statistics of continuous functions, and proves convergence of geometric approximations to continuous statistics for regular sampling lattices. In addition, the computational cost of various approaches is considered, and recommendations made about when to use each type of statistic.", "paper_title": "Integrating Isosurface Statistics and Histograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000312482200009"}
