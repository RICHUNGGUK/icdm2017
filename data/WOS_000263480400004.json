In the absence of disturbances, a uniform ultimate boundedness property of the tracking error with respect to an arbitrarily small set around the origin is guaranteed, as well as the uniform boundedness of all the signals in the closed loop. The proposed switching adaptive controller effectively avoids possible division by zero, while guaranteeing the continuity of switching. In this way, problems connected to existence of solutions and chattering phenomena are alleviated. Simulations illustrate the approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Neural Network Tracking Control With Disturbance Attenuation for Multiple-Input Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263480400004"}
