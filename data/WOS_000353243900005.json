The main motivation is to raise the level of generality for search methodologies. The objective of the hyper-heuristic is to produce solutions of acceptable quality for a number of optimisation problems. In this work, we demonstrate the generality through experimental results for different variants of exam timetabling problems. The hyper-heuristic represents an automated constructive method that searches for heuristic choices from a given set of low-level heuristics based only on non-domain-specific knowledge. The high-evel search methodology is based on a simple estimation distribution algorithm. It is capable of guiding the search to select appropriate heuristics in different problem solving situations. The probability distribution of low-level heuristics at different stages of solution construction can be used to measure their effectiveness and possibly help to facilitate more intelligent hyper-heuristic search methods.", "paper_title": "Hybridising heuristics within an estimation distribution algorithm for examination timetabling", "paper_id": "WOS:000353243900005"}
