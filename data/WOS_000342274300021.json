In this work, we demonstrate that the use of the SBT collision scheme together with the TAS technique reduces the total number of particles (simulators), the number of grid cells and respectively, the computational memory, required for simulation of low Knudsen number micro/nano flows, while the accuracy is preserved. The efficiency of the SBT-TAS is investigated in details for two typical benchmark cases, namely, low Knudsen/low speed flow in a rectangular micro-cavity and high speed/high gradient flow over a nano-scale flat plate.
