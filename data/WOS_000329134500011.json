A common method employed for this purpose is duty-cycled operation, which extends battery lifetime yet incurs several types of energy wastes and challenges. A promising alternative to duty-cycled operation is the use of wake-up radio (WuR), where the main microcontroller unit (MCU) and transceiver, that is, the two most energy-consuming elements, are kept in energy-saving mode until a special signal from another node is received by an attached, secondary, ultra-low power receiver. Next, this so-called wake-up receiver generates an interrupt to activate the receiver node's MCU and, consequently, the main radio. This article presents a complete wake-up radio design that targets simplicity in design for the monetary cost and flexibility concerns, along with a good operation range and very low power consumption. Both the transmitter (WuTx) and the receiver (WuRx) designs are presented with the accompanying physical experiments for several design alternatives. Detailed analysis of the end system is provided in terms of both operational distance (more than 10 m) and current consumption (less than 1 mu A). As a reference, a commercial WuR system is analyzed and compared to the presented system by expressing the trade-offs and advantages of both systems.", "paper_title": "Design, Development, and Performance Evaluation of a Low-Cost, Low-Power Wake-Up Radio System for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329134500011"}
