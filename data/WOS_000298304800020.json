By exploiting multiple routes inherent in an interconnect structure, this method can tolerate faulty connections by efficiently finding alternative paths. The proposed approach is compatible with previous interconnect detection and diagnosis methods under oscillation ring schemes, and together they can be applied to implement a robust interconnect structure that may still provide correct communication even under multiple link faults in Network-on-Chips (NoCs). With such knowledge, designers can significantly improve interconnect reliability by augmenting vulnerable interconnect structures in NoCs. As a result, the experimental results show that alternative paths in NoCs can be found for almost all paths. Hence, the proposed method provides a good way to achieve fault tolerance and reliability/yield improvement.", "paper_title": "Maximal Interconnect Resilient Methodology for Fault Tolerance, Yield, and Reliability Improvement in Network on Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800020"}
