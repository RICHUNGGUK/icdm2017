The method consists of coupling the recently developed Iterative Conditional Fitting (ICF) algorithm with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. It provides positive definite estimates for any sample size, and does not rely on any structural assumption concerning the PPZ. It can be easily adapted to many versions of EM.", "paper_title": "A new method for the estimation of variance matrix with prescribed zeros in nonlinear mixed effects models", "paper_id": "WOS:000263181200002"}
