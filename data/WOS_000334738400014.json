With radial basis function neural network, the controller parameters are tuned on-line directly using the measured input and output data of the plant, when the plant model is unavailable. The stability of the proposed method is guaranteed by rigorous theoretical analysis, and the effectiveness and applicability are verified by numerical simulation and further demonstrated by the experiment on three tanks water level control process.", "paper_title": "Data-Driven MFAC for a Class of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems With RBFNN", "paper_id": "WOS:000334738400014"}
