We prove that the proposed algorithm is optimal and requires simple computing operations that can be implemented by simple devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a sensor wake-up frequency that depends on the sensor's location in the routing paths. Using simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm significantly increases the lifetime of the network while guaranteeing a maximum on the end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "An Optimal Wake-Up Scheduling Algorithm for Minimizing Energy Consumption While Limiting Maximum Delay in a Mesh Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000265437800016"}
