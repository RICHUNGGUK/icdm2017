In general, the ecological data are difficult for analysis due to complexity residing in the systems with the variables varying in non-stationary fashion. Therefore, we needs to efficient methods that are able to measure from various environmental conditions. In this paper the wavelet transform are introduced as an alternative tool for extracting local and global information out of complex ecological data. And we discuss the method that is applicable to various relative fields.", "paper_title": "Non-stationary movement analysis using wavelet transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300123"}
