To improve signal extraction performance and expand its application, we develop an adaptive BSE algorithm with an additive noise model. We first present an improved normalized kurtosis as an objective function, which caters for the effect of noise. By combining the objective function and Lagrange multiplier method, we further propose a robust algorithm that can extract the desired signal as the first output signal. Simulations on both synthetic and real biomedical signals demonstrate that such combination improves the extraction performance and has better robustness to the estimation error of normalized kurtosis value in the presence of noise.", "paper_title": "A robust extraction algorithm for biomedical signals from noisy mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000297646300002"}
