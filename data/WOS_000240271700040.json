To this end we extend the information complexity approach of Chakrabarti, Shi, Wirth, and Yao (2001) and Bar-Yossef, Jayram, Kumar, and Sivakumar (2004) to our restricted version of the multiparty number on the forehead model. The best currently known multiparty protocol for pointer jumping by Damm, Jukna, and Sgall (1998) works in this model.", "paper_title": "NOF-multiparty information complexity bounds for pointer jumping", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700040"}
