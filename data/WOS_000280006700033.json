DLPP/MMC seeks to maximize the difference, rather than the ratio, between the locality preserving between-class scatter and locality preserving within-class scatter. DLPP/MMC is theoretically elegant and can derive its discriminant vectors from both the range of the locality preserving between-class scatter and the range space of locality preserving within-class scatter. DLPP/MMC can also derive its discriminant vectors from the null space of locality preserving within-class scatter when the parameter of DLPP/MMC approaches + infinity. Experiments on the ORL, Yale, FERET, and PIE face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed DLPP/MMC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
