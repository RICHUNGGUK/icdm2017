The information on the building type (detached building, terraced building, etc.) is essential for a variety of relevant applications of 3D city models like spatial marketing, real estate management and marketing, and for visualization. The derivation of the building type from coarse data (mainly 2D footprints, building heights and functions) seems impossible at first sight. However it succeeds by incorporating the spatial context of a building. Since the input data can be derived easily and at very low cost, this method is widely applicable. Nevertheless, as with all supervised learning algorithms, obtaining labelled training data is very time-consuming. Herewith, we provide a method which uses outlier detection and clustering methods to support users in efficiently and rapidly obtaining adequate training data.", "paper_title": "Automatic classification of building types in 3D city models", "paper_id": "WOS:000299768900003"}
