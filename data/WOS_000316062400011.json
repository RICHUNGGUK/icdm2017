The power divider consists of an input CPW port and two output rectangular waveguide ports. The CPW to rectangular waveguide power divider using the dipole slot has a return loss larger than 15 dB and an insertion loss equal to 3.08-3.27 dB in the whole X-band (8.2-12.4 GHz). Furthermore, to broaden the bandwidth, the dipole slot is replaced by the bow-tie slot. The CPW to rectangular waveguide power divider using the bow-tie slot yields a return loss larger than 16 dB and an insertion loss equal to 3.05-3.29 dB from 8 to 13 GHz, which exceeds the X-band. To verify our design, power dividers that use the dipole slot or the bow-tie slot are fabricated and measured. The measurement results of both power dividers are in good agreement with the simulation results. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
