However, successful combination of hand-written rules and a stochastic approach to Czech, as well, as some initial experiments in acquisition of tagging rules for Polish revealed potential capabilities of a rule based approach. The goals are: to define a language of tagging constraints, to construct a set of reduction rules for Polish and to apply Machine Learning to extraction of tagging rules. A language of functional tagging constraints called JOSKIPI is proposed. An extension to the C4.5 algorithm based on introducing complex JOSKIPI operators into decision trees is presented. Construction of a preliminary hand-written tagging rules for Polish is discussed. Finally, the results of the comparison of different versions of the tagger are given.", "paper_title": "Hand-written and automatically extracted rules for Polish tagger", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500026"}
