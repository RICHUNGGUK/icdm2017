Neglecting the effect of performing a job on its own processing time is mentioned as a deficiency in the literature of industrial scheduling. At first, self-influential factors are defined and then equations are presented to utilize these new factors. GAMS IDE/CPLEX software is used to validate the represented model by solving small to medium-sized sample problems, in which the associate results are compared with a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA). The vitality of considering and modeling the effect of learning and deteriorating made by a job, on its own processing time is tested for several sample problems. Then a significant improvement is observed by comparing the results acquired by neglecting the self-influential factors with the results based on considering them. Finally, the computational results are analyzed and the conclusion is given. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
