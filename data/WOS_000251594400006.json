However, CSFQ can not effectively provide the fairness between TCP connections and UDP connections. Besides, the setting of buffer size strongly affects the efficiency of CSFQ. In this paper, we present a novel CSFQ-based queuing algorithm. Based on the estimated value of fair share, the probability to drop packet is determined to ensure fair share of bandwidth. The simulated experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms CSFQ. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
