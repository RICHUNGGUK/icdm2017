A new phase-screen method is proposed to model radio wave propagation, in the atmospheric turbulence, using the resolved scale refractivity obtained from LES. The proposed method offers the same level of accuracy, as the one already existing in the literature, at much cheaper cost. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
