This paper reviews trends in recent studies on sketching in engineering design and focuses on the encouragement of sketching. The authors present three experimental studies on sketching that look at (1) sketching assignments and their motivation, (2) the impact of a sketching lesson, and (3) the use of Smartpen technology to record sketching; overall these studies address the research question: Can sketching frequency be influenced in engineering education? Influencing sketching frequency is accomplished through motivation, learning, and use of technology for sketching, respectively. Results indicate that these three elements contribute to the encouragement of sketching in engineering design.", "paper_title": "Research on encouraging sketching in engineering design", "paper_id": "WOS:000307946900005"}
