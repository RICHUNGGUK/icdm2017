One of the reasons for this is that requirement analysis is typically overlooked in real projects. In this paper we propose GRAnD, a goal-oriented approach to requirement analysis for data warehouses based on the Tropos methodology. Two different perspectives are integrated for requirement analysis: organizational modeling, centered on stakeholders, and decisional modeling, focused on decision makers. Our approach can be employed within both a demand-driven and a mixed supply/demand-driven design framework. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
