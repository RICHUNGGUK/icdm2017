We have also suggested a binary classification algorithm that utilizes non-trivial characteristics of epidemic dynamics. In this paper we extend our previous work by considering a three-state epidemic model for label propagation. Specifically, we introduce a new, intermediate state that corresponds to \"susceptible\" data instances. The utility of the added state is that it allows to control the rates of epidemic spreading, hence making the algorithm more flexible. We show empirically that this extension improves significantly the performance of the algorithm. In particular, we demonstrate that the new algorithm achieves good classification accuracy even for relatively large overlap across the classes.", "paper_title": "Iterative relational classification through three-state epidemic dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800008"}
