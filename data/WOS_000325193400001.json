It has a signature-based and an incremental structure that allow to apply the F-5 criterion for deletion of unnecessary reductions. In this paper, we present an involutive completion algorithm which outputs a minimal involutive basis. Our completion algorithm has a non-incremental structure and in addition to the involutive form of Buchberger's criteria it applies the F-5 criterion whenever this criterion is applicable in the course of completion to involution. In doing so, we use the G(2)V form of the F-5 criterion developed by Gao, Guan and Volny IV (Gao et al., 2010a). To compare the proposed algorithm, via a set of benchmarks, with the Gerdt-Blinkov involutive algorithm (Gerdt and Blinkov, 1998) (which does not apply the F-5 criterion) we use implementations of both algorithms done on the same platform in maple.
