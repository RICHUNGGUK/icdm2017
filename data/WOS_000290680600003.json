As a consequence, in such settings, sensitivity analyses are often sensible. One such class of analyses assesses the dependence of conclusions on an explicit missing value mechanism. Inevitably, there is an association between such dependence and the actual (but unknown) distribution of the missing data. In a particular parametric framework for dropout in this paper, an approach is presented that reduces (but never removes) the impact of incorrect assumptions on the form of the association. It is shown how these models can be formulated and fitted relatively simply using hierarchical likelihood. These are applied directly to an example involving mastitis in dairy cattle, and an extensive simulation study is described to show the properties of the methods.", "paper_title": "Robust estimation of dropout models using hierarchical likelihood", "paper_id": "WOS:000290680600003"}
