By analysing aesthetic-aware features, the authors' strategy jointly takes attention and geometry composition into account to learn the aesthetic manifestation knowledge of professional photographers. Firstly, aesthetic composition representation exploits the strength of visual saliency to explicitly encode the spatial correlation of the professional photos. Secondly, l2 regularised least square is adopted to constrain the representation coefficients, which provides a fast solution in selecting aesthetic candidates collaboratively. In addition, a novel confidence measure scheme is further designed based on reconstruction errors and the reference photos are updated adaptively according to the composition rules. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the model performs well for the portrait photographing recommendation.", "paper_title": "Strategy for aesthetic photography recommendation via collaborative composition model", "paper_id": "WOS:000361362400009"}
