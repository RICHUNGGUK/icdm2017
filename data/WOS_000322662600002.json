Different from previous works on bilateral teleoperation systems, this paper addresses dual-master trilateral control of a single holonomic-constrained robotic manipulator, where the communication delays are modeled as multiple Markov chains, and the motion/force controls are investigated under consideration of unsymmetric stochastic time-varying delays and system dynamical uncertainties. Using partial feedback linearization, the whole trilateral teleoperation system, which consists of both master and slave manipulator dynamics, is transformed into three subsystems. By integrating Markov jump systems to handle random delays, adaptive fuzzy control strategies are developed for the nonlinear teleoperators with modeling uncertainties and external disturbances by using the approximation property of the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs). It is proven that the trilateral teleoperation system is stochastically stable in mean square under specific linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions, and all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly bounded. The proposed scheme is validated by extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Trilateral Teleoperation of Adaptive Fuzzy Force/Motion Control for Nonlinear Teleoperators With Communication Random Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000322662600002"}
