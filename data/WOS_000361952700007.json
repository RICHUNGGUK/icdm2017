When the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies to be analyzed, the process used to select studies can be arduous. In a previous experiment, we conducted a pilot test to compare the performance and accuracy of PhD students in conducting the selection review activity manually and using Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques. The goal of this paper is to describe a replication study involving PhD and Master students. The replication study uses the same experimental design and materials of the original experiment. This study also aims to investigate whether the researcher's level of experience with conducting SLRs and research in general impacts the outcome of the primary study selection step of the SLR process. The replication results have confirmed the outcomes of the original experiment, i.e., VTM is promising and can improve the performance of the selection review of primary studies. We also observed that both accuracy and performance increase in function of the researcher's experience level in conducting SLRs. The use of VTM can indeed be beneficial during the selection review activity.", "paper_title": "Visual Text Mining: Ensuring the Presence of Relevant Studies in Systematic Literature Reviews", "paper_id": "WOS:000361952700007"}
