The connected components represent equivalent executions. For looped processes, the state space is a torus and the trace space is a disjoint union of trace spaces of deloopings. In the current paper, we develop the index poset for the trace space of the deloopings from the once delooped case. When just one process is looped, the index poset is generated as words in a regular language. We also construct a corresponding automaton.", "paper_title": "Trace spaces of directed tori with rectangular holes", "paper_id": "WOS:000343643500002"}
