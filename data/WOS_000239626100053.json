Based on the characteristics of multi-CPU parallel structure and the parallel property of neural network, the algorithm of Gabor wavelet neural network is proved theoretically. The relevant algorithm structure is designed; the training and recognizing algorithms for image target recognition are given out. Finally, the simulation experiment for 4 types of plane targets indicated that recognition rate reached 98%+, recognizing time was 40ms.", "paper_title": "Research on algorithms of Gabor wavelet neural network based on parallel structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100053"}
