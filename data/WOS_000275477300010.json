Faults are handled by means of specific software units, the \"aspects\", in order to better modularize issues transversal to several components. As a case study, this approach was applied to the design of the fault detection software inside a flexible framework for magnetic measurements, developed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Experimental results of software modularity and performance measurements for comparing aspect- and objectoriented solutions in rotating coils tests on superconducting magnets are reported.
