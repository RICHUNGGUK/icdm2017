Since there is a shortage of DCEA tools, we implemented in an R package 'DCGL' five DCEA methods for identification of differentially coexpressed genes and differentially coexpressed links, including three currently popular methods and two novel algorithms described in a companion paper. DCGL can serve as an easy-to-use tool to facilitate differential coexpression analyses.", "paper_title": "DCGL: an R package for identifying differentially coexpressed genes and links from gene expression microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000282749700026"}
