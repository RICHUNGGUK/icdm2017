By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functional and using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a series of sufficient criteria, which are very easy to verify, are obtained. It is shown that these criteria improve and extend the earlier works. Finally, a population of genetic oscillators based on the Goodwin model is adopted as a numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.
