We propose a goal-oriented approach where the state of the system is assessed using a set of indicators. These indicators are evaluated against thresholds that are used as goals of our system. We propose a self-adaptive context-aware framework, where we learn both the relations existing between the indicators and the effect of the available actions over the indicators state. The system is also able to respond to changes in the environment, keeping these relations updated to the current situation. Results have shown that the proposed methodology is able to create a network of relations between indicators and to propose an effective set of repair actions to contrast suboptimal states of the data center. The proposed framework is an important tool for assisting the system administrator in the management of a data center oriented towards Energy Efficiency (EE), showing him the connections occurring between the sometimes contrasting goals of the system and suggesting the most likely successful repair action(s) to improve the system state, both in terms of EE and QoS.
