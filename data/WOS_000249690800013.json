[ N. Alon, E. Fischer, M. Krivelevich, and M. Szegedy, Combinatorica, 20 ( 2000), pp. 451 - 476] showed that every property that is characterized by a finite collection of forbidden induced subgraphs is epsilon- testable. However, the complexity of the test is double- tower with respect to 1/epsilon, as the only tool known to construct such tests uses a variant of Szemeredi's regularity lemma. Here we show that any property of bipartite graphs that is characterized by a finite collection of forbidden induced subgraphs is epsilon- testable, with a number of queries that is polynomial in 1/ epsilon. Our main tool is a new \" conditional\" version of the regularity lemma for binary matrices, which may be interesting on its own.", "paper_title": "Efficient testing of bipartite graphs for forbidden induced subgraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000249690800013"}
