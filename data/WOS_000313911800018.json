Algorithms for optimal DVFS exist, but optimal DPM and the optimal combination of DVFS and DPM are not yet solved. In this article we use well-established models of DPM and DVFS for frame-based systems. We show that it is not sufficient-as some authors argue-to consider only individual invocations of a task. We define a schedule that also takes interactions between invocations into account and prove-in a theoretical fashion-that this schedule is optimal.", "paper_title": "Optimal DPM and DVFS for Frame-Based Real-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000313911800018"}
