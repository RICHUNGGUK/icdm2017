In this paper, a fast algorithm to enumerate generalized fusenes with given faces is given. The algorithm is fast enough to generate millions of non-isomorphic structures per second and is based on a two-step approach using the canonical construction path method and the homomorphism principle.", "paper_title": "Enumeration of Generalized Fusenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000365373800004"}
