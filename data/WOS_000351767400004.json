A VEO is the knowledge representation of an engineering object that embodies its associated knowledge and experience. A VEO is capable of adding, storing, improving, and sharing knowledge through experience. Moreover, it is demonstrated that VEO is a specialization of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). In this article, it is shown through test models how the concept of VEO can be implemented with the Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) and Decisional DNA (DDNA). The test model confirmed that the concept of VEO is able to capture and reuse the experience of engineering artifacts, which can be beneficial for efficient decision-making in industrial design and manufacturing.", "paper_title": "Virtual Engineering Object (VEO): Toward Experience-Based Design and Manufacturing for Industry 4.0", "paper_id": "WOS:000351767400004"}
