However in many application scenarios, each Web service independently performs a selection, even though achieving the business's goals demands collective, pairwise interactions across the total set of Web services. This study instead considers the Web service selection problem in a choreographed environment, in which each Web service maintains its confidentiality about its collaborators and exchanges only limited amounts of information with its partners. The goal is to maximize the likelihood of completing the entire choreography in a failure-prone environment. Several experiments show that the proposed method performs similarly to a centralized method and better than three distributed Web service selection methods that involve various degrees of information about other services.
