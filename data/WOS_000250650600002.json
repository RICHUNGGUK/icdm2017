In order to understand these factors a single case study of a Jailed Australian EPS was conducted. The findings confirm the influence of EPS adoption factors identified from the literature, which include cooperation with established entities, simplicity, trust, security and mutuality of stakeholder benefits. Furthermore, this study has specifically demonstrated the importance of large partners in the adoption of EPS. These partners are able to provide EPS with access to a large installed base of customers, association with their brand name and marketing resources in order to achieve public awareness. This paper contributes to theory and practice through examining a failed case from the system provider's perspective, which is rare in the study of EPS.", "paper_title": "Exploring the reasons for a failure of electronic payment systems: A case study of an Australian company", "paper_id": "WOS:000250650600002"}
