The model uses the non-hydrostatic pressure and the eddy viscosities from the conventional linear turbulence model are modified to account for the secondary effects generated by strong channel curvature in the natural rivers with meandering open channels. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved on the unstructured grid using the Raviart-Thomas finite element for the horizontal velocity components, and the common PI linear finite element in the vertical direction. To provide the accurate resolution at the bed and the free-surface, the governing equations are solved in the multi-layers system (the vertical plane of the domain is subdivided into fixed thickness layers). The up-to-date k-epsilon turbulence solver is implemented for computing eddy coefficients, the Eulerian-Lagrangian-Galerkin (ELG) temporal scheme is performed for enhancing numerical time integration to guarantee high degree of mass conservation while the CFL restriction is eliminated. The present paper reports on successful validation of the numerical model through available benchmark tests with increasing complexity, using the high quality and high spatial resolution three-dimensional data set collected from experiments.
