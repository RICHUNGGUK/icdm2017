We consider three versions of this problem, preemptive semi-online, non-preemptive on-line and preemptive on-line scheduling. For all these cases we design algorithms with best possible competitive ratios as functions of the machine speeds.", "paper_title": "Optimal on-line algorithms to minimize makespan on two machines with resource augmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254920900001"}
