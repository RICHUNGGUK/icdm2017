Since WLANs are not inherently designed to support high mobility applications, they introduce frequent disruptions in the network services when used in vehicular environments. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether the vehicular traffic patterns affect this undesired disruption in WLAN-based vehicular communication. Stochastic models are first developed to describe connectivity conditions in normal and dense traffic conditions based on experimental data. Hidden Markov model techniques measure the variations in estimated disruption with changing traffic conditions.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Analysis of Variation in Disruption with Changing Traffic Patterns in IEEE 802.11-Based Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339464800019"}
