Moreover, universal stability conditions of the impulsive bioprocess are presented. In order to obtain the universality of the solution, a sigmoid function is introduced for description of the biomass yield changes. Further, the universal mathematical model of the impulsive bioprocess is established, tested and discussed. This work shows among others that the impulsive bioprocess extends functionality of a simple continuous bioprocess providing in an easy way to control biomass concentration. The article also introduces a new objective function and then presents and discusses aspects of the impulsive bioprocess multi-criteria optimization. The analytical results presented in the work are validated by numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Universal modelling and qualitative analysis of an impulsive bioprocess", "paper_id": "WOS:000288411900011"}
