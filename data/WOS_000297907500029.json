The dynamic response of quay wall during earthquake, including soil-sea-structure interaction, is calculated using ADINA finite element program. A typical configuration of caisson-type quay wall is used for analysis and seven real earthquake records along with one harmonic excitation are applied as base acceleration. The results demonstrate that the influence of seawater-structure interaction on the permanent displacement of a caisson-type quay wall, constructed on relatively non-liquefiable site, is not significant.
