Therefore, this paper proposes a new co-word analysis: semantic-based co-word analysis which can integrate experts' knowledge into co-word analysis effectively. The performance of this method has been proved to be very good. It can solve problems on keywords and indexes used in co-word analysis effectively and can improve the veracity of co-word analysis. Using this method, the research filed of \"human intelligence network\" in China has been analyzed. According to the analysis result, we point out that there are four research focuses on it in China now. They are \"methods and theories of human intelligence network\", \"human intelligence network\", \"competitive intelligence system (CIS for short)\", \"the construction and visualization of human intelligence network\". The findings of this study not only advance the state of co-word analysis research but also shed light on future research directions.", "paper_title": "Research on the semantic-based co-word analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000300325800007"}
