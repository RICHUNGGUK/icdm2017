We demonstrate the successful implementation of this multiwavelength PON ( MWPON) architecture with dual feeder fiber using a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier ( RSOA) at each optical network unit ( ONU). The scalability of this MWPON is limited by the power of feeding light, RSOA operating conditions, temperature variations, and Rayleigh backscattering. We report on the possibility of a 16-user network with 20 km of feeder and 2.0 km of distribution fiber. With temperature controlled ONUs, the MWPON may deliver eight distinct wavelengths for upstream access with 10 Gbits/s aggregate capacity.
