Specifically, we consider extensions of Petri nets in which tokens carry pure names dynamically generated with special nu-transitions (nu-PN) and compare their expressiveness with transfer and reset nets with black indistinguishable tokens (Affine Well-Structured Nets), and nets in which tokens carry data taken from a linearly ordered domain (Data nets and CMRS). All these models are well-structured transition systems. In order to compare these models we consider the families of languages they recognize, using coverability as the accepting condition. With this criterion, we prove that nu-PNs are in between AWNs and Data Nets/CMRS, but equivalent to an extension of nu-PN with whole-place operations. These results extend the currently known classification of the expressive power of well-structured transition systems. Finally, we study several problems regarding (coverability) languages of AWN and nu-PN. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
