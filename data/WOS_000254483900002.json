(i) The number of tetrahedra of minimum (non-zero) volume spanned by n points in R-3 is at most 2 /3n(3) - O(n(2)) and there are point sets for which this number is 3/16n(3) - O(n(2)). We also present an O(n) time algorithm for reporting all tetrahedra of minimum non-zero volume, and thereby extend an algorithm of Edelsbrunner, O'Rourke and Seidel. In general, for every k, d is an element of N, 1 <= k <= d, the maximum number of k-dimensional simplices of minimum (non-zero) volume spanned by n points in R-d is Theta(n(k)). (ii) The number of unit volume tetrahedra determined by n points in R-3 is O(n(7/2)), and there are point sets for which this number is Omega(n(3) log log n). (iii) For every d is an element of N, the minimum number of distinct volumes of all full-dimensional simplices determined by n points in R-d, not all on a hyperplane, is Theta(n).", "paper_title": "On the number of tetrahedra with minimum, unit, and distinct volumes in three-space", "paper_id": "WOS:000254483900002"}
