The weighted version of the constraint, AtMostWValue, where each value is associated with a weight or cost, is a useful and natural extension. Both constraints occur in many industrial applications where the number and the cost of some resources have to be minimized. This paper introduces a new filtering algorithm based on a Lagrangian relaxation for both constraints. This contribution is illustrated on problems related to facility location, which is a fundamental class of problems in operations research and management sciences. Preliminary evaluations show that the filtering power of the Lagrangian relaxation can provide significant improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithm for these constraints. We believe it can help to bridge the gap between constraint programming and linear programming approaches for a large class of problems related to facility location.", "paper_title": "New filtering for ATMOSTNVALUE and its weighted variant: A Lagrangian approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000354216900006"}
