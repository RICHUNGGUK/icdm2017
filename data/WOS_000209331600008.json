Reviews of related studies are given, and their generic architectures are designed. The resulting architecture for Pervasive Social Computing is presented. A prototype is developed and examined, in order to investigate the characteristics exhibited by Pervasive Social Computing.", "paper_title": "Pervasive Social Computing: augmenting five facets of human intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000209331600008"}
