Etna volcano, Sicily. The two utilized scenarios assume different thickness of ashfall, over distances comparable with those covered by deposits from realistic eruptions that occurred recently on the volcano. The fall episodes are considered instantaneous or with a duration of 90 days. These models are in agreement with the actual and recent activity of the volcano. The evaluation of vulnerability was performed by a GIS-based method, accordingly with the different themes that constitute the Corine Land Cover inventory of the study area and discovering the potentially damaged elements following the two hypothesized scenarios.", "paper_title": "GIS-based method for the environmental vulnerability assessment to volcanic ashfall at Etna Volcano", "paper_id": "WOS:000266162800003"}
