But the adoption of this kind of systems in Australia is very little and unsuccessful so far. It is observed that the deployment of them always encounters resistance from community care real workers who must use them. One possible cause of this resistance is that the groupware usability is quite dissatisfying, which further causes that the system does not meet user expectations. This research aims to gain a deeper understanding of user perspective and expectation to the interface usability of Community Care Groupware System (CCGS) basing on the specific context of use. A task modeling method is introduced to improve the quality of groupware usability evaluation. A triangulated research methodology comprising unstructured observation, structured and semistructured questionnaire, and unstructured interview, was conducted on 23 community care workers. Five determinants that most influence the interface usability of CCGS from user's perspective, and several relevant suggestions that make a CCGS really usable in everyday use are elicited from data collection and analysis.", "paper_title": "Determinants of groupware usability for community care collaboration", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000045"}
