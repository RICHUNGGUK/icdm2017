We show that this relative Tutte polynomial can be computed in a way similar to the classical spanning tree expansion used by Tune in his original paper on this subject. We then apply the relative Tune polynomial to virtual knot theory. More specifically, we show that the Kauffman bracket polynomial (and hence the Jones polynomial) of a virtual knot can be computed from the relative Tutte polynomial of its face (Tait) graph with some suitable variable substitutions. Our method offers an alternative to the ribbon graph approach, using the face graph obtained from the virtual link diagram directly.", "paper_title": "Relative Tutte Polynomials for Coloured Graphs and Virtual Knot Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000277473600002"}
