Traffic volume increases with network speed and the analysis of large traffic traces is computationally intensive. The paper presents, for the first time ever, a flow extraction software that allows to obtain complex TCP-aware flow records at 4.4 millions of packets per second in a single GPU. Such TCP flow records include number of retransmissions and duplicates per flow, whose calculation is very challenging to obtain at high-speed. Our software significantly increases the processing performance of the recently proposed high-speed sniffers based on commodity hardware and demonstrates the advantages of applying massively parallel processing devices for traffic analysis.", "paper_title": "High-speed TCP flow record extraction using GPUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000361531500010"}
