Frequent itemset mining (FIM) is one of the most fundamental problems in data mining. In this paper, we explore the possibility of designing a differentially private FIM algorithm which can not only achieve high data utility and a high degree of privacy, but also offer high time efficiency. To this end, we propose a differentially private FIM algorithm based on the FP-growth algorithm, which is referred to as PFP-growth. The PFP-growth algorithm consists of a preprocessing phase and a mining phase. In the preprocessing phase, to improve the utility and privacy tradeoff, a novel smart splitting method is proposed to transform the database. For a given database, the preprocessing phase needs to be performed only once. In the mining phase, to offset the information loss caused by transaction splitting, we devise a run-time estimation method to estimate the actual support of itemsets in the original database. In addition, by leveraging the downward closure property, we put forward a dynamic reduction method to dynamically reduce the amount of noise added to guarantee privacy during the mining process. Through formal privacy analysis, we show that our PFP-growth algorithm is epsilon-differentially private. Extensive experiments on real datasets illustrate that our PFP-growth algorithm substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.", "paper_title": "Differentially Private Frequent Itemset Mining via Transaction Splitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000355937800011"}
