Within the scope of the OMRAS2 Music Information Retrieval project, we have made use of and contributed to Semantic Web technologies for purposes ranging from the publication of music recording metadata to the online dissemination of results from audio analysis algorithms. In this paper, we assess the extent to which our tools and frameworks can assist in research and facilitate distributed work among audio and music researchers, and enumerate and motivate further steps to improve collaborative efforts in music informatics using the Semantic Web. To this end, we review some of the tools developed by the OMRAS2 project, examine the extent to which our work reflects the Semantic Web paradigm, and discuss some of the remaining work needed to fulfil the promise of online music informatics research.", "paper_title": "Linked Data and You: Bringing Music Research Software into the Semantic Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000288434100003"}
