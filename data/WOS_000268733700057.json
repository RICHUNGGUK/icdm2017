Large margin classifiers like the support vector machine (SVM) have been reported effective in computer-assisted diagnosis systems for breast cancers. However, since the separating hyperplane determination exclusively relies on support vectors, the SVM is essentially a local classifier and its performance can be further improved. In this work, we introduce a structured SVM model to determine if each mammographic region is normal or cancerous by considering the cluster structures in the training set. The optimization problem in this new model can be solved efficiently by being formulated as one second order cone programming problem. Experimental evaluation is performed on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) dataset. Various types of features, including curvilinear features, texture features, Gabor features, and multi-resolution features, are extracted from the sample images. We then select the salient features using the recursive feature elimination algorithm. The structured SVM achieves better detection performance compared with a well-tested SVM classifier in terms of the area under the ROC curve. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
