We show that a succinct representation of the binary relation permits much better results, while using space within a lower order term of the optimal. We apply our results not only to conjunctive queries on binary relations, but also to queries on semi-structured documents such as XML documents or file-system indexes, using a variant of an adaptive algorithm used to solve conjunctive queries on binary relations.", "paper_title": "Adaptive searching in succinctly encoded binary relations and tree-structured documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000239421700004"}
