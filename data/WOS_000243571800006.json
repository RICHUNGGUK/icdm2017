The nature of this resource is still not fully understood: here we use numerical simulation to investigate how entanglement between register qubits varies as Shor's algorithm is run on a quantum computer. The shifting patterns in the entanglement are found to relate to the choice of basis for the quantum Fourier transform.", "paper_title": "Entanglement and its role in Shor's algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000243571800006"}
