It consists of a KUKA (TM) manipulator mounted on a linear track and synchronised with a rotary table. Prior to any machining, the additional joints require an in situ calibration in an industrial environment. For this purpose, a novel planar calibration method is developed to estimate the external joint configuration parameters by means of a laser displacement sensor and avoiding direct contact with the pattern. Moreover, a redundancy resolution scheme on the joint rate level is integrated within a computer aided manufacturing system for the complete control of the workcell during the path tracking of a milling task. Finally, the whole system is tested in the prototyping of an orographic model.", "paper_title": "Calibration and control of a redundant robotic workcell for milling tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290792500004"}
