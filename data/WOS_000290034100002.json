Extensions of these conditions to the fuzzy domain have been discussed and addressed in recent literature. This work presents a novel approach based on the definition of a fuzzily ordered set with a view to generating the necessary conditions for the Pareto-optimality of candidate solutions in the fuzzy domain. Making use of the conditions generated, one can characterize fuzzy efficient solutions by means of carefully chosen mono-objective problems and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to fuzzy non-dominated solutions. The uncertainties are inserted into the formulation of the studied fuzzy multi-objective optimization problem by means of fuzzy coefficients in the objective function. Some numerical examples are analytically solved to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "The use of possibility theory in the definition of fuzzy Pareto-optimality", "paper_id": "WOS:000290034100002"}
