The adaptive least mean square (LMS) feedforward control with,sliding mode controller is developed. Finite element model of flexible beam is calculated. The developed adaptive control with sliding mode controller design is numerically verified on a flexible beam model, showing that it has better performance and robustness in vibration suppression with respect to the system parameter variations and external disturbance. Simulation verified the desired performance of the proposed designs and proved that the adaptive feedforward sliding mode control is an effective approach to the vibration reduction problems.", "paper_title": "ROBUST ADAPTIVE FEEDFORWARD VIBRATION CONTROL FOR FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500018"}
