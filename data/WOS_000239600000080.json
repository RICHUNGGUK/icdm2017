We have elsewhere proposed CNNs (Cellular Neural Networks) to achieve an accuracy in automated landmarks detection suitable for clinical practice, and have applied the method for 8 landmarks located on the bone profile. This paper proposes and evaluates a CNNs approach augmented by local image dynamic enhancemet for other 3 landmarks that are notoriously difficult to locate; the advantages of this method in the landmark detection problem are pointed out.", "paper_title": "Cellular neural networks and dynamic enhancement for cephalometric landmarks detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000080"}
