Paid clients (colluders) may illegally share copyrighted content files with unpaid clients (pirates). Such online piracy has hindered the use of open P2P networks for commercial content delivery. We propose a proactive content poisoning scheme to stop colluders and pirates from alleged copyright infringements in P2P file sharing. The basic idea is to detect pirates timely with identity-based signatures and time-stamped tokens. The scheme stops collusive piracy without hurting legitimate P2P clients by targeting poisoning on detected violators, exclusively. We developed a new peer authorization protocol (PAP) to distinguish pirates from legitimate clients. Detected pirates will receive poisoned chunks in their repeated attempts. Pirates are thus severely penalized with no chance to download successfully in tolerable time. Based on simulation results, we find 99.9 percent prevention rate in Gnutella, KaZaA, and Freenet. We achieved 8598 percent prevention rate on eMule, eDonkey, Morpheus, etc. The scheme is shown less effective in protecting some poison-resilient networks like BitTorrent and Azureus. Our work opens up the low-cost P2P technology for copyrighted content delivery. The advantage lies mainly in minimum delivery cost, higher content availability, and copyright compliance in exploring P2P network resources.", "paper_title": "Collusive Piracy Prevention in P2P Content Delivery Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266273200009"}
