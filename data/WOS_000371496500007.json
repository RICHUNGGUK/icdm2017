We show that every 4-power-free infinite binary word, other than the Thue-Morse word t and its complement t, has this measure of similarity with t between 1/3 and 2/3, and that this bound is optimal in a strong sense just for the class of overlap-free words. This is a generalization of a classical 1927 result of Kurt Mahler.", "paper_title": "Optimal Bounds for the Similarity Density of the Thue-Morse Word with Overlap-Free and 7/3-Power-Free Infinite Binary Words", "paper_id": "WOS:000371496500007"}
