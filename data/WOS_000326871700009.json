Here, a new three-parameter distribution motivated mainly by lifetime issues is introduced. Some properties of the new distribution including estimation procedures, univariate generalizations and bivariate generalizations are derived. A real data application is described to show its superior performance versus at least that of 15 of the known lifetime models.", "paper_title": "A new lifetime distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000326871700009"}
