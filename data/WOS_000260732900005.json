The code provides exact results for total angular momentum J = 0, and invokes the helicity decoupling (or centrifugal sudden) approximation for J > 0. Our new RWP code has been extensively checked by considering the benchmark H + H2O -> H-2 + OH abstraction reaction.", "paper_title": "Real wavepacket code for ABC plus D -> AB plus CD reactive scattering", "paper_id": "WOS:000260732900005"}
