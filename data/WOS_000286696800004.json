A cost function is considered as the performance index for the system. By Lyapunov stability criterion and the parallel distributed compensation (PDC), some sufficient conditions are derived such that the large-scale fuzzy system is not only asymptotically stable but also cost-guaranteed. Furthermore, the interactive relations among the fuzzy subsystems are employed to relax previous results. The same ideas are also extended to the large-scale fuzzy system with uncertainty. Finally, two examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Guaranteed Cost Control for Large-Scale T-S Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000286696800004"}
