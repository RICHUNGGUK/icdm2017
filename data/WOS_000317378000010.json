Meanwhile, the relations of coupling matrix to stability and synchronization are discussed in detail, and some analysis methods to the synchronization stability of complex networks are also argued. The difficulty arising from the nonsymmetry of the coupling matrix has been overcome in this work. Numerical simulation is also given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
