With the improvement of resolution, the time cost in image and video compression is more and more, which seriously affects the real-time of WMSN. In JPEG system, the core of the system is DCT, but DCT-JPEG is not the best choice. Block-based DCT transform coding has serious blocking artifacts when the image is highly compressed at low bit rates. APBT is used in this paper to solve that problem, but APBT does not have a fast algorithm. In this paper, we analyze the structure in JPEG and propose a parallel framework to speed up the algorithm of JPEG on GPU. And we use all phase biorthogonal transform (APBT) to replace the discrete cosine transform (DCT) for the better performance of reconstructed image. Therefore, parallel APBT-JPEG is proposed to solve the real-time of WMSN and the blocking artifacts in DCT-JPEG in this paper. We use the CUDA toolkit based on GPU which is released by NVIDIA to design the parallel algorithm of APBT-JPEG. Experimental results show that the maximum speedup ratio of parallel algorithm of APBT-JPEG can reach more than 100 times with a very low version GPU, compared with conventional serial APBT-JPEG. And the reconstructed image using the proposed algorithm has better performance than the DCT-JPEG in terms of objective quality and subjective effect. The proposed parallel algorithm based on GPU of APBT also can be used in image compression, video compression, the edge detection and some other fields of image processing.", "paper_title": "APBT-JPEG Image Coding Based on GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000354983500011"}
