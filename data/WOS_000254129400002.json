However, no innovative product can be put on the market without a well-structured and well- organized network of partners. This simple idea deeply influences various aspects of collaborative enterprises. This article studies the close relationship between two parallel design processes: product design and network design. This paradigm called co-design is explained and some basic concepts and exploratory results are defined.", "paper_title": "Innovative product and network of partners co-design: Context, problems, and some exploratory results", "paper_id": "WOS:000254129400002"}
