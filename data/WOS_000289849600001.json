For this, we investigate weighted timed automata and show how we can extend Wilke's relative distance logic with weights taken from an arbitrary semiring. We show that every formula in our logic can effectively be transformed into a weighted timed automaton, and vice versa. The results indicate the robustness of weighted timed automata and may also be used for specification purposes.", "paper_title": "MSO logics for weighted timed automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000289849600001"}
