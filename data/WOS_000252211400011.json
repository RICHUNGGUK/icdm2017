In this paper, a MD method based on fractal image coding (MDFIC) is proposed. In the proposed scheme, after fractal image coding (FIC), MD scalar quantization(MDSQ) and MD lattice vector quantization (MDLVQ) are applied to create two descriptions for some FIC parameters. Meanwhile, a re-match scheme is proposed to create two descriptions for other FIC parameters. Compared with the referenced MDC approaches, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme yields acceptable performance even when only one description is received.", "paper_title": "Multiple description image coding based on fractal", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400011"}
