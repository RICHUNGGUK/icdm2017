There remains scope for faster and more robust estimation techniques. Walsh transforms have traditionally being neglected due to its sensitivity to the input signal's phase. However, the orthogonal nature of its base functions makes it ideal for cast shadow estimation. In this paper it is proven that the Walsh transform can be successfully used for shadow casting, by proposing a new algorithm. Furthermore, experiments were performed to validate the proposed methodology and indicate further applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
