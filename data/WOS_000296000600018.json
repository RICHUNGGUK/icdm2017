To conduct the Integrated Efficiency and Trade-off (JET) analyses using the DEA-IMRP approach, it is important to understand the characteristics of the efficiency frontier and interactive trade-off analysis process. In this paper, the features of the IET analyses are investigated in detail. Graphical and analytical methods and procedures are explored for generating and analysing data envelopes and efficient frontiers for multiple input and multiple output DEA models using the DEA-IMRP approach. This computational investigation generates useful insights into the JET analyses and leads to the definition of new efficiency measures, which are instrumental to help conduct trade-off analysis for setting realistic performance targets. A numerical example is studied to illustrate the findings graphically. A case study for UK retail banks is conducted using the new methods and procedures investigated in this paper.
