Measured properties of the rectangular polypropylene waveguide such as dielectric loss and bending loss are reported. The design and measurements of a 90-GHz injection-locked ASK receiver in 40-nm CMOS are presented. The link is demonstrated with the receiver chip and a plastic waveguide with lengths up to 9 m. The highest achieved bit rate is 9 Gbps for a distance of 60 cm and 2.5 Gbps for a distance of 9 m with a . With a power consumption of 50 mW from a 0.9 V supply, the best FOM is 2.2 pJ/bit/m.", "paper_title": "A 90-GHz receiver in 40-nm CMOS for plastic waveguide links", "paper_id": "WOS:000351741400006"}
