It also provides improved browsing and retrieval facilities to users of video database. This paper presents an effective approach to movie scene extraction based on the analysis of background images. Our approach exploits the fact that shots belonging to one particular scene often have similar backgrounds. Although part of the video frame is covered by foreground objects, the background scene can still be reconstructed by a mosaic technique. The proposed scene extraction algorithm consists of two main components: determination of the shot similarity measure and a shot grouping process. In our approach, several low-level visual features are integrated to compute the similarity measure between two shots. On the other hand, the rules of film-making are used to guide the shot grouping process. Experimental results show that our approach is promising and outperforms some existing techniques.
