Various decision-making approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem. In contemporary supply chain management, the performance of potential suppliers is evaluated against multiple criteria rather than considering a single factor-cost. This article proposes a new weighted nonlinear model to solve the multiple criteria supplier-selection problem. The proposed model not only incorporates multiple criteria for supplier selection but also maintains the effects of weights in the final solution. An illustrative example is presented to compare the proposed model and those in the literature.", "paper_title": "A new nonlinear model for multiple criteria supplier-selection problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000285353500002"}
