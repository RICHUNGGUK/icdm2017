This article gives an overview of the design of this interactive multimedia e-learning system that facilitates the interactive, web-based teaching and learning of industrial engineering via a problem-based learning paradigm. To demonstrate the functionality of the system, one of the case problems that is incorporated in the system-the performance of system analysis of a production operation of a '' virtual company '' is presented. Through this example, the article highlights the characteristics of the system provides and discusses the significance of the features delivered by the IMELS.
