In this paper, we address the problem of program equivalence for this programming framework. For this purpose, we present a structural operational semantics for LCC based on a label transition system and investigate different notions of observational equivalences inspired by the state of art of process algebras. Then, we demonstrate that the asynchronous pi-calculus can be viewed as simple syntactical restrictions of LCC. Finally, we show that LCC observational equivalences can be transposed straightforwardly to classical Concurrent Constraint languages and Constraint Handling Rules, and investigate the resulting equivalences.", "paper_title": "Observational equivalences for linear logic concurrent constraint languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000292701100004"}
