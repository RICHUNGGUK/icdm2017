This paper reviews the literature in order to better understand this phenomenon. As specialists in IS, strategy and organizational studies, we analyze the discourse on OT found in the strategy, organizational theory and IS literature, and identify four structuring themes: organizational inertia, process, agency and performance. We apply the coding derived from these themes to a set of 62 empirical papers and discuss the results. Ten research avenues are then identified to show that IS-enabled OT is still a new frontier for strategic information systems research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
