However, precise timing information is often unavailable in medicine. In previous research this problem has been tackled using Allen's qualitative algebra of time, which, despite successful medical application, does not deal with the associated uncertainty. Objectives: It is investigated whether and how Allen's temporal algebra can be extended to handle uncertainty to better fit available knowledge and data of disease processes. Methods: To bridge the gap between probability theory and qualitative time reasoning, methods from probabilistic logic are explored. The relation between the probabilistic logic representation and dynamic Bayesian networks is analysed. By studying a typical, and clinically relevant problem, the detection of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it is determined whether the developed probabilistic logic of qualitative time is medically useful. Results: The probabilistic logic extension of Allen's temporal algebra, called Qualitative Time CP-logic provides a tool to model disease processes at a natural level of abstraction and is sufficiently powerful to reason with imprecise, uncertain knowledge. The representation of the COPD disease process gives evidence that the framework can be applied functionally to a clinical problem. Conclusion: The combination of qualitative time and probabilistic logic offers a useful framework for modelling knowledge and data to describe disease processes in clinical medicine.
