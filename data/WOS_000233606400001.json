The novel algorithm integrates advantages of the immune evolutionary algorithm and chaos optimization algorithm. Chaos variables are loaded into the variable colony of the immune algorithm in the immune evolutionary algorithm, tiny disturbance is introduced into the memory colony, and the disturbance amplitude is gradually adjusted based on the characteristic of chaos search. The experimental results indicate that the new immune evolutionary algorithm improves the convergence performance and search efficiency of the immune evolutionary algorithm. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
