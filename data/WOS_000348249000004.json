We achieve it by integrating novel QoE-aware video adaptation (QoEVA) and QoE-aware resource allocation (QoERA) schemes. We first study QoEVA of SVC via a subjective video quality assessment database and derive QoE-optimized scalability adaptation tracks. A rate-QoE model is then constructed to approximate the track and is employed to design QoERA. By proving the NP-hardness of the QoERA problem, we propose an adaptive solution where resource block assignment, power allocation and modulation selection are jointly optimized to enhance multiuser QoE. Experimental results show that the proposed QoEVA significantly performs better than the conventional video adaptation schemes and the proposed QoERA achieves much better user experience when compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Our solution can be employed for both pre-coded and live video streaming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
