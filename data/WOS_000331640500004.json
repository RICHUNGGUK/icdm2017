Building upon earlier studies exploiting a Riemannian framework to address these challenges, the present paper proposes a novel metric and an accompanying computational framework for DTI data processing. The proposed approach grounds the signal processing operations in interpolating curves. Well-chosen interpolating curves are shown to provide a computational framework that is at the same time tractable and information relevant for DTI processing. In addition, and in contrast to earlier methods, it provides an interpolation method which preserves anisotropy, a central information carried by diffusion tensor data.", "paper_title": "Anisotropy Preserving DTI Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000331640500004"}
