SPI and continuous quality improvements are associated with better return on investment (ROI) for organizations. The purpose of this empirical research is to study the impact of the CMM on certain critical factors in information systems implementation strategy, software quality and software project performance. Our findings are that CMNI levels do associate with IS implementation strategies and higher CMM levels relate to higher software quality and project performance. We also conclude that information systems (IS) implementation strategies have a significant impact on software quality and project performance. While certain IS implementation strategies - executive commitment and prototyping - have a significant impact on both software quality and project performance, training had a significant effect only on software quality and simplicity has a significant effect only on project performance.
