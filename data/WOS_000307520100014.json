By constructing an augmented system, the MREF achieves the estimation of both states and faults, under existence conditions that are less restrictive than those associated with existing adaptive fault diagnosis observer (AFDO) and sliding mode observer design. Moreover, a detailed discussion on and comparison with the AFDO design are given. Furthermore, by introducing slack variables, improved results on MREF design are obtained such that different Lyapunov functions can be separately designed for multiple constraints. Simulation results are presented to illustrate our contributions.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design of robust estimation filter for a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000307520100014"}
