Images of different resolution, originating from scanner, successively train a neural network, which learns to improve resolution from 25 to 50 pixels-per-inch (ppi), then from 100 to 200 ppi and finally, from 50 to 100 ppi. Thus, the network is provided with consistent knowledge regarding the point spread function (PSF) of the scanner, whilst it gains the generalization ability to reconstruct finer resolution images unfamiliar to it. The novelty of the proposed image-resolution-enhancement technique lies in the successive training of the neural structure with images of increasing resolution. Comparisons with the image scanned at 400 ppi demonstrate the superiority of our method to conventional interpolation techniques.", "paper_title": "Scanned images resolution improvement using neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251098200005"}
