Floor attenuation might not give enough margin discrepancy to classify two neighboring floors, such as windows nearby or ring structure. Fingerprint location using the nearest Euclidean distance to the reference point can be interfered by the neighboring floor. In this paper, a multifloor localization framework with floor identification is proposed. The discriminative floor model is trained to maximize between-class scatter and floor identification is triggered by stair walk and elevator events. In experiments, a real dataset is collected in the building of six floors to evaluate our method. The results show that our method can identify accurate location in multifloor environment.", "paper_title": "Multifloor Wi-Fi Localization System with Floor Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000359211800001"}
