It is originally required to be secure against a conspiring group of malicious signers (type I adversary) and against malicious KGC (type II adversary). In this paper, we define a novel fundamental type of adversary for certificateless aggregate signature schemes, type III adversary, called malicious KGC & Signers Coalition, who can break Zhang-Zhang scheme. We also propose two new certificateless aggregate schemes which are provably secure against all three types of adversary.", "paper_title": "Certificateless Aggregate Signature Schemes with Improved Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100010"}
