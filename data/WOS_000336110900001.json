As the representative state-of-the-art metric access methods (also called metric indexes) that vary in the usage of filtering rules and in structural designs, we could mention the M-tree, the M-Index and the List of Clusters, to name a few. In this paper, we present the concept of cut-regions that could heavily improve the performance of metric indexes that were originally designed to employ simple ball-regions. We show that the shape of cut-regions is far more compact than that of ball-regions, yet preserving simple and concise representation. We present three re-designed metric indexes originating from the above-mentioned ones but utilizing cut-regions instead of ball-regions. We show that cut-regions can be fully utilized in the index structure, positively affecting not only query processing but also the index construction. In the experiments we show that the re-designed metric indexes significantly outperform their original versions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
