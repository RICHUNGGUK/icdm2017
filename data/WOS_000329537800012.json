The algorithm supports parallel computation and has been implemented on a multi-core cluster computer system. We show how to use our approach to calculate two unsolved problems, which arise from computational geometry optimization and electric power engineering, and analyze the time complexity as well as bits complexity.", "paper_title": "Parallel computation of determinants of matrices with multivariate polynomial entries", "paper_id": "WOS:000329537800012"}
