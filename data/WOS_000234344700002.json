The former is constructed based on the locations of data objects: using some distance heuristics on object locations. The latter is built on a precomputed solution space. Thus, NN queries can be reduced to and processed as simple point queries in this solution space. Both approaches exhibit some disadvantages, especially when employed for wireless data broadcast in mobile computing environments. In this paper, we introduce a new index method, called the grid-partition index, to support NN search in both on-demand access and periodic broadcast modes of mobile computing. The grid-partition index is constructed based on the Voronoi diagram, i.e., the solution space of NN queries. However, it has two distinctive characteristics. First, it divides the solution space into grid cells such that a query point can be efficiently mapped into a grid cell around which the nearest object is located. This significantly reduces the search space. Second, the grid-partition index stores the objects that are potential NNs of any query falling within the cell. The storage of objects, instead of the Voronoi cells, makes the grid-partition index a hybrid of the solution-based and object-based approaches. As a result, it achieves a much more compact representation than the pure solution-based approach and avoids backtracked traversals required in the typical object-based approach, thus realizing the advantages of both approaches.", "paper_title": "Grid-partition index: a hybrid method for nearest-neighbor queries in wireless location-based services", "paper_id": "WOS:000234344700002"}
