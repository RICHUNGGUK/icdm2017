A general representation of randomized quantizers that includes the common models in the literature is introduced via appropriate mixtures of joint probability measures on the product of the source and reproduction alphabets. Using this representation and results from optimal transport theory, the existence of an optimal (minimum distortion) randomized quantizer having a given output distribution is shown under various conditions. For sources with densities and the mean square distortion measure, it is shown that this optimum can be attained by randomizing quantizers having convex codecells. For stationary and memoryless source and output distributions, a rate-distortion theorem is proved, providing a single-letter expression for the optimum distortion in the limit of large blocklengths.", "paper_title": "Randomized Quantization and Source Coding With Constrained Output Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000346980400009"}
