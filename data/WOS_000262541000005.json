In this paper, we propose a novel analytical framework to analyze QoS (metrics include make-span, cost, and reliability) of workflow systems based on GWF-net, which extends traditional workflow net by associating tasks with generally distributed firing delay and time-to-failure. The GFW-net model is used to model process structure and task organization of workflows at the process level. In contrast with prevailing QoS models based on Markovian process, we introduce a reduction technique to evaluate QoS of GWF-net process avoiding the state-explosion problem and tedious mathematical derivation of state-transition probabilities. Through a case study, we show that our framework is capable of modeling real-world workflow-based application effectively. Also, experiments and confidence-interval analysis in the case study indicate that the reduction methods are verified by real results. We also compare our approach with related research in the text.
