Understanding how to achieve such collaboration with simpler robots leverages these advances, potentially allowing more robots for a given cost and/or decreasing the cost of deploying a fixed number of robots. This paper is a step toward understanding the algorithmic strengths and weaknesses of robots that are identical mobile finite-state machines (FSMs)-FSMs being the avatars of simple, yet non-trivial, discrete control structures. We study the ability of (teams of) FSMs to identify and search varied-size quadrants of square (i.e. n x n) meshes of tiles-such meshes being the avatars of simple tesselated geographically constrained environments. Each team must be able to accomplish its assigned tasks in arbitrarily large meshes-i.e. for arbitrarily large values of n. Partitions of a mesh into quadrants are specified via pairs of rational numbers <phi,psi >, where 0 < phi,psi < 1, chosen from a fixed, finite repertoire of such pairs. The quadrants specified by a pair <phi,psi > are delimited by a horizontal line and a vertical line that that cross at the anchor mesh-tile v = < left perpendicular phi(n-1)right perpendicular, left perpendicular psi(n-1)right perpendicular >. The following results are established. A single FSM cannot identify anchor tiles in meshes of arbitrary sizes, even for a single pair <phi, psi >-except when the anchor tile resides on an edge of the mesh. A pair of identical FSMs can identify anchor tiles in meshes of arbitrary sizes, for arbitrary fixed finite sets of k pairs {<phi(i), psi(i)>}(i=1)(k). After identifying an anchor tile, the pair can sweep each of the resulting quadrants in turn. Single FSMs can verify-for arbitrary fixed finite sets of pairs and for meshes of arbitrary sizes-that all of the tiles of each quadrant are labeled in a way that is unique to that quadrant. Deploying multiple FSMs for this task achieves linear parallel speedup.", "paper_title": "Region Management by Finite-State Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000329132400004"}
