We prove that the distribution of the length of the standard right factor of a random Lyndon word with length n, divided by n, converges to mu(dx) = 1/2 delta(1)(dx) + 1/2 1([0,1))(x)dx, when n goes to infinity. The convergence of all moments follows. This paper thus completes the results of [2], in which the limit of the first moment is given.", "paper_title": "Limit law of the length of the standard right factor of a Lyndon word", "paper_id": "WOS:000246254600006"}
