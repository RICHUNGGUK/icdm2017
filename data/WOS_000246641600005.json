The proposed method is built on the planar Voronoi diagram to label a ripple search domain. Then, the appropriate codeword can easily be found just by searching the local region instead of global exploration. In order to take a step further and obtain the close result full-search VQ would, we equip the proposed method with a duplication mechanism that helps to bring down the possible quantizing distortion to its lowest level. According to the experimental results, the proposed method is indeed capable of providing better outcome at a faster quantization speed than the existing partial-search methods. Moreover, the proposed method only requires a little extra storage for duplication.", "paper_title": "Fast planar-oriented ripple search algorithm for hyperspace VQ codebook", "paper_id": "WOS:000246641600005"}
