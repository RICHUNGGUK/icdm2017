Online shopping possesses numerous advantages and benefits, such as convenience, lower prices, variety, lack of obligation and discreet purchases. However, selecting from among a huge number of products is a challenge for customers. Customers may spend days or even months viewing relevant products on different web sites, occasionally re-locating previously viewed products for comparison, until a final purchase is made. With the large volume of historically viewed products, it is not an easy job for human users to relocate a previously visited product page using conventional access history lists. Also, the product's ranking may change, making re-finding it difficult or impossible-even using the same keywords in the same online shopping mall. To address this problem, we developed the ShoppingCat system to assist online buyers in re-finding previously viewed product pages via product-related features or previously accessed context features. We evaluated ShoppingCat's performance in a 2-month user study: its prediction precision was over 70.0%, and the recall rate was 84.7% particularly for the search-then-browse pages.", "paper_title": "ShoppingCat: relocating products from the Web in online shopping", "paper_id": "WOS:000324164600009"}
