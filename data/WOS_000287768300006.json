The platforms consist of RFID tag-embedded physical objects and RFID reader boards. A library is built upon the platforms for recognizing data, locations, and movements of the physical game objects. Three kinds of game prototypes are designed and developed for use in young children's edutainment. The user tests prove that a natural type of interactivity can be achieved for digital board games, and it can contribute to establishing paradigms for next-generation edutainment.", "paper_title": "RFID-BASED DIGITAL BOARD GAME PLATFORMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287768300006"}
