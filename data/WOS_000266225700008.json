Gaussian mixture discriminant analysis (MDA) is an effective classification approach for this task, as it is able to model inhomogeneous and scattering class structures. On the basis of a highly diverse dataset comprising 3642 spectra of 29 different strains of bacteria, the utility of MDA for the differentiation of microorganisms by micro-Raman spectroscopy was demonstrated in comparison to various linear and nonlinear classification algorithms. The employed algorithms include partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), k-nearest neighbor classifier (kNN) and support vector machines (SVMs). In a first attempt the best prediction performance was achieved by a SVM model yielding 87.3% of correctly classified spectra outperforming MDA (80.9%) and the other classification methods. The prediction accuracy of MDA can be improved markedly by establishing multiple one-class-versus-one-class models and making predictions by a major vote decision overall pairwise classifications. Using this pairwise approach the performance of MDA increased up to 86.6%, which is statistically equivalent to the performance of a support vector machine. In the case of MDA, the assessment of a posteriori probabilities allows a straightforward novelty detection procedure. Moreover, due to its cluster property, MDA can be employed to visualize the effect of varying cultivation parameters on the group-structure of the investigated dataset. The analysis demonstrates that MDA exhibits useful features for the differentiation of single bacteria by micro-Raman spectroscopy in terms of prediction accuracy, novelty detection, and interpretation of the model.
