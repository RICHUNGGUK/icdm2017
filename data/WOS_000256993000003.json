The methods employs a moving grid technique and a projection scheme based on low-order Crouzeix-Raviart and P-I finite elements. The computational grid is aligned with the fluid interface at each time step to keep the interpolation order optimal. The connectivity of the grid is fixed during the entire time simulation to ensure efficient assembling and parallelization. The method is tested on several examples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
