At fixed confidence level, local random sets are defined whose aggregation admits the calculation of upper probabilities of events. In the multivariate case, a number of ways of combination is highlighted to encompass independence and unknown interaction using random set independence and Frechet bounds. For all cases we derive formulas for the corresponding upper probabilities and elaborate how they relate. An example from structural mechanics is used to exemplify the method.", "paper_title": "MULTIVARIATE MODELS AND VARIABILITY INTERVALS: A LOCAL RANDOM SET APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000295333500004"}
