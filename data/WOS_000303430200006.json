In addition to using the labels of training data themselves, we associate a class label with each cluster center to enforce discriminability in the resulting visual words. Our algorithms encourage data points from the same class to be assigned to the same visual word, and those from different classes to be assigned to different visual words. More specifically, we introduce a class consistency term in the clustering process which penalizes assignment of data points from different classes to the same cluster. The optimization process is efficient and bounded by the complexity of k-means clustering. A very efficient and discriminative tree classifier can be learned for various recognition tasks via the Hierarchical CCKM. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated on two public face datasets and four benchmark action datasets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
