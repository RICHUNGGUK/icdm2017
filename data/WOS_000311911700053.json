Some dynamical properties are investigated and the sufficient conditions for stochastic permanence, extinction and global stability are established. Moreover, the lower-growth rate and the upper-growth rate of the positive solution are studied. In addition, the limit of the average in time of the sample paths of solutions is estimated.
