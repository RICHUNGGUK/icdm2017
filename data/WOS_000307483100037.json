This paper analyzes the performance of the EWMAS chart under drifts in process variation. A fast and accurate algorithm based on the piecewise collocation method is presented for computing both the zero-state and steady-state average run lengths of the EWMAS chart. It is shown that the proposed method can provide accurate approximation results in both zero-state and steady-state cases. Some optimal design tables are also provided to facilitate the design of EWMAS charts in practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
