Simply speaking, every non-full-rank perfect code C is the union of a well-defined family of (mu) over bar -components K((mu) over bar), where (mu) over bar belongs to an \"outer\" perfect code C(star), and these components are at distance three from each other. Components from distinct codes can thus freely be combined to obtain new perfect codes. The Phelps general product construction of perfect binary code from 1984 is generalized to obtain (mu) over bar -components, and new lower bounds on the number of perfect 1-error-correcting q-ary codes are presented.", "paper_title": "ON THE STRUCTURE OF NON-FULL-RANK PERFECT q-ARY CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000293562800002"}
