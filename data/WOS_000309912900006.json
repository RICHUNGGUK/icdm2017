This will lead to more constraints on users' network access and computational capability, (2) Most users only need part of the 3DV data at any given time, while the users' requirements exhibit large diversity, (3) Only a limited number of views are captured and transmitted for 3DV. View rendering is thus necessary to generate virtual views based on the received 3DV data. However, many terminal devices do not have the functionality to generate virtual views. To enable 3DV experience for the majority of users with limited capabilities, adaptive 3DV transmission is necessary to extract/generate the required data content and represent it with supported formats and bitrates for heterogeneous terminal devices. 3DV transcoding is an emerging and effective technique to achieve desired adaptive 3DV transmission. In this article, we propose the first efficient 3DV transcoding scheme that can obtain any desired view, either an encoded one or a virtual one, and compress it with more universal H. 264/AVC. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to appropriately utilize motion information contained in the bitstream to generate candidate motion information. Original information of both the desired view and reference views are used to obtain this candidate information and a proper motion refinement process is carried out for certain blocks. Simulation results show that, compared to the straightforward cascade algorithm, the proposed scheme is able to output compressed bitstream of the required view with significantly reduced complexity while incurring negligible performance loss. Such a 3DV transcoding can be applied to most gateways that usually have constraints on computational complexity and time delay.", "paper_title": "A Novel 3D Video Transcoding Scheme for Adaptive 3D Video Transmission to Heterogeneous Terminals", "paper_id": "WOS:000309912900006"}
