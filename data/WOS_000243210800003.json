This paper is devoted to a novel data clustering approach based on a generalized particle model (GPM). The GPM transforms the data clustering process into a stochastic process over the configuration space on a GPM array. The proposed approach is characterized by the self-organizing clustering and many advantages in terms of the insensitivity to noise, quality robustness to clustered data, suitability for high-dimensional and massive data sets, learning ability, openness and easier hardware implementation with the VLSI systolic technology. The analysis and simulations have shown the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed GPM approach to data clustering.", "paper_title": "Generalized particle model used for data clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000243210800003"}
