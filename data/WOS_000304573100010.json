It describes a color distribution (a set of color pixels) of a color package image as a linear manifold (an affine subspace) in the color space, and recognizes an anonymous package by linear manifold matching. Mainly due to low dimensionality of color spaces, LMCD can provide more compact description and faster computation than description styles based on histogram and dominant-color. This paper also proposes distance-based dissimilarities for linear manifold matching. Specially designed for color distribution matching, the proposed dissimilarities are theoretically appropriate more than J-divergence and canonical angles. Experiments on medicine package recognition validates that LMCD outperforms competitors including MPEG-7 color descriptors in terms of description size, computational cost and recognition rate.", "paper_title": "A Linear Manifold Color Descriptor for Medicine Package Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000304573100010"}
