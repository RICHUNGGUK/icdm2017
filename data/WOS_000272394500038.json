Weng et al. also proposed a C-PRE scheme, and claimed that their scheme is secure against chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA). In this paper, we show that their scheme is not CCA-secure under their defined security model.", "paper_title": "On the Security of a Conditional Proxy Re-Encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394500038"}
