We propose a novel approach for visualizing transactional data using multiple clustering results for knowledge discovery. This scheme necessitates us to relate different clustering results in a comprehensive manner. Thus we have invented a method for attributing colors to clusters of different clustering results based on minimal transversals. The effectiveness of our method VISUMCLUST has been confirmed with experiments using artificial and real-world data sets.", "paper_title": "Visualizing transactional data with multiple clusterings for knowledge discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800007"}
