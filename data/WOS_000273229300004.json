Using this method we construct many self-dual MDS (or near-MDS) codes of lengths up to 16 over various prime fields GF(p), where p = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 53, 61, 73, 89, 97, 101, 109, 113, 137, 149, 157, 173, 181, 193 and 197. In addition, a number of optimal codes are presented for many lengths up to 40 over small prime fields GF(p). Furthermore, our results on the minimum weight of self-dual codes over prime fields give a better bound than the Pless-Pierce bound obtained from a modified Gilbert-Varshamov bound.", "paper_title": "MDS AND NEAR-MDS SELF-DUAL CODES OVER LARGE PRIME FIELDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273229300004"}
