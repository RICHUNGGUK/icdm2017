However, numerous challenges in the simulation of water disinfection processes still remain. This review summarizes past CFD studies of the hydraulic and associated disinfection efficiency of disinfection contactors. Hydraulic efficiency studies based on flow and tracer transport simulation were found to be the most common and successful. Challenges existing in flow and disinfection simulation are identified and discussed. These challenges can be overcome via advanced turbulent simulation approaches, such as Large Eddy Simulation and multi-phase resolving simulations. Although turbulence-chemistry interaction is found to be the most challenging problem for proper representation of the reaction system and inactivation kinetics, solutions to this challenge can be overshadowed unless errors induced by unresolved unsteady flow and multi-phase flow are reduced sufficiently.
