In this paper, we propose a Ring Based Routing (RBR) scheme to address the issue of sink-location privacy in WSNs. The RBR scheme is composed of multiple routing rings and routing lines where the nodal data is not directly sent to the sink but to the nearest routing ring. In our scheme, data is routed through each node in the ring and then sent to other routing rings via routing lines, where the number of anonymity sink nodes is equal to the total number of nodes in the network. More specifically, under the RBR scheme the routing rings move in irregular patterns which can confuse adversaries even if the sink location is static and this greatly improves the sink-location privacy. In addition, the routing rings are constructed according to comprehensive analysis of network energy, which can fully use the remaining energy and improve energy efficiency and network lifetime. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our scheme can protect location privacy of sinks effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
