The mean and entropy in the transform domain are used to form a feature vector. The proposed method can achieve a high texture classification rate even for small number of samples used in training stage. This makes it suitable for applications where the number of texture samples used in training is very limited. The superior performance and robustness of the proposed classifier is shown for classifying and retrieving texture images from image databases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
