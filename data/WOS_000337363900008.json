With the super-vector formulation of iterative learning control (ILC), such a system can be formulated as a linear discrete-time stochastic system in the iteration domain, and then a sufficient condition guaranteeing both stability of the ILC process and the desired H-infinity performance in the iteration domain is presented. The condition can be derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities that can be solved by using existing numerical techniques. A numerical simulation example is also included to validate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "H-infinity iterative learning controller design for a class of discrete-time systems with data dropouts", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363900008"}
