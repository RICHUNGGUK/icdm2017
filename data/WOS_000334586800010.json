Different equivalent forms of the RSM-RANS system are discussed and classification of the complex terms introduced by advanced turbulence closures is attempted. Computational examples are presented, which indicate that the use of contact-discontinuity-resolving convective numerical fluxes, along with a passive-scalar approach for the Reynolds-stresses, may lead to unphysical oscillations of the solution. To determine the source of these instabilities, theoretical analysis of the Riemann problem for a simplified Reynolds-stress transport model-system, which incorporates the divergence of the Reynolds-stress tensor in the convective part of the mean-flow equations, and includes only those nonconservative products which are computable (do not require modelling), was undertaken, highlighting the differences in wave-structure compared to the passive-scalar case. A hybrid solution, allowing the combination of any low-diffusion approximate Riemann solver with the complex tensorial representations used in advanced models, is proposed, combining low-diffusion fluxes for the mean-flow equations with a more dissipative massflux for Reynolds-stress-transport. Several computational examples are presented to assess the performance of this approach, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and satisfactory convergence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
