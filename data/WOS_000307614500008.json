It is composed of two membranes of NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) in a martensitic state at room temperature. They have an initial flat shape and are bonded together with an intermediate spacer. The thermal loading allows the actuator to move up and down in the membrane normal direction. A detailed analysis of sensibility to material and geometric parameters of the SMA actuator is undertaken by FE method. The actuation capability and reliability are studied in order to lead to optimal parameters set providing a higher stroke (deflection) with a low heating temperature. The shape memory effect exhibited by these membranes is simulated by means of the phenomenological constitutive law based on Chemisky-Duval model [1,2], and implemented in the Abaqus (R) FE code. The obtained numerical results were detailed proving the ability of the proposed modeling to reproduce the actuator behavior under thermal loading. This analysis showed that it is possible to provide a large stroke for a minimal geometry of the actuator. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
