It is built with multiple Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). PLC is a special form of microprocessor-based controller with proprietary operating system. Due to the unique architecture of PLC, traditional digital forensic tools are difficult to be applied. In this paper, we propose a program called Control Program Logic Change Detector (CPLCD), which works with a set of Detection Rules (DRs) to detect and record undesired incidents on interfering normal operations of PLC. In order to prove the feasibility of our solution, we set up two experiments for detecting two common PLC attacks. Moreover, we illustrate how CPLCD and network analyzer Wireshark could work together for performing digital forensic investigation on PLC.", "paper_title": "PLC FORENSICS BASED ON CONTROL PROGRAM LOGIC CHANGE DETECTION WORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000369706800006"}
