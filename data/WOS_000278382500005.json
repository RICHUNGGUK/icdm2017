To attain high write performance, recent SSDs use an internal SDRAM write buffer and parallel architecture that uses interleaving techniques. In such architecture, coarse-grained address mapping called superblock mapping is inevitably used to exploit the parallel architecture. However, superblock mapping shows poor performance for random write requests. In this paper, we propose a novel victim block selection policy for the write buffer considering the parallel architecture of SSD. We also propose a multi-level address mapping scheme that supports small-sized write requests while utilizing the parallel architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves the I/O performance of SSD by up to 64% compared to the existing technique. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
