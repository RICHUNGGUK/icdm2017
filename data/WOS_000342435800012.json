The algorithm is based on the CONDENSATION algorithm, but it avoids expensive operations that are costly in real-time embedded systems. It also includes a method that reduces the number of particles during execution and a new resampling scheme. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is as accurate as the CONDENSATION algorithm. Depending on the processed sequence, the acceleration with respect to CONDENSATION can reach 7 for 50 particles, 12 for 100 particles and 58 for 200 particles.", "paper_title": "A computationally efficient importance sampling tracking algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435800012"}
