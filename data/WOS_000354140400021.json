The refinements in the present work include the influence of embedment, soil self-weight and anisotropy which were not considered previously. The study focuses on a grey-blue clay from Taranto in Italy, for which stochastic strength parameters were well documented. Results show that the influences of embedment, self-weight and anisotropy can be significant and lead to more realistic estimates of bearing capacity reliability. Finally a probability distribution of the bearing capacity was estimated and used to calibrate safety factors for reliability purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
