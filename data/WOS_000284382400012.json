All past protocols for asynchronous Byzantine agreement had been exponential, and no protocol for asynchronous leader election had been known. Our protocols tolerate up to (1/3 - epsilon) . n faulty processors, for any positive constant E. They are Monte Carlo, succeeding with probability 1 - o(1) for Byzantine agreement, and constant probability for leader election. A key technical contribution of our article is a new approach for emulating Feige's lightest bin protocol, even with adversarial message scheduling.", "paper_title": "Fast Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement and Leader Election with Full Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000284382400012"}
