The display resolution visibility (DRV) factor is introduced here as the measurement of the system's adaptability. Both the 3D virtual human model and sign animation scripts are simplified according to the DRV Factor of the ubiquitous device. Consequently, a real-time transmission scheme is proposed for sign language animation over a heterogeneous network. Simulations results show that these innovations significantly reduce the transmission bandwidth and work very well on the ubiquitous devices.
