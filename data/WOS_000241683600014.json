We report the experimental evaluation of a large set of patterns using an ontology enrichment tool: CAMELEON. Results underline the strong corpus influence on the patterns efficiency and on their meaning. This influence confirms two of the hypotheses that motivated to define CAMELEON as a support used in a supervised process: (1) patterns and relations must be adapted to each project; (2) human interpretation is required to decide how to report in the ontology the pieces of knowledge identified with patterns.", "paper_title": "Designing and evaluating patterns for ontology enrichment from texts", "paper_id": "WOS:000241683600014"}
