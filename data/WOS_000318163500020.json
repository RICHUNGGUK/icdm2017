First, it is shown that any sum-rate maximizing selective decentralized feedback policy must be a threshold feedback policy. This result holds for all fading channel models with continuous distribution functions. Second, the resulting optimum threshold selection problem is analyzed in detail. This is a nonconvex optimization problem over finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. By utilizing the theory of majorization, an underlying Schur-concave structure in the sum-rate function is identified, and the sufficient conditions for the optimality of homogenous threshold feedback policies are obtained. Applications of these results are illustrated for well-known fading channel models such as Rayleigh, Nakagami, and Rician fading channels. Rather surprisingly, it is shown that using the same threshold value at all mobile users is not always a rate-wise optimal feedback strategy, even for a network in which mobile users experience statistically the same channel conditions. For the Rayleigh fading channel model, on the other hand, homogenous threshold feedback policies are proven to be rate-wise optimal if multiple orthonormal data carrying beams are used to communicate with multiple mobile users simultaneously.", "paper_title": "Optimal Selective Feedback Policies for Opportunistic Beamforming", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163500020"}
