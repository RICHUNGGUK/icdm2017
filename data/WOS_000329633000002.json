DTSA treats a gray facial image as a second order tensor and adopts two-sided transformations to reduce dimensionality. One of the many advantages of DTSA is its ability to preserve the spatial structure information of the images. In order to deal with micro-expression video clips, we extend DTSA to a high-order tensor. Discriminative features are generated using DTSA to further enhance the classification performance of ELM classifier. Another notable contribution of the proposed method includes significant improvements in face and micro-expression recognition accuracy. The experimental results on the ORL, Yale, YaleB facial databases and CASME micro-expression database show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Face Recognition and Micro-expression Recognition Based on Discriminant Tensor Subspace Analysis Plus Extreme Learning Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000329633000002"}
