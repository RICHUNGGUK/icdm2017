These include data for a variety of facilities, manufacturing processes, and the input and output of each process (input material, by-products, and intermediate and final products). Effective operation and maintenance of manufacturing facilities and eco-friendly products are gradually becoming important issues due to increased environmental regulations and changes in the enterprise business model. For this reason, increased efficiency in data management is necessary in the manufacturing industry. In this paper, existing data models for the integration of lifecycle data are analyzed according to their application domains. After the analysis, information requirements for the integrated management of facility, process, and output data are developed. According to these requirements, a data model appropriate for this integration is proposed. As an application case study, the use of the proposed data model for the effective operation and maintenance of manufacturing facilities is presented. Finally, benefit, limitation, and improvement of the proposed data model are discussed.", "paper_title": "Integrated management of facility, process, and output: data model perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000303426100002"}
