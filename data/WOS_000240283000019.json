Social networks exhibit swarming, transitory, and informal qualities. Further, in social networks based on geographic proximity, online interaction takes place in a shared locale where users can see and meet each other in real life if they wish. Commercially successful systems designed to facilitate and support social networking in inner-city neighborhoods represent an opportunity to bridge a gap in the market. For example, with a new kind of cross-platform instant-messenger tool, users can easily maintain social ties with their local friends and peers-anywhere, anytime.", "paper_title": "Facilitating social networking in inner-city neighborhoods", "paper_id": "WOS:000240283000019"}
