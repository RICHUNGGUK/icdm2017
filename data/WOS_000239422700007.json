This has the major advantage that calculations with quantified expressions become more straightforward because the calculational rules need be given just once for a great variety of different quantifiers. We demonstrate the ease of calculation with finite quantifications by considering a number of examples. Two are simple warm-up exercises, using boolean equality as the quantifier. Three are taken from books of challenging mathematical problems, and one is a problem concocted by the authors to demonstrate the techniques.", "paper_title": "Exercises in quantifier manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239422700007"}
