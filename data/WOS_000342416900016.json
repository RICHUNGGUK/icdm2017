Some of our bounds are given in terms of the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the source sequence or the reproduction sequence. We also demonstrate how some analogous results can be obtained for classes of linear encoders and linear decoders in the continuous alphabet case.", "paper_title": "On the Data Processing Theorem in the Semi-deterministic Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900016"}
