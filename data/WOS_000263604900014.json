Target application of the design is 3-D power delivery for future microprocessors, in which the PoL converter will be vertically integrated with the processor using wafer-level 3-D interconnect technologies. Advantages of 3-D power delivery over conventional discrete voltage regulator modules (VRMs) are discussed. The prototype design, using two interleaved buck converter cells each operating at 200 MHz switching frequency and delivering 500 mA output current, is discussed with a focus on the converter power stage and control loop to highlight the tradeoffs unique to such high-frequency, monolithic designs. Measured steady-state and dynamic responses of the fabricated prototype are presented to demonstrate the ability of such monolithic converters to meet the power delivery requirements of future processors.", "paper_title": "Fully Monolithic Cellular Buck Converter Design for 3-D Power Delivery", "paper_id": "WOS:000263604900014"}
