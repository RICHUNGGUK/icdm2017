Application of fuzzy logic to unsupervised classification or clustering methods has resulted in many wildly used techniques such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) method. However, when the observations are too noisy, the performance of such methods might be reduced. Thus, in this paper, a new fuzzy clustering method based on FCM is presented and the relative entropy is added to its objective function as a regularization function to maximize the dissimilarity between clusters. Several examples are provided to examine the performance of the proposed clustering method. The obtained results show that the proposed method has a very good ability in detecting noises and assignment of suitable membership degrees to the observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
