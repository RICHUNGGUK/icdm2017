The mode group diversity multiplexing (MGDM) technique in graded-index multimode fiber (GI-MMF) has been shown to be less expensive with simpler transmitters and receivers, keeping the same information capacity. However, the classic transmission in MGDM complicates the integration of radio-over-fiber (RoF) services. In this paper, we propose a wired and a RoF model dedicated to broadband indoor applications. This model is based on a modified MGDM where we employ a variation of the transmission power technique and a selection algorithm for the optimal transmitter. To evaluate our system, the bit error rate and symbol error rate have been computed.", "paper_title": "Adaptation of the Mode Group Diversity Multiplexing Technique for Radio Signal Transmission Over Multimode Fiber", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459300001"}
