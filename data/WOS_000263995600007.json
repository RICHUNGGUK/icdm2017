In this paper, an approach is developed for fault detection based on a distributed system. Firstly, identifying of sensor instrumentation system is responsible for the signal processing and the system fault information. Secondly, the sensor wireless networks are used to transmit the data (lower layer) to or receive the commands from the computer center (top layer). Thirdly. the computer center at the top layer will monitor the overall system and generate the alarm signals or the commands when the faults occur. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
