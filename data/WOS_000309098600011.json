In so doing we establish a link with syntactic semigroups of languages that are themselves cyclic semigroups. We apply the extended transform with a view to generating de Bruijn words through inverting the transform. We also make use of de Bruijn words to facilitate a proof that the maximum number of distinct factors of a word of length n has the form 1/2n(2) - O(n log n). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
