The system is based on a hierarchical network of integrate-and-fire spiking neurons with random synaptic connections and a novel organization process. The network generates integrated output sequences that are used for image classification. The proposed network is shown to provide satisfactory predictive performance given that the number of the recognition neurons and synaptic connections are adjusted to the size of the input image. Comparison of synaptic plasticity activity rule (SAPR) and spike timing dependant plasticity rules, which are used to learn connections between the spiking neurons, indicates that the former gives better results and thus the SAPR rule is used. Test results show that the proposed network performs better than a recognition system based on support vector machines.", "paper_title": "Recognition of Partially Occluded and Rotated Images With a Network of Spiking Neurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000283944100001"}
