Our method focuses on not only keeping important regions unchanged but also keeping the aspect ratio of the main object in an image unchanged. The dual conditions can avoid distortion which often occurs when only using the former condition. Our method first calculates image importance. Next, we extract the main objects on an image by using image importance. Finally, we calculate the optimal grid transformation which suppresses changes in size of important regions and in the aspect ratios of the main objects. Our method uses lower and upper thresholds for transformation to suppress distortion due to extreme shrinking and enlargement. To achieve better resizing results, we introduce a boundary discarding process. This process can assign wider regions to important regions, reducing distortions on important regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method resizes images with less distortion than other resizing methods.", "paper_title": "Content Aware Image Resizing with Constraint of Object Aspect Ratio Preservation", "paper_id": "WOS:000327168600013"}
