We focus on the double-directional channel response of each frequency band and the degree of similarity between them. In general, when a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) system is employed, as for example in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), it is of vital importance to study whether the measurement results from the uplink could be directly extrapolated to the downlink direction, and vice versa. By applying two conventional beamforming techniques and the well known MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, the angular domain performance of both bands was assessed. The initial results presented herein are promising enough as the joint spectra seem to be remarkably similar implying that the underlying propagation mechanisms at both bands are also similar.
