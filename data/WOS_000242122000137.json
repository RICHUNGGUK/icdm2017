Wireless data broadcast is suitable for meeting requests from lots of users owing to its scalability. Air indexing techniques have been developed for energy efficient query processing of mobile clients in the wireless data broadcast. Especially for spatial queries related to the user's location, the index based on Hilbert Curve is proposed. However, the index makes clients listen to a lot of data objects in order to process range queries. In this paper, we describe indexing technique for spatial range queries. And we propose the distributed air index based on space partition. For the performance evaluation, it is implemented using a discrete event-driven simulation package, SimJava. A Simulation is conducted with the real dataset that contains 5922 cities of Greece. The results show that the proposed index outperforms the index based on the Hilbert Curve in the energy efficiency and query processing time significantly.", "paper_title": "Cell-based distributed index for range query processing in wireless data broadcast systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000137"}
