This method is a novel robust multiobjective approach for structural sizing of composite stiffened panels at different design stages. The approach is integrated at two design stages labelled as preliminary design and detailed design. The robust multilevel design methodology integrates the structural sizing to minimize the variance of the structural response. This method improves the product quality by minimizing variability of the output performance function. This innovative approach simulates the sequence of actions taken during design and structural sizing in industry where the manufacture of the final product uses an industrial organization that goes from the material characterization up to trade constraints, through preliminary analysis and detailed design. The developed methodology is validated with an example in which the initial architecture is conceived at the preliminary design stage by generating a Pareto front for competing objectives that is used to choose a design with a required weight. Then a robust solution is sought in the neighbourhood of this solution to finally find the layup for the panel capable of bearing the highest load for the given geometry and boundary conditions.", "paper_title": "Robust design and optimization of composite stiffened panels in post-buckling", "paper_id": "WOS:000350897000010"}
