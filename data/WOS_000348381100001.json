First, we recall the too-little-known fact that these coefficients f(n) always admit a closed form. Then we study their asymptotics, known to be of the type f(n) similar to CA(n)n(alpha). When the function is a power series associated to a context-free grammar, we solve a folklore conjecture: the critical exponents a cannot be 1/3 or -5/2; they in fact belong to a proper subset of the dyadic numbers. We initiate the study of the set of possible values for A. We extend what Philippe Flajolet called the Drmota-Lalley-Woods theorem (which states that alpha = -3/2 when the dependency graph associated to the algebraic system defining the function is strongly connected). We fully characterize the possible singular behaviours in the non-strongly connected case. As a corollary, the generating functions of certain lattice paths and planar maps are not determined by a context-free grammar (i.e., their generating functions are not N-algebraic). We give examples of Gaussian limit laws (beyond the case of the Drmota-Lalley-Woods theorem), and examples of non-Gaussian limit laws. We then extend our work to systems involving non-polynomial entire functions (non-strongly connected systems, fixed points of entire functions with positive coefficients). We give several closure properties for N-algebraic functions. We end by discussing a few extensions of our results (infinite systems of equations, algorithmic aspects).", "paper_title": "Formulae and Asymptotics for Coefficients of Algebraic Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000348381100001"}
