These schemes are applicable to the full-tensor pressure equation with generally discontinuous coefficients and remove the O(1) errors introduced by standard reservoir simulation schemes when applied to full-tensor flow approximation. The family of flux-continuous schemes is characterized by a quadrature parameterization. Improved numerical convergence for the family of CVD-MPFA schemes using the quadrature parameterization has been observed for structured and unstructured grids in two dimensions. The CVD-MPFA family cell-vertex formulation is extended to classical general element types in 3-D including prisms, pyramids, hexahedra and tetrahedra. A numerical convergence study of the CVD-MPFA schemes on general unstructured grids comprising of triangular elements in 2-D and prismatic, pyramidal, hexahedral and tetrahedral shape elements in 3-D is presented.
