Classification functions for the objective functions and their properties are studied. Fuzzy c-means algorithms using kernel functions is also discussed with kernelized cluster validity measures and numerical experiments. New kernel functions derived from the classification functions are moreover studied.", "paper_title": "Different Objective Functions in Fuzzy c-Means Algorithms and Kernel-Based Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000293369800004"}
