Here, CO chemisorption onto the Au-5(-) cluster is investigated using the density functional calculations. It is found that chemisorption of CO molecules can induce previously unreported two- to three-dimensions (3D) structural changes. Even a single CO chemisorption induces a major structural change to explain the huge blue-shift in photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The apex site in the parent Au-5(-) cluster is not always the most preferred site for the chemisorption, and two bridged adsorption CO molecules are observed in the lowest-energy (CO)(3)Au-5(-) cluster. A clear splitting is observed in the first PES of (CO)(4)Au-5(-), and calculated planar and 3D geometries are likely coexisting in the cluster beam. The fifth CO adsorption leads to the structural transformation of Au-5 skeleton to create more apex sites to accommodate five CO molecules. The structural properties, together with the vertical electron detachment energy (VDE) and binding energies calculations indicate that the chemisorption-saturated number is 5.", "paper_title": "Chemisorption-induced two- to three-dimensions structural transformations in gold pentamer (CO)(n)Au-5(-) (n=0-5)", "paper_id": "WOS:000343888400014"}
