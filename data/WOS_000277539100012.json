Design/methodology/approach - Empirical laws and well-known laboratory experiments of physics are revisited in light of the spinning yoyo method and thinking logic. When appropriate, relevant quantitative methods are established. Findings - By generalizing the concept of electromotive force, the paper introduces that of meridian motive forces (MMF). By considering two possible cases when electric yoyo flows can be induced within a return circuit, the paper uses specific examples to compute yoyo potential differences, the forces needed to pull a conductive wire in a magnetic yoyo field, and the total flux of magnetic yoyo field passing through a return circuit. When the paper tries to address the questions of how an electric yoyo current in a circuit is produced and what force could get around the resistance of metals to make electric yoyo charges move around inside return circuits, the paper successfully establishes a theoretical explanation for why Lenz's law about the direction of induced electric currents holds true. At the end, the paper develops a quantitative formula for practically calculating desired MMF. Originality/value - This paper provides the first ever theoretical explanation for why Lenz's law could be true. It is expected that this explanation would be equally applicable in the study of social systems.", "paper_title": "Motional meridian motive forces", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100012"}
