This method was developed in a way that on the boundaries both the governing equation and boundary condition are satisfied, so it is more robust and accurate than conventional collocation methods. Though the method used to solve the coordinate transforming equations is meshless, it does not deteriorate the value of present work, because most numerical models in modern use are grid-dependent, and grid generation of service to these models is still strongly desired, particularly for finite difference models in irregular domains. Before applying to grid generation problems, the performance of present method is tested by a bench mark potential flow problem. Additional to two basic grid generation problems, a bottleneck problem of previous works, which contains zero-degree corners in the domain, is carried out. Finally, the model is applied to the orthogonal grid generation in a multi-connected domain. The correctness is testified by checking the orthogonality of the generated results.
