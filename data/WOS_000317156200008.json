In order to overcome these two demerits, this paper proposes a robust framework of LBP, named Completed Robust Local Binary Pattern (CRLBP), in which the value of each center pixel in a 3 x 3 local area is replaced by its average local gray level. Compared to the center gray value, average local gray level is more robust to noise and illumination variants. To make CRLBP more robust and stable, Weighted Local Gray Level (WLG) is introduced to take place of the traditional gray value of the center pixel. The experimental results obtained from four representative texture databases show that the proposed method is robust to noise and can achieve impressive classification accuracy.
