This paper introduces a novel framework for automated adjustment of region-based AC regularization and data fidelity parameters. Motivated by an isomorphism between the weighting factors of AC energy terms and the eigenvalues of structure tensors, we encode local geometry information by mining the orientation coherence in edge regions. In this light, the AC is repelled from regions of randomly oriented edges and guided toward structured edge regions. Experiments are performed on four state-of-the-art AC models, which are automatically adjusted and applied on benchmark datasets of natural, textured and biomedical images and two image restoration models. The experimental results demonstrate that the obtained segmentation quality is comparable to the one obtained by empirical parameter adjustment, without the cumbersome and time-consuming process of trial and error.", "paper_title": "Automated Adjustment of Region-Based Active Contour Parameters Using Local Image Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000345629000042"}
