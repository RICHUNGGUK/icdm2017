The main concept of CCN is to smoothly distribute digital contents between the content provider and consumer. In these types of networks, contents are identified by unique names, however, naming those contents is still a challenging task. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical and hash based naming with efficient Compact Trie (CT) management scheme for Vehicular Content-Centric Network (VCCN). The proposed naming scheme makes the best use of the features offered by hierarchical as well as hash-based or flat naming schemes. The hierarchical part of the digital content name contains information about the content provider, type, its sub-types and attributes of the content itself that is shared between vehicles. The hash part uniquely identifies the digital content required for VCCN applications. The proposed naming scheme satisfies two main purposes: first, it helps in minimizing the routing table by aggregating the name prefixes and simplifying the routing decisions. Second, it contains attributes, spatial, temporal and their range information to easily find and resolve the content. The proposed scheme manages prefixes (e.g. Add, Search and Delete) in the tables e.g. Forwarding Information Base (FIB), Pending Interest Table (PIT), etc. The CT is relatively faster and space-efficient than Simple Trie and has better performance compared to the existing solutions of naming the required content(s). The evaluation results show that the proposed CT based prefix management scheme performs 45.5% and 23.3% faster prefix search and 55% and 34% faster prefix delete operation compared to Simple Trie and Bloom-Filter based name management schemes, respectively. The memory profile results show that average memory consumption of the proposed CT implementation is 24 and 186 times smaller than the Simple Trie and the NLAPB, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
