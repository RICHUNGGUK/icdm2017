In this paper, we analyze, using numerical simulation, the feasibility of the distribution of impulse-radio UWB signals with pulse amplitude modulation in long-reach FTTH networks. The simulation results show a severe performance degradation of the transmitted signals in FTTH networks, both in terms of the channel error probability and in terms of the temporal and spectral distortion factors. This degradation is mainly due to the effect of the fiber group velocity dispersion.", "paper_title": "Distribution of IR-UWB Signals With PAM Modulation in Long-Reach FTTH Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285516500001"}
