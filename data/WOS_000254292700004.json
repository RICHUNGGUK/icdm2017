Data security in such a framework is an important problem and crucial for many Web applications. In this paper, we propose an approach that addresses data integrity and confidentiality in content adaptation and caching by intermediaries. Our approach permits multiple intermediaries to simultaneously perform content services on different portions of the data. Our protocol supports decentralized proxy and key management and flexible delegation of services. Our experimental results show that our approach is efficient and minimizes the amount of data transmitted across the network.", "paper_title": "Efficient and secure content processing and distribution by cooperative intermediaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000254292700004"}
