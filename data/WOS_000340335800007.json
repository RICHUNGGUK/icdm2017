The method separates and optimally minimizes the finite-timestep and finite-sampling errors inherent in the Langevin representation of the Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. It does so by combining multiple solutions to the underlying equations with varying numbers of timesteps. For a desired level of accuracy epsilon, the computational cost of the method is O(epsilon(-2)) or O(epsilon(-2)(ln epsilon)(2)), depending on the underlying discretization, Milstein or Euler-Maruyama respectively. This is to be contrasted with a cost of O(epsilon(-3)) for direct simulation Monte Carlo or binary collision methods. We successfully demonstrate the method with a classic beam diffusion test case in 2D, making use of the Levy area approximation for the correlated Milstein cross terms, and generating a computational saving of a factor of 100 for epsilon = 10(-5). We discuss the importance of the method for problems in which collisions constitute the computational rate limiting step, and its limitations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
