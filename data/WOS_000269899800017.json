The ground moving targets, such as humans, cars and tanks, have only comparable size with the transmitted signal wavelength; the point target model and the linear change of observation angle are not applicable. In this paper, the signal model of ground moving target is developed based on the case of forward scattering micro radar, considering the two-ray propagation model and area target model, and nonlinear change of observation angle as well as high order phase error. Furthermore, the analytical form of the received power from moving target has been obtained. Using the simulated forward scattering radar cross section, the received power of theoretical calculation is near to that of measured data. In addition, the simulated signal model of ground moving target is perfectly matched with the experimented data. All these results show the correctness of analytical calculation completely.", "paper_title": "Ground moving target signal model and power calculation in forward scattering micro radar", "paper_id": "WOS:000269899800017"}
