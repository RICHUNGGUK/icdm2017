We use a classification scheme based on dissimilarity representation, which has been successfully applied to verification problems. Besides assessing two texture descriptors (local binary patterns and local phase quantization), we also address important issues related to the dissimilarity representation, such as the impact of the number of references used for verification and identification, how the framework performs on the problem of writer identification, and how the dissimilarity-based approach compares to other feature-based strategies. In order to meet these objectives, we carry out experiments on two different datasets, the Brazilian forensic letters database and the IAM database. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we show that both LBP- and LPQ-based classifiers are able to surpass previous results reported in the literature for the verification problem by about 5 percentage points. For the identification problem, the proposed approach using LPQ features is able to achieve accuracies of 96.7% and 99.2% on the BFL and IAM and databases respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
