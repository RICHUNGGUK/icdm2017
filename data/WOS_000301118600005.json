The importance of domain modeling in virtual engineering deals directly with the potential benefits that the semantic technologies may bring, allowing to discover implicit knowledge that can be beneficial for engineers. This work presents a state-of-the-art review of the technologies used in our approach, a successful case study where our methodology was applied, and the description and results of an experiment designed to provide a quantitative validation of our methodology.", "paper_title": "Building Domain Ontologies from Engineering Standards", "paper_id": "WOS:000301118600005"}
