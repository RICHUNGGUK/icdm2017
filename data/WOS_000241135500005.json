Firstly, a client-server based architecture for collaborative assembly is discussed. The discussion highlights how to decompose the collaborative assembly environment into several functional modules, and how to deploy the right module on the right side. Secondly, some key technologies. including task classification and subdivision, and multimodal interaction, are discussed in detail. At last, we give our implementations and discuss limitations in our current research effort.", "paper_title": "A collaborative design platform for assembly process planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500005"}
