Both the mobile handover model and the random walk model, which are based on the relative velocity between neighboring hosts, are considered in the analysis, respectively. The numerical results obtained from both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments indicate that the random walk analytical model is able to provide better description of the complicated mobile host moving behavior than the mobile handover model. However, the performance margin between these two mobility models is smaller when the mobile host moving speed is higher. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
