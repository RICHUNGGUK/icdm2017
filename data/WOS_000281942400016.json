Each element of the universal sets is chosen independently by some vertex with probability p. Two vertices are joined by an edge iff their chosen element sets intersect. Given n, m so that m = inverted right perpendicularn(alpha)inverted left perpendicular, for any real alpha different than one, we establish here, for the first time, a sharp threshold for the graph property \"Contains a Hamilton cycle\". Our proof involves new, nontrivial, coupling techniques that allow us to circumvent the edge dependencies in the random intersection graph model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
