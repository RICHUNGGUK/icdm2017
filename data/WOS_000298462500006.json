The digital 3D foot scans, obtained from 50 Hong Kong Chinese subjects (25 males and 25 females) were processed to generate the foot outlines at heights of 2 mm and 40 mm. The outlines were represented as turning functions and the similarity among shapes was determined using average linkage clustering. The results show that there are two distinct shape groups for the 40 mm foot outlines on both medial and lateral sides of the foot. The presence (46%) or absence (54%) of a medial bulge characterizes the medial side, while the two shape groups on the lateral side are mainly due to the lateral concavity in the mid-foot region. The group with a lateral concavity consists of more females (68%) and thus lateral side of foot outline appears to be gender related. Furthermore, the medial and lateral side clusters are not related to each other. The medial side shape from the 2 mm foot outline is a good indicator of fallen arches. Based on the analyses, four types of feet were identified: feet with (1) lateral concavity and a medial bulge, (2) a medial bulge and no lateral concavity, (3) lateral concavity and no medial bulge and (4) lateral concavity and a medial bulge. These shape differences can be useful in the design of shoe lasts and in the manufacture of compatible footwear so that trial and error fitting can be minimized. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
