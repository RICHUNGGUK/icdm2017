This online learning algorithm is shown to achieve and in some cases outperform the mean-square error (MSE) performance of the best constituent algorithm in the steady state. However, the MSE analysis of this algorithm in the literature uses approximations and relies on statistical models on the underlying signals. Hence, such an analysis may not be useful or valid for signals generated by various real-life systems that show high degrees of nonstationarity, limit cycles and that are even chaotic in many cases. In this brief, we produce results in an individual sequence manner. In particular, we relate the time-accumulated squared estimation error of this online algorithm at any time over any interval to the one of the optimal convex mixture of the constituent algorithms directly tuned to the underlying signal in a deterministic sense without any statistical assumptions. In this sense, our analysis provides the transient, steady-state, and tracking behavior of this algorithm in a strong sense without any approximations in the derivations or statistical assumptions on the underlying signals such that our results are guaranteed to hold. We illustrate the introduced results through examples.", "paper_title": "A Deterministic Analysis of an Online Convex Mixture of Experts Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000356506700022"}
