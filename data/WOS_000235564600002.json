We discuss the nonlinear convergence of the Picard iteration as a function of the pressure and scalar potential continuity projections stemming from the SIMPLER algorithm, for three example problems. In particular, we discuss the choice of under-relaxation method, and choice of under-relaxation factors; the choice of the projection algorithm; and the required tolerance for the linear solve of the generalized Poisson equations for the pressure and scalar potential equations that arise from the projection operations. We conclude that the convergence of the nonlinear Picard iteration can be effectively controlled by the optimal enforcement of the continuity projections.
