The algorithm evaluates a large set of curved segments or strokes through the image of the input Arabic word or subword using a dynamic feature extraction technique then nominates a small \"optimal\" subset of cuts for segmentation. All the directions of stroke are converted to two main segments: '+' and W'-' RISF. A list of nominated segmentation points are prepared from the '+' segments and evaluated according to special conditions to locate the final segmentation points. The RISF. algorithm was tested by using our new designed database AHD/AUST and the IFN/ENIT database. It has achieved a high segmentation rate of 95.66% on AHD/AUST and 90.58% on IFN/ENIT handwritten Arabic databases.", "paper_title": "Off-line Arabic handwritten word segmentation using Rotational Invariant Segments Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000257681100014"}
