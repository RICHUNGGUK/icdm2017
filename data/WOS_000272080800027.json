The result is presented as a tree of these objects, which can be viewed and explored through a specific java applet designed to highlight relevant features. Unlike the numerous tools that search for overrepresented terms, SimCT draws a simplified representation of biological terms present in the set of objects, and can be applied to any ontology for which annotation data is available. Being web-based, it does not require prior installation, and provides an intuitive, easy-to-use service.", "paper_title": "SimCT: a generic tool to visualize ontology-based relationships for biological objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000272080800027"}
