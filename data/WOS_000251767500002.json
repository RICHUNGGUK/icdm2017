We prove both constructive lower bounds and combinatorial upper bounds on the maximal sizes of these sets. The lower bounds are proved by analyzing a class of algorithms that return feasible solutions for the given problems. The analysis uses the differential equation method proposed by Wormald [Lectures on Approximation and Randomized Algorithms, PWN, Wassaw, 1999, pp. 239-298]. The upper bounds are proved by direct combinatorial means. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "Packing vertices and edges in random regular graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000251767500002"}
