Output feedback controller is designed for fractional-order uncertain systems when fractional-order a satisfies 0 < alpha < 2. By introducing appropriate transformation, the multiconsensus problem is converted into the stability problem of fractional-order systems. Based on the stability theory of fractional-order systems, some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure that the states of all the agents can reach more than one consistent values asymptotically, and the feedback matrix of the proposed protocol is also determined according to linear matrix inequalities. Simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
