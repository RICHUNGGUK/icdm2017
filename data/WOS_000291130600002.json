The design of the embedded networks involves complex and competing objectives that are associated with various physical processes. The optimization tool includes a PDE solver based on advanced finite element techniques coupled to a multi-objective constrained genetic algorithm. The resulting Pareto-optimal fronts are investigated in the optimization of these materials for void volume fraction, flow efficiency, maximum temperature, and surface convection objective functions.
