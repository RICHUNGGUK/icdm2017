In this paper, we investigate power allocation and relay selection techniques for amplify-and-forward two-path successive relaying networks. Our approach is based on the maximization of the received SNR subject to a total power budget consumed by the source and the relay assisting this specific transmission. Two scenarios including with and without direct link are considered here. We show that the main problem has a closed-form solution and only requires a few amounts of feedback bits to be broadcasted. Numerical results reveal that the proposed approaches are more insensitive to the inter-relay interference and robust to channel estimation errors; meanwhile, they perform better than the existing schemes.
