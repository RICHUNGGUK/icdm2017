The aim of our research is the design of a computer-aided, intelligent and genetic algorithm(GA) based programming system for CNC cutting tools selection, tool sequences planning and optimisation of cutting conditions. The first step is geometrical feature recognition and classification. On the basis of recognised features the module for GA-based determination of technological data determine cutting tools, cutting parameters (according to work piece material and cutting tool material) and detailed tool sequence planning. Material, which will be removed, is split into several cuts, each consisting of a number of basic tool movements. In the next step, GA operations such as reproduction, crossover and mutation are applied. The process of GA-based optimisation runs in cycles in which new generations of individuals are created with increased average fitness of a population. During the evaluation of calculated results (generated NC programmes) several rules and constraints like rapid and cutting tool movement, collision, clamping and minimum machining time, which represent the fitness function, were taken into account. A case study was made for the turning operation of a rotational part. The results show that the GA-based programming has a higher efficiency. The total machining time was reduced by 16%. The demand for a high skilled worker on CAD/CAM systems and CNC machine tools was also reduced.", "paper_title": "Intelligent programming of CNC turning operations using genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000237025900006"}
