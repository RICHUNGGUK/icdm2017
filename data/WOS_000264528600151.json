This goal, in fact, can be achieved by a proper turbine maintenance policy. This study presents a model for total productive maintenance to enhance the efficiency of power plant equipment. A probabilistic failure analysis model is used to determine the optimal turbine maintenance cycle. Additionally. the costs savings achieved by using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is demonstrated in an operational maintenance model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
