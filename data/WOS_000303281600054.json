The requirements engineering approach is grounded in the theoretical framework of C-K theory. An essential result of this approach is that we obtain normalized class models. Compared to traditional UML class models, these normalized models are free of ambiguities such as many-to-many, optional-to-optional or reflexive associations which cause amongst others problems at design time. FCA has the benefit of providing a partial ordering of the objects in the conceptual model based on the use cases in which they participate. The four operators of the C-K design square give a clear structure to the requirements engineering process: elaboration, verification, modification and validation. In each of these steps the FCA lattice visualization plays a pivotal role. We empirically show how the strategy works by applying it to a set of case studies and a modeling experiment in which 20 students took part. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
