However, FCRb are subject to several restrictions that create difficulties in their creation and completion. This paper proposes a method to optimally complete FCRb using Fuzzy Boolean Net properties as qualitative universal approximators. Although the proposed approach focuses on FCRb, it can be generalized to any fuzzy rule base. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
