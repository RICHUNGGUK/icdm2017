Though the security in sensor networks share many characteristics with wireless ad hoc networks, the two fields are rapidly diverging due to the fundamental differences between the make-up and goals of the two types of networks. Perhaps the greatest dividing difference is the energy and computational abilities. Sensor nodes are typically smaller, less powerful, and more prone to failure than nodes in an ad hoc network. These differences indicate that protocols that are valid in the context of ad-hoc networks may not be directly applicable for sensor networks. In this paper, we survey the state of art in securing wireless sensor networks. We review several protocols that provide security in sensor networks, with an emphasis on authentication, key management and distribution, secure routing, and methods for intrusion detection.
