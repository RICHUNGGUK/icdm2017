CAT0.5 is more suitable for multiplicative disease models and MAX2 is better for dominant/recessive models. Methods: We define the CAT0.5-MAX2 phase diagram on the disease model space such that regions where MAX2 is more powerful than CAT0.5 are separated from regions where the CAT0.5 is more powerful, and the task is to choose the appropriate parameterization to make the separation possible. Results: We find that using the difference of allele frequencies (delta(p)) and the difference of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium coefficients (6,) can separate the two phases well,and the phase boundaries are determined by the angle tan(-1) (delta(p)/delta(epsilon)), which is an improvement over the disease model selection using 6, only. Conclusions: We argue that phase diagrams similar to the one for CAT0.5-MAX2 have graphical appeals in understanding power performance of various tests, clarifying simulation schemes, summarizing case-control datasets, and guessing the possible mode of inheritance.
