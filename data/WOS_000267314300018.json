The analysis is performed by using an upper bound theorem of limit analysis in combination with finite elements and linear programming. It is specified that both the anchors are loaded to failure simultaneously at the same magnitude of the failure load. For different clear spacing (S) between the anchors, the magnitude of the efficiency factor (xi(gamma)) is determined. On account of interference, the magnitude of xi(gamma) is found to reduce continuously with a decrease in the spacing between the anchors. The results from the numerical analysis were found to compare reasonably well with the available theoretical data from the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
