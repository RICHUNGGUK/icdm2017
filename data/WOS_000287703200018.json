The receiver can cover Group#3, Group#4 for WiMedia and Group#2-5 for China UWB standard respectively. The fully differential receiver consists of a wideband LNA and a down conversion mixer with high gain and low gain mode. A low-pass filter with controllable gain and cut-off frequency along with a programmable gain amplifier are also included. The chip was fabricated in TSMC 0.13-mu m RF CMOS process. Measurement results show that the receiver achieves voltage gain from 21 to 69 dB with 2 dB/step and an NF of 3.2-4.6 dB over 6.2-9.5 GHz and 1-dB compression point of -21 dBm. The intermediate frequency of the receiver can be switched between 264 and 132 MHz, which enables the receiver applicable for both WiMedia and China UWB standard. Power consumption is only 47 mA with 1.2-V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "A 6.2-9.5 GHz receiver for Wimedia MB-OFDM and China UWB standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000287703200018"}
