We present the case of a public medical clinic offering activities, mostly to the elderly, at a daycare center. Users are brought into the daycare center by bus or by taxi. The global problem consists in defining routes to pick up users while assigning them to time slots in the week. At first sight this problem could be viewed as an asymmetric multiple vehicle routing problem. However many additional constraints must be considered. In this paper, we propose a metaheuristic including two phases to solve the problem. In the first phase, the initial solution is determined using one of two proposed constructed algorithms and is improved using tabu search in the second phase. These algorithms are tested on 10 problem instances. Experimental results are presented.", "paper_title": "Heuristics to Solve a Real-world Asymmetric Vehicle Routing Problem with Side Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000332030300006"}
