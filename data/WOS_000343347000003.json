Availability and performance are key aspects in call centers. Architectural models, service policies, and redundancies are attributes for defining and evaluating the overall operation of such systems. In this work, we performed the performability evaluation of an important emergency call center located in a large city in Brazil. The results showed that the system's downtime is considered high, so, we proposed a new architecture to improve the system's performability. The results obtained in this paper can be used to provide support for decisions on interventions in the emergency call center to improve its performability. It is expected that the models presented in this paper will be useful in a variety of emergency call centers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
