Conditions for the occurrence of the abrupt disappearance of entanglement are determined and, most importantly, rigourously shown to be almost always satisfied: Dynamical models for which the sudden death of entanglement does not occur are seen to form a highly idealized zero-measure subset within the set of all possible quantum dynamics.", "paper_title": "UNIVERSALITY OF SUDDEN DEATH OF ENTANGLEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000292172800009"}
