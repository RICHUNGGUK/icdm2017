Even in its most simple formulation, which requires only the maintenance of minimum pressures, it is difficult to solve, and the simplifications introduced often impair the practicality of the solutions. The paper aims at integrating an engineering approach to the optimization problem by generating pseudofronts in the hydraulically feasible region of the search space. The optimization algorithms provide an entirely feasible trade-off between cost and considered constraints, which may be directly used by a hypothetical decision maker. This engineering approach requires a fast tool to search for feasible solutions: the recently developed genetic heritage by stochastic evolution transmission (GHEST) algorithm, used herein, has proved to be effective and efficient in solving the optimal design problem of WDNs. Tests are carried out on two large-size water distribution networks (Balerma and Modena), using the GHEST algorithm, modified to account for several objectives.
