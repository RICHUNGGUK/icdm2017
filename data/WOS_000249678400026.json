If the decoding computer is temporarily not available at (or, not connected to) the decoding scene, we can still physically stack any t received transparencies (t <= n is a threshold value) to get a vague black-and-white view of the secret image immediately. On the other hand, when the decoding computer is finally available, then we can get a much finer gray-valued view of the secret image using the information hidden in the transparencies. In summary, each transparency is a two-in-one carrier of the information, and the decoding has two options. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
