The emergence of synthetic rock mass (SRM) numerical modelling offers a promising approach to the analysis of rock masses, but has not been rigorously compared with actual physical experiments. In this work, SRM modelling by the discrete element software PFC3D is used to investigate the effect of geometric parameters of joints on the rock mass failure mechanism, unconfined compressive strength and deformation modulus. Firstly, a validation study is undertaken to investigate the ability of SRM modelling to reproduce rock mass failure modes and strength as determined by uniaxial and biaxial compression testing in the laboratory. The numerical analyses agree well with physical experimentation at low confining pressure. A sensitivity study is then undertaken of the effect of joint configuration parameters on the failure mode, unconfined compressive strength and deformation modulus of the rock mass. Five failure modes are predicted to occur: intact rock, planar, block rotation, step-path and semi-block generation. It is found that the failure mode is determined principally by joint orientation and step angle and the joint orientation with respect to principal stress direction is the parameter with the greatest influence on rock mass properties.
