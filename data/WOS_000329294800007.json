Recently, the combination of grasping devices and haptic feedback has been a promising avenue for many applications such as laparoscopic surgery and spatial telemanipulation. This paper presents the work behind a new self-adaptive, a.k.a. underactuated, gripper with a proprioceptive haptic feedback in which the apparent stiffness of the gripper as seen by its actuator is used to estimate contact location. This system combines many technologies and concepts in an integrated mechatronic tool. Among them, underactuated grasping, haptic feedback, compliant joints and a differential seesaw mechanism are used. Following a theoretical modeling of the gripper based on the virtual work principle, the authors present numerical data used to validate this model. Then, a presentation of the practical prototype is given, discussing the sensors, controllers, and mechanical architecture. Finally, the control law and the experimental validation of the haptic feedback are presented.", "paper_title": "A compliant self-adaptive gripper with proprioceptive haptic feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000329294800007"}
