For solving the system of second-order ordinary differential equations y '' + My = f (t, y) with M is an element of R-mxm, the multidimensional ARKN methods (adapted Runge-Kutta-Nystrom methods) were formulated by Wu et al. (2009) [1]. Very recently, the multidimensional ERKN methods (extended Runge-Kutta-Nystrom methods) were proposed by Wu et al. (2010) [26]. Both the ARKN methods and the ERKN methods perform numerically much better than the classical Runge-Kutta-Nystrom methods due to the use of the special structure of the equation brought by the linear term My. Based on the two kinds of multidimensional schemes, we derive two novel improved multidimensional Stormer-Verlet formulas, which are shown to be symplectic and of order two. Each new formula is a blend of existing trigonometric integrators and symplectic integrators. Meantime, the symplecticity conditions for the one-stage explicit multidimensional ARKN methods are presented. Stability and phase properties of the two improved formulas are analyzed. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the two improved multidimensional Stormer-Verlet formulas are more efficient than the classical Stormer-Verlet formula and the two other improved Stormer-Verlet methods appeared in the literature. In particular, when applied to a Hamiltonian system, the two symplectic improved multidimensional Stormer-Verlet formulas preserve well the Hamiltonian in the sense of numerical approximation, and have better accuracy than the classical Stormer-Verlet formula and the two other improved Stormer-Verlet methods with the same computational cost.
