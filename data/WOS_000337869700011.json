Past research on upstream transmission in passive optical networks (PONs) has mainly considered packet-switched traffic and has focused on optimizing packet-level performance metrics, such as reducing mean delay. This study proposes and evaluates a dynamic circuit and packet PUN (DyCaPPON) that provides dynamic circuits along with packet-switched service. DyCaPPON provides (i) flexible packet-switched service through dynamic bandwidth allocation in periodic polling cycles, and (ii) consistent circuit service by allocating each active circuit a fixed-duration upstream transmission window during each fixed-duration polling cycle. We analyze circuit-level performance metrics, including the blocking probability of dynamic circuit requests in DyCaPPON through a stochastic knapsack-based analysis. Through this analysis we also determine the bandwidth occupied by admitted circuits. The remaining bandwidth is available for packet traffic and we conduct an approximate analysis of the resulting mean delay of packet traffic. Through extensive numerical evaluations and verifying simulations we demonstrate the circuit blocking and packet delay trade-offs in DyCaPPON. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
