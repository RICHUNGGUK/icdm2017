The proposed RoF network architecture is based on a reconfigurable control station and remote access unit (RAU) that is equipped with a fixed filter and tunable filter. The proposed hybrid frequency-division multiplexing/time division multiple access (FDM/TDMA) based MAC protocol realizes failure detection/recovery and dynamic wavelength allocation to remote access units. Simulation result shows that with the proposed MAC protocol, the control station can detect failures and recover and dynamic wavelength allocation can increase the wavelength resource utilization to maintain network performance.", "paper_title": "Dynamically reconfigurable radio-over-fiber network with medium access control protocol to provide network access to train passengers", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500013"}
