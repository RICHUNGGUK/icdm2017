Studies on the aging effect in neural activation report controversial results. In this paper, pictures of two classes of facial affect, i.e., anger and fear, were presented to young and elderly participants. High-density 256-channel EEG data were recorded and an innovative methodology was used to map the activated brain state at the N170 event-related potential component. The methodology, namely 3D Vector Field Tomography, reconstructs the electrostatic field within the head volume and requires no prior modeling of the individual's brain. Results showed that the elderly exhibited greater N170 amplitudes, while age-based differences were also observed in the topographic distribution of the EEG recordings at the N170 component. The brain activation analysis was performed by adopting a set of regions of interest. Results on the maximum activation area appeared to be emotion-specific; the anger emotional conditions induced the maximum activation in the inferior frontal gyrus, while fear activated more the superior temporal gyrus. The approach used here shows the potential of the proposed computational model to reveal the age effect on the brain activation upon emotion arousing images, which could be further transferred to the design of assistive clinical applications.", "paper_title": "Age Effect in Human Brain Responses to Emotion Arousing Images: The EEG 3D-Vector Field Tomography Modeling Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000364875000008"}
