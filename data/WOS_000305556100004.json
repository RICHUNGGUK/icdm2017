Enterprises have to evolve continuously to attract customers and ensure sustainability. In fact, organisations of all sectors are facing two main challenges: (i) Better understanding of enterprise structures and (ii) Aligning information technologies with business strategies. These challenges are faced by all manufacturing organisations whether they are global companies or small enterprises. Many research activities have been carried out by the scientific community in order to develop and improve enterprise modelling frameworks. Zachman (1987. A framework for information systems architecture. IBM Systems Journal, 26 (3), 176-292.) specified a framework to represent enterprises according to different points of view. It was the first enterprise Architecture Framework. Since 1987, researchers and experts have proposed several Enterprise Architecture frameworks for military (Chief Information Officer Council, 2001. A practical guide to federal enterprise architecture [online]. Available from: http://www.gao.gov/best practices/bpeaguide.pdf [Accessed April 2010].) or manufacturing organisations (Lapkin A., 2005. Gartner's enterprise architecture process and framework help meet 21st century challenges [online]. Available from: http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doccd=133132 [Accessed April 2010].). Existing approaches do not apprehend supply chain complexity though they provide many views of organisations. Furthermore, there are no rigorous methodologies defined for Enterprise Architecture projects. In this study, a SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) based Enterprise Architecture Methodology (S-BEAM) is proposed to guide decisions of improvement at both strategic and operational levels. The methodology is intended to provide a global vision of supply chain and to improve its performance. In the present study, we begin by researching enterprise architecture literature, and then we present the proposed methodology. A case study of this methodology application will also be carried out.", "paper_title": "SCOR-based enterprise architecture methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000305556100004"}
