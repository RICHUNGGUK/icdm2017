Systematic analysis, however, has yet to be carried out for the various GFMs on their accuracies and conservation errors. In this paper, we develop a technique to rigorously analyze the accuracies and conservation errors of these different GFMs when applied to the multi-medium Riemann problem with a general equation of state (EOS). By analyzing and comparing the interfacial state provided by each GFM to the exact one of the original multi-medium Riemann problem, we show that the accuracy of interfacial treatment can achieve \"third-order accuracy\" in the sense of comparing to the exact solution of the original mutli-medium Riemann problem for the MGFM and the RGFM, while it is of at most \"first-order accuracy\" for the OGFM and the GWGFM when the interface approach is actually near in balance. Similar conclusions are also obtained in association with the local conservation errors. A special test method is exploited to validate these theoretical conclusions from the numerical viewpoint.
