In current clinical equipment, HFR is obtained using multi-line acquisition (MLA) which typically requires broadening of transmit beams. As this may result in a significant degradation of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the capacity of MLA to obtain high quality HFR images remains limited. As an alternative, we have demonstrated by computer simulation that simultaneously transmitting multiple focused beams into different directions [multi-line transmit (MLT)], can increase the frame rate without significantly compromising the spatial resolution or SNR. This study aimed to experimentally verify these theoretical predictions both in vitro and in vivo to demonstrate, for the first time, that cardiac MLT imaging is feasible. Hereto, the ultrasound advanced open platform, equipped with a 2.0 MHz phased array, was programmed to interleave MLT and conventional single line transmit (SLT) beam forming. Using these two beam forming methods, images of phantoms and healthy volunteers were acquired and investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results confirmed our simulations that image quality of a 4MLT imaging system with a Tukey apodization scheme is very competitive to that of SLT while providing a 4 times higher frame rate. It is also demonstrated that MLT can be combined with MLA to provide images at 12- to 16-fold frame rate (about 340-450 Hz) without significantly compromising spatial resolution and SNR. This is thus the first study to demonstrate that this new ultrasound imaging paradigm is viable which could have significant impact on future cardiac ultrasound systems.", "paper_title": "Multi-Transmit Beam Forming for Fast Cardiac Imaging-Experimental Validation and In Vivo Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000337125400001"}
