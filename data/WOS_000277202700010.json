The crucial interactions between the kinase and the activation protein were investigated and the SMD simulations showed that several activation-relevant motifs of CDK5 leave p25 in sequence during the pulling and lead to an apo-CDK2 like CDK5 structure after separation. Based on systematic examination of hydrogen bond breaking and classical MD/molecular mechanics-generalized Born/surface area) (MM-GBSA) calculations, a CDK5 activation mechanism by p25 is suggested. This is the first step towards the systemic development of CDK inhibitors and the mechanism proposed could lead to a better understanding of the protein-protein recognition characteristics between the kinase and its activator.", "paper_title": "Mechanism of CDK5 activation revealed by steered molecular dynamics simulations and energy calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000277202700010"}
