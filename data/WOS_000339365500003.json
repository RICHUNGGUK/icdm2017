First, an SSW report frame compatible with IEEE 802.11ad standard is designed. Second, an approach collecting instantaneous channel state information (CSI) overheard during BF is devised. Third, with the aim of minimizing the outage probability and maximizing the overall network throughput capacity, the optimal relay selection issue for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links is formulated as a bipartite graph, and Kuhn Munkres (KM) algorithm is provided to resolve it. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show, with CSI considering NLoS conditions and selected relays according to the overall network throughput capacity maximization principle, the improvements achieved over opportunistic relay selection strategy in terms of overall network throughput capacity and outage probability with minimal modifications to IEEE 802.11ad.", "paper_title": "Relay selection with feedback beamforming information through designed sector sweep report frame for mmWave WPANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500003"}
