This scheme has two main features: 1) Whether or not the sampled state should be transmitted is determined by the current-sampled state and the error between the current-sampled state and the latest transmitted state. Compared with those in a periodic time-triggered communication scheme, the communication bandwidth utilization is considerably reduced while preserving the desired control performance; and 2) it is a discrete event-triggered communication scheme due to the fact that the triggered conditions are only measured and checked at a constant sampling period. Compared with a continuous event-triggered communication scheme, the special hardware for continuous measurement and computation is no longer needed. Second, a networked T-S fuzzy model is delicately constructed, which not only considers nonuniform time scales in the networked T-S fuzzy model and the parallel distributed compensation fuzzy control rules but includes the aforementioned state error as well. Third, a stability criterion and a stabilization criterion about the networked T-S fuzzy system are derived, respectively. The stability criterion and stabilization criterion can provide a tradeoff to balance the required communication resource and the desired performance: Lowering the desired performance allows the network to allocate more limited bandwidth to other nodes in need. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "To Transmit or Not to Transmit: A Discrete Event-Triggered Communication Scheme for Networked Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314724900012"}
