Since much m-TV consumption will be in spare time, offering the users contents they are interested in becomes extremely important to provide an attractive service which does not discourage potential users. Using DVB-H as transport infrastructure, in this paper we introduce a personalization architecture which perfectly fits in with the value chain of m-TV. By applying semantic models and techniques, personalized virtual channels are dynamically constructed by adequately combining several kinds of contents according to the user's interests. While the personalization architecture is particularized, in this paper, to provide news channels, it could be easily generalized to other fields. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
