Contention becomes a potential problem when a large number of requests, which can overwhelm the aggregate capacity of shared resources, are submitted from the participating organizations coincidentally at the same period. In particular, when a small number of requests that require large amounts of computing resources are admitted in place of a large number of requests that require less computing resources, the overall system performance, in terms of admission ratio, can deteriorate significantly. Hence, admission control is necessary to reduce resource oversubscription. Because domain-shared computing resources are likely to be combined to form a large-scale system, it is not possible to define a fixed admission policy solely based on the request's CPU and execution time requirements. In this paper, we introduce an admission control framework, based on a pricing model, for a multi-domain-shared computing infrastructure. The performance of the admission control framework is evaluated under different scenarios that contribute to the overall degree of competition for shared resources. The results are presented and analyzed in this paper.
