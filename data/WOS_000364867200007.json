To mitigate the crosstalk effect, there are several types of crosstalk avoidance codes proposed in the literature. In this paper, we are particularly interested in generating forbidden transition codes that do not have opposite transitions on any two adjacent wires. For this, we propose a sequential bit-stuffing algorithm and a parallel bit-stuffing algorithm. For the sequential bit-stuffing algorithm, we perform a worst-case analysis and a probabilistic analysis. We show by both theoretic analysis and simulations that the coding rate of the sequential bit-stuffing encoding scheme is quite close to the Shannon capacity. In particular, for a bus with n = 10 parallel wires, the difference is only 2.2 percent. Using a Markov chain analysis, we show that the coding rate of the parallel bit-stuffing algorithm is only slightly lower than that of the sequential bit-stuffing algorithm. The implementation complexity of the parallel bit-stuffing algorithm is linear with n. In comparison with the existing forbidden transition codes that use the Fibonacci representation in the literature, our bit-stuffing algorithms not only achieve higher coding rates but also have much lower implementation complexity.", "paper_title": "Bit-Stuffing Algorithms for Crosstalk Avoidance in High-Speed Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000364867200007"}
