A confluence of frequency and temporal parameters are extracted from the EEG to serve as input features to well-configured ANN and SVM networks. Through these classification results, we thus can infer the occurrence of high-risk (epileptic) as well as low risk (control) patients for potential follow up procedures.", "paper_title": "A NEW PARAMETRIC FEATURE DESCRIPTOR FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF EPILEPTIC AND CONTROL EEG RECORDS IN PEDIATRIC POPULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000302210200001"}
