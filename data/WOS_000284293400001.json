Three wavelengths, 596 nm, 554 nm and 450 nm, were chosen as the main light waves for three sub-pixels, RGB. Because the diffractive optical element was directly attached to the color filter of a MPEG-4 player (Motion Picture Experts Group Four Player, MPEG-4 player) panel, the stereoscopic image remained high brightness. Since lithography would be the most possible manufacturing method, multilevel approximation was to proceeded during simulation. From the simulated results of optical simulation software, LightTools, the RGB lights moved parallelly and consequently avoiding cross-talk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
