Our problem does not have precoloring solutions of cells as the input, and it allows using techniques, including white space insertion, cell flipping, adjacent-cell swapping, and vertical cell movement, to optimize the solution quality. We first present (resource-constrained) shortest-path-based algorithms for several TPL-aware single-row placement problems that allow or disallow perturbing a given cell ordering. Based on these algorithms, we then propose an approach to our TPL-aware detailed placement refinement problem, which first minimizes the number of stitches and then minimizes the wirelength. Finally, we report extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "paper_title": "On Refining Row-Based Detailed Placement for Triple Patterning Lithography", "paper_id": "WOS:000353509300008"}
