We have developed an adaptive middleware infrastructure that simultaneously satisfies the individual needs of applications while maintaining overall system performance. A Model Reference Adaptive Control mechanism has been implemented in the middleware using control theory and fuzzy-based techniques. With reference to the model reference adaptive control theory, we also present a Self-Adaptive Fuzzy-based Service Adaptation Model (SA-FSAM) by taking historical adaptation information into account, and utilizing a closed-loop control mechanism to fine-tune adaptation decisions. The SA-FSAM and a conventional threshold-based linear-control model have been evaluated using a campus assistant mobile application. With the introduction of self-adaptive elements in the control model, the SA-FSAM shows significant improvements in service adaptation decisions.", "paper_title": "Model Reference Adaptive Control in Fuzzy-Based Context-Aware Middleware", "paper_id": "WOS:000319191800016"}
