These reconfigurable architectures have shown to achieve higher performance compared to software-programmed processors. However, reconfigurable architectures suffer from a significant reconfiguration overhead and a speedup limitation. By reducing the reconfiguration overhead, the overall performance of reconfigurable architectures can be improved. Therefore, we will describe temporal partitioning, which are able to amortize the reconfiguration overhead at synthesis phase or compilation time. Our temporal partitioning methodology splits a configuration context into temporal partitions to amortize reconfiguration overhead. And then, we will present benchmark results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology.", "paper_title": "Temporal partitioning to amortize reconfiguration overhead for dynamically reconfigurable architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020000010"}
