By using suitable Lyapunov functional and the LaSalle's invariance principle, we establish the global stability of the three equilibria. The uninfected equilibrium E-0 is globally asymptotically stable if R-0 <= 1, the infected equilibrium without immunity E-1 is globally asymptotically stable if R-1 <= 1 and R-0 > 1, the infected equilibrium with humoral immunity E-2 is globally asymptotically stable if R-1 > 1. We check our theorems with numerical simulation in the end. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
