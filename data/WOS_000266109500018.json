Here we present MICAlign, a sequence-to-structure alignment tool that incorporates multiple sources of information from local structural contexts of template, sequence profiles, predicted secondary structures, solvent accessibilities, potential-like terms (including residue-residue contacts and solvent exposures) and pre-aligned structures and sequences. These features, together with a position-specific gap scheme, were integrated into conditional random fields through which the optimal parameters were automatically learned. MICAlign showed improved alignment accuracy over several other state-of-the-art alignment tools based on comparisons by using independent datasets.", "paper_title": "MICAlign: a sequence-to-structure alignment tool integrating multiple sources of information in conditional random fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000266109500018"}
