The advent of massively parallel supercomputers has enhanced the scientific community's ability to study larger system sizes. Ground-state DFT calculations on similar to 10(3) valence electrons using traditional O (N-3) algorithms can be routinely performed on present-day supercomputers. The performance characteristics of these massively parallel DFT codes on > 10(4) computer cores are not well understood. The GPAW code was ported an optimized for the Blue Gene/P architecture. We present our algorithmic parallelization strategy and interpret the results for a number of benchmark test cases.
