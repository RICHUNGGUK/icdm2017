However, there is still a lack of efficient and accurate computational methods to predict compound selectivity properties. In this paper, we propose a set of machine learning methods to do compound selectivity prediction. In particular, we propose a novel cascaded learning method and a multitask learning method. The cascaded method decomposes the selectivity prediction into two steps, one model for each step, so as to effectively filter out nonselective compounds. The multitask method incorporates both activity and selectivity models into one multitask model so as to better differentiate compound selectivity properties. We conducted a comprehensive set of experiments and compared the results with those of other conventional selectivity prediction methods, and our results demonstrated that the cascaded and multitask methods significantly improve the selectivity prediction performance.", "paper_title": "Improved Machine Learning Models for Predicting Selective Compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000299351600005"}
