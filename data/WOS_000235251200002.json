The choice of the exponent value for IDW and splines as well as the number of the closest neighbours to include was decided from the root mean squared error (RMSE) statistic, obtained from a cross-validation procedure. Experimental variograms were fitted with the exponential, spherical, Gaussian and linear models using weighted least squares. The model with the smallest residual sum of squares (RSS) was further interrogated to find the number of neighbours that returned the best cross-validation result. Overall, all of the methods gave similar RMSE values. On this experimental field, ordinary kriging performed best for pH in the topsoil and lognormal ordinary kriging gave the best results when applied to electrical conductivity in the topsoil. IDW interpolated subsoil pH with the greatest accuracy and splines surpassed kriging and IDW for interpolating, organic matter. In all uses of IDW, the power of one was the best choice, which may due to the low skewness of the soil properties interpolated. In all cases, a value of three was found to be the best power for splines. Loganormal kriging performed well when the dataset had a coefficient of skewness larger than one. No other summary statistics offered insight into the choice of the interpolation procedure or its parameters. We conclude that many parameters would be better identified from the RMSE statistic obtained from cross-validation after an exhaustive testing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
