We employed molecular dynamics simulation techniques to identify the predicted D2 receptor structure. Homology models of the protein were developed on the basis of crystal structures of four receptor crystals. Compound docking revealed the possible binding mode. In addit ' ion, the docking analyses results indicate that five residues (Asp72, Va173, Cys76, LeuI83, and Phel87) were responsible for the selectivity of the tetralindiol derivatives. Our molecular dynamics simulations were applied in combination with the solvated interaction energies (SIE) technique to predict the compounds' docking modes in the binding pocket of the D2 receptor. The simulations revealed satisfactory correlations between the calculated and experimental binding affinities of all seven tetralindiol derivative antagonists, as indicated by the obtained W value of 0.815.", "paper_title": "Predictions of Binding for Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists by the SIE Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000271011500020"}
