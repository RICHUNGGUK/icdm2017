The aim of this study is to propose a novel approach. for customer service management. For the improvement of logistics service operations, the proposed method integrates quality function development (QFD), fuzzy extended analytic hierarchy process (FEAHP), and multi-segment goal programming (MSGP). The advantage of the method includes the consideration of various logistics goals and the flexibility of setting multi-aspiration levels of evaluation criteria. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
