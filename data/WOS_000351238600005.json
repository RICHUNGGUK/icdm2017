We construct a high-order averaged system whose solution remains exponentially close to the exact one over long time intervals, possesses the same geometric properties (structure, invariants, ...) as compared to the original system and is non-oscillatory. We then apply our results to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation on the -dimensional torus , or in with a harmonic oscillator, for which we obtain a hierarchy of Hamiltonian averaged models. Our results are then illustrated numerically on several examples borrowed from the recent literature.", "paper_title": "Stroboscopic Averaging for the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351238600005"}
