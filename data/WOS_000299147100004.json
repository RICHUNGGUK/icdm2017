Due to the color information such as components and distribution is also taken into consideration, the feature obtained not only reflects the texture correlation but also represents the color information. As a result, our proposed method is superior to the gray-level co-occurrence matrix method and color histogram method, and it enhances the retrieval accuracy which is measured in terms of the recall and precision in the meanwhile.
