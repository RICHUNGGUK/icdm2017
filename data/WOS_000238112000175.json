Firstly, on the basis of the searching-and-averaging-based method in frequency domain, the algorithm was extended to blind delay source model. Secondly, a new cost function for estimating the delay of observed signal was present; the delay was inferred in the single-signal intervals. Finally, the delayed sound experiments demonstrate its performance.", "paper_title": "Estimation of delays and attenuations for underdetermined BSS in frequency domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000175"}
