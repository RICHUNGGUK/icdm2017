We derive the analytical formulations for dyadic approximation error and nonorthogonality error. We further classify the dyadic approximation error into a \"system error\" and a \"nonflat error,\" and proposed two models for them. We found that the \"nonflat error\" has a substantial impact on video quality if the number of shifting bits at decoder side (DQ_BITS) is small. We also give a theoretical justification on why scaling factors at encoder side are better to be adapted to the rescaling factors at decoder side in H. 264/AVC-like codecs.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Dyadic Approximation Error for Hybrid Video Codecs With Integer Transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000295008100008"}
