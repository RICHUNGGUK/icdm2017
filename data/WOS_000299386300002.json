In such networks the mobile nodes are disconnected for significantly long periods of time. Traditional routing protocols proposed for mobile ad hoc networks or mesh networks, which assume at least one path between each source and destination, are ineffective in DTNs. One approach to improve communication is through gossip based protocols because these protocols do not rely on a fixed path. Another approach is to control the movement of the mobile nodes and/or use special mobile nodes called ferry nodes. Others try to employ a fixed infrastructure including stationary relay points. One scheme in stationary relay point approach is to use base stations as relay points which need their own power supply. In this paper, we study a passive approach where mobile nodes deposit/retrieve messages to/from known stationary locations in the geographic region. Messages are delivered from a source by being deposited at one or more locations that are later visited by the destination. A proposed implementation of our approach using read/writable passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, one per point location, is considered in this work. Passive RFID technology is desirable because it operates wirelessly and without the need for attached power. Our simulation results indicate that our approach can achieve competitive message delay and delivery rates. We also demonstrate several techniques for optimizing the stationary relay node placement, namely relay pruning, probability based relay distribution and a genetic algorithm; the genetic algorithm is shown to provide the best solutions to this problem.", "paper_title": "Improving performance in delay/disruption tolerant networks through passive relay points", "paper_id": "WOS:000299386300002"}
