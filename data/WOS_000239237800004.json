The design of the variable-structure controller using output feedback provides a technique to compute matrix parameters and guarantees the reaching conditions for a general class of linear systems. A combination of both a modified control law and a simple search technique based on the GA approach is proposed to obtain a good dynamic response. The proposed method is computationally simple and tractable, and guarantees a sliding motion along the switching surface. The efficacy of the theoretical results is illustrated by considering a linearized model of an aircraft control problem.", "paper_title": "Reaching condition for variable-structure output feedback controller using a search technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000239237800004"}
