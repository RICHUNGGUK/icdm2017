In this paper, we introduce a distance metric learning method for bipartite graph matching-based 3D object retrieval framework. In this method, the relationship among 3D models is formulated by a graph structure with semisupervised learning to estimate the model relevance. More specially, we model two sets of views by using a bipartite graph, on which their optimal matching is estimated. Then, we learn a refined distance metric by using the user's relevance feedback. The proposed method has been evaluated on four data sets and the experimental results and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Learning-Based Bipartite Graph Matching for View-Based 3D Model Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000209737800001"}
