In these articles Egghe considered a general h-type index which has a value n if n is the largest natural number such that the first n publications (ranked according to the number of received citations) have received at least f(n) citations, with f(n) any increasing function defined on the strictly positive numbers. His results deal with increments I-2 and I-1 defined by: I-2(n)-I-1 (n + 1)-I-1 (n) where I-1 (n) = (n + 1)f(n + 1) - nf(n). Our results differ from Egghe's because we also consider I-k(0), k= 1,2. We, moreover, provide a non-recursive definition of the increment functions I-k(n) (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
