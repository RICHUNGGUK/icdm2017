However, so far, collaborative design for aircraft tooling, especially in large-sized one, is difficult. To solve this, a self-adaptive collaborative design method of aircraft tooling based on a natural neuron-endocrine-immunity system, multi-agent and product data management (PDM) technologies has been developed and is presented in this article. Firstly, with the similar working principle of the neuron-endocrine-immunity system model that is able to manage cells and tissues of a human body in a self-adaptive means, a tooling collaborative design model has been developed to enhance the responsiveness and adaptability for changes during aircraft design. Secondly, a collaborative design framework has been proposed by applying the multi-agent and PDM technologies to implement this model. The multi-agent technology focuses on managing the frequent changes, and the PDM has been used to manage the mass aircraft product design and tooling. This framework incorporates the PDM Client/Server architecture and adopts a federated structure for effective collaboration in terms of unified data sharing, convenient tool wrapping, decentralized control, coordination, etc. Finally, a multi-agent-based prototype system, developed, and testified in an aircraft manufacturing enterprise, is demonstrated for aircraft tooling collaborative design. Case studies show that optimized and re-configurable aircraft tooling design can be achieved with the help of the developed collaboration framework.", "paper_title": "Aircraft Tooling Collaborative Design Based on Multi-agent and PDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000266651200006"}
