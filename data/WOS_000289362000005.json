The findings of this work suggest that using a content expert with a process that combines conventional audio-description techniques with colour commentary techniques to allow emotion and excitement, as well as description of the important visual elements, is enjoyable and entertaining for blind, low-vision and sighted audiences. Following the proposed process, about 60% of the content of the live show could be described in a timely manner. Finally, it was found that the describer added about three times as many descriptions from a prepared script as were omitted.", "paper_title": "Re-fashioning fashion: an exploratory study of a live audio-described fashion show", "paper_id": "WOS:000289362000005"}
