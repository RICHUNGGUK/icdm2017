Araport is developed through a partnership between J. Craig Venter Institute, the Texas Advanced Computing Center at The University of Texas at Austin, and The University of Cambridge. Part of the open architecture of Araport is the Science Applications Workspace. Taking an app store' approach, users can choose applications developed both by the Araport team and community developers to create a customized environment for their work. Araport also provides tooling and support for developing applications for Araport, including an application generator, a rapid development and testing tool, and a straightforward deployment path for publishing applications into the Araport workspace.
