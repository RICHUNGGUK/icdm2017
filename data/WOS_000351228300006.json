We study the MCCNFP over a grid network with a general nonnegative separable concave cost function. We show that this problem is polynomially solvable when all sources are in the first echelon and all sinks are in two echelons, and when there is a single source but many sinks in multiple echelons. The polynomiality argument relies on a combination of a particular dynamic programming formulation and an investigation of the extreme points of the underlying flow polyhedron. We derive an analytical formula for the inflow into any node in an extreme point solution, which generalizes a result of Zangwill (Manag Sci 14(7):429-450, 1968) for the multi-echelon lot-sizing problem.", "paper_title": "Minimum concave cost flow over a grid network", "paper_id": "WOS:000351228300006"}
