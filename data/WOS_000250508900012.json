In some one-to-many E-services, like global positioning systems (GPS) or news feeds systems, it is not reasonable to ask customers to stay on-line all the time and save the changes of keys to the system. If registered customers are not on-line, they will miss the re-keying messages and will not be able to decrypt any E-service content. We propose a practical revocation scheme for one-to-many E-services with stateless and service diversity properties. Our scheme reduces the key-storage requirement of service providers to a constant size and customers are not required to be on-line constantly (stateless). Also, service providers can provide various E-services for their customers at the same time (service diversity) and customers can request any E-service or cancel it whenever needed.
