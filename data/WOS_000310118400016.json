For this purpose, specialized zoomable browsers have been proposed to reduce the network traffic. This paper presents a lightweight and platform independent zoomable browser that supports annotations of the high quality digital content. The browser can display high-resolution images in resource-limited mobile environments like PDAs, PALMs and smart-phones, even in low speed connections. We evaluated the browser and the main finding is that data transfer is reduced with the aid of the browser, while the presented information is of high quality and could be used in various operating environments. The browser is developed using lightweight Web technologies, which makes the tool ideal for downloading high detailed digital content.", "paper_title": "IMPLEMENTING A ZOOMABLE WEB BROWSER WITH ANNOTATION FEATURES FOR MANAGING LIBRARIES OF HIGH QUALITY IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118400016"}
