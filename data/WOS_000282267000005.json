The main contribution of this paper is a generic security, privacy and trust framework providing context-aware adaptability, flexibility and scalability which allows customisation of wireless sensor networks to a diverse set of application spaces. Suitable protocols and mechanisms are identified, which when combined according to the framework form a complete toolbox solution which fits the architecture of Beyond 3G environments. Performance evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and estimate the benefits of the security framework for a variety of scenarios.
