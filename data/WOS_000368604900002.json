Although cloud computing is often considered as an energy-efficient technology, the implications of cloud-based software on energy efficiency lack scientific evidence. At the same time, energy efficiency is becoming a crucial requirement for cloud service provisioning, as energy costs significantly contribute to the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a data center. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review that investigates cloud software architectures addressing energy efficiency as a primary concern. The aim is to provide an analysis of the state-of-the-art in the field of energy-efficient software architectures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
