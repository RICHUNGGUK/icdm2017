Since there exist problems of Gaussian noises and uncertain data in complex fuzzy fault system modeling, the input and output variables are described as fuzzy numbers. Then by integrating fuzzy theory. Gaussian loss function and v-support vector classifier machine, the fuzzy Gaussian v-support vector regression machine (Fg-SVCM) is proposed. To seek the optimal parameters of Fg-SVCM, the modified genetic algorithm (GA) is also applied to optimize parameters of Fg-SVCM. A diagnosing method based on Fg-SVCM and GA is put forward. The results of application in fault diagnosis of car assembly line show the hybrid diagnosis model based on Fg-SVCM and PSO is feasible and effective, and the comparison between the method proposed in this paper and other ones is also given, which proves this method is better than other v-SVCMs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
