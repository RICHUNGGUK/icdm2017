Fan, Y. Dai, Fast bit-parallel GF(2\") multiplier for all trinomials, IEEE Transactions on Computers 54 (4) (2005) 485-490]. We give a simpler construction than in Fan and Dai (2005) of the matrix associated to the SPB used to perform the field multiplication. We present also a novel parallel architecture to multiply in SPB. This multiplier have a smaller time complexity (for good field it is equal to T-A + [log(2)(n)] T-X) than all previously presented architecture. For practical field F-2\", i.e., for n similar or equal to 163, this roughly improves the delay by 10%. On the other hand the space complexity is increased by 25%: the space complexity is a little greater than the time gain. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
