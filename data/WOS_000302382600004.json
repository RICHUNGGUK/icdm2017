A high-resolution particle image velocimetry system was used to make detailed flow field measurements to quantify the time evolution of the helical tip vortices in relation to the position of the rotating turbine blades in order to elucidate the underlying physics associated with turbine power generation and fatigue loads acting on the wind turbines.", "paper_title": "Visualization of the tip vortices in a wind turbine wake", "paper_id": "WOS:000302382600004"}
