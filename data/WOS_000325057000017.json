Due to the lack of understanding and supporting data, constant soil parameters for the entire pile length have been routinely used. This practice is unrealistic and compromises the signal match quality. Using recently completed field tests, this paper develops empirical equations for dynamic soil parameters in terms of measureable soil properties and proposes an improved signal matching technique, thereby allowing for better match quality.
