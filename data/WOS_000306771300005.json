We present a new method for checking whether such a language is semi-geometrical or not and whether it is geometrical or not. This method makes use of the enumeration of the simple cycles of the state diagram. It is based on the construction of systems of linear Diophantine equations, where the coefficients are deduced from the set of simple cycles. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
