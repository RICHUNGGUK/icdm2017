The developments concern mainly to some drawbacks in the initial model which takes it far from being used in practice. A fuzzy modeling method is proposed to estimate the required functions in the initial model. Structure identification in the proposed fuzzy modeling method is carried out using subtractive clustering, and parameter identification is conducted via some heuristics as well as an optimization problem. Furthermore, a simulation method along with some heuristic relations is used for implementation and evaluation of the modified model. Efficiency of the proposed method to fuzzy modeling as well as the proposed simulation method is presented by a numerical example. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
