We will study the realistic challenges to this goal by deploying 40 MHz single-element, mechanically rotating transducers. The intrinsic variability among the transducers' spectral parameters as well as tissue signals will be demonstrated. Subsequently, we will show that global data normalization is not suited for data calibration, due to the aforementioned variations as well as the stringent characteristics of spectral features. We will describe the sensitivity of an existing feature extraction algorithm based on eight spectral signatures (integrated backscatter coefficient, slope, midband-fit (MBF), intercept, and maximum and minimum powers and their relative frequencies) to a number of factors, such as the window size and order of the autoregressive (AR) model. It will be further demonstrated that the variations in the transducer's spectral parameters (i.e., center frequency and bandwidth) cause inconsistencies among extracted features. In this paper, two fundamental questions are addressed: 1) what is the best reliable way to extract the most informative features? and 2) which classification algorithm is the most appropriate for this problem? We will present a full-spectrum analysis as an alternative to the eight-feature approach. For the first time, different classification algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and linear Fisher, will be employed and their performances quantified. Finally, we will explore the reliability of the training dataset and the complexity of the recognition algorithm and illustrate that these two aspects can highly impact the accuracy of the end result, which has not been considered until now.", "paper_title": "Challenges in atherosclerotic plaque characterization with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS): From data collection to classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000258595300006"}
