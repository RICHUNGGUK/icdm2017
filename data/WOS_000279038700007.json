We find an appropriate Markov chain to calculate an explicit expression for the time constant whose numerical value is approximate to 0.6827. This time constant is the long-term average inverse speed of the process. We also calculate the average residual time.", "paper_title": "First-Passage Percolation with Exponential Times on a Ladder", "paper_id": "WOS:000279038700007"}
