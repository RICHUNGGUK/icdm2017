A global offensive alliance is a subset S of V such that the above condition holds for every vertex v not in S. Finding the smallest such set in general graphs is NP-complete for both of these problems, even when the weights are all the same. In this paper, we give linear time algorithms that find the smallest global offensive and global powerful alliance of any weighted tree T = (V, E). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
