The proposed method combines a genetic algorithm with local search and is called the hybrid genetic algorithm. The implemented separation method is based on evolutionary minimization of the separated signal cross-correlation. The convergence behaviour of the network is demonstrated by presenting experimental separating signal results. A computer simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The hybrid genetic algorithm blind signal separation performance is better than the genetic algorithm at directly minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Eventually, it is hopeful that this optimization approach can be helpful for blind signal separation engineers as a simple, useful and reasonable alternative.", "paper_title": "The hybrid genetic algorithm for blind signal separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000105"}
