For a positive integer k, a k-tuple dominating set of G is a subset D of vertices such that every vertex in G is dominated by at least k vertices in D. The k-tuple domination number of G is the minimum cardinality of a k-tuple dominating set of G. This paper deals with the k-tuple domination problem on generalized de Bruijn and Kautz digraphs. We establish bounds on the k-tuple domination number for the generalized de Bruijn and Kautz digraphs and we obtain some conditions for the k-tuple domination number attaining the bounds.
