Although the method is well known and easy to implement, if the 2D topological relationships between the footprints are not taken into account, the resulting 3D city models will not necessarily be topologically consistent (i.e. primitives shared by 3D buildings will be duplicated and/or intersect each others). As a result, the model will be of little use for most applications, besides visualization that is. In this article, we present a new extrusion procedure to construct topologically consistent 3D city models. It is based on the use of a constrained triangulation, is conceptually simple and offers great flexibility to create city models in different formats (e.g. CityGML or a surface-based representation). We have implemented the procedure, tested it with real-world data sets and validated it.", "paper_title": "Topologically consistent 3D city models obtained by extrusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000291022400004"}
