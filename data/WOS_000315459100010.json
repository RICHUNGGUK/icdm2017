We find fractal lattices of arbitrary dimension greater than one that all act as good resources for measurement-based quantum computation, and sets of fractal lattices with dimension greater than one that do not. The difference is put down to other topological factors such as ramification and connectivity. This is in direct analogy to the tendency of lattices to observe criticality in spin systems. We also discuss the analogy between thermodynamics and one-way computation in this context. This work adds confidence to the analogy and highlights new features of what we require for universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation.
