Since failures are local, their repair will often be taken on the local (cell) level. Engineers have long sought systems that could offer similar reliability and have relatively recently started trying to integrate ideas inspired by nature into the modern silicon technology of today. While bio-inspired proposals inspired by multicellular systems demonstrated feasibility, the resulting systems were often unduly complex. We are proposing a radically new methodology inspired by the characteristics, morphology, and behavior of simpler prokaryotic bacteria and bacterial communities. The hypothesis we use is that such simple unicellular organisms could help to build simpler cost effective systems, but with improved reliability than hitherto achieved by other methods. The result is a cellular array-based fault-tolerant electronic system with online self-test and self-repair capability. These ideas are simulated, tested, and verified through the successful construction of demonstrators: a proportional, integral, and differential and a robot controller. This paper discusses the underlying biological principles that guide our research and the bio-inspired model that we have derived. It also gives a detailed circuit and system description of the architecture and its run-time self-diagnostic and self-repair capability.", "paper_title": "Novel Bio-Inspired Approach for Fault-Tolerant VLSI Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324650300009"}
