We extend the idea of Dynamic Power Management (DPM) to input queued switches, allowing operators to tradeoff power and delay in a useful way. We frame the problem as a dynamic program and solve a relaxation using techniques from Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR). This optimal policy is combined with existing, nonpower-aware switch controls to generate two novel scheduling algorithms: 1) LQR Power Aware Maximum Weight Matching (LQR PA MWM) and 2) LQR Power Aware Projective Cone Scheduling (LQR PA PCS). Simulation results suggest that our algorithms result in significant power savings compared to MWM and previous power control schemes with little performance degradation.", "paper_title": "Power and Delay Aware Management of Packet Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000310385000011"}
