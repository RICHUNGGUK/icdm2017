The aim of including local and global weights in FPRs and the tuning of these weights is to improve the learning and testing accuracy without increasing the number of rules. By experimenting with some existing benchmark examples (Iris data, Wine data, Pima data and Glass data) the proposed method is found to have high accuracy in classifying unseen samples without increasing the number of the extracted FPRs, and furthermore, the time required to consult with domain experts for gaining a rule is reduced. The synergy between WFPRs and an FNN offers a new insight into the construction of better fuzzy intelligent systems in the future.", "paper_title": "Refinement of fuzzy production rules by using a fuzzy-neural approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100054"}
