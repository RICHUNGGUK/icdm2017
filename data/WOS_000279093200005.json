In this paper we focus on the study of the combined performance of a WiMAX Base Station MAC downlink scheduler and OFDMA packing algorithm which mainly determine the usage efficiency of the available radio resources. We design and analyze an efficient and flexible solution, greedy scheduling algorithm (GSA), and evaluate its performance as compared to several relevant alternative solutions. Specifically, we analyze performance differences with respect to efficiency, flexibility to provide per subscriber station burst shape preferences, interference mitigation and computational load. Our results show that GSA achieves a performance similar to the one of the competing approaches considered in terms of efficiency, even better in some cases, and significantly outperforms them in flexibility to provide per subscriber station burst shape preferences, interference mitigation and computational load. As a conclusion, the proposed GSA solution is a promising candidate to maximize the utilization of the available WiMAX radio resources at a low computational cost while at the same time being able to fulfill a wide range of requirements based on operators' preferences and/or network environment specifics.
