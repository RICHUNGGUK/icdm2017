The EL-REP can be computed for one or more simple polygons of any kind: convex or nonconvex, with or without holes and even with several shells. A method for constructing this decomposition is described in detail, together with several of its main applications: fast point-in-polygon inclusion test, 2D location, triangulation of polygons, and collision detection.", "paper_title": "EL-REP: A New 2D Geometric Decomposition Scheme and Its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000293455600012"}
