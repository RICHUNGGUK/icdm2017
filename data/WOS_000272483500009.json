The pose of a biped robot is acquired from image information instead of different sensors, and this pose information is used for fuzzy controller to keep biped robot in a stable balanced condition. Initially, the camera mounted on the head of robot obtains the pose information of the target object while walking. We acquired corresponding points between characteristic features on the target object and CAD (Computer Aided Design) information in DB(Data Base) using SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) algorithm. Three arbitrary features from SURF algorithm are able to generate a virtual plane, which represent the geometric information of the target object's pose data. The camera pose information for the target object is calculated using pose information derived from the virtual planes. As the camera pose information is related to pose of a biped robot, we can easily get the pose information of a biped robot. With this the difference between current and desired pose of a biped robot is obtained. This difference is used as input data for the fuzzy controller. The fuzzy controller keeps the biped robot in stable pose using the recent pose and velocity of a biped robot. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been proven by the experiments performed on even floor using a mini humanoid robot.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Controller based Biped Robot Balance Control using 3D Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000272483500009"}
