Besides, energy efficiency has become a main design factor and, consequently, both performance and energy efficiency are primary goals in HPC designs. As a result, energy-efficient high-performance memory subsystem designs should be explored. In this paper, we extend the architecture of general-purpose processors by adding a software-managed local memory (LM) and a very simple programmable DMA controller. We demonstrate that with these extensions-together with efficient run-time management-we improve performance and energy consumption factors. We perform an LM design space exploration study for an Intel((R)) Pentium((R)) 4 platform: we analyze the performance, energy and energy-delay product for a total of 27 computational loops of the NAS benchmarks. We show a 1.2x performance speedup factor and an energy reduction of 6.21% on average when using a constrained 32 KB LM with commodity memory bandwidths (6.4 GB/s). More aggressive configurations (i.e. 256 KB LM + 12.8 GB/s) show at least 2.14x performance speedup factors and energy savings of 42.07% on average.", "paper_title": "Local Memory Design Space Exploration for High-Performance Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000290315200012"}
