It was validated by field tests reported in earlier publications. The model is based on a compartment modeling approach where the spray cloud is spatially partitioned into several compartments, with equal thickness but increasing cross section in the direction of application. The stability of the simulation curves depends concurrently on the compartment thickness (Delta x) and time step (Delta t) used. Simultaneously, the needed computer memory and computational time greatly depend on Delta t. In this application note, the influence of these two parameters on simulated airborne spray mass has been explored and a criterion for selecting a pair of them to optimize simulation output has been established. The criterion, Delta t = Delta x/u(a), establishes a strong relationship of these two parameters with sprayer air velocity, u(a), stressing the importance of u(a) in the model. The results provided critical understanding about the sensitivity of the model to the studied parameters and tend to be crucial for successful implementation of the model. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
