In this paper, we study one of the more general problems, known as LCP (largest common point set problem): Let P and Q be two point sets in R-3, and let epsilon >= 0 be a tolerance parameter, the problem is to find a rigid motion mu that maximizes the cardinality of subset I of Q, such that the Hausdorff distance dist(P, mu(I)) <= epsilon. We denote the size of the optimal solution to the above problem by LCP(P, Q). The problem is called exact-LCP for epsilon = 0, and tolerant-LCP when epsilon > 0 and the minimum interpoint distance is greater than epsilon. A beta-distance-approximation algorithm for tolerant-LCP finds a subset I subset of Q such that vertical bar I vertical bar >= LCP(P, Q) and dist(P, mu(I)) <= beta epsilon for some beta >= 1. This paper has three main contributions. (1) We introduce a new algorithm, called T-hashing, which gives the fastest known deterministic 4-distance-approximation algorithm for tolerant-LCP. (2) For the exact-LCP, when the matched set is required to be large, we give a simple sampling strategy that improves the running times of all known deterministic algorithms, yielding the fastest known deterministic algorithm for this problem. (3) We use expander graphs to speed-up the T-hashing algorithm for tolerant-LCP when the size of the matched set is required to be large, at the expense of approximation in the matched set size. Our algorithms also work when the transformation mu is allowed to be scaling transformation.", "paper_title": "An efficient approximation algorithm for point pattern matching under noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100030"}
