Combining semantic web technologies (SWT) and elements of grid computing (GC), we have designed a distributed architecture of intelligent nodes, which are called power grid distributed nodes (PGDINs). This distributed architecture supports the majority of the grid management activities in an intelligent and collaborative way by means of distributed processing of semantic data. A node collaborative scheme is defined based on logical states that each node presents according to the events occurring in the grid. A specific BPEL business-workflow is formally defined for each logical state, based on the node's knowledge base (an electrical model) and the distributed data. The introduced core workflows allow the potential grid behavior to be predefined when a business requirement is triggered. Thus, this approach supports the grid to react and reach over again a stable state, which is defined as a working state that facilitates the provision of the required business tasks. We have validated our approach with the simulation of a well-known use case, the energy balancing verification, fed with real data from the Spanish electrical grid.", "paper_title": "Supporting Business Workflows in Smart Grids: An Intelligent Nodes-Based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900019"}
