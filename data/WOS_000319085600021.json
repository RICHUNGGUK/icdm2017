Taking advantage of converged input data value set as a precomputation concept, the proposed one-dimensional IDCT is a multiplierless hardware which differs from Loeffler architecture and has benefits of low complexity and low power consumption. The experimental results show that our design can reduce 85.2% energy consumption and 58.6% area. Various spectrum and spatial attacks are also tested to corroborate the robustness.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient IDCT Design for DS-CDMA Watermarking Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085600021"}
