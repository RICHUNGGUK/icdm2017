A key challenge is to infer information about geographic events from these observations. A systematic approach to the representation of domain knowledge is vital when reasoning about events due to heterogeneous observational sources. This article delivers a formal model capturing the relations between observations and events. The model is exploited with a rule-based mechanism to infer information about events from in-situ observations. The article also describes how the model's vocabularies are used to formulate spatiotemporal queries. A use case for reasoning about blizzard events based on real time series illustrates the formal model.", "paper_title": "A formal model to infer geographic events from sensor observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000350367900001"}
