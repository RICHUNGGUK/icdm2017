We prove that every 2-connected loopless plane graph has a strong parity vertex coloring with 9 7 colors. Moreover the coloring we construct is proper. This proves a conjecture of Czap and Jendrol' [Discuss. Math. Graph Theory 29 (2009), pp. 521-543.]. We also provide examples showing that eight colors may be necessary (ten when restricted to proper colorings).", "paper_title": "Strong parity vertex coloring of plane graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342623000009"}
