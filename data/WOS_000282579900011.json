Usually, these policies are designed using a series of data related to the studied units. All policies do not consider the effect of the environment where the components or systems operate. In this article, one of the most used policies, the age replacement policy, is also discussed taking into consideration the environmental effects using an innovative concept, introduced by Pham, called systemability. Several numerical examples are carried out in order to illustrate the aim of this work. The importance of environmental factors is also demonstrated thanks to the application to a real case.", "paper_title": "Age replacement policy in a random environment using systemability", "paper_id": "WOS:000282579900011"}
