Compared with other computation methods, the main advantage of this method is that it can find as many potential protein complexes as possible. Application on the Yeast genomic data highlights the efficiency of our method.", "paper_title": "Clustering protein interaction data through chaotic genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300108"}
