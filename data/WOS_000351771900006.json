However, if geo-oriented websites leave location-sensitive content in the browser cache, other sites can sniff that content via side channels. The authors' case studies demonstrate the reliability and power of geo-inference attacks, which can measure the timing of browser cache queries and track a victim's country, city, and neighborhood. Existing defenses cannot effectively prevent such attacks, and additional support is required for a better defense deployment.", "paper_title": "I Know Where You've Been Geo-Inference Attacks via the Browser Cache", "paper_id": "WOS:000351771900006"}
