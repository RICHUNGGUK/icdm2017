However, they always impact each other in various kinds of scenarios and it is necessary to study the optimization between them. This paper proposes algorithms to evaluate security level with three main features, i.e., authentication, data integrity and confidentiality. Based on that, a novel model is proposed to measure the interaction between delay of QoS and security in different application scenarios, heterogeneous users and disparate services. Furthermore, immune algorithm is used to get optimal parameters for both delay and the security level. Simulation results show that the proposed model can balance delay and security level well under diverse traffic loads of network. The model is useful to get better performance for network service, especially in rigorous network circumstance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
