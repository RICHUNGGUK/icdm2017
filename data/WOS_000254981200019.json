The fuzzy modeling techniques are used to represent the evaluating values by fuzzy numbers to increase the flexibility of the system. In other words, it allows an evaluator to express his/her evaluating valves by using fuzzy numbers to increase the flexibility of the system. An index of optimism lambda determined by the evaluator is used to indicate the degree of optimism of the evaluator for evaluating the answerscripts of the students, where lambda is an element of [0, 1]. The universe of discourse is formed by a set of satisfaction levels. The fuzzy mark awarded to the answer of each question of the answerscript of a student is represented by a type-2 fuzzy set. The proposed methods can overcome the drawbacks of the existing fuzzy evaluation methods. They can evaluate the answerscripts of students in a more flexible and more intelligent manner.", "paper_title": "Evaluating students' answerscripts based on extended fuzzy grade sheets", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981200019"}
