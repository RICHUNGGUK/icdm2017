For linear codes, a lower bound on the number of uncorrectable errors is derived. The bound for uncorrectable errors with a weight of half the minimum distance asymptotically coincides with the corresponding upper bound for Reed-Muller codes and random linear codes. For the first-order Reed-Muller codes, the number of correctable/ uncorrectable errors with a weight of half the minimum distance plus one is determined. This result is equivalent to deriving the number of Boolean functions of variables with nonlinearity 2(m-2) + 1. The monotone error structure and its related notions larger half and trial set, which were introduced by Helleseth, Klove, and Levenshtein, are mainly used to derive the results.", "paper_title": "On Correctable Errors of Binary Linear Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200001"}
