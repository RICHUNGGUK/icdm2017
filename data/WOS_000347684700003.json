The two-phase test sample sparse representation method (TPTSSR) achieved an excellent performance in face recognition. However, TPTSSR exploits the global information and tends to lose local information. In this paper, the weighted two phase test sample sparse representation method (WTPTSSR) is proposed. WTPTSSR utilizes both data locality and linearity and it can be regarded as extensions of TPTSSR. Experiments on the face databases demonstrate that WTPTSSR is more effective than TPTSSR.", "paper_title": "Face Recognition Via Weighted Two Phase Test Sample Sparse Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347684700003"}
