Gower's idea of pseudo-sample projection is exploited to recover the contribution of the initial variables to the final model and visualize those having the highest discriminant power. The results show that the proposed approach provides an efficient fault discrimination and enables a correct identification of the discriminant variables in the considered case studies.
