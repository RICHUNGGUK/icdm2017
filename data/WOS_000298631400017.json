We also develop some statistical indices to evaluate the reliability of controlling parking errors in a certain range. By comparing modeling errors, the subtractive clustering method other than grid partition method is chosen to generate an initial fuzzy system for ANFIS. Then, the collected TSP data from two railway stations are employed to identify the parameters of the proposed three models. The three models can make the average parking errors under an acceptable error, and tuning the parameters of the models is effective in dynamically reducing parking errors. Experiments in two stations indicate that, among the three models, (1) the linear model ranks the third in training and the second in testing, nevertheless, it can meet the required reliability for two stations, (2) the GRNN based model achieves the best performance in training, but the poorest one in testing due to overfitting, resulting in failing to meet the required reliability for the two stations, (3) the ANFIS based model obtains better performance than model 1 both in training and testing. After analyzing parking error characteristics and developing a parking strategy, finally, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ANFIS model in the real-world application. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.
