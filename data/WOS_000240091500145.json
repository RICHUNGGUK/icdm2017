Referential device is one of the important means for helping readers comprehend a text. The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-assisted environment to enhance EFL college students' comprehension. Four modules, natural language processing (NLP), user interface, recording, and feedback module are included. Among these four modules, the feedback module compares students' initial maps with the expert's. The results of comparison will inform students what referents are incorrect and offer them appropriate scaffoldings. The recording module records all of students' behavioral data. From the data, the teacher can identify the difficulties students encounter and different performance levels among students with various reading proficiencies.", "paper_title": "A computer-assisted environment on referential understanding to enhance academic reading comprehension", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500145"}
