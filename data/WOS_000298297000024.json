The proposed method is not only capable of finding inverses of full pentadiagonal matrices, but also of those with pentadiagonal envelope, such as tridiagonal matrices. The method is modified to generate an MPI algorithm. The speed-up performance of the parallelized algorithm is also analyzed on different cases.", "paper_title": "Parallel algorithm on inversion for adjacent pentadiagonal matrices with MPI", "paper_id": "WOS:000298297000024"}
