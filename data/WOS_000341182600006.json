As a result, human factors have gained attention in the software industry. Software Project Managers are decisive to achieve project success. A competent project manager is capable of solving any problem that an organization may encounter, regardless of its complexity. This paper presents I-Competere which is a tool developed to forecast competence gaps in key management personnel by predicting planning and scheduling competence levels. Based on applied intelligence techniques, I-Competere allows the forecast and anticipation of competence needs thus articulating personnel development tools and techniques. The results of the test, using several artificial neural networks, are more than promising and show prediction accuracy.", "paper_title": "I-Competere: Using applied intelligence in search of competency gaps in software project managers", "paper_id": "WOS:000341182600006"}
