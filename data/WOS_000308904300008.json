In this paper, we propose the development of an optimization framework integrated within a Geographical Information System (GIS) for addressing this specific problem. Our proposed modeling framework departs from well-known facility location coverage models by considering both the impact of walking distance from an individual residential location to a stop and the transit facility attractiveness (ease to cross, number of destinations served). Integration within a GIS environment is accomplished using a simulated annealing heuristic. An example on an inbound urban bus route illustrates the utility of the approach for transit planning, using model parameters developed in collaboration with local transit agencies.
