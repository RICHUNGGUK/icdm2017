Situational computing can be viewed as the pervasive computing paradigm that deals with situational context representation and reasoning. One important problem that arises in such paradigm is the imperfect observations (e.g., sensor readings) that lead to the estimation of the current user situation. Hence, the knowledge upon which the context/situation aware paradigm is built is rather vague. To deal with this shortcoming, we propose the use of Fuzzy Logic theory with the purpose of determining (inferring) and reasoning about the current situation of the involved user. We elaborate on the architectural model that enables the system to assume actions autonomously according to previous user reactions and current situation. The captured, imperfect contextual information is matched against pre-developed situation ontologies in order to approximately infer the current user context. Finally, we present a series of experimental results that provide evidence on the flexible, efficient nature of the proposed Situational computing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
