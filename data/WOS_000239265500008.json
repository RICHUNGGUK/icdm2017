The feedback controller designed is a sawtooth function of the system states, which can make the fixed point of the closed-loop system to be a snapback repeller, thereby yielding chaotic dynamics. Based on the Marotto theorem, it is proven theoretically that the closed-loop system is chaotic in the sense of Li and Yorke. Finally, the simulation results are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.", "paper_title": "Chaotifying the controllable linear system via single input state feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000239265500008"}
