The algorithmic model, inspired by and similar to the Law of Universal Gravitation, is derived from the vector geometric analysis of the linear classifier and established in the feature space. Based on this algorithmic model, we propose a classification method called vector gravitational recognition. The proposed method is applied to the benchmark Glass Identification task in the UCI Database available from USA Forensic Science Service, and other two UCI benchmark tasks. The experimental and comparative results show that the proposed approach yields quite good results and outperforms some well known and recent approaches on the tasks, and other applications may benefit from ours.", "paper_title": "A vector gravitational force model for classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000256324800005"}
