This problem is solved with a simple, yet powerful, modification of the so called ALVOT family of supervised classification algorithms with a novel differentiated-weighting scheme. Compared to other previously published approaches, the proposed method significantly reduces the number and complexity of the text-features to be extracted from the text. Also, the specific combination of line-level and word-level features used introduces an eclectic paradigm between texture-related and structure-related approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
