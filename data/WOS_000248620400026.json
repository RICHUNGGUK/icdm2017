We address the problem of identification of a seizure origin through an analysis of ictal electroencephalogram ( EEG), which is proven to be an effective standard in epileptic focus localization. Summary: With a goal of developing an automated and robust way of visual analysis of large amounts of EEG data, we propose a novel approach based on multiway models to study epilepsy seizure structure. Our contributions are 3-fold. First, we construct an Epilepsy Tensor with three modes, i.e. time samples, scales and electrodes, through wavelet analysis of multi-channel ictal EEG. Second, we demonstrate that multiway analysis techniques, in particular parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), provide promising results in modeling the complex structure of an epilepsy seizure, localizing a seizure origin and extracting artifacts. Third, we introduce an approach for removing artifacts using multilinear subspace analysis and discuss its merits and drawbacks. Results: Ictal EEG analysis of 10 seizures from 7 patients are included in this study. Our results for 8 seizures match with clinical observations in terms of seizure origin and extracted artifacts. On the other hand, for 2 of the seizures, seizure localization is not achieved using an initial trial of PARAFAC modeling. In these cases, first, we apply an artifact removal method and subsequently apply the PARAFAC model on the epilepsy tensor from which potential artifacts have been removed. This method successfully identifies the seizure origin in both cases.", "paper_title": "Multiway analysis of epilepsy tensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400026"}
