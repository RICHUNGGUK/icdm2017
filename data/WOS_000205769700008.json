It is with sensors that can discover other nodes or estimate ranges between nodes. that serve as position references. In this paper. we show that sensors acquire coarse-grain location awareness by the training protocol. The training protocol which hybrids the synchronization and training procedure. In this protocol, synchronization and training are combined into one scheme. The sink node sends two beacons in each slot instead of one. In the training, sensor searching for its location using a binary search scheme. Our simulation results shown less number of cycles needed for training", "paper_title": "Hybrid training with binary search protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000205769700008"}
