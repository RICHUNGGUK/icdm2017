The existing literature focuses on the Web security problem from the server-side perspective. In contrast, we explore it from the client-side, considering the major types of threats. After a short threat summary, we discuss related research and existing countermeasures. We then examine intuitive human-oriented trust models and posit a flexible, multilayer framework to facilitate automated client-side decision making. The proposed suggestions are not intrusive and do not require advanced technical knowledge from end users.
