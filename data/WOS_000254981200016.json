This is usually achieved based on the parametric and nonparametric density estimation approaches. The purpose of this paper is to develop two novel unified parametric and nonparametric ICA algorithms, which enable as to separate hybrid source signals including symmetric and asymmetric distributions with self-adaptive score functions. They are derived from the parameterized asymmetric generalized Gaussian density (AGGD) model and GGD kernel based generalized k-nearest neighbor (GKNN) nonparametric estimation. In the unified parametric AGGD ICA algorithm, the parameters of the score function is chosen adaptively by estimating the high order statistics of the separating signals, at the same time, the stability of the algorithm is proven. However, in the unified, nonparametric ICA algorithm, the parameters of the score function is chosen by the GGD kernel estimation based GKNN nonparametric method. Compared with conventional ICA algorithms, the two given methods can separate a wide range of source signals using only one unified density model separately. Simulations confirm the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Unified parametric and nonparametric ICA algorithms for hybrid source signals and stability analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981200016"}
