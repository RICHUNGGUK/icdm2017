Self-evolution of manufacturing systems means a continuous process of adapting to the environment on the basis of autonomous goal-formation and goal-oriented dynamic organization. This paper proposes a goal-regulation mechanism that applies a reinforcement learning approach, which is a principal working mechanism for autonomous goal-formation. Individual goals are regulated by a neural network-based fuzzy inference system, namely, a goal-regulation network (GRN) updated by a reinforcement signal from another neural network called goal-evaluation network (GEN). The GEN approximates the compatibility of goals with current environmental situation. In this paper, a production planning problem is also examined by a simulation study in order to validate the proposed goal regulation mechanism. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
