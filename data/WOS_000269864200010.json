Using united-residue model, we simulated the folding of a six-helix protein with a length of 120 amino acids (C-terminal domain of Ku86). The folding behaviors, structural topology and sequence repetition of this protein all suggest that it may have a two-fold quasi-repetition or symmetry in its sequence and structure. Therefore, we simulated the folding of its two halves (1-60 and 61-120 amino acids) and find that they can fold into native conformations independently. It is also found that their folding behaviors are very similar to other three-helix bundles. This suggests that this protein may be divided into two foldable halves. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
