Let L-I(epsilon) be the set of words u such that epsilon double right arrow(I)* u. We prove that the set I is unavoidable if and only if the relation double right arrow(I) *, is a well quasi-order on lthe set L-I(epsilon). This result generalizes a theorem of [Ehrenfeucht et al., Theor. Comput. Sci. 27 (1983) 311-332].
