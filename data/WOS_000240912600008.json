The main results pertain to the summand-wise nature of the dominance relation, when applied to ordinal sum conjunctors, and to the relationship between the idempotent elements of two conjunctors involved in a dominance relationship. The results are illustrated on some well-known parametric families of t-norms and copulas.", "paper_title": "On the dominance relation between ordinal sums of conjunctors", "paper_id": "WOS:000240912600008"}
