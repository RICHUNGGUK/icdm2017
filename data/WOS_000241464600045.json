In this paper, we propose a first order analytical modeling of the standard deviations of basic CMOS cell timings. The proposed model is then used to define a statistical characterization protocol which is fully compliant with standard characterization flows. Validation of this protocol is given for a 90nm process.", "paper_title": "Statistical characterization of library timing performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600045"}
