This confidence estimation provides a diagnosis module with precise reported information to quickly identify the origin of equipment failure. We studied the factors affecting CLFI, such as measurement system reliability, production context, position of sensors in the acquisition chains, type of products, reference metrology, preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance based on historical data and feedback information generated by production equipments. We introduced the new 'CLFI' concept based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network approach and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes model. Our contribution includes an on-line confidence computation module for production equipment data, and an algorithm to compute CLFI. We suggest it to be applied to the semiconductor manufacturing industry. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
