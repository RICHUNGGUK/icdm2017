The relay is assumed to either possess perfect channel state information or have a fixed gain. The performance of the considered system is affected by the combined effects of atmospheric turbulence-induced fading, pointing errors (i.e., misalignment fading), and path loss. Atmospheric turbulence conditions are modeled using the gamma-gamma distribution. For the system under consideration, accurate analytical approximations as well as upper bounds to the ergodic capacity are derived. In addition, bound approximations in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime are deduced that provide valuable insights into the impact of model parameters on the capacity of AF FSO dual-hop relaying systems. Numerically evaluated and computer simulation results are further provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed mathematical analysis.", "paper_title": "Capacity Analysis of Dual Amplify-and-Forward Relayed Free-Space Optical Communication Systems Over Turbulence Channels With Pointing Errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000325168400010"}
