The transmitter, the legitimate receiver, and the eavesdropper are connected by a discrete memoryless wiretap channel with a memoryless state sequence. The transmitter and the legitimate receiver generate a secret-key that must be concealed from the eavesdropper. We assume that the state sequence is known noncausally to the transmitter and no public discussion channel is available. We derive lower and upper bounds on the secret-key capacity. The lower bound involves a source-channel codebook for constructing a common reconstruction sequence at the legitimate terminals and then mapping this sequence to a secret-key using a secret-key codebook. For the special case of Gaussian channels with additive interference (secret-keys from dirty paper channel) our bounds differ by 0.5 bit/symbol and coincide in the high signal-to-noise-ratio and high interference-to-noise-ratio regimes. In another special case-symmetric channel state information (CSI)-when the legitimate receiver is also revealed the state sequence, we establish optimality of our lower bound. In addition, only causal side information at the transmitter and the receiver suffices to attain the secret-key capacity in the case of symmetric CSI.", "paper_title": "Secret-Key Agreement With Channel State Information at the Transmitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000293924000016"}
