This paper provides an analytical solution method for the FWA based on the conclusions of the Karnik-Mendel (KM) algorithm. Compared with the two current popular kinds of a-cut based computational methods for the FWA (mathematical programming transformations and direct iterate computations), our method is precise, and, has a concise structure, efficient computation process, and sound theoretical proofs. We propose two algorithms for computing the analytical solution of the FWA. Two numerical examples illustrate our proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
