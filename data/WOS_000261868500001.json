All of our simulation is developed in SIMULINK, MATLAB 7. Our results showed that (1) increased supplementary motor area output increases the rigidity and (2) rigidity and the tremor are correlated. Therefore, from our model it can be suggested that the simultaneous treatment of these two abnormal motor behaviors could be more beneficial. Experimental studies are needed to validate this computational model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
