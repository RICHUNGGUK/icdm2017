Furthermore, those policies must be robust to signal noise or unexpected situations, scalable to more complex environments, and account for the physical limitations of the robots (e.g., limited battery power and computational power). In this paper we evaluate reactive and learning navigation algorithms for exploration robots that must avoid obstacles and reach specific destinations in limited time and with limited observations. Our results show that neuro-evolutionary algorithms with well-designed evaluation functions can produce up to 50% better performance than reactive algorithms in complex domains where the robot's goals are to select paths that lead to seek specific destinations while avoiding obstacles, particularly when facing significant sensor and actuator signal noise.
