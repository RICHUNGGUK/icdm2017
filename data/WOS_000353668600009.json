In order tninfect host cells, this Virus. fuses its membrane with the host membrane in a process mediated by the glycoptotein hemaggluthiin. During fusion, the N terminal region of hemagglutinin, which is known as the fusion peptide (FP), inserts into the host inernbrane, promoting lipid mixing between the viral and host, membranes. Therefore, this peptide plays a key role in the fusion process, but the exact mechanism by-which it promotes lipid mixing is still unclear. To shed light into this matter, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the influenza Fp environments (water, dodecylphosphotholine (DPC) micelles, and a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) membrane) While in pure water the peptide lost its initial secondary structure, in simulations performed in the presence of DPC micelles it remained stable, in agreement with previous experimental observations. In simulations performed in the,presence of a preassembled DMPC bilayer, the peptide became unstructured and was unable to insert into the membrane as a: result of technical limitations of the method used. To overcome this problem, we used a self-assembly strategy, assembling the membrane together with the peptide. These simulations revealed that the peptide can adopt a membrane-spanning conformation, which had not been predicted by previous mp simulation studies. The peptide insertion had a strong effect on thermembrane, lowering the bilayer thickness, disordering nearby lipids, and promoting lipid tail protrusion. These results contribute to a better understanding of the role of the FP in the fusion process.", "paper_title": "Self-Assembly Molecular Dynamics Simulations Shed Light into the Interaction of the Influenza Fusion Peptide with a Membrane Bilayer", "paper_id": "WOS:000353668600009"}
