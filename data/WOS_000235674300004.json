All servers in the first queue work at rate mu(1) and all in the second work at rate mu(2). A new arrival is routed to the system with the lesser number of customers. If both queues have equal occupancy, the arrival joins the first queue with probability v(1), and the second with probability v(2) = 1 - v(1). We analyze this model asymptotically. We assume that the arrival rate. is large compared to the two service rates. We give several different asymptotic formulas, that apply for different ranges of the state space. The numerical accuracy of the asymptotic results is tested.", "paper_title": "On the infinite server shortest queue problem: Non-symmetric case", "paper_id": "WOS:000235674300004"}
