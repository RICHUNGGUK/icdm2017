The modeling framework shows that an effective energy-efficient operation depends on the planning decisions. Conversely, it also shows that planning with energy management operation in view yields more versatile topologies than more traditional models based only on Capex. Results for LTE networks are provided and show that savings up to 65% in energy expenses are possible with slight increases in capital investments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
