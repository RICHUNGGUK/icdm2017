During the experiment, 46 participants were asked to leave their finger pressed on a touch panel and to inform the experimenter when perceiving a vibration. This work allowed identifying the minimum perceptual thresholds of haptic signals for 95% of a representative population, on a given vibration range. This study also particularly revealed perception differences depending on waveform. Finally, it provides significant results regarding the effect of sex on perceptual sensations: Female participants tend to get lower perceptual thresholds.", "paper_title": "Haptics on a Touch Screen: Characterization of Perceptual Thresholds", "paper_id": "WOS:000342443300004"}
