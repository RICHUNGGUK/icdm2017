The proposed approach is based on linear matrix inequalities and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, where a new fuzzy weighting-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is introduced. By employing the Gu discretization technique and strategies to add slack matrix variables, less conservative conditions are obtained. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "On Stability and Stabilization of T-S Fuzzy Time-Delayed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272319000017"}
