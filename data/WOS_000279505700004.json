Motivated by multi-view learning algorithms, multi-modality features of videos can be represented by multiple graphs. And the graph-based semi-supervised learning methods can be extended to multiple graphs to predict the semantic labels for unlabeled video data. However, traditional graphs represent only homogeneous pairwise linking relations, and therefore the high-order correlations inherent in videos, such as high-order visual similarities, are ignored. In this paper we represent heterogeneous features by multiple hypergraphs and then the high-order correlated samples can be associated with hyperedges. Furthermore, the multi-hypergraph ranking (MHR) algorithm is proposed by defining Markov random walk on each hypergraph and then forming the mixture Markov chains so as to perform transductive learning in multiple hypergraphs. In experiments on the TRECVID dataset, a triple-hypergraph consisting of visual, textual features and multiple labeled tags is constructed to predict concept labels for unlabeled video shots by the MHR framework. Experimental results show that our approach is effective.", "paper_title": "Multiple hypergraph ranking for video concept detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000279505700004"}
