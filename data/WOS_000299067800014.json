This paper presents a numerical model for the analysis and prediction of the ground vibrations due to the road traffic. A car model with four degrees of freedom is used for the determination of the load due to the road traffic. The load is then introduced in a 3D finite difference model for the determination of the traffic-induced ground vibrations. The numerical model is validated using field data. Numerical analyses show that both the amplitude and frequency of the traffic-induced vibrations are mainly affected by the vehicle speed, the road unevenness and the vehicle suspension system. Some recommendations are suggested for the reduction of these vibrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
