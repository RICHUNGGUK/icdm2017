Many practical and theoretical issues have been presented in the literature, showing good performance of this technique. The present work deals with one of the most relevant aspects of any controller, namely, the steady-state operation. As will be shown, basic FCS-MPC formulations can be enhanced to achieve a reduced average steady-state error. As an illustrative example, we apply our proposal to a simple H-Bridge power converter. Experimental results were carried out to verify the performance obtained by the proposed predictive strategies.", "paper_title": "Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Control With Improved Steady-State Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700009"}
