We consider two undirected models of random graphs: random geometric graphs and random proximity graphs for which sharp connectivity thresholds have been shown. We are interested in a.a.s. connected graphs close just above the connectivity threshold. For such subfamilies of random graphs we show that the distant-2-chromatic number is Theta (log n) with high probability. The result on random geometric graphs is extended to the random sector graphs defined in [J. Diaz, J. Petit, M. Serna.
