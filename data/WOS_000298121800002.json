The extensions of the concepts in incomplete information table are represented by interval sets, which regulate the upper and lower bounds of the uncertain concepts. Interval set operations are discussed, and the connectives of concepts are represented by the operations on interval sets. Certain inclusion, possible inclusion, and weak inclusion relations between interval sets are presented, which are introduced to induce strong rules and weak rules from incomplete information table. The related properties of the inclusion relations are proved. It is concluded that the strong rules are always true whatever the missing values may be, while the weak rules may be true when missing values are replaced by some certain known values. Moreover, a confidence function is defined to evaluate the weak rule. The proposed approach presents a new view on rule induction from incomplete data based on interval set. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
