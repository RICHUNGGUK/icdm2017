Design/methodology/approach - Both exploratory and confirmatory modes of research using exploratory factor analysis, total interpretive structure modeling, and t-test techniques have been conducted. Findings - In the context of effective strategy execution, the organization support system has most driving power affecting appropriateness of other automate systems. On the other hand, the effective design and deployment of control and monitoring system dependent on other systems. The control and monitoring directly affects the success of strategy execution while the other systems affect execution through structural mediation suggested by the proposed model. Research limitations/implications - Though this study adopts multiple research methods, a comparatively large sample size would be more useful. The study also faces subjective limitation of the research context. There is possibility of participant's biases while responding to five-point scale questionnaire. Practical implications - The driving-dependence linkages among the automate systems helps in developing appropriate managerial action plan to convert strategic goals into the results. The model helps in institutionalizing the systems as well as making them effective while linking them in structured relationship. Additionally, the integrated understanding of the automate systems helps promote a sense of purpose and shared meaning of systems among the key stakeholders, which smoothen the execution process. Originality/value - This study reviews and factorize different automate systems and identifies structured linkages among them to demonstrate the relative criticality of each systems and how effective development of one system leads to the effectiveness of other system. This study also adds methodological value extending triangulation along with the interpretative tool.", "paper_title": "Modeling organizational and information systems for effective strategy execution", "paper_id": "WOS:000357393800004"}
