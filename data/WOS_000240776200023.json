Limited by the mosaic sampling pattern of the color filter array (CFA), color artifacts may occur in a demosaicked image in areas of high-frequency and/or sharp color transition structures. However, a color digital video camera captures a sequence of mosaic images and the temporal dimension of the color signals provides a rich source of information about the scene via camera and object motions. This paper proposes an inter-frame demosaicking approach to take advantage of all three forms of pixel correlations: spatial, spectral, and temporal. By motion estimation and statistical data fusion between adjacent mosaic frames, the new approach can remove much of the color artifacts that survive intra-frame demosaicking and also improve tone reproduction accuracy. Empirical results show that the proposed inter-frame demosaicking approach consistently outperforms its intra-frame counterparts both in peak signal-to-noise measure and subjective visual quality.", "paper_title": "Improvement of color video demosaicking in temporal domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776200023"}
