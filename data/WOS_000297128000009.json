In this problem, the objective is to characterise subgroups of patients according to their time of arrival at the emergency department. To solve this problem, several subgroup discovery algorithms have been applied to determine which of them obtains better results. The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm MESDIF for the extraction of fuzzy rules obtains better results and so it has been used to extract interesting information regarding the rate of admission to the psychiatric emergency department.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary fuzzy rule extraction for subgroup discovery in a psychiatric emergency department", "paper_id": "WOS:000297128000009"}
