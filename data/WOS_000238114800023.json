We have developed a simulation model to compare this algorithm with two popular algorithms: the least-loaded algorithm and the most-loaded algorithm. We show that our algorithm, which we call the non-mixing algorithm, performs significantly better than the two existing algorithms by accommodating more streams thereby lowering the blocking probabilities under a range of assum-ptions of peak concurrent usage rate and percentage of HD streams. Using computer simulation we found that the non-mixing algorithm leads to an average of 4.39% higher allowed peak usage rate than the least-loaded and most-loaded algorithms.", "paper_title": "VoD QAM resource allocation algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800023"}
