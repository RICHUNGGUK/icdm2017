However, it is difficult for service requesters to discover satisfactory web services. The reason for this phenomenon is that the traditional service organization mode lacks semantic understanding ability for service function interface. This paper proposes a novel approach to annotating web services. We first adopt domain ontology as a semantic context, and give our general framework of service semantic annotation. Then, interface concept mapping algorithm and service interface expansion algorithm are respectively presented in detail. Finally, the generation process of semantic web service repository is presented based on preceding algorithms. Simulation experiment results demonstrate that annotated web services by the proposed method can more satisfy requirements for service requesters than traditional ones by service matchmaking engine. It can get better service discovery effectiveness.", "paper_title": "A novel approach to annotating web service based on interface concept mapping and semantic expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000289438200011"}
