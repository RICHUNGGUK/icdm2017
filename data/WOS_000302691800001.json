Based on significant empirical evidence of over 100,000 transmissions over each link in 802.15.4 and 802.11 testbeds, we propose two metrics, expected future transmissions (EFT) and MAC(3), for runtime estimation of bursty wireless links. We introduce a bursty link estimator (BLE) that based on these two metrics, accurately estimates bursty links in the network rendering them available for data transmissions. Finally, we present bursty routing extensions (BRE): an adaptive routing strategy that uses BLE for forwarding packets over bursty links if they offer better routing progress than long-term stable links. Our evaluation, comprising experimental data from widely used IEEE 802.15.4-based testbeds, reveals an average of 19% and a maximum of 42% reduction in the number of transmissions when routing over long-range bursty links typically ignored by routing protocols. Additionally, we show that both BLE and BRE are not tied to any specific routing protocol and integrate seamlessly with existing routing protocols and link estimators.", "paper_title": "Exploiting the Burstiness of Intermediate-Quality Wireless Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000302691800001"}
