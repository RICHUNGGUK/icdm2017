This article develops asymptotically valid confidence intervals for quantiles estimated via simulation using variance-reduction techniques (VRTs). We establish our results within a general framework for VRTs, which we show includes importance sampling, stratified sampling, antithetic variates, and control variates. Our method for verifying asymptotic validity is to first demonstrate that a quantile estimator obtained via a VRT within our framework satisfies a Bahadur-Ghosh representation. We then exploit this to show that the quantile estimator obeys a central limit theorem (CLT) and to develop a consistent estimator for the variance constant appearing in the CLT, which enables us to construct a confidence interval. We provide explicit formulae for the estimators for each of the VRTs considered.", "paper_title": "Confidence Intervals for Quantiles When Applying Variance-Reduction Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000302131400004"}
