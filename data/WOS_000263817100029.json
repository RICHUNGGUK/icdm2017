Automatic scene detection of a long video stream file is hence the first and crucial step toward a concise and comprehensive content-based representation for indexing, browsing and retrieval purposes. In this paper, we present a novel scene detection scheme for various video types. We first detect video shot using a coarse-to-fine algorithm. The key frames without useful information are detected and removed using template matching. Spatio-temporal coherent shots are then grouped into the same scene based on the temporal constraint of video content and visual similarity of shot activity. The proposed algorithm has been performed on various types of videos containing movie and TV program. Promising experimental results shows that the proposed method makes sense to efficient retrieval of video contents of interest. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
