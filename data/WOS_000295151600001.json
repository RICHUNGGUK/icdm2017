A Tabu search based approach is used for topology generation with an automated design technique, incorporating floorplan information to attain accurate values for power consumption of the routers and physical links. The Tabu search method incorporates multiple objectives and is able to generate optimal NoC topologies which account for both power and performance. The contention analysis technique assesses performance and relieves any potential bottlenecks using virtual channel insertion after considering its effect on power consumption and performance improvement within the NoC. The contention analyzer uses a Layered Queuing Network approach to model the rendezvous interactions among system components. Several experiments are conducted using various SoC benchmark applications to compare the power and performance outcomes of the proposed technique. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
