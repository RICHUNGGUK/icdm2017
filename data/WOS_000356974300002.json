In this paper, we first present a sharp lower bound on the harmonic index of unicyclic conjugated graphs (unicyclic graphs with a perfect matching). Also a sharp lower bound on the harmonic index of unicyclic graphs is given in terms of the order and given size of matching.", "paper_title": "On the Harmonic Index of Unicyclic Conjugated Molecules", "paper_id": "WOS:000356974300002"}
