The objective is not only to shift the bandwidth burden to end participating peers, but also to move the computation load for adapting video contents away from dedicated media-streaming/adaptation servers. It is an initiative to merge the adaptation operations and the P2P streaming basics to support the expansion of context-aware mobile P2P systems. DAg-stream organizes mobile and heterogeneous peers into overlays. For each video, a separate overlay is formed. No control message is exchanged among peers for overlay maintenance. We present a combination of infrastructure-centric and application end-point architecture. The infrastructure-centric architecture refers to a tree controller, named DAg-master, which is responsible for tree/overlay administering and maintenance. The application end-point architecture refers to video sharing, streaming and adaptation by the participating resourceful peers. The motivation for this work is based on the experiences and lessons learned so far about developing a video adaptation system for heterogeneous devices. In this article, we present our architecture and some experimental evaluations supporting the design concept for overlay video streaming and online adaptation.", "paper_title": "DAg-stream: Distributed video adaptation for overlay streaming to heterogeneous devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000284091500003"}
