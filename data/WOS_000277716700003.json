In this study, numerical layout optimization techniques are used to demonstrate that when a standard material with equal tension and compressive strength is involved, a simple parabolic arch rib is not the true optimum structure. Instead, a considerably more complex structural form, comprising a central parabolic section and networks of truss bars in the haunch regions, is found to possess a lower structural volume.", "paper_title": "Optimum structure to carry a uniform load between pinned supports", "paper_id": "WOS:000277716700003"}
