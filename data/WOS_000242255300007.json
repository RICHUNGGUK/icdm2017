The sampled and continuous measurements are represented using the integral measurement model with discontinuous measure. The obtained optimal filter is also in, the integral form with a discontinuous measure. The discontinuity of the measurements leads to jumps in the optimal state estimate and the estimation, error covariance matrix. These jumps can be explicitly calculated using the theory of vibrosolutions. The derived optimal filter is applicable to a wide range of practical problems; including the case of multirate and randomly sampled measurements. Under additional assumptions, the reported result is reduced to several classical filters. For a, simple example, the optimal and the previously reported suboptimal filters are compared using Monte-Carlo simulations.", "paper_title": "Optimal state estimation for continuous stochastic state-space system with hybrid measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255300007"}
