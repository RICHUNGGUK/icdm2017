Since the early 1980s, its use has been investigated in various frameworks. We propose a general model for recommendation-based argumentation by extending Dung's seminal argumentation system. This approach is applied to analyse argumentation on food quality in a public health policy. Cereal products, and more specifically bread, are used by decision makers as a healthy lever to fight against diseases such as obesity or diabetes. Our model outputs new recommendations based on stakeholder's argumentation by targeting some specific audiences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
