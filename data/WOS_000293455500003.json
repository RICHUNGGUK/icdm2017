A preliminary experiment first examines the possible confounds of visual magnification and grip force. Results show that micromanipulation precision is not affected by grip force in both naive and experienced subjects. On the other hand, precision is increased by visual magnification of up to 10x, but not further for larger magnifications. The main experiment required subjects to perform small-range point-to-point movements in 3D space in an unstable environment which amplified position errors to the straight line between start and end point. After having trained in this environment, subjects performing in the free conditions show an increase in success rate and a decrease in error and its standard deviation relative to the control subjects. This suggests that this technique can improve accuracy and reliability of movements during micromanipulation.", "paper_title": "Effect of Grip Force and Training in Unstable Dynamics on Micromanipulation Accuracy", "paper_id": "WOS:000293455500003"}
