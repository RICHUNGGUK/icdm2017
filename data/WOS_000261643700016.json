But the reconstruction of 3-D heat source is very complicated and difficult. just from the surface temperature data, the 3-D distribution of heat and temperature for organisms can be reconstructed by solving Pennes' bio-heat equation with the Monte Carlo method in this paper. In detail, the inverse problem of bio-heat conduction can be solved with the Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on hierarchical Bayesian models, and the 3-D distribution of heat and temperature can be reconstructed through the Monte Carlo method of fixed random walk.
