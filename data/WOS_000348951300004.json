We show that a complex Lipschitz map is analytic in an open set if and only if its L-derivative is a singleton at all points in the open set. The calculus of the L-derivative for sum, product and composition of maps is derived. The notion of contour integration is extended to Scott continuous, non-empty compact, convex valued functions on the complex plane, and by using the L-derivative, the fundamental theorem of contour integration is extended to these functions.
