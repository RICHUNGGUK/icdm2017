However, few studies have been conducted for the hydraulic machinery to calculate dynamic stresses caused by the unsteady hydraulic load. The present paper aims to analyse the stresses in blades of a Kaplan turbine. Design/methodology/approach - By employing a partially coupled solution of 3D unsteady flow through its flow passage, the dynamic interaction problem of the blades was analyzed. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the SST kappa-omega turbulence model were solved to model the flow within the entire flow path of the Kaplan turbine. The time-dependent hydraulic forces on the blades were used as the boundary condition for the dynamics problem for blades. Findings - The results showed that the dynamic stress in the blade is low under approximately optimum operating conditions and is high under low-output conditions with a small guide vane opening, a small blade angle and a high head. Research limitations/implications - It is assumed that there is no feedback of blade motion on the flow. Self-excited oscillations are beyond the scope of the present paper. Originality/value - The authors developed a code to transfer the pressure on blades as a boundary condition for structure analysis without any interpolation. The study indicates that the prediction of dynamic stress during the design stage is possible. To ensure the safety of the blades it is recommended to check the safety coefficient during the design stage for at least two conditions: the 100 percent output with lower head and the 50 percent output with the highest head.", "paper_title": "Analysis of dynamic stresses in Kaplan turbine blades", "paper_id": "WOS:000251013300007"}
