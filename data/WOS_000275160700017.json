These problems have important applications, e.g., in automatic graph drawing and computational biology. We present a new polyhedral approach to the quadratic linear ordering problem that is based on a linearization of the quadratic objective function. Our main result is a reformulation of the 3-dicycle inequalities using quadratic terms. After linearization, the resulting constraints are shown to be face-inducing for the polytope corresponding to the unconstrained quadratic problem. We use this result both within a branch-and-cut algorithm and within a branch-and-bound algorithm based on semidefinite programming. Experimental results for bipartite crossing minimization show that this approach clearly outperforms other methods.", "paper_title": "Exact Algorithms for the Quadratic Linear Ordering Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000275160700017"}
