In this paper focus is on deblurring that is considered as an inverse problem. It becomes ill-posed when noise contaminates the blurry image. Hence the problem is very sensitive to small perturbation in data. Conventionally, smoothness constraints are considered as a remedy to cater the sensitivity of the problem. In this paper, fuzzy rule based regularization parameter estimation is proposed with quadratic functional smoothness constraint. For deblurring image in the presence of noise, a constrained least square error function is minimized by the steepest descent algorithm. Visual results and quantitative measurements show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed technique compared to the state of the art and recently proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Estimation and optimization based ill-posed inverse restoration using fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000333209300022"}
