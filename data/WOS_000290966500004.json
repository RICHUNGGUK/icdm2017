Three local pattern search (PS) methods, simulated annealing and threshold acceptance were combined with BRGNN in the form of a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). The results obtained revealed that PS is a suitable method for improving the ability of BRGNN to break out from the local minima. The proposed HGA technique is able to retrieve important variables from complex systems and nonlinear search spaces for optimisation. Two models with 8-3-1 artificial neural network (ANN) architectures were developed for describing 47 and 41 modulatory activities of integrin antagonists. Monte Carlo cross-validation was performed to validate the models and Q2 values of 0.75 and 0.74 were obtained for 47 and 41 inhibitory activities, respectively. The scrambling technique was used for sensitivity analysis of descriptors appearing in ANN models. Frequencies of repetition and sensitivity analysis of molecular descriptors revealed that 3D-Morse descriptors are influential factors for describing 47 inhibitory activity, while in the case of 41 inhibitory activity, the Randic shape index, the lowest eigenvalue of the Burden matrix and the number of rotatable bonds are important parameters.", "paper_title": "QSAR modelling of integrin antagonists using enhanced Bayesian regularised genetic neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290966500004"}
