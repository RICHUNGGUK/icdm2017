Two novelties of this method are the simultaneous exploitation of intensity and edge information for detecting the eye state as well as the record of the patterns of eyelids before closing for tracking the reopened eyes. Experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
