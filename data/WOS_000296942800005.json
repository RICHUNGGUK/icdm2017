IE and content analysis together enhance the rigor of qualitative research through computer based content analysis. We use CAINES to illustrate an effective application of IF and computer aided content analysis on eWOM reviews. CAINES is a system based on linguistic techniques that can extract and analyze online movie reviews. In this research we demonstrate how CAINES is able to analyze the most important factor a moviegoer considers when rating a movie online. CAINES extracted and analyzed movie reviews from 18 action and adventure movies consisting of 20,679 individual reviews. By using CAINES we were able to show that storylinc is most important to moviegoers and they tend to leave more positive than negative reviews. Our results also reveal that reviewers mainly discuss their personal evaluation of the movie, rather than discouraging or encouraging readers to see the movie.", "paper_title": "A COMPUTER AIDED CONTENT ANALYSIS OF ONLINE REVIEWS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296942800005"}
