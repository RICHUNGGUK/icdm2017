A general optimization procedure is outlined including derivation of design sensitivities for the case when the mass density and stiffness vary in time. The outlined optimization procedure is exemplified on a 1D wave propagation problem in which a single gaussian pulse is compressed when propagating through the optimized structure. Special emphasis is put on the use of a time-discontinuous Galerkin integration scheme that facilitates analysis of a system with a time-varying mass matrix.", "paper_title": "Optimization of space-time material layout for 1D wave propagation with varying mass and stiffness parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000286921200002"}
