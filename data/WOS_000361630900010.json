This paper, considers four conflicting objectives, namely minimizing task transfer time, task execution cost, power consumption, and task queue length, to develop a comprehensive multi-objective optimization model for task scheduling. This model reduces costs from both the customer and provider perspectives by considering execution and power cost. We evaluate our model by applying two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). To implement the proposed model, we extend the Cloudsim toolkit by using MOPSO and MOGA as its task scheduling algorithms which determine the optimal task arrangement among VMs. The simulation results show that the proposed multi-objective model finds optimal trade-off solutions amongst the four conflicting objectives, which significantly reduces the job response time and makespan. This model not only increases QoS but also decreases the cost to providers. From our experimentation results, we find that MOPSO is a faster and more accurate evolutionary algorithm than MOGA for solving such problems.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary algorithm-based multi-objective task scheduling optimization model in cloud environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000361630900010"}
