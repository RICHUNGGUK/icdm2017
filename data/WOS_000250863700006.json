This processor has a pipelined processing architecture and features coarse-grained instructions that are based on the data formats of the telecommunication packet. Using this processor, target applications can be implemented within a short working period without degrading the processing performance. We implemented a prototype system to evaluate its packet propagation delay and packet forwarding performance. The measured results suggest that the architecture is useful for packet processing on high-speed telecommunication networks.", "paper_title": "Network processor for high-speed network and quick programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000250863700006"}
