We propose a new unsupervised learning algorithm to annotate groups of nouns with hypernym labels. Several variations of the algorithm are presented, including a method that utilizes semantic information from WordNet. The algorithm's results are compared against an independently-developed labeling method. The evaluation is performed using labels assigned to noun clusters by several participants of a specially designed human study.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised Labeling of noun clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000239589600024"}
