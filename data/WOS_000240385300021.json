In the proposed scheme, system working environment is learned and the environmental context is identified. Then the group of classifiers that are most likely to produce accurate output is generated for each environmental context. Then the decision of fusion of more than one classifiers or selecting best classifier is made using proposed t-test decision model. The proposed t-test decision model ensures the reliability of fusion. The proposed scheme has been tested in area of face recognition using standard FERET database, taking illumination as an environmental context. Experimental result showed that using context awareness and t-test decision model in classifier combination provides robustness to varying environmental conditions.", "paper_title": "Context-awareness based adaptive classifier combination for object recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300021"}
