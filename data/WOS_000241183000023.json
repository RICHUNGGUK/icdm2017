We focus on the particular class of equidistant filters and provide improved lower bounds on the linear complexity of the filtered sequences. This is achieved by first considering and proving properties of generalised Vandermonde determinants. Furthermore, it is shown that the methodology developed can be used for studying properties of any nonlinear filter.", "paper_title": "Lower bounds on sequence complexity via generalised Vandermonde determinants", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000023"}
