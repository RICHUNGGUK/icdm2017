This paper proposes a blind blur estimation technique based on the low rank approximation of cepstrum. The key idea that this paper presents is that the blur functions usually have low ranks when compared with ranks of real images and can be estimated from cepstrum of degraded images. We extend this idea and propose a general framework for estimation of any type of blur. We show that the proposed technique can correctly estimate commonly used blur types both in noiseless and noisy cases. Experimental results for a wide variety of conditions i.e., when images have low resolution, large blur support, and low signal-to-noise ratio, have been presented to validate our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Blind blur estimation using low rank approximation of cepstrum", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700009"}
