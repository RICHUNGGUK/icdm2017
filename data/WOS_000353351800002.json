However, most leading middleware solutions provide only limited resource matching and selection functionality. When significant amounts of resources are available, selecting the appropriate resources becomes challenging and time-consuming. This paper addresses the growing issues of resource matching and selection in IoT solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel resource model to describe the IoT resources in a multidimensional manner. Based on the resource model, a resource matching algorithm that selects the well-matched resources by matching the similarity between resources is proposed. Moreover, we constructed a combined resource set and used it and OWLS-TC to evaluate our work comprehensively. Experimental results show that the proposed resource matching approach is more effective and efficient than existing approaches.
