This approach avoids explicitly modeling scenes by replacing the modeling phase with an object reconstruction phase. Reconstruction is achieved in two possible ways: recovering 3=D point locations using multiview stereo techniques, or reasoning about consistency of each voxel in a discretized object volume space. The most challenging problem for image-based reconstruction is the presence of occlusions. Occlusions make reconstruction ambiguous for object parts not visible in any input image. These parts must be reconstructed in a visually acceptable way. This paper both reviews image inpainting and argues that inpainting can provide not only attractive reconstruction but also a framework for increasing the accuracy of depth recovery. Digital image inpainting refers,to any methods that fill-in holes of arbitrary topology in images so that they seem to be a part of the original image. Available methods are broadly classified as structural inpainting or textural inpainting. Structural inpainting reconstructs using prior assumptions and boundary conditions, while textural inpainting considers only the available data from texture exemplars or other templates. Of particular interest is research on structural inpainting applied to 3-D models, emphasizing its effectiveness for disocclusion.", "paper_title": "Review and preview: Disocclusion by inpainting for image-based rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000247644800009"}
