To handle both the single-source and the multiple-source problem in the same way, especially the problems with dense arcs, a deterministic annealing algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is derived from an application of the Lagrange and Hopfield-type barrier function. It consists of two major steps: one is to find a feasible descent direction by updating Lagrange multipliers with a globally convergent iterative procedure, which forms the major contribution of this paper, and the other is to generate a point in the feasible descent direction, which always automatically satisfies lower and upper bound constraints on variables provided that the step size is a number between zero and one. The algorithm is applicable to both the single-source and the multiple-source capacitated problem and is especially effective and efficient for the problems with dense arcs. Numerical results on 48 test problems show that the algorithm is effective and efficient. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
