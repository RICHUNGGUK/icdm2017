Although the approaches developed achieved high detection rate. they did so with a relatively high rate of false alarm. We now present a clustering query results based approach. This approach supports a higher precision. i.e.. lower false alarm rate, with only a modest compromise on detection rate. namely recall.", "paper_title": "Detection using clustering query results", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800083"}
