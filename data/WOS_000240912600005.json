In particular, the characterization of harmonic sernicopulas allows us to introduce a new concept of depedence between two random variables. The notion of multivariate semicopula is given and two applications in the theories of fuzzy measures and stochastic processes are given.", "paper_title": "Semicopulas: Characterizations and applicability", "paper_id": "WOS:000240912600005"}
