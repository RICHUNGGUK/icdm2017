Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken is that of a synthesis. Findings - Biology can better deal with intersubjectivity within and between species by incorporating approaches and theory from education inquiry. Conversely, educators can de-anthropocentrize their discipline by entering into learning relationships with other species. By rallying around the concept of \"eduction\", second-order cybernetics plays a role in both syntheses. Practical implications - De-anthropocentrizing education could have practical value in creating ecologically relevant education for children and in developing more integrated environmental impact assessments. Originality/value - Finding convergence between the study of life and forms of practitioner inquiry in education research, and connecting these to the environmental movement.", "paper_title": "The interspecies educator's cybernetic world", "paper_id": "WOS:000330599400010"}
