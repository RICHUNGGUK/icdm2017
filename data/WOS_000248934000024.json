In our method, three steps are included in the downsampling: the first-round downsampling, the interim upsampling and the second-round downsampiing. The downsampling operation unit size is selected between one single 16 x 16 block size and four 8 x 8 block sizes during the first-round downsampling processing. To distinguish the selected downsampling operation unit size, the interim upsampling and the second-round downsampling is required. The DCT coefficients of the interim upsampling image indicate the selected downsampling unit size. The DCT coefficients are converted by some way like lifting step and simultaneously downsampled in the second round. The information about selected operator unit size is contained in the final downsampling image. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves better result than the relevant existing method.", "paper_title": "An adaptive image resizing algorithm in DCT domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934000024"}
