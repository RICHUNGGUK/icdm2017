These interactions and integration aspects are essential when studying a system and subsystem behavior. This is especially important when considering fault scenarios, harsh weather, and complex marine operations. However, many simulators, including a selection presented here, study the positioning system and the power system separately. This paper proposes a simulator combining the two systems, as an extension to the marine systems simulator MATLAB/Simulink library. The intended use cases and the according design choices are presented. New subsystem models include a power-based electrical bus model and a simplified diesel engine model. Both are validated through the simulation against established models. In addition, established models for generators, electrical storage devices, thrusters, and a mean-value diesel engine model are summarized with rich references. Three case studies illustrate the multi-domain use of the simulator: 1) a semi-submersible drilling rig performing station keeping under environmental disturbances; 2) the same vessel subject to an electrical bus reconfiguration; and 3) a supply vessel with a hybrid power plant.", "paper_title": "Marine Vessel and Power Plant System Simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200158"}
