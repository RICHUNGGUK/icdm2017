Their algorithms come with complete theoretical analysis, however, no experimental evaluation is provided. They argue that there is a tradeoff between communication cost and processing cost, and that there is a skyline of the proposed algorithms; i.e. none dominates another. We observe via experiments that, from a practical point of view, some algorithms are almost always preferable to others. We provide detailed experimental results and insights that show the different facets of each algorithm.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Joins in MapReduce: An Experimental Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800016"}
