Dynamic scheduling and Load-Balancing in distributed systems can be achieved through the Node-Availability metric as decision criterion, even without previously knowing the execution time of the processes, nor other information about them such as process communication requirements. This paper also presents a case study which shows that the metric is feasible to implement in conjunction with a dynamic Load-Balancing algorithm, obtaining an acceptable performance.", "paper_title": "Node Availability for Distributed Systems considering processor and RAM utilization for Load Balancing", "paper_id": "WOS:000279488500007"}
