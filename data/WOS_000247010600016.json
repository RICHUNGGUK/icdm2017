The security of both kinds of cryptosystems relies on the hypothesis that the underlying mathematical problems are computationally intractable, in the sense that they cannot be solved in polynomial time. In this paper, we study the performance of artificial neural networks on the computation of a Boolean function derived from the use of elliptic curves in cryptographic applications.
