The characteristics of the proposed notched structure are investigated using simulations to demonstrate the design flexibility of the notchband performance. After integrating the proposed notched structure into the basic UWB BPF based on a stepped-impedance stub loaded resonator (SISLR), a UWB BPF with dual sharply rejected notched bands at 5.2 and 5.8 GHz is constructed. Finally, the designed filter is built and tested. The simulated and measured results are found to be in good agreement to verify the proposed design.", "paper_title": "Design of UWB bandpass filter with dual notched bands", "paper_id": "WOS:000304120300019"}
