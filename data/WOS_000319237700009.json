In several application domains, from gene to social network analysis, the labeling is unbalanced: for instance positive labels may be much less than negatives. In this paper we present COSNet (COst Sensitive neural Network), a neural algorithm for predicting node labels in graphs with unbalanced labels. COSNet is based on a 2-parameter family of Hopfield networks, and consists of two main steps: (1) the network parameters are learned through a cost-sensitive optimization procedure; (2) a suitable Hopfield network restricted to the unlabeled nodes is considered and simulated. The reached equilibrium point induces the classification of the unlabeled nodes. The restriction of the dynamics leads to a significant reduction in time complexity and allows the algorithm to nicely scale with large networks. An experimental analysis on real-world unbalanced data, in the context of the genome-wide prediction of gene functions, shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
