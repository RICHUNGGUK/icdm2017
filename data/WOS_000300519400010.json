The interleaver in serial concatenated convolutional codes, which is the key module in overcoming burst errors, is deliberately designed with the scrambling function to provide a low error rate for those authorized transceivers. By contrast, the unauthorized transceivers without keys would get so high an error rate that decoding bits could bring little value, thus realizing both the confidentiality and reliability in wireless machine to machine communication.", "paper_title": "A Method of Combining Scrambling Technology with Error Control Coding to Realize Both Confidentiality and Reliability in Wireless M2M Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000300519400010"}
