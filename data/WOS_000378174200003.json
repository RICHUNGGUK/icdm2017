The degree based topological indices such as Randic index, geometric-arithmetic (GA) index and atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index are of vital importance among all topological indices. These topological descriptors significantly correlate certain physico-chemical properties of the corresponding chemical compounds. Graph theory has been found to be very useful in this area of research. The topological indices of certain interconnection and mesh derived networks are recently studied by Imran et al. [17]. In this paper, we de fine some new classes of networks from honeycomb networks by using basic graph operations like stellation, medial and dual of a graph. We derive analytical close formulas of general Randic index R-alpha (G) (for different values of alpha) for hexagonal and honeycomb derived networks. We also compute first Zagreb, ABC, and GA indices for these important classes of networks.", "paper_title": "Computing Topological Indices of Honeycomb Derived Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000378174200003"}
