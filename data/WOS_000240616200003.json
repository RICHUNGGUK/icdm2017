This algorithm requires a high computational cost when the data amount becomes large. Here we study a parallel computing scheme for the Katsevich algorithm to facilitate the image reconstruction. Based on the proposed parallel algorithm, several numerical tests are conducted on a high performance computing (HPC) cluster with thirty two 64-bit AMD-based Opteron processors. The standard phantom data [5] is used to establish the performance benchmarks. The results show that our parallel algorithm significantly reduces the reconstruction time, achieving high speedup and efficiency.", "paper_title": "A parallel implementation of the katsevich algorithm for 3-D CT image reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000240616200003"}
