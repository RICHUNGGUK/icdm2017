The vision of all vehicles connected poses a significant challenge to the collection, storage, and analysis of big traffic-related data. Vehicular cloud computing, which incorporates cloud computing into vehicular networks, emerges as a promising solution. Different from conventional cloud computing platform, the vehicle mobility poses new challenges to the allocation and management of cloud resources in roadside cloudlet. In this paper, we study a virtual machine (VM) migration problem in roadside cloudlet-based vehicular network and unfold that (1) whether a VM shall be migrated or not along with the vehicle moving and (2) where a VM shall be migrated, in order to minimize the overall network cost for both VM migration and normal data traffic. We first treat the problem as a static off-line VM placement problem and formulate it into a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. A heuristic algorithm with polynomial time is then proposed to tackle the complexity of solving mixed-integer quadratic programming. Extensive simulation results show that it produces near-optimal performance and outperforms other related algorithms significantly.
