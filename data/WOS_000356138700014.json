To meet requirements of users, smart devices with different kinds of functions may need to be associated together to provide the service described in the user requirement, which is called service composition. As the service composition environment may be dynamic and large scale, centralized service composition algorithm is usually inefficient due to message cost. On the other hand, a decentralized approach, which employs pre-determined coordinators to search and compose service, may have high cost as well. In this paper, we discuss a localized approach for service composition based on the Ubiquitous Interacting Object (UIO) model we have proposed earlier. UIO is an abstraction of physical devices in PvCE with ability to find and collaborate with other devices through exposing their capabilities as services. In our localized service composition algorithm (LASEC), UIOs collaborate with each other in a bottom-up, localized manner to compose required service without requiring global knowledge. To solve the problem of blind compositions in LASEC, we propose a novel mechanism called Alien-information- based Acknowledging (A-Ack), in which a UIO decides on collaborating with another UIO only after obtaining some additional information from the collaboration candidate. Specifically, this information refers to ability of a given UIO to compose another part of the service. Proposed LASEC is message-efficient and quality-guaranteed. Extensive simulations of LASEC as well as existing decentralized and pull-based centralized algorithms have been conducted. The results show the relatively low communication cost and composition time of LASEC. Moreover, we demonstrate feasibility of our approach with a prototype implementation.", "paper_title": "LASEC: A Localized Approach to Service Composition in Pervasive Computing Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000356138700014"}
