To achieve this goal, multimodal systems have been developed to combine multiple modalities depending on the task, preferences and communicative intentions of the users.In this paper, we present a new approach to overcome uncertain or ambiguous knowledge during the fission process in multimodal system. This approach is context-based method using Bayesian network. We also present a modular and distributed architecture, which is very useful in multimodal systems.", "paper_title": "Context-Based Method Using Bayesian Network in Multimodal Fission System", "paper_id": "WOS:000364525200003"}
