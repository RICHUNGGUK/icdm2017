After surveying around 225 papers in the field, the amount of existing works for each method is identified and classified. The paper concludes with comparative tables and graphs demonstrating the frequency of each high impedance fault detection methods, and so it can be used as a guideline for researchers in this field.", "paper_title": "Approaches in High Impedance Fault Detection A Chronological Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000281805600019"}
