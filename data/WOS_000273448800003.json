The BDR problem has potential applications in the design of survivable network structures in telecommunications as well as in the identification of local distribution/collection routes in logistics. The BDR problem can also be considered a generalization of the traveling salesman problem since we are interested in multiple tours instead of a single tour. We develop an efficient heuristic solution methodology that involves various GRASP-based randomized solution construction routines that allow a multi-start framework and a n effective combination of cyclic-exchange and single-move neighborhoods in a local search improvement procedure. The algorithms perform very well in our numerical studies, providing encouraging optimality and lower bound gaps with very reasonable runtimes.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for the design of network topologies with balanced disjoint rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000273448800003"}
