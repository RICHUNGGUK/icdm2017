Firstly, we propose a non-cooperative distributed scheme, in which mobile stations (MS) in different cells with given subcarrier assignment (SA) adjust the modulation and transmit power non-cooperatively, to optimize its own bpj. An advanced noncooperative BS-controlled resource allocation scheme, in which the base station in each cell jointly performs SA, modulation adaptation, and power control for MSs in a non-cooperative manner, is proposed. Numerical results illustrate the tradeoff between energy and spectral efficiency, and show the proposed scheme makes great improvement on bpj with marginal loss of throughput as compared to other conventional scheme.", "paper_title": "Non-Cooperative Multi-Cell Resource Allocation and Modulation Adaptation for Maximizing Energy Efficiency in Uplink OFDMA Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300004"}
