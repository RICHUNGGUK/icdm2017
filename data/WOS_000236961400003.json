In Integrated Measurement Processes (IMP), geometric tolerances data model must support different models from several well-defined standards: including ASME Y14.5M- 1994, STEP, DMIS and others. In this paper, we propose a layered conformance level geometric tolerances representation model. This model uses the widely applied ASME Y14.5M-1994 as its foundation layer by abstracting most information from this standard. The additional geometfic tolerances information defined by DMIS and STEP is incorporated into this model to form corresponding conformance layers that support IMP. Thus, different application domains in an enterprise can use this data model to exchange product information. This model is further transformed with XML Schema that can be used to generate XML instance file to satisfy geometric tolerances representation requirements in IMP. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
