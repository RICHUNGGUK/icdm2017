The electrode signal is extracted by brain-computer-interface (BCI) to monitor the user's degree of concentration, where the user is reminded by sound to concentrate, or teaching staffs are reminded to help users improve reading habits, in order to facilitate the user's ability to concentrate. The digital signal processing methods, such as the Kalman Filter, Fast Fourier Transform, the Hamming window, the average value of the total energy of a frame, correlation coefficient, and novel judgment algorithm are used to obtain the corresponding parameters of concentration evaluation. Users can correct their manner of reading with reminders. The repeated test results may be expected to lie with a probability of 95%. Such model training results in better learning effect.
