In this paper we consider the problem of locating a path-shaped or tree-shaped (extensive) facility in trees, under the condition that existing facilities are already located. We introduce a parametric-pruning method to solve the conditional discrete/continuous extensive weighted 1-center location problems in trees in linear time. This improves the recent results of O(nlog n) by Tamir et al. (J. Algebra 56:50-75, [2005]).", "paper_title": "Optimal Algorithms for the Path/Tree-Shaped Facility Location Problems in Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000269307700001"}
