In the large message transmission, traditional authenticated encryption schemes have the disadvantages that communication overheads and the computation costs are too high. In this work, we propose a secure authentication encryption scheme and show that the scheme is secure in the random oracle model. In comparison with Lv et al.'s scheme and Li et al.'s scheme, our proposed scheme is the most efficient one in terms of computation complexity and communication cost. Finally, we extend our proposed scheme to adapt to the authenticated encryption for a large message, which is secure against the message block being reordered, replicated or partially deleted during transmission.
