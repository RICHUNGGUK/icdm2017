Finding a feasible solution to highly constrained problems is often a very difficult task. Various strategies have been applied to deal with infeasible solutions throughout the search. We propose a new scheme of classifying individuals based on nested domains to determine the solutions according to the level of infeasibility, which in our case represents bands of additional production hours (overtime). Within each band, individuals are just differentiated by their fitness function. As iterations are conducted, the widths of the bands are dynamically adjusted to improve the convergence of the individuals into the feasible domain. The numerical experiments on highly capacitated instances show the effectiveness of this computational tractable approach to guide the search toward the feasible domain. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches and commercial solvers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
