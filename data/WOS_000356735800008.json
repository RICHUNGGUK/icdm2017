Firstly, based on the Caputo fractional-order derivative it is shown that co-periodic or autonomous fractional-order neural networks cannot generate exactly co-periodic signals. Next, by using the contraction mapping principle we discuss the existence and uniqueness of S-asymptotically co-periodic solution for a class of fractional-order non-autonomous neural networks. Then by using a fractional-order differential and integral inequality technique, we study global Mittag-Leffler stability and global asymptotical periodicity of the fractional-order non-autonomous neural networks, which shows that all paths of the networks, starting from arbitrary points and responding to persistent, nonconstant co-periodic external inputs, asymptotically converge to the same nonconstant co-periodic function that may be not a solution.
