Thus, prediction of ABC-transporter substrate properties of compound libraries is of major interest. In this study, we use k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification in combination with five different feature subset selection (FS) algorithms to create predictive models for classification of ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 substrates. Our results show that FS methods that incorporate the classification algorithm give the best results and contain only a small subset of descriptors. For ABCB1 and ABCG2 cross validated accuracies of higher than 80% were achieved. The interpretation of the best performing feature subsets showed that descriptors consisting of simple counts as well as of projections of physicochemical properties on subdivided surface areas have highest contribution to the models.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Contemporary Feature Selection Algorithms: Application to the Classification of ABC-Transporter Substrates", "paper_id": "WOS:000271539000001"}
