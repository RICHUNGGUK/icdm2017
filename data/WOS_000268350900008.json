Various proposals offer approaches adapted to one of these two modes. We present a proposal leading to a system allowing the integration of both modes using the same search engine. This engine is adapted according to each possible search mode.", "paper_title": "An Adaptable Search Engine for Multimodal Information Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000268350900008"}
