In this architecture the entire band including multiple RF systems is directly converted to digital by a wideband high speed ADC, and the RF systems can be easily switched by only digital signal processing with the minimum analog RF components. The digital RF front-end consists of parallel processing blocks for parallel data streams considering practical ADC's configuration. The RF signals are converted into baseband through digital IF stage and the data rates are made down by two steps of decimation. In this paper, a principle investigation into a dualmode system implementation is presented for simplicity. The circuit resource and the robustness to the spurs (spurious outputs) of an NCO (numerically controlled oscillator) in the proposed design will be presented. The proposed architecture was implemented with an FPGA on the developed prototype system and the operations were also verified.", "paper_title": "Efficient Heterodyne Digital Receiver with Direct RF-to-Digital Conversion for Software Defined Radio", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701700017"}
