We use the Shanghai and Shenzhen's stock index since 1997 to test our presented method. The results show that the method could intelligently recognizes some rules of essence trends of the stock markets and forecasts essence direction of the stock markets not only in short-term but also in long-term.", "paper_title": "Clustering based stocks recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000140"}
