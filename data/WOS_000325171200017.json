In this paper, we propose an improved authenticated key transfer protocol based on Shamir's secret sharing. The proposed protocol achieves key confidentiality due to security of Shamir's secret sharing and provides key authentication by broadcasting a single authentication message to all members. Furthermore, the proposed scheme resists against both insider and outsider attacks.", "paper_title": "An Improved Authenticated Group Key Transfer Protocol Based on Secret Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000325171200017"}
