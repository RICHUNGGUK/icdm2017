For w is an element of K-1(3) boolean OR {w*})-PBD is a pairwise balanced design on v points with block size from the set K-1(3) in which there is at least one block of size w. In this paper, we investigate the existence problem for (v, K-1(3) boolean OR {w*})-PBDs and give a complete solution to this problem. As its applications, we solve completely the embedding problem for directed designs DB(4, 1;u)s. In addition, we also apply our (v, K-1(3) boolean OR {w*})-PBDs to do embeddings for near resolvable triple systems and nested Steiner triple systems and give unified and simple new proofs of two known theorems. Some new 4-GDDs are constructed as well.", "paper_title": "Existence of (v,K-1( 3)boolean OR{w*})-PBDs and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000251609600001"}
