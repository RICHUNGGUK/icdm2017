This paper presents a collection of new results on the codeword length distribution of T-codes based on this link. In particular, the average and average weighted codeword lengths are investigated for systematic T-codes. Several results are presented on subsets of T-code codewords for which the aforementioned limit is reached, and asymptotic expressions are derived for the variance and the coefficient of variation of codeword length distributions.", "paper_title": "On the Codeword Length Distribution of T-Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304572900008"}
