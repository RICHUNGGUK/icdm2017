But even in a NoC, link-power can become unacceptably high and data rates are limited when conventional data transceivers are used. In this paper, we present a low-power, high-speed source-synchronous link transceiver which enables a factor 3.3 reduction in link power together with an 80% increase in data-rate. A low-swing capacitive pre-emphasis transmitter in combination with a double-tail sense-amplifier enable speeds in excess of 9 Gb/s over a 2 mm twisted differential interconnect, while consuming only 130 fJ/transition without the need for an additional supply. Multiple transceivers can be connected back-to-back to create a source-synchronous transceiver-chain with a wave-pipelined clock, operating with 6 sigma offset reliability at 5 Gb/s.", "paper_title": "Low-Power, High-Speed Transceivers for Network-on-Chip Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000262017400002"}
