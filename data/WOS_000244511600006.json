This paper is concerned with developing two ANN approaches (a backpropagation neural network [BPNN] and a fuzzy neural network [FNN]) for the prediction of mean, root-mean-square (rms) pressure coefficients and time series of wind-induced pressures on a large gymnasium roof. In this study, simultaneous pressure measurements are made on a large gymnasium roof model in a boundary layer wind tunnel and parts of the model test data are used as the training sets for developing two ANN models to recognize the input-output patterns. Comparisons of the prediction results by the two ANN approaches and those from the wind tunnel test are made to examine the performance of the two ANN models, which demonstrates that the two ANN approaches can successfully predict the pressures on the entire surfaces of the large roof on the basis of wind tunnel pressure measurements from a certain number of pressure taps. Moreover, the FNN approach is found to be superior to the BPNN approach. It is shown through this study that the developed ANN approaches can be served as an effective tool for the design and analysis of wind effects on large roof structures. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
