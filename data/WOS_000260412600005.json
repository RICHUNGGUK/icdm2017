Method. Specifying an ontology, based on enterprise functions and application systems of (health) information systems and closely linked to the Three-Layer Graph-Based Meta Model (302). Deriving appropriate measures and algorithms. Results: A formal definition for data availability is introduced and elucidated by an example. This concept is used e.g. to disclose missing communication links and to suggest solutions. Conclusions: Data availability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for trustworthiness of health information systems. If information management has a thorough description of the information system at its disposal, e.g. by using 302, the calculation of data availability does not need further efforts.", "paper_title": "Model-based Assessment of Data Availability in Health Information Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000260412600005"}
