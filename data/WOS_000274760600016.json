This empirical study assesses the relationships among web-service quality, trust, and purchase intention. The results suggest that web-service quality has a significant impact on customer trust, which in turn significantly impact the customer's intention to purchase auto insurance online. This study provides useful guidelines for online auto insurers contemplating differentiated marketing strategies based on web-system quality, information quality, and various trust factors such as product trust, service trust, and company trust. Furthermore, this exploratory study makes a contribution to the research community by providing a theoretical framework for future studies on e-commerce in general and online auto insurance in particular.", "paper_title": "ROLE OF TRUST IN ADOPTION OF ONLINE AUTO INSURANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000274760600016"}
