This paper is part of an ongoing research toward an ecological design of a separation assistance interface that can present all the relevant properties of the spatiotemporal separation problem. A work-domain analysis is described from which several perspective projections of traffic properties and travel constraints are derived. A display concept is proposed that presents heading and altitude action possibilities in a flight-path angle-track angle action space. Key issues in the current design are discussed, with recommendations for future work.", "paper_title": "Design of an Airborne Three-Dimensional Separation Assistance Display", "paper_id": "WOS:000294134300006"}
