In G = {G(1),..., G(s)}, the decomposition of G, each sub-graph G(i) specifies a set of primitive rings assigned to the same wavelength. If the maximum size set is c then G is a c-grooming. In this paper, bounding the maximum throughput (tp) over bar (c, n, l). of a c-grooming G is addressed, subject to each node being equipped with a limited number l of add-drop multiplexers (ADMs). Naturally, restricting the number of ADMs limits the achievable throughput. For all l, precise determinations of maximum throughput for grooming ratios c=2, 3, and 4 are given. These underlie substantially improved bounds for larger grooming ratios.", "paper_title": "Grooming Traffic to Maximize Throughput in SONET Rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459300002"}
