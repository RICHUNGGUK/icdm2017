It is derived by considering the mean-field limit of a N-body quantum problem, then K-multivalued solutions are adapted to the treatment of this weakly nonlinear system obtained after homogenization without taking into account for Pauli's exclusion principle. Numerical experiments display the behaviour of self-consistent wave packets and screening effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
