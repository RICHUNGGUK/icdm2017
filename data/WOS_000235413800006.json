The concept is applied for multiple swing mode damping through a single FACTS device. An optimization problem is solved to determine controller parameters that would guarantee closed-loop poles in certain target locations with preferential treatment to those corresponding to the inter-area modes. Plant models under different operating conditions are incorporated in the design formulation to achieve performance robustness. A min-max approach is adopted to optimize the worst case scenario. The control design methodology is illustrated for a prototype power system. The performance is verified through time-domain simulations.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous stabilization technique for damping controller design in power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235413800006"}
