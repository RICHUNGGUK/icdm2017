The goal of our work is to adapt the Mean-Value Analysis evaluation algorithm to model the behavior of the thread pool. The computation time and the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm have been provided. The limit of the response time and the throughput sequences computed by the novel algorithm has been determined. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm can be applied to performance prediction of web-based software systems in ASP.NET environment. The proposed algorithm has been validated and the correctness of performance prediction with the novel algorithm has been verified with performance measurements. Error analysis has been performed to verify the correctness of performance prediction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
