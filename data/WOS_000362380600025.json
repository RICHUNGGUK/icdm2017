The main objective of this paper is to investigate multiple event-triggered H-2/H-infinity filtering for hybrid wired-wireless networked systems with random network-induced delays. For multi-sensor network communications, a multiple event-triggered mechanism is employed firstly, which can reduce communication burden of each channel. The different communication characters of hybrid wired-wireless networks are then described by two Markov chains, and a general filtering error dynamic system model with the event-triggered parameters and multi-channel network-induced delays of hybrid wired-wireless networks is presented. Furthermore, the designed filter enables the filtering error dynamic system to be stochastic stability and to achieve a prescribed performance, and the relationships between the stability criteria and the maximum network-induced delays of hybrid wired-wireless networks, the event-triggered parameters and the system performance parameter are established. Finally, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
