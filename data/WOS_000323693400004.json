Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 115 data collected from automotive parts/components manufacturing companies in five ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam) was used to test the proposed research hypotheses. A two-step modelling approach was employed to model the data by using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings - Leadership of the organisations tend to focus on their external (customers and suppliers) rather than internal (employees) partners. The result of this study also suggests that tier 1 suppliers of the automotive industry in ASEAN considered quality information and supplier relationship instead of people management, as the drivers of process management. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to a single industry. The study did not consider some aspects culture in its investigation. Practical implications - The results of this study clarify differences in how quality is managed in an emerging region when compared to previous studies in developed countries. Originality/value - This study is the first attempt to explore quality management implementation in a specific sector in the ASEAN region.", "paper_title": "Revisiting quality management and performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000323693400004"}
