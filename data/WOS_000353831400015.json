The 3-D CIE Lab color feature is extracted at each superpixel to characterize local image information. Based on the color feature, the superpixel-based coding model is achieved between the adjacent frames for correctly tracking object. The proposed tracking method considers the interaction of corresponding superpixels between the adjacent frames of complex scenes, which enhances the stability of encoding. Due to the update of codebook and classifier parameter, the proposed method is robust for long-term object tracking. We test the proposed method on 15 challenging sequences involving drastic illumination change, partial or full occlusion, and large pose variation. The proposed method shows excellent performance in comparison with eight previously proposed trackers.", "paper_title": "Inter-frame constrained coding based on superpixel for tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000353831400015"}
