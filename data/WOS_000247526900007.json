This is the first attempt to account for inversions in an evolutionary model of tandemly repeated genes. We present a branch-and-bound algorithm that finds the exact solution, and a polynomial-time heuristic based on the breakpoint distance. We show, on simulated data, that those algorithms can be used to improve phylogenetic inference of tandemly repeated gene families. An application on a published phylogeny of KRAB zinc finger genes is presented.", "paper_title": "Duplication and inversion history of a tandemly repeated genes family", "paper_id": "WOS:000247526900007"}
