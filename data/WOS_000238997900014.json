Design/methodology/approach - The nonlinear boundary value problem is reformulated as a nonlinear boundary integral equation, with u on the boundary as the solution being sought. The integral equation is solved numerically by using the collocation method on smooth or nonsmooth boundary; the singularities of solution degrade the rates of convergence. Findings - Variants of the methods for finding numerical solutions are suggested. So these methods have been compared with respect to number of iterations. Practical implications - Numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed methods. Originality/value - Provides new methods to solve nonlinear weakly singular integral equations and discusses difficulties that arise in particular cases.", "paper_title": "New methods for solving of nonlinear weakly singular integral equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238997900014"}
