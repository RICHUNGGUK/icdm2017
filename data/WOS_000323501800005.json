By integrating the home entertainment system in the user's reading experience combined with haptic interfaces we want to examine whether such augmentation of modalities influence the user's learning patterns. The proposed Haptic E-Book (HE-Book) system leverages the haptic jacket, haptic arm band as well as haptic sofa interfaces to receive haptic emotive signals wirelessly in the form of patterned vibrations of the actuators and expresses the learning material by incorporating image, video, 3D environment based augmented display in order to pave ways for intimate reading experience in the popular mobile e-book platform.", "paper_title": "Mobile Haptic E-Book System to Support 3D Immersive Reading in Ubiquitous Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000323501800005"}
