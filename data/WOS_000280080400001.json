The aim of this study was to increase the separation of fluorescent labels. In the new imaging cryomicrotome, the sample is cut in slices of 40 mu m. Six images are taken for each cutting plane. Correction for spectral overlap is based on linear combinations of fluorescent images. Locations of microspheres are determined by using the system point spread function. Five differently colored microspheres were injected in vivo distributed over two major coronaries, the left anterior descending and left circumflex artery. Under absence of collateral flow, microspheres outside of target perfusion territories were not found and the procedure did not generate false positive detection when spectral overlap was relevant. In silico-generated microspheres were used to test the effect of background image, transparency correction, and color separation. The percentage of microspheres undetected was 2.3 +/- A 0.8% in the presence and 1.5 +/- A 0.4% in the absence of background structures with a density of 900 microspheres per color per cm(3). The image analysis method presented here, allows for an increased number of experimental conditions that can be investigated in studies of regional myocardial perfusion.", "paper_title": "Improved detection of fluorescently labeled microspheres and vessel architecture with an imaging cryomicrotome", "paper_id": "WOS:000280080400001"}
