Both complexes were found to have relatively complicated energy surfaces with lowenergy triplet and quintet spin state structures as well as the expected singlet- state structures for Co(III) complexes. This existence of singlet-, triplet-, and quintet- state structures of similar energies complicates the study of these complexes by density functional theory. The B3LYP* method of Reiher et al. was chosen in an effort to provide the most reliable estimates of the relative energies of the singlet, triplet, and quintet spin states. The lowest- energy Cp2Co2F4 structure was found to be a doubly bridged quintet spin state structure, with similar triplet and singlet structures lying within similar to 4 kcalmol(-1) of this quintet structure. The lowest- energy Cp2Co2(CN)(4) structure was found to be a triplet spin state structure, with a singlet structure lying within similar to 1 kcal mol- 1 of this triplet structure. Almost all of the Cp2Co2X4 structures were found to have nonbonding Co center dot center dot center dot Co distances in excess of 2.9 angstrom, as expected for Co(III) complexes. In general, structures with trans stereochemistry of the Cp and other terminal ligands were found to be of lower energy than the corresponding structures with cis stereochemistry.", "paper_title": "A density functional theory study of paramagnetic cyclopentadienylcobalt(III) derivatives: fluoride versus cyanide", "paper_id": "WOS:000332180100046"}
