Those classes might be defined a priori or data-driven. When the latter approach is followed, one method for deriving asset groups is given by the use of clustering methods. In this paper, we analyze in detail one of those clustering approaches. the Gaussian mixture GARCH. This method is designed to identify groups based on the conditional variance dynamic parameters. The clustering algorithm, based on a Gaussian mixture model, has been recently proposed and is here generalized with the introduction of a correction for the presence of correlation across assets. Finally, we introduce a benchmark estimator used to assess the performances of simpler and faster estimators. Simulation experiments show evidence of the improvements given by the correction for asset correlation. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
