In this paper, we take one step forward by formulating the process of cost assignment into two phases: 1) determining a priority profile and 2) specifying a cost-value distribution. We analytically show that the cost-value distribution determines the change rate of cover elements. Furthermore, when the cost-values are specified to follow a uniform distribution, the change rate has a linear relation with the payload, which is a rare property for content-adaptive steganography. In addition, we propose some rules for ranking the priority profile for spatial images. Following such rules, we propose a five-step cost assignment scheme. Previous steganographic schemes, such as HUGO, WOW, S-UNIWARD, and MG, can be integrated into our scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of better resisting steganalysis equipped with high-dimensional rich model features.", "paper_title": "Investigation on Cost Assignment in Spatial Image Steganography", "paper_id": "WOS:000364428900001"}
