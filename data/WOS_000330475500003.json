Multiple techniques have been proposed to address this problem, with the split spectrum approach (SSA) being a very interesting candidate among them. This technique is based on splitting a demand into smaller sub-demands when a blocking situation arises. In split-spectrum-enabled networks, the route, spectrum, and modulation level assignment (RSMLA) problem that appears in elastic optical networks is further complicated due to the signal splitting operation. In this paper we present novel mechanisms to optimally attack this problem; various possible implementations of the SSA are also discussed. We highlight the benefits of the proposed mechanisms through illustrative results and compare the various implementation solutions in terms of average network cost.", "paper_title": "Optimal Route, Spectrum, and Modulation Level Assignment in Split-Spectrum-Enabled Dynamic Elastic Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330475500003"}
