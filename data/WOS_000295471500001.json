Darshak automatically constructs cinematic narrative discourse of a given story in a 3-D virtual environment. It utilizes a hierarchical partial-order causal link (POCL) planning algorithm to generate narrative plans that contain story events and camera directives for filming them. Dramatic situation patterns, commonly used by writers of fictional narratives, are formalized as communicative plan operators that provide a basis for structuring the cinematic content of the story's visualization. The dramatic patterns are realized through abstract communicative operators that represent operations on a viewer's beliefs about the story and its telling. Camera shot compositions and transitions are defined in this plan-based framework as execution primitives. Darshak's performance is evaluated through a novel user study based on techniques used to evaluate existing cognitive models of narrative comprehension. Initial study reveals significant effect of the choice of visualization strategies on measured viewer comprehension. It further shows significant effect of Darshak's choice of visualization strategy on comprehension.", "paper_title": "Cinematic Visual Discourse: Representation, Generation, and Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000295471500001"}
