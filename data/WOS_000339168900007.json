Our main result is the comparison of languages of infinite words u(beta) and u(-beta) coding the ordering of distances between consecutive beta- and (-beta)-integers. It turns out that for a class of roots beta of x(2)-mx-m, the languages coincide, while for other quadratic Pisot numbers the language of u(beta) can be identified only with the language of a morphic image of u(-beta). We also study the group structure of (-beta)-integers.", "paper_title": "INTEGERS IN NUMBER SYSTEMS WITH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE QUADRATIC PISOT BASE", "paper_id": "WOS:000339168900007"}
