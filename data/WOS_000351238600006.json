This is based on regularity results in Babuska-Kondratiev spaces. Following the argument of Dahlke and DeVore, we first prove an embedding of these spaces into the scale of Besov spaces with . This scale is known to be closely related to -term approximation w.r.t. wavelet systems, and also adaptive finite element approximation. Ultimately, this yields the rate for for . In order to improve this rate to , we leave the scale and instead consider the spaces . We determine conditions under which the space is embedded into some space for some , which in turn indeed yields the desired -term rate. As an intermediate step, we also prove an extension theorem for Kondratiev spaces.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Approximation Rates and Besov Regularity for Elliptic PDEs on Polyhedral Domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000351238600006"}
