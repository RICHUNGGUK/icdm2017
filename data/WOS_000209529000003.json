This paper describes a baseline GPGPU cloud system built on Kepler GPUs, for the purpose of exploring hardware potential while improving task performance. This paper elaborates a general scheme which defines the whole cloud system into a cloud layer, a server layer, and a GPGPU layer. This paper also illustrates the hardware features, task features, scheduling mechanism, and execution mechanism of each layer. Thus, this paper provides a better understanding of general-purpose computing on a GPGPU cloud.", "paper_title": "GPGPU Cloud: A Paradigm for General Purpose Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000209529000003"}
