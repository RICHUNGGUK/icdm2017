Thus, visual stability problems in these robot control systems have become important design issues. In this paper, to solve the problem of vision instability caused by attitude variation of the robot working under bumpy environment, a bionic eyes system of active compensation for robot visual error is proposed inspired by the binocular VOR. The bionic vision system is developed based on features of oculomotor behaviors and bionic control algorithm of the binocular VOR. According to the behaviors features of eye movement, the bionic eye mechanism is designed by using a 3-DoF spherical parallel mechanism(SPM). Meanwhile, to improve the performance, the mechanism parameters of SPM are optimized by utilizing the worst-case performance index as the optimizing target in required workspace. An adaptive control model of the binocular VOR is established on neural control mechanisms of eye movement, and the model is used as the bionic control algorithm to drive and control the eye mechanism. The results indicate that the model can actively compensate the visual errors from postural changes of robot. Physical robot experiments also show that the system is robust even with bumpy environment.", "paper_title": "Design and Control of 3-DoF Spherical Parallel Mechanism Robot Eyes Inspired by the Binocular Vestibule-ocular Reflex", "paper_id": "WOS:000354490300005"}
