The system included a local WSN with multiple sensor nodes to acquire soil property data, a data sink, and a long-distance cellular network to transmit field data to a remote database. The quality of service of the system was evaluated based on the average packet delivery rate and valid data rate, which were both above 95% for each sensor node during the tests. The system could provide users an easy access of real-time field data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
