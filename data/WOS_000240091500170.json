That is due to their contribution to easy encoding and robust multimedia communication. In this paper, we propose a new DVC framework where two LVQ (lattice vector quantization) and a rate-variable LDPC (low-density parity-check) are exploited. In both LVQ and LDPC, we use the interpolated from decoded frames as side information to help coding. Because of LVQ's exploitation to dependence of source and the better error-correcting capacity of LDPC, our system achieves more than I dB improvement in PSNR than the referenced. Meanwhile, the property of low-complexity encoding is still preserved.", "paper_title": "LVQ based distributed video coding with LDPC in pixel domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500170"}
