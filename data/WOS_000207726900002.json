In this paper, we have evaluated and compared several algorithms for dynamic scheduling of lightpaths using a flexible advance reservation model. The main aim is to find the best scheduling policy for a grid network resource manager that improves network utilization and minimizes blocking. The scheduling of lightpaths involves both routing and wavelength assignment. Our simulation results show that minimum-cost adaptive routing where link costs are determined by the current and future usage of the link provides the minimum blocking. For wavelength assignment, we have used a scheme that reduces fragmentation by minimizing unused gaps. We have also analyzed approaches for failure recovery and resource optimization.
