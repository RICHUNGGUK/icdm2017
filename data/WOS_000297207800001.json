The present analysis takes into consideration the Soret and Dufour's effects in the presence of a chemical reaction. The governing equations for velocity, concentration, and temperature fields are derived. Using the homotopy analysis method, the solution of outcoming equations are computed. Graphical results for velocity, temperature, and concentration fields are reported and analyzed.
