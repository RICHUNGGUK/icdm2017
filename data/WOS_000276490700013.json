Based on radio interference, each sensor node can obtain a multi-group of distance variations from itself to a mobile anchor through the measurement of the cumulative phase variations caused by Doppler effect, by which its position can be determined. The proposed method has the following advantages: the sensor node conducts localization in a completely distributed manner without information exchange or centralized processing, and the measurement result equals the actual distance without modulus operation, which is in reality measuring the distance with a ruler of radio wavelength, and will significantly reduce the system complexity and achieve high location accuracy. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Radio interferometric localization of WSNs based on Doppler effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000276490700013"}
