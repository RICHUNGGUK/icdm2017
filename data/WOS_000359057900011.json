For this reason, it is of great importance to research PSS. The purpose of this paper is to establish a systematic strategy and a system tool for PSS design. Design/methodology/approach - A requirement-driven product-service system (RdPPS) is developed using requirements analysis and knowledge management technologies. A framework is proposed to support RdPPS by providing tools and methods for requirement analysis and processing, formalization of PSS by ontology-based knowledge representation, reasoning method for PSS solution finding, and solution optimizing and assessing. Finally, the design support strategies for RdPPS are investigated to demonstrate the usability and functioning of the developed system. Findings - Many conventional design methods did not consider the influence of customer requirements (CRs) during the planning phase of PSS design. Moreover, a broader range of knowledge is required to PSS design, since both products and services are considered. Research limitations/implications - This research provides a solid foundation for PSS, and promotes an effective means for PSS design. Originality/value - A RdPSS is presented. CRs are considered during the design phase of PSS as well as both product and service knowledge.", "paper_title": "A product-service system using requirement analysis and knowledge management technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000359057900011"}
