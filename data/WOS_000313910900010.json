SWEET was held in conjunction with the 2012 SIGMOD conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA on May 20th, 2012. The goal of the workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore the state of the art in workflow-based programming for data-intensive applications, and the potential of cloud-based computing in this area. The program featured two very well attended invited talks by Pawel Garbacki from Google and Jimmy Lin from the University of Maryland, on leave at Twitter at the time, as well as a tutorial on Oozie, Yahoo's workflow engine based on Hadoop, by Mohammad Islam from Yahoo/Cloudera.", "paper_title": "Report from the first workshop on Scalable Workflow Enactment Engines and Technology (SWEET'12)", "paper_id": "WOS:000313910900010"}
