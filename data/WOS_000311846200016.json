The schemes are based on a recently proposed method known as block recombination, which efficiently computes the sum of two products of Toeplitz matrices and vectors. Specifically, here we take advantage of some structural properties of the matrices and vectors involved in the formulation of field multiplication using optimal normal bases. This yields new space and time complexity results for corresponding bit parallel multipliers.", "paper_title": "Improved Area-Time Tradeoffs for Field Multiplication Using Optimal Normal Bases", "paper_id": "WOS:000311846200016"}
