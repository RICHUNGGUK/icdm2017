Optimizing dictionary from predefined coding schemes is a challenge task. This paper focuses on learning dictionary from two Locality Coding Adaptors (LCAs), i.e., locality Gaussian Adaptor (GA) and locality Euclidean Adaptor (EA), for large-scale and high-dimension datasets. Online dictionary learning is formulated as two cycling steps, local coding and dictionary updating. Both stages scale up gracefully to large-scale datasets with millions of data. The experiments on different applications demonstrate that our method leads to a faster dictionary learning than the classical ones or the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
