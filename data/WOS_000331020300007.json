The proposed method utilizes the shift-invariance of nonsubsampled contourlet transform to restrain the pseudo-Gibbs phenomenon, and then enhance details of the image by unsharp masking. We achieved an increase in image definition by 54.5%, the mean increased by 15.6%, whereas the standard deviation increased by 54.5% compared with the unsharp masking method. To the noisy image, we achieved an increase in image definition by 35.4%, the mean increased by 2.2%, whereas the standard deviation increased by 34.9% compared with the unsharp masking method.
