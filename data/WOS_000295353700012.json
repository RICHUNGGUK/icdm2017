Several methods have been developed to detect and locate the tampered region, while most methods do fail when the copied region is rotated before being pasted because of the de-synchronization in the searching procedure. To solve the problem, the paper proposes an efficient and robust passive authentication method that uses the circle block and the Hu moments to detect and locate the duplicate regions with rotation. Experimental results show that our method is robust not only to noise contamination, blurring and JPEG compression, but also to the rotation. Meanwhile, the proposed method has better time performance compared with exiting methods because of the lower feature dimension. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
