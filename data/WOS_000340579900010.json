The same is true for the Renyi entropy, where additivity is equivalent to multiplicativity of the 1 -> q norm for all q <= 1. In this paper we consider the related question of multiplicativity of the 2 -> q norm for q > 2 for entanglement breaking channels. We prove that multiplicativity holds in this case for certain classes of EB channels, including both the CQ and QC channels.", "paper_title": "MULTIPLICATIVITY OF SUPEROPERATOR NORMS FOR SOME ENTANGLEMENT BREAKING CHANNELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579900010"}
