Our paper contributes to this goal by introducing the GroundCam, a cheap tracking modality with no significant setup necessary. By itself, the GroundCam provides high frequency and high resolution relative position information similar to an inertial navigation system but with significantly less drift. We present the design and implementation of the GroundCam, analyze the impact of several design and runtime factors on tracking accuracy and consider the implications of extending our GroundCam to different hardware configurations. Motivated by the performance analysis, we developed a hybrid tracker that couples the GroundCam with a wide area tracking modality via a complementary Kalman filter, resulting in a powerful base for indoor and outdoor mobile mixed reality work. To conclude, the performance of the hybrid tracker and its utility within mixed reality applications is discussed.", "paper_title": "Heads up and camera down: A vision-based tracking modality for mobile mixed reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000253880100003"}
