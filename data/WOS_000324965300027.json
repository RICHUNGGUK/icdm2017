Hence, these compounds are of great interest for environment, global climate change, energy resources, and Cosmochemistry. The knowledge of stability and physical-chemical properties of methane hydrate crystal structure is important for evaluating some new green becoming technologies such as, strategies to produce natural gas from marine methane hydrates and simultaneously store CO2 as hydrates. However, some aspects related with their stability, spectroscopic and other chemical-physical properties of both hydrates are not well understood yet. The structure and stability of crystal structure of methane and CO2 hydrates have been investigated by means of calculations with empirical interatomic potentials and quantum-mechanical methods based on Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory (DFT) approximations. Molecular Dynamic simulations have been also performed exploring different configurations reproducing the experimental crystallographic properties. Spectroscopic properties have also been studied. Frequency shifts of the main vibration modes were observed upon the formation of these hydrates, confirming that vibration stretching peaks of C-H at 2915 cm(-1) and 2905 cm(-1) are due to methane in small and large cages, respectively. Similar effect is observed in the CO2 clathrates. The guest-host binding energy in these clathrates calculated with different methods are compared and discussed in terms of adequacy of empirical potentials and DFT methods for describing the interactions between gas guest and the host water cage, proving an exothermic nature of methane and CO2 hydrates formation process.
