Design/methodology/approach - The objective is achieved by introducing the concepts of particle \"strain\" and \"stress\" so that some equivalence between the physical system and the numerical model can be established. Findings - Three similarity principles, namely geometric, mechanical and dynamic, under which the numerical model can exactly reproduce the mechanical behaviour of a physical model are proposed. In particular, the concept of the scale invariant interaction law is further introduced. The scalability of a number of most commonly used interaction laws in the discrete element modelling is examined. Research limitations/implications - This is a preliminary research for a very important and challenging topic. More research, particularly in the understanding of the convergent properties of discrete element models, is needed. Originality/value - The paper provides some important theoretical guidances to computational modelling of particle systems using discrete element techniques.", "paper_title": "On upscaling of discrete element models: similarity principles", "paper_id": "WOS:000269477800003"}
