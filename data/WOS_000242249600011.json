We compare the reliability of several mirrored disk organizations, which provide tradeoffs between reliability and load balancedness (after disk failure) by comparing their a(2) values, which can be obtained via a partial reliability analysis taking into account a few disk failures. We next use asymptotic expansions to compare the reliability of hierarchical RAID disk arrays, which combine replication and rotated parity disk arrays (RAID5 and RAID6). Finally, we argue that the mean time to data loss in systems with repair is related to the reliability without repair. As part of this discussion we show how to estimate the mean time to data loss in RAID5 and RAID6 disk arrays without resorting to transient analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
