Beyond what the standard can define, in order to effectively support video streaming, VoIP, and data services, proprietary radio resource management, including multi-connection assignment, scheduling controls, and call admission controls, are essential. In this study we evaluate the downlink performance of a Mobile WiMAX cellular system with different radio resource management, especially the scheduler for QoS control and the implementation of multiconnection for streaming applications.", "paper_title": "Radio resource management of heterogeneous services in mobile WiMax systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244400300005"}
