The \"quality of information sharing\" is a group-level construct for assessing the outcome of collaborative technology use in collaborative work. However, few studies have addressed this informational influence. We propose a research model, grounded in interactivity and fit-appropriation theories, to examine structural, perceptual, and attitudinal influences on the quality of information sharing. Particularly, we incorporate task complexity into this model to examine the direct and interaction effects on collaborative technology use. We empirically test the model by examining the use of Lotus Notes at offices. The empirical results show that structural and perceptual factors have distinct effects on fit and appropriation attitudes, which indirectly or directly determine the quality of information sharing. We also discuss the academic and managerial implications of the research findings.", "paper_title": "Examining structural, perceptual, and attitudinal influences on the quality of information sharing in collaborative technology use", "paper_id": "WOS:000351520100014"}
