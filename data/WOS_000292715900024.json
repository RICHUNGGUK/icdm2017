The goal is to determine the configuration of the controller and to set up the procedure for determination of the controller parameters. Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of the analytical and numerical analysis of the so-far proposed stabilizers, the new directions towards improved and efficient stabilizer have been established. The advantage of the proposed approach has been confirmed with simulations and experimental results. Findings - Three main contributions can be highlighted: on the basis of the synchronous generator analysis, it is shown that the conventional power system stabilizer is inappropriate for optimal oscillation damping through the entire operating range; the possibility of application of the model reference adaptive control theory for stabilizer design is confirmed; and the rules have been set up for selection of the stabilizer parameters. Research limitations/implications - The power system control is rather conservative and does not allow new approaches to the control concepts. Originality/value - The paper's originality lies in the fact that the proposed adaptive approach for realizing the control system for damping of oscillations is presented completely. The configuration of the controller is presented, as well as the method for determining the adaptation mechanism parameters.", "paper_title": "Adaptive stabilization for generator excitation system", "paper_id": "WOS:000292715900024"}
