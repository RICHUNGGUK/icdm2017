We first present an effective analysis of the features and the classification method adopted in the SMV. And feature vectors which are applied to the GMM are then selected from relevant parameters of the SMV for the efficient V/UV classification. The performance of the proposed algorithm are evaluated under various conditions and yield better results compared to the conventional method of the SMV.", "paper_title": "Efficient Implementation of Voiced/Unvoiced Sounds Classification Based on GMM for SMV Codec", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648400043"}
