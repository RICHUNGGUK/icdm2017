This paper has two main contributions: first of all, we propose a semistatic energy efficient method to find out the optimal on-off pattern considering the interference from adjacent base stations using integer convex optimization, from which the optimal on-off proportion of base stations could be obtained; then we propose a novel energy efficient cooperative heuristic algorithm in dynamic scenario, by separating the waiting time into two independent Markov processes using the new method; the total power consumption could be reduced significantly by adopting the novel method. Compared with reference method, simulation results indicate that in semistatic scenario, the total system power consumption could be reduced up to 26%, and, in dynamic scenario, the system power consumption could be reduced up to 40%.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient Cooperative Sleep Control Using Small Cell for Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360478300001"}
