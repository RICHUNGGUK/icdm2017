The ultimate load-carrying capacity analysis is done starting from the initial shape determination due to bridge dead load. The proposed model can consider both geometric and material nonlinearities in the nonlinear inelastic analysis for the example bridges. The load-displacement curves of the example bridges predicted by both the proposed model and the commercial code ABAQUS are compared with each other to verify the accuracy of solutions. Identical solutions between them are found. A parametric study on the example bridges is presented and their ultimate behavior is discussed.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear analysis of steel cable-stayed bridges", "paper_id": "WOS:000246433400005"}
