RFID can support automatic information tracing and management during the management process in many fields. A typical field that uses RFID is modern warehouse management, where products are attached with tags and the inventory of products is managed by retrieving tag IDs. Many practical applications require searching a group of tags to determine whether they are in the system or not. The existing studies on tag searching mainly focused on improving the time efficiency but paid little attention to energy efficiency which is extremely important for active tags powered by built-in batteries. To fill in this gap, this paper investigates the tag searching problem from the energy efficiency perspective. We first propose an Energy-efficient tag Searching protocol in Multiple reader RFID systems, namely ESiM, which pushes per tag energy consumption to the limit as each tag needs to exchange only one bit data with the reader. We then develop a time efficiency enhanced version of ESiM, namely TESiM, which can dramatically reduce the execution time while only slightly increasing the transmission overhead. Extensive simulation experiments reveal that, compared to state-of-the-art solution in the current literature, TESiM reduces per tag energy consumption by more than one order of magnitude subject to comparable execution time. In most considered scenarios, TESiM even reduces the execution time by more than 50%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
