The standard threshold circuits using threshold gates and weights are replaced by nodes computing directly a threshold function of the inputs. The method developed can be considered exhaustive as if a solution exist the algorithm eventually will find it. At all stages different optimization strategies are introduced in order to make the algorithm as efficient as possible. The method is applied to the synthesis of circuits that implement a flip-flop circuit and a multi-configurable gate. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are analyzed.", "paper_title": "Optimal synthesis of Boolean functions by threshold functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100102"}
