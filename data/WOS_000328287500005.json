The proposed modeling method uses 8-node hexahedral isoparametric elements for the discretization of concrete. Steel rebars may have any orientation inside the solid concrete elements allowing the simulation of longitudinal as well as transverse reinforcement. Concrete cracking is treated with the smeared crack approach, while steel reinforcement is modeled with the natural beam-column flexibility-based element that takes into consideration shear and bending stiffness. The performance of the proposed modeling is demonstrated by comparing the numerical predictions with existing experimental and numerical results in the literature as well as with those of a commercial code. The results show that the proposed refined simulation predicts accurately the nonlinear inelastic behavior of reinforced concrete structures achieving numerical robustness and computational efficiency.", "paper_title": "Computationally efficient 3D finite element modeling of RC structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000328287500005"}
