This problem generalizes metric TSP. In this paper, we show that the problem admits a rho-approximation algorithm if b(v)a parts per thousand yen2, vaV, where rho=2.5 if k is even, and rho=2.5+1.5/k if k is odd. We also prove that the digraph version of this problem admits a 2.5-approximation algorithm and discuss some generalization of metric TSP.", "paper_title": "Network Design with Edge-Connectivity and Degree Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000267899000007"}
