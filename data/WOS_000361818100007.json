We consider a specific non-stationary and non-uniform variant of the Merrien subdivision family, and we provide a data dependent strategy to select the related parameters which ensures convergence and shape preservation for any set of initial monotone and/or convex data. Each step of the proposed subdivision procedure can be regarded as the midpoint evaluation of an interpolating function-and of its first and second derivatives-in a suitable space of functions of dimension which has tension properties. The limit function of the subdivision procedure is a piecewise quintic polynomial interpolant.", "paper_title": "Shape preserving HC2 interpolatory subdivision", "paper_id": "WOS:000361818100007"}
