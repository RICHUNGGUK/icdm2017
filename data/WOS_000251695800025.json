We prove that a prefix-free regular expression gives only a linear number of matching substrings in the size of a given text. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm for the prefix-free regular-expression matching problem. Furthermore, we suggest an algorithm to determine whether or not a given regular language is prefix-free. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
