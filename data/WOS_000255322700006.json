Our method consists of an appropriate finite difference scheme for solving our model equations and a level set approach for capturing the complicated motion between the bubbles. Results indicate that our models and the level set methods can handle complicated interfacial motions and topology changes, and that they can numerically simulate many of the physical features of bubble motions.
