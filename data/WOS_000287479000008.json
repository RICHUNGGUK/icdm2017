In particular, we consider interaction potentials which are singular in the sense that their first derivative is discontinuous at the origin. For locally attractive singular interaction potentials we prove under a linear stability condition local non-linear stability of stationary states consisting of a finite sum of Dirac masses. For singular repulsive interaction potentials we show the stability of stationary states of uniformly bounded solutions under a convexity condition. Finally, we present numerical simulations to illustrate our results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
