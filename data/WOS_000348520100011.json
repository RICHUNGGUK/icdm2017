An event-triggered communication scheme is proposed in order to determine whether the measurements on each sensor should be transmitted to the estimators or not. The norm-bounded uncertainty enters into the system in a random way. Through available output measurements from not only the individual sensor but also its neighbouring sensors, a sufficient condition is established for the desired distributed estimator to ensure that the estimation error dynamics are exponentially mean-square stable. These conditions are characterized in terms of the feasibility of a set of linear matrix inequalities, and then the explicit expression is given for the distributed estimator gains. Finally, a simulation example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered distributed state estimation scheme.", "paper_title": "Event-triggered robust distributed state estimation for sensor networks with state-dependent noises", "paper_id": "WOS:000348520100011"}
