We present an in-kernel architecture of management gateway, namely kP2PADM, built upon open-source packages with several modifications and design techniques. First, the in-kernel design streamlines the data path through the gateway. Second, the dual-queue buffer eliminates head-of-line blocking for multiple connections. Third, a connection cache reduces useless reconnection attempts from the peers. Fourth, a fast-pass mechanism avoids slowing down the TCP transmission. The in-kernel design approximately doubles the throughput of the design in the user space. The internal benchmarks also analyze the impact of each function on performance.", "paper_title": "kP2PADM: An In-Kernel Architecture of P2P Management Gateway", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400400003"}
