In the first step, a comprehensive ray tracing study with a 3D ray tracing tool is performed to determine the channel impulse responses. Feeding our PHY simulator with the collected channel responses, the performance figures are generated over received SNR. It was observed that for a satisfactory BER performance, a directional antenna with the minimum of 10 dB antenna gain should be used at least in the receiver side when there is human shadowing in the environment.", "paper_title": "60 GHz PHY Performance Evaluation with 3D Ray Tracing under Human Shadowing", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000018"}
