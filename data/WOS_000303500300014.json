Online review data generated by authors who have experienced the submission process in 10 Chinese academic journals were collected. The results of Spearman correlation analysis show that Chinese authors' perceived responsiveness of an editorial office is positively correlated with perceived quality of the journal, and the total review time does not affect perceptions of the quality of a journal and its editorial responsiveness.", "paper_title": "Editorial responsiveness, journal quality, and total review time: An empirical analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000303500300014"}
