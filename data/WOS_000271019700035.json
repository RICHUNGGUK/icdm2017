Using a lemma of Hou, Stickelberger's theorem on Gauss sums, and certain ternary weight inequalities, we show that certain ternary monomial functions arising in the 2006 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY paper (vol. 52, pp. 2018-2032, 2006) are weakly regular bent, thus settling a conjecture of Helleseth and Kholosha. We also prove that the Coulter-Matthews bent functions are weakly regular.", "paper_title": "Proofs of Two Conjectures on Ternary Weakly Regular Bent Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019700035"}
