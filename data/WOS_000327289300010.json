If the languages are regular, we determine whether a system of implicit boolean equations or relations has solutions. If there is a solution, we provide an effective construction of a (regular) solution. We give representations for maximal and minimal solutions. Moreover, we also solve the problem of uniqueness of solutions as well as whether infinitely many solutions exist. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
