We also obtained the temperature profile in a graphene nanoribbon containing two types of grain boundaries with different misorientation angles, theta = 21.8 degrees and theta =32.2 degrees. We found that a temperature gap appears in the temperature profile of a graphene nanoribbon with a grain boundary at the middle. Moreover, we found that the temperature profile in the partially hydrogenated graphene varies with the percentage of hydrogens, i.e. the C:H ratio. Our results show that a grain boundary line in the graphene sheet can change the thermal transport through the system which might be useful for controlling thermal flow in nanostructured graphene.
