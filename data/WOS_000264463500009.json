To solve complex constrained optimization problems, a new immune-genetic algorithm is proposed in this paper. In this approach, first of all, some antigens are randomly generated for the production and training of antibodies. Then, an efficient immune system with the capability to recognize self- and non-self-antigens is supported by these trained antibodies. The resulting immune system is built into genetic algorithms, and they can be used to identify and repair the illegal and infeasible chromosomes during the genetic iterations. The recommended algorithm can improve the performance of genetic algorithms particularly in complex constrained optimization problems. It has been achieved satisfactory results from the new product introduction problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
