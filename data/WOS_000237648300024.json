This scheme provides an enhancement, resolving some problems with regard to Lee's scheme, which cannot defend against and replay and impersonation attacks. Accordingly, an analysis and comparison with Lee's and other schemes, demonstrate that the current paper avoids replay and impersonation attacks, providing mutual authentication, and also results in a lower computation cost than the original scheme.", "paper_title": "Efficient nonce-based authentication scheme using token-update", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300024"}
