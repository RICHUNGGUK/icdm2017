In this paper, the new models based on the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) subtour elimination constraints are developed and computational results together with comparisons against MTZ-based, flow-based, and hop-indexed formulations are reported. The first model is obtained by adapting the MTZ-based Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem formulation of Sherali and Driscoll [18] and the other two models are obtained by combining topology-enforcing and MTZ-related constraints offered by Akgun and Tansel (submitted for publication) [20] for HMST with the first model appropriately. Computational studies show that the best LP bounds of the MTZ-based models in the literature are improved by the proposed models. The best solution times of the MTZ-based models are not improved for optimally solved instances. However, the results for the harder, large-size instances imply that the proposed models are likely to produce better solution times. The proposed models do not dominate the flow-based and hop-indexed formulations with respect to LP bounds. However, good feasible solutions can be obtained in a reasonable amount of time for problems for which even the LP relaxations of the flow-based and hop-indexed formulations can be solved in about 2 days.
