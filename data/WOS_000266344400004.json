Dinur and Friedgut later showed that this statement also holds if we replace the discrete domain {0, 1}(n) with the continuous domain [0, 1](n), under the extra assumption that f is increasing. They conjectured that the condition of monotonicity is unnecessary and can be removed. We show that certain constant-depth decision trees provide counter-examples to the Dinur-Friedgut conjecture. This suggests a reformulation of the conjecture in which the function g : [0, 1](n) -> {0, 1}, instead of depending on a small number of variables, has a decision tree of small depth. In fact we prove this reformulation by showing that the depth of the decision tree of g can be bounded by e(O(If/epsilon 2)). Furthermore, we consider it second notion of the influence of a variable, and study the functions that have bounded total influence in this sense, We use a theorem of Bourgain to show that these functions have certain properties. We also study the relation between the two different notions of influence.", "paper_title": "Decision Trees and Influences of Variables Over Product Probability Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000266344400004"}
