By virtue of the stochastic analysis method and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, it new sufficient condition is proposed where the feasibility of the conditions can be readily checked by the Mat-lab LMI control toolbox. Moreover, our method has the advantage of removing the restrictions on the time varying delays, so the derived results are less conservative than the previous works. A numerical example with simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed results.", "paper_title": "Novel criteria for mean square stability of stochastic delayed neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000259042700006"}
