Leveraging advances in high-resolution finite-volume methods for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, we first discretize the interior product (also called contraction) through integrals over Eulerian approximations of extrusions. This, along with Cartan's homotopy formula and a discrete exterior derivative, can then be used to derive a discrete Lie derivative. The usefulness of this operator is demonstrated through the numerical advection of scalar fields and 1-forms on regular grids.", "paper_title": "Discrete Lie Advection of Differential Forms", "paper_id": "WOS:000288219600001"}
