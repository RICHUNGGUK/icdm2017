In this paper, we show how the effect of typical ill-conditioning of passive location, arising in many operational conditions, may be significantly mitigated by regularization techniques. The pertaining advantages with respect to the conventional (non-regularized) approach are shown in a realistic situation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
