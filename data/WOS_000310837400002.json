With the standard app1235roach to tackle this problem being combinatorial, the reconstructed network is rarely unique. From a biological point of view, it is therefore of importance to not only compute one network, but all possible networks. In this article, we make a first step toward approaching this goal by presenting the first algorithm-called allMAAFs-that calculates all maximum-acyclic-agreement forests for two rooted binary phylogenetic trees on the same set of taxa.", "paper_title": "A First Step Toward Computing All Hybridization Networks For Two Rooted Binary Phylogenetic Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000310837400002"}
