Transition region descriptor plays a key role in the process, which greatly affects accuracy of transition region extraction and subsequent thresholding. Local entropy (LE), a classic descriptor, considers only frequency of gray level changes, easily causing those non-transition regions with frequent yet slight gray level changes to be misclassified into transition regions. To eliminate the above limitation, a modified descriptor taking both frequency and degree of gray level changes into account is developed. In addition, in the light of human visual perception, a preprocessing step named image transformation is proposed to simplify original images and further enhance segmentation performance. The proposed algorithm was compared with LE, local fuzzy entropy-based method (LFE) and four other thresholding ones on a variety of images including some NDT images, and the experimental results show its superiority.
