We present a learning-based method for automatic and efficient localization of these landmarks and the plane using regression forests. Given a point in an image, we first extract a set of multiscale long-range contextual features. We then build random forests models to learn a nonlinear relationship between these features and the probability of the point being a landmark or in the plane. Three-stage coarse-to-fine models are trained for the AC, PC, and MSP separately using downsampled by 4, downsampled by 2, and the original images. Localization is performed hierarchically, starting with a rough estimation that is progressively refined. We evaluate our method using a leave-oneout approach with 100 clinical T1-weighted images and compare it to state-of-the-art methods including an atlas-based approach with six nonrigid registration algorithms and a model-based approach for the AC and PC, and a global symmetry-based approach for the MSP. Our method results in an overall error of 0.55 +/- 0.30 mm for AC, 0.56 +/- 0.28 mm for PC, 1.08 degrees +/- 0.66 in the plane's normal direction, and 1.22 +/- 0.73 voxels in average distance for MSP; it performs significantly better than four registration algorithms and the model-based method for AC and PC, and the global symmetry-based method for MSP. We also evaluate the sensitivity of our method to image quality and parameter values. We show that it is robust to asymmetry, noise, and rotation.
