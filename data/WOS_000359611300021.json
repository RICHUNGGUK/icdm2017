The formation and evolution of public opinion event is a dynamically interactive process affected by the participant's complicated psychology and behaviors. Agent-based modeling method can provide an effective and powerful tool to investigate the emerging phenomena in a social simulation system. Although many methodologies have been presented to support the standardized modeling, but the transition from expertise or theory model to computing simulation model is still a hard work for the sociologist, who usually lack of the required technological skills. In order to step over this barrier, we propose a domain-expert oriented methodology to guide the modeling process in a specific social domain, and design a meta-modeling framework based on the paradigm of Agent-Event-Environment (AEE) which can be considered as a basis of developing a visual modeling environment or tools. By the application in the real case of a major public opinion event, the proposed method has been verified effectively and efficiently. Research work of this article provides a valuable framework and methodology to deal with the transition of expertise or theoretical knowledge into computing simulation for a specific social domain.", "paper_title": "A Meta-Modeling Framework for a Specific Social Domain: Public Opinion Event", "paper_id": "WOS:000359611300021"}
