We focus on their implementations based on general-purpose processors that are cost-effective and flexible to update. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, called deterministic finite automata with extended character-set (DFA/EC), which can significantly decrease the number of states through doubling the size of the character-set. Unlike existing state reduction algorithms, our solution requires only a single main memory access for each byte in the traffic payload, which is the minimum. We perform experiments with several Snort rule-sets. Results show that, compared to DFAs, DFA/ECs are very compact and are over four orders of magnitude smaller in the best cases; DFA/ECs also have smaller memory bandwidth and run faster. We believe that DFA/EC will lay a groundwork for a new type of state compression technique in fast packet inspection.", "paper_title": "A DFA with Extended Character-Set for Fast Deep Packet Inspection", "paper_id": "WOS:000341523800008"}
