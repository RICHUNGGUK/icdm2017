For games with n vertices, m edges and d different priorities, the original algorithm computes the winning regions and a winning strategy for one of the players in O(dm center dot (n/left perpendiculard/2right perpendicular)(left perpendiculard/2right perpendicular)) time. Computing a winning strategy for the other player requires a re-run of the algorithm on that player's winning region, thus increasing the runtime complexity to O(dm center dot (n/inverted right perpendiculard/2inverted left perpendicular)(inverted right perpendiculard/2inverted) (left perpendicular)) for computing the winning regions and winning strategies for both players. We modify the algorithm so that it derives the winning strategy for both players in one pass. This reduces the upper bound on strategy derivation for SPM to O(dm center dot (n/left perpendiculard/2right perpendicular)(left perpendiculard/2right perpendicular)) . At the basis of our modification is a novel operational interpretation of the least progress measure that we provide.", "paper_title": "Improvement in Small Progress Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000367344400012"}
