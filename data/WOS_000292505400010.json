Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and proxies are two common ways for reducing the server workload. In this paper, we consider a peer-assisted Internet VoD system with proxies deployed at domain gateways. We formally present the video caching problem with the objectives of reducing the video server workload and avoiding inter-domain traffic, and we obtain its optimal solution. Inspired by theoretical analysis, we develop a practical protocol named PopCap for Internet VoD services. Compared with previous work, PopCap does not require additional infrastructure support, is inexpensive, and able to cope well with the characteristic workloads of Internet VoD services. From simulation-based experiments driven by real-world data sets from YouTube, we find that PopCap can effectively reduce the video server workload, therefore provides a superior performance regarding the video server's traffic reduction.", "paper_title": "PopCap: popularity oriented proxy caching for peer-assisted Internet video-on-demand streaming services", "paper_id": "WOS:000292505400010"}
