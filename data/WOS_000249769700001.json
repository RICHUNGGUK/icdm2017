All clinicians must grapple with this daunting challenge; those with little or no informatics expertise may be particularly surprised by the attendant difficulties. To do so successfully, they must be able to explicitly conceptualize the daily clinical work-a prerequisite for appreciating and reasonably evaluating it. Further, few of these evaluators may have reflected on the dynamic interaction between their work and their tools-how changing a tool necessarily changes the work. This article illuminates these problems by telling the story of how one patient care information systems committee first learned to think about the purpose of a patient information management system, and second, how to evaluate the impact of its implementation.", "paper_title": "Discovering how to think about a hospital patient information system by struggling to evaluate it: A committee's journal", "paper_id": "WOS:000249769700001"}
