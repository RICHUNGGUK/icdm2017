As a key building block of the security infrastructure for the networked embedded systems. the design of signature schemes is one of the most critical aspects in the research field of secure networked embedded systems. In this paper. we propose a novel identity-based partially blind signature scheme with adaptive delegation. which is cost-efficient and very suitable under several constraints of networked embedded systems. We analyze the security. efficiency of our scheme. and conduct experiments on a typical networked embedded platform. The experimental results show that our technique can perform better compared with the previous work.", "paper_title": "AN ID-BASED PARTIALLY BLIND SIGNATURE SCHEME WITH ADAPTIVE DELEGATION FOR NETWORKED EMBEDDED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268910300011"}
