The span of an L(d, 1)-labeling f of a graph is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum integers used by f. The L(d. 1)-labeling number of G. denoted by lambda(d,) (1) (G), is the minimum span over all L(d, 1)-labelings of G. An L'(d, 1)-labeling of a graph G is an L(d, 1)-labeling of G which assigns different labels to different vertices. Denote by lambda'(d, 1) (G) the L'(d, 1)-labeling number of G. Georges et al. [Discrete Math. 135 (1994) 103-111] established relationship between the L(2, 1)-labeling number of a graph G and the path covering number of G(c), the complement of G. In this paper we first generalize the concept of the path covering of a graph to the t-group path covering. Then we establish the relationship between the L'(d, 1)-labeling number of a graph G and the (d - 1)-group path covering number of G(c). Using this result, we prove that lambda'(2,) (1) (G) and lambda'(3), (1) (G) for bipartite graphs G can be computed ill polynomial time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
