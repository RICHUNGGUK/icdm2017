The system uses the Friend of a Friend (FOAF) and RDF Site Summary (RSS) vocabularies for recommending music to a user, depending on the user's musical tastes and listening habits. Music information (new album releases and reviews, podcast sessions, audio from MP3 blogs, related artists' news, and upcoming gigs) is gathered from thousands of RSS feeds. The presented system provides music discovery by means of: user pro. ling (defined in the user's FOAF description), context-based information (extracted from music related RSS feeds) and content-based descriptions (extracted from the audio itself), based on a common ontology (OWL DL) that describes the music recommendation domain. The system is available at: http://foa.ng-the-music.iua.upf.edu. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
