Often the User and the workflow middleware services want to be informed about the performance behavior of workflows, as early as possible, so that they call steer the execution Of workflows to coni pen sate for the performance loss or execution failures. This paper describes a distributed performance analysis service that supports tracing execution, analyzing performance overheads, and searching for performance problems of Web services-based workflows in the Grid. We present how the user and the Grid workflow middleware can utilize the distributed performance analysis service in order to optimize the execution of workflows. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
