This equation incorporates an internal state index related to the density and pressure, as well as the coefficient of particle breakage and rotation. The adapted Rowe's stress-dilatancy equation indicates that the relationship between stress and dilatancy is not constant, but varies with density and pressure. This result is in agreement with TRM test data. A state-dependent model was established for TRM using generalized plasticity theory combined with the adapted Rowe's stress-dilatancy equation. The model includes twelve constants calibrated using TRM test data from Group A, and this model was used to predict the strain softening and dilatancy behaviors of dense TRM. Furthermore, the model predictions were validated using test data from Group B. In summary, the model accurately represented the stress-strain and dilatancy behaviors of TRM over a wide range of densities and pressures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
