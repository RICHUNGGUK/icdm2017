However, although some initial multi-domain crankback studies have been done, most have not considered post-fault recovery. Along these lines, this paper proposes a novel solution framework for joint intra/inter-domain crankback restoration in realistic MPLS/GMPLS network settings. Namely, dynamic link failure and intra-domain link-state routing information is coupled with the available inter-domain path/distance vector routing state to improve the recovery process. Mechanisms are also introduced to limit crankback overheads and delays. The performance of the proposed solution is then analyzed using simulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
