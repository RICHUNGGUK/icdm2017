Most of the existing path generation methods are computationally expensive since they require a lengthy preprocessing step and the 3D positions of all path points should be generated. In this paper, we propose a visibility-based automatic path generation method by emulating the ray propagation through the conduit of the colon. The proposed method does not require any preliminary data preprocessing steps, and it also dramatically reduces the number of points needed to represent the camera path using control points. The result is a perceivable increase in computational efficiency and easier colon navigation with the same level of accuracy.", "paper_title": "A visibility-based automatic path generation method for virtual colonoscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600039"}
