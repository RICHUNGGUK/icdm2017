This fact suggests, in a natural way, the problem of when the upper and lower Hausdorff quasi-pseudo-metrics of a weightable quasi-metric space (X, d) are weightable. Here we discus this problem. Although the answer is negative in general, we show, however, that it is positive for several nice classes of (nonempty) subsets of X. Since the construction of these classes depends, to a large degree, on the specialization order of the quasi-metric d, we are able to apply our results to some distinguished quasi-metric models that appear in theoretical computer science and information theory, like the domain of words, the interval domain and the complexity space.
