A usual penalty is considered, which is a term proportional to the norm of the weights. The main contribution of this paper is to theoretically prove the boundedness of the weights in the network training process. This boundedness is then used to prove an almost sure convergence of the algorithm to the zero set of the gradient of the error function.", "paper_title": "Boundedness and Convergence of Online Gradient Method with Penalty for Linear Output Feedforward Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266251000005"}
