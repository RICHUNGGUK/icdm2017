Since there can be an extremely large number of potential services that offer similar functionality, it is challenging to select the right ones. Service requestors have to decide which services closelysatisfy their needs, and theymust worry about the reliability of the service provider. Although an individual service can be trusted, a composed service is not guaranteed to be trustworthy. In this paper, we present a trust model that supports service discovery and composition based on trustworthiness. We define a method to evaluate trust in order to discover trustworthy services. We also provide a method to perform trust estimation for dynamic service composition, and we present results of two experiments. The proposed model allows for service requestors to obtain the most trustworthy services possible. Our mechanism uses direct and indirect user experience to discover the trustworthiness of the services and service providers. Moreover, composing services based on quantitative trust measurements will allow for consumers to acquire a highly reliable service that meet their quality and functional requirements.", "paper_title": "Trustworthy Service Discovery for Dynamic Web Service Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000353109800024"}
