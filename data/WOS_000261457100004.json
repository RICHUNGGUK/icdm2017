It is implemented using an FPGA platform that guarantees speed enhancement, time accuracy and extensibility with no performance loss. We have focused on the implementation of a discrete event system, specifically timed automata into FPGA, and we have linked them with continuous systems implemented as filters in fixed point arithmetic. The paper shows a methodology, which employs widely used tools (Matlab, UPPAAL) as a user interface. and which implements the FPGA based tester tool. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
