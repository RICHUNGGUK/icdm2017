By joining together an uncommonly wide range of disciplines and expertise, the Kavli HUMAN Project will advance measurement of behavioral phenotypes, as well as environmental factors that impact behavior. By following the same individuals over time, KHP will liberate new understanding of dynamic links between behavioral phenotypes, disease, and the broader environment. As KHP advances understanding of the bio-behavioral complex, it will seed new approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of human disease.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Assessment of Wellness and Disease in Daily Life", "paper_id": "WOS:000361364900010"}
