In this paper, an approach is proposed for recognizing music-induced emotions through the fusion of three-channel forehead biosignals (the left temporalis, frontalis, and right temporalis channels) and an electrocardiogram. The classification of four emotional states in an arousal-valence space (positive valence/low arousal, positive valence/high arousal, negative valence/high arousal, and negative valence/low arousal) was performed by employing two parallel support vector machines as arousal and valence classifiers. The inputs of the classifiers were obtained by applying a fuzzy-rough model feature evaluation criterion and sequential forward floating selection algorithm. An average classification accuracy of 88.78 % was achieved, corresponding to an average valence classification accuracy of 94.91 % and average arousal classification accuracy of 93.63 %. The proposed emotion recognition system may be useful for interactive multimedia applications or music therapy.", "paper_title": "Classification of Music-Induced Emotions Based on Information Fusion of Forehead Biosignals and Electrocardiogram", "paper_id": "WOS:000336313700009"}
