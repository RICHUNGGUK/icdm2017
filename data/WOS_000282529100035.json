The capacity available for processing the accepted orders is limited and each order is characterized by a known processing time, delivery date, revenue and a weight representing a penalty per unit-time delay beyond the delivery date. We prove that the existence of a constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem is unlikely. We propose two linear formulations that are solved using an IP solver and we devise two exact branch-and-bound procedures able to solve instances with up to 50 jobs within reasonable CPU times. We compare the efficiency and quality of the results obtained using the different solution approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
