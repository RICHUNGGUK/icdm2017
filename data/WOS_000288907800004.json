In response to the advances of hardware accelerators, we also modify the code in the SBR toolbox to accelerate the computation by off-loading a significant part of the operations to a graphics processor (GPU). The performance results illustrate the parallelism and scalability of these algorithms on current high-performance multi-core and many-core architectures.
