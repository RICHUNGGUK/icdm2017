Thus usually multiple entropy codec hardware modules are implemented in parallel to process the entropy encoding/decoding. This module, however, requests many small-size memories to store intermediate data, and when multiple modules are implemented on a chip, employment of the large number of SRAMs increases difficulty of whole chip layout. In this paper, an efficient memory organization framework for the entropy encoding/decoding module is proposed, in which not only existing memory organizations but also our proposed novel memory organization methods are attempted to expand the design space to be explored. As a result, the efficient memory organization for a target process technology can be explored.", "paper_title": "Efficient Memory Organization Framework for JPEG2000 Entropy Codec", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648400028"}
