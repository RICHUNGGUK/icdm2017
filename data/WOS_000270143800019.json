A new type of distributed consensus filters is designed, where each sensor can communicate with the neighboring sensors, and filtering can be performed in a distributed way. In the pinning control approach, only a small fraction of sensors need to measure the target information, with which the whole network can be controlled. Furthermore, pinning observers are designed in the case that the sensor can only observe partial target information. Simulation results are given to verify the designed distributed consensus filters.", "paper_title": "Distributed Consensus Filtering in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270143800019"}
