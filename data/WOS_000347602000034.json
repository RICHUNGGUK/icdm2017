The problem was motivated by research in phylogenetics. For parameterized algorithms, while the problem is known to be fixed-parameter tractable for binary trees, it was an open problem whether the problem is still fixed-parameter tractable for general trees. We resolve this open problem by developing an O (3(k)n)-time parameterized algorithm for general trees. Our techniques on tree structures also lead to a polynomial-time approximation algorithm of ratio 3 for the problem, giving the first constant-ratio approximation algorithm for general trees.
