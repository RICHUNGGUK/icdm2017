The architectures of both converters are very simple and only consist of few components. The convergence condition, which is independent to duty cycle of converters, is derived in this paper. Using this concept to synthesize current-mode converters, the component values of converters will be designed easily. There is no sub-harmonic oscillation in the proposed converters without slope compensation even if the duty cycle greater than 50%. The proposed circuits are implemented into a single chip with TSMC 0.35 mu m CMOS DPQM processes and their chip area is only 2.25 mm(2), respectively. The maximum power efficiency of proposed converters is measured and described in this paper, too.", "paper_title": "Monolithic HCC buck and boost converters with simplified convergence analysis methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000254622800006"}
