In this paper, we develop the work on fuzzy DES to consider the reliable decentralized supervisor problem with possible failures of some local supervisors. By presenting a new definition of co-observable language, the reliable decentralized supervisory control problem is solved. Since the co-observable languages are not closed under union, a new normal language that is co-observable is defined to solve the synthesis problem. Finally, a numerical example is given.
