The core design of Medusa is to enable developers to leverage the massive parallelism and other hardware features of GPUs by writing sequential C/C++ code for a small set of APIs. This simplifies the implementation of parallel graph processing on the GPU. The runtime system of Medusa automatically executes the user-defined APIs in parallel on the GPU, with a series of optimizations based on the architecture features of GPUs and characteristics of graph applications. In this paper, we present an overview of the Medusa system and a case study of adopting Medusa to a research project on social network simulations. With Medusa, users without GPU programming experience can quickly implement their graph operations on the GPU, which accelerates the discovery and findings of domain-specific applications.", "paper_title": "Medusa: A Parallel Graph Processing System on Graphics Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000344417200005"}
