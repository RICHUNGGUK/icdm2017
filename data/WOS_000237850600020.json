Unlike existing techniques, our algorithm car! simultaneously correct a variety of geometric distortions, including skew, fold distortion, binder curl, and combinations of these. In addition, the same interpolation framework can be used to estimate the intrinsic illumination component of the distorted image to correct shading artifacts. We detail our algorithm for geometric and shading correction and demonstrate its usefulness on real-world and synthetic data.", "paper_title": "Geometric and shading correction for images of printed materials using boundary", "paper_id": "WOS:000237850600020"}
