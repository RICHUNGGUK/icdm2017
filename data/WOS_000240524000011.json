A new Inverse function Delayed (ID) neuron model is implemented. The Inverse function Delayed model, which includes the BVP model, has superior associative properties thanks to negative resistance. An associative memory based on the ID model with self-connections has possibilities of improving its basin sizes and memory capacity. In order to decrease circuit area, we employ stochastic logic. The proposed neuron circuit completes the stimulus response output, and its retrieval property with negative resistance is superior to a conventional nonlinear model in basin size of an associative memory.", "paper_title": "Hardware implementation of an inverse function delayed neural network using stochastic logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000240524000011"}
