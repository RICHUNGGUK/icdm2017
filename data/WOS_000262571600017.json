Three-dimensional Navier Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates have been applied to the slipper/plate gap, including the groove. The paper presents pressure, leakage, force and torque variations when groove dimensions and position are being modified, the effect of slipper tangential velocity and turning speed are also considered. Fluid momentum interchange inside the groove is studied, since vorticity inside the groove is analysed under several working conditions. A test rig was build to compare experimental and CFD results, finding a good agreement for all of the cases studied. Flow is considered laminar and incompressible under all conditions and the slipper is considered parallel to the plate. Design instructions to optimise slipper/groove performance are also given.
