Due to intrinsic characteristic of flatness, hierarchical topology can achieve the scalability and efficiency of a wireless network. To solve this problem, one can construct a virtual backbone network by using a connected dominating (CDS) set of a wireless network. In past few years, efficiently and fast construct a CDS in a wireless network as a virtual backbone has been the main research problem in hierarchical topology control. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey for CDSs and related problems with various network models and specific applications. To conclude, some open problems and interesting issues in this field are proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
