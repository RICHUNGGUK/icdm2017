Indiscriminate addition of information can, however, come with inherent problems such as the provision of poor quality or fraudulent information. Provenance represents the cornerstone element which will enable information consumers to assess information quality, which will play a fundamental role in the continued evolution of the Web. This paper investigates the characteristics and requirements of provenance on the Web, describing how the Open Provenance Model (OPM) can be used as a foundation for the creation of W3P, a provenance model and ontology designed to meet the core requirements for the Web.
