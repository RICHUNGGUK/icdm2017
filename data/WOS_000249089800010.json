In particular, these constructions are generalizations of the *-product and the *-product for copulas introduced by Darsow, Nguyen and Olsen in 1992. Some properties of these constructions are studied, especially their relationships with ordinal sums and shuffles of Min.", "paper_title": "Remarks on two product-like constructions for copulas", "paper_id": "WOS:000249089800010"}
