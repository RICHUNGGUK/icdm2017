Trust is an important issue in these distributed systems. A flexible and general-purpose trust-management system can maintain current and consistent trustworthiness information for the different entities in a distributed system. Thus, trust management remains an active research area. Many interesting research issues are yet to be fully explored, including trust/reputation value storage.", "paper_title": "Trust management in distributed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244085500011"}
