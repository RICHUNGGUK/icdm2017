Although the information discovered using learning analytics techniques can be useful in fostering self-reflection, its delivery to students should be done without distracting them from their learning goals. This paper presents a visualization technique based on similarity measures and their relationship with final course results, in order to foster students' awareness. The approach is based on the idea that ` students that behave similarly are graded similarly'. This idea is validated with an empirical evaluation to determine the visualization technique's accuracy when used to find a relationship between similarity and grade. The study used a previously collected dataset and several volunteers were asked to estimate the students' scores with graphics provided as the only source of information. The obtained results validate the proposal as a means to foster effective self-reflection.", "paper_title": "A Visual Analytics Method for Score Estimation in Learning Courses", "paper_id": "WOS:000351909400008"}
