In this paper, we investigate how to determine optimal relay locations in serial and parallel FSO relaying so as to minimize the outage probability and quantify performance improvements obtained through optimal relay placement. We further present a diversity gain analysis for serial and parallel FSO relaying schemes and quantify their diversity advantages in terms of the number of relays and channel parameters.", "paper_title": "Optimal Relay Placement and Diversity Analysis of Relay-Assisted Free-Space Optical Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000313906300004"}
