Most of these algorithms implement permutations and diffusions at the pixel level by considering the pixel as the smallest (atomic) element of an image. In fact, a permutation at the bit level not only changes the position of the pixel but also alters its value. Here we propose an image cryptosystem employing the Arnold cat map for bit-level permutation and the logistic map for diffusion. Simulations have been carried out and analyzed in detail, demonstrating the superior security and high efficiency of our cryptosystem. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.
