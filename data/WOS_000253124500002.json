For this task, the video frames should be registered, i.e., mosaiced, after compensating for their distortions due to camera shakes. In this paper, a mosaicing-by-recognition technique is proposed where the problems of video mosaicing and text recognition are formulated as a unified optimization problem and solved by a dynamic program ming-based optimization algorithm simultaneously and collaboratively. Experimental results indicate that, even if the frames undergo various distortions such as rotation, scaling, translation, and nonlinear speed fluctuation of camera movement, the proposed technique provides fine mosaic image by accurate distortion estimation (around 90% of perfect estimation) and character recognition accuracy (over 95%).
