We present some applications in connection with the detection of isolated singularities and the joint time-frequency analysis of a fractal via the representation of the corresponding wavelet coefficients. An interesting comparison between the different families of classical orthogonal polynomials, taking into account the computational cost (in flops) needed in the representation of these coefficients, axe also given.", "paper_title": "Continuous wavelet transforms based on classical orthogonal polynomials and functions of the second kind", "paper_id": "WOS:000244874800008"}
