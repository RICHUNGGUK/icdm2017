The algorithm further applies to the problem of optimal stopping of a Markov chain, for which a novel Gittins-index solution approach is introduced. The algorithm draws on Gittins and Jones' (1974) index definition via calibration, on Kallenberg's (1986) proposal of using parametric linear programming, on Dantzig's simplex method, on the Varaiya et al. (1985) algorithm, and on the author's earlier work. This paper elucidates the structure of parametric simplex tableaux. Special structure is exploited to reduce the computational effort of pivot steps, decreasing the operation count by a factor of three relative to conventional pivoting, and by a factor of 3/2 relative to recent state-elimination. algorithms. A computational study demonstrates significant time savings against alternative algorithms.", "paper_title": "A (2/3)n(3) fast-pivoting algorithm for the Gittins index and optimal stopping of a Markov chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000251037100012"}
