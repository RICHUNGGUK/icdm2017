Since signaling or regulatory networks are dynamic and context-specific, systematic efforts to characterize such structural alterations must effectively distinguish significant network rewiring from random background fluctuations. Here we introduced a novel integration of network biology and imaging to study cancer phenotypes and responses to treatments at the molecular systems level. Specifically, Differential Dependence Network (DDN) analysis was used to detect statistically significant topological rewiring in molecular networks between two phenotypic conditions, and in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to more accurately define phenotypic sample groups for such differential analysis. We applied DDN to analyze two distinct phenotypic groups of breast cancer and study how genomic instability affects the molecular network topologies in high-grade ovarian cancer. Further, FDA-approved arsenic trioxide (ATO) and the ND2-SmoA1 mouse model of Medulloblastoma (MB) were used to extend our analyses of combined MRI and Reverse Phase Protein Microarray (RPMA) data to assess tumor responses to ATO and to uncover the complexity of therapeutic molecular biology.", "paper_title": "Integration of Network Biology and Imaging to Study Cancer Phenotypes and Responses", "paper_id": "WOS:000346630600004"}
