Our goal is to distinguish between graphs having a predetermined graph property and graphs that are far from every graph having that property. It is well known that in the bounded-degree graph model (where two graphs are considered \"far\" if they differ in epsilon n edges for a positive constant epsilon), many graph properties cannot be tested even with a constant or even with a polylogarithmic number of queries. Therefore in this paper we focus our attention on testing graph properties for special classes of graphs. Specifically, we show that every hereditary graph property is testable with a constant number of queries provided that every sufficiently large induced subgraph of the input graph has poor expansion. This result implies that, for example, any hereditary property (e. g., k-colorability, H-freeness, etc.) is testable in the bounded-degree graph model for planar graphs, graphs with bounded genus, interval graphs, etc. No such results have been known before, and prior to our work, very few graph properties have been known to be testable with a constant number of queries for general graph classes in the bounded-degree graph model.", "paper_title": "TESTING HEREDITARY PROPERTIES OF NONEXPANDING BOUNDED-DEGREE GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266018400017"}
