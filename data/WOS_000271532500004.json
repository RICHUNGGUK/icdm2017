It is often used as a building block to construct an optimistic fair exchange. in this paper, we propose a new concept: a proxy verifiably encrypted signature scheme, by combining proxy signature with a verifiably encrypted signature. And we formalize security model of proxy verifiably encrypted signature. After a detail construction is given, we show that the proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model. The security of the scheme is related to the computational Diffie-Hellman problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
