In particular, we solve processor selection, path selection and router configuration problems. Given the complexity of these problems, state of the art approaches in this area largely rely on greedy heuristics, which do not guarantee optimality. Our approach is based on a constraint programming formulation that merges a number of steps, usually tackled in sequence in classic approaches. Thus, our method has the potential of finding optimal solutions with respect to resource usage under throughput constraints. The experimental evaluation presented in here shows that our approach is capable of exploring a range of solutions while giving the designer the opportunity to emphasize the importance of various design metrics.
