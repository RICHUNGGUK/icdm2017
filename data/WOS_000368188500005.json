Existing solutions usually use unicast instead of broadcast to forward packets from a node to its neighbors according to their working schedules, which is, however, not energy efficient. In this article, we propose to exploit the broadcast nature of wireless media to further save energy for low-duty-cycle networks, by adopting a novel broadcasting communication model. The key idea is to let some early wake-up nodes postpone their wake-up slots to overhear broadcasting messages from its neighbors. This model utilizes the spatiotemporal locality of broadcast to reduce the total energy consumption, which can be essentially characterized by the total number of broadcasting message transmissions. Based on such model, we aim at minimizing the total number of broadcasting message transmissions of a broadcast for low-duty-cycle WSNs, subject to the constraint that the broadcasting latency is optimal. We prove that it is NP-hard to find the optimal solution, and design an approximation algorithm that can achieve a polylogarithmic approximation ratio. Extensive simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional solutions in terms of energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Energy Efficiency for Minimum Latency Broadcast in Low-Duty-Cycle Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000368188500005"}
