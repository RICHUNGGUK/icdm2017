However, they are offered as centralised services running in a single server, regardless if they are free/open source or proprietary software. After re-engineering Apache Wave (former Google Wave), we can now provide the first decentralised and federated free/open source alternative. The new API allows to develop new real-time collaborative web applications in both JavaScript and Java environments.", "paper_title": "Building Real-Time Collaborative Applications with a Federated Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000375128200007"}
