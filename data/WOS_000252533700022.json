An exponential backoff method has been used in WLANs and significant efforts have been made to analyze its throughput and other important properties such as delay and jitter. In this article, we propose a new backoff algorithm and model it with a discrete-time Markov chain; measuring its saturation throughput under several conditions and several set of parameters which are to be adjusted according to the network condition, with the aim of approaching maximum throughput when stations are saturated.
