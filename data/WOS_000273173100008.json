More important is the need to overcome the rigid constraints necessitated by the practical implementation of sensible but effective security methods such as iris recognition. An inventive iris acquisition method with less constrained image taking conditions can impose minimal to no constraints on the iris verification and identification process as well as on the subject. Consequently, to provide acceptable measures of accuracy, it is critical for such an iris recognition system to be complemented by a robust iris segmentation approach to overcome various noise effects introduced through image capture under different recording environments and scenarios. This research introduces a robust and fast segmentation approach towards less constrained iris recognition using noisy images contained in the UBIRIS.v2 database (the second version of the UBIRIS noisy iris database). The proposed algorithm consists of five steps, which include: (1) detecting the approximate localization of the eye area of the noisy image captured at the visible wavelength using the extracted sclera area, (2) defining the outer iris boundary which is the boundary between iris and sclera, (3) detecting the upper and lower eyelids, (4) conducting the verification and correction for outer iris boundary detection and (5) detecting the pupil area and eyelashes and providing means for verification of the reliability of the segmentation results. The results demonstrate that the accuracy is estimated as 98% when using 500 randomly selected images from the UBIRIS.v2 partial database, and estimated at >= 97% in a \"Noisy Iris Challenge Evaluation (NICE.I)\" in an international competition that involved 97 participants worldwide, ranking this research group in sixth position. This accuracy is achieved with a processing speed nearing real time. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
