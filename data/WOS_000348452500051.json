In situ measurements of aquifer hydraulic parameters are expensive and difficult. Traditionally, these parameters have been estimated by graphical methods that are approximate and time-consuming. As a result, nonlinear programming (NLP) techniques have been used extensively to estimate them. Despite the outperformance of NLP approaches over graphical methods, they tend to converge to local minima and typically suffer from a convergence problem. In this study, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) methods are used to identify hydraulic parameters (i.e., storage coefficient, hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, specific yield, and leakage factor) of three types of aquifers namely, confined, unconfined, and leaky from real time-drawdown pumping test data. The performance of GA and ACO is also compared with that of graphical and NLP techniques. The results show that both GA and ACO are efficient, robust, and reliable for estimating various aquifer hydraulic parameters from the time-drawdown data and perform better than the graphical and NLP techniques. The outcomes also indicate that the accuracy of GA and ACO is comparable. Comparing the running time of various utilized methods illustrates that ACO converges to the optimal solution faster than other techniques, while the graphical method has the highest running time.
