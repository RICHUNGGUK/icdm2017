In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight equilateral triangle localization algorithm (LETLA) that accurately localizes sensors and minimizes the power consumption. In the LETLA, the approximate coordinates substituted for the real coordinates of the unknown node, and the corresponding optimization problem is formulated to minimize the estimation error. With the sequences that represent the ranking of distances from the anchors to the unknown node, a simple and robust technique is developed to quickly and efficiently estimate a region containing the approximate coordinates, and a condition under which the approximate error can be minimized is given. This condition employs a new geometric construct of anchor layout called equilateral triangle diagrams. Extensive simulations show that the LETLA performs better than other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of energy consumption with the same localization precision.", "paper_title": "A Novel Lightness Localization Algorithm Based on Anchor Nodes Equilateral Triangle Layout in WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000314964200001"}
