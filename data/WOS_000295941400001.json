The obtained data, however, have some distortions due to the sensor motion during the scanning period. Besides these distorted range data, there should be available range data sets taken by other sensors fixed on the ground. Based on the overlapping regions visible from the moving sensor and the fixed ones, we propose an extended alignment algorithm to rectify the distorted range data and to align the data to the models by the fixed sensors. By using CAD models, we estimate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed method. Then we apply it to some real data sets to prove the validity of the method.", "paper_title": "Determination of motion parameters of a moving range sensor approximated by polynomials for rectification of distorted 3D data", "paper_id": "WOS:000295941400001"}
