This is considered such an important function because it is involved in the assignment of factory resources to production tasks. In this paper, an advanced planning model that simultaneously decides process plans and schedules was proposed for the manufacturing supply chain (MSC). The model was formulated with mixed integer programming, which considered alternative resources and sequences, a sequence-dependent setup and transportation times. The objective of the model was to analyze alternative resources and sequences to determine the schedules and operation sequences that minimize makespan. A new adaptive genetic algorithm approach was developed to solve the model. Numerical experiments were carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive genetic algorithm for advanced planning in manufacturing supply chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000240935400012"}
