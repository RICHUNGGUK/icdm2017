By fusing multiple propagated label volumes, the segmentation can be improved. We developed a model that predicts the improvement of labelling accuracy and precision based on the number of segmentations used as input. Using a cross-validation study on brain image data as well as numerical simulations, we verified the model. Fit parameters of this model are potential indicators of the quality of a given label propagation method or the consistency of the input segmentations used.", "paper_title": "Multiclassifier fusion in human brain MR segmentation: Modelling convergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700100"}
