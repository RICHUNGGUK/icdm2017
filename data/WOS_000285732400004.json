Based on the system model proposed by Yoon and Yoo [14], we propose a novel multi-authenticated encryption scheme using self-certified public keys. In the proposed scheme, the designated recipient can verify the validity of the recovered message and the binding of the singers' public keys and identities implicitly at the same time. We show that the proposed scheme is secure against the chosen ciphertext attack in the random oracle model. Some possible attacks on the proposed scheme are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Self-Certified Multi-authenticated Encryption Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000285732400004"}
