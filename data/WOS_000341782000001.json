Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses were tested using the data provided by 203 managers of medium-sized and large Spanish firms using regression analysis. Findings - The paper shows that firms have higher levels of strategic flexibility when their CEOs' social networks are larger. Furthermore, CEOs have more incentives to use strong social-networking ties to develop strategic flexibility when there exists a positive organizational climate and a high degree of environmental uncertainty. Practical implications - An understanding of these issues offers opportunities to assist CEOs embarking on a new strategic option or to become more effective in building and utilizing their networking activities or organizational climate. Originality/value - This study explores the paradox over the role of social networks regarding strategic flexibility in uncertain environments. Prior research has presented arguments that uncertainty may be addressed through a wide range of responses, from the promotion of entrepreneurial activities to the adoption of conservative attitudes. The multisector sample reveals evidence of both types of behavior, with each playing a different role with respect to strategic flexibility.", "paper_title": "Towards strategic flexibility: social networks, climate and uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000341782000001"}
