This paper proposes a metaheuristic approach to SCP that can scale up to large problems better than state-of-the-art complete methods, and exploits standard filtering algorithms to handle hard constraints more efficiently. For problems with many scenarios it can be combined with scenario reduction and sampling methods.", "paper_title": "Hybrid metaheuristics for stochastic constraint programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000347690400003"}
