Therefore, storage nodes are vulnerable to attack because of their importance. In this paper, we propose a privacy and integrity preserving protocol called SSQ, which is able to prevent compromised storage nodes from leaking sensitive data and allows the sink to detect the misbehaviors of compromised storage nodes. For privacy preserving, a size-limited bucketing technique is proposed to mix the data in a range, and a prefix membership verification technique based on Bloom filters is developed to perform skyline queries on encrypted data items. For integrity preserving, a Merkle hash tree-based technique is investigated to prevent compromised storage nodes from tampering and dropping data. Detailed performance evaluations confirm the high efficacy and efficiency of SSQ.
