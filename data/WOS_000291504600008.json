The conversion property further enables the designated recipient to reveal an ordinary signature for dealing with a later dispute over repudiation. Based on the EIGamal cryptosystem, in 2009, Lee et al. proposed a CAE scheme with only heuristic security analyses. In this paper, we will demonstrate that their scheme is vulnerable to the chosen-plaintext attack and then further propose an improved variant. Additionally, in the random oracle model, we prove that the improved scheme achieves confidentiality against indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and unforgeability against existential forgery under adaptive chosen-message attacks (EF-CMA).
