Digital images are increasingly transmitted over non-secure channels such as the Internet. Therefore, military, medical and quality control images must be protected against attempts to manipulate them; such manipulations could tamper the decisions based on these images. To protect the authenticity of multimedia images, several approaches have been proposed. These approaches include conventional cryptography, fragile and semi-fragile watermarking and digital signatures that are based on the image content. The aim of this paper is to present a survey and a comparison of emerging techniques for image authentication. Methods are classified according to the service they provide, that is strict or selective authentication, tamper detection, localization and reconstruction capabilities and robustness against different desired image processing operations. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of image content and discuss the most important requirements for an effective image authentication system design. Different algorithms are described and we focus on their comparison according to the properties cited above.", "paper_title": "Methods for image authentication: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000256622500001"}
