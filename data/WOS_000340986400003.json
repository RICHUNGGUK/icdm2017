It raises an interesting issue of accurately formalizing specified performance requirements by taking consideration of data values of the protocol messages. In this paper, we present a novel logic-based testing approach to check protocol performance requirements through real execution traces and formally specified properties. In order to evaluate and assess our methodology, we develop a prototype and present experiments through a set of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) properties. Finally, a performance benchmark method is proposed and relevant verdicts and discussions are provided. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
