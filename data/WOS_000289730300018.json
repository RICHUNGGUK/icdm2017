The proposed call admission control algorithm estimates the network throughput by using a local linear model in terms of a control parameter of the proposed scheduling algorithm, and performs its own functions based on the information. The proposed scheduling algorithm continuously updates the control parameter to pursue an effective tradeoff between the quality-of-service of video streaming and the network throughput. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the performance of the proposed video streaming system.", "paper_title": "QoS-aware joint working packet scheduling and call admission control for video streaming service over WiMAX network", "paper_id": "WOS:000289730300018"}
