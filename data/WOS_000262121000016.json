The X, Y, Z relaxed Descartes coordinates of the atoms were calculated as a linear combination of the eigenvectors. We found that the partial sums generated three-dimensional structures only if they contained all the three bi-lobal eigenvectors of the Laplacian. We obtained partial sums that produced satisfactory initial coordinates for molecular mechanics calculations.", "paper_title": "Shape analysis of carbon nanotube junctions", "paper_id": "WOS:000262121000016"}
