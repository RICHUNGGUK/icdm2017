It uses a novel bias circuit for implementing a PT-invariant transconductor using a MOSFET in triode region. Measurements show that the transconductance varies only by +/- 3.4% across 18 fabricated chips and over temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 100 degrees C. Simulations show that variation of the transconductance across process corners is +/- 6.7% and across temperature range of 0 degrees C to 100 degrees C is +/- 1.6%. The proposed PT-invariant transconductor has the minimum variation among the fully on-chip transconductors reported so far. The proposed circuit consumes 136 mu W of power.", "paper_title": "A Fully On-Chip PT-Invariant Transconductor", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208100039"}
