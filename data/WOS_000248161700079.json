Since the authoring environment for Flash is initially developed for non-programmers, it is easy to learn even for those having no previous knowledge in programming language, although some previous experience in programming may help in mastering advanced features of ActionScript, an object-oriented programming language used for developing Flash programs. The most attractive feature of Flash is its strong graphic capability not available in other standard programming languages. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
