We first show that under a natural cost assumption, it is sufficient to optimize over a stock-dominant relaxation. We further study the polyhedral structure of a strong relaxation of this problem involving only initial inventory variables and setup variables. We consider several variants: uncapacitated at both levels with or without start-up costs, uncapacitated at the upper level and constant capacity at the lower level, constant capacity at both levels. We finally demonstrate how the strong formulations described improve our ability to solve instances with up to several dozens of periods and a few hundred products.", "paper_title": "Relaxations for two-level multi-item lot-sizing problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884700018"}
