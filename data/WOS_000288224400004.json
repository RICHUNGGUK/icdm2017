Orthogonal Latin Square Code (OLSC) can protect the interconnection against transient errors, while also lowering energy consumption. When applied to a 64-bit link using a 45-nm CMOS technology with low-swing signaling, OLSC provided up to 55% energy reduction, with only a small area overhead and no loss in reliability.", "paper_title": "Low-Power, Resilient Interconnection with Orthogonal Latin Squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000288224400004"}
