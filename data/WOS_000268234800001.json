Complexity arises in mobile robotic systems because the computing platform travels through the environment with which the system is interacting. These systems have spatio-temporal requirements in the sense that correct behavior is defined in terms of both space and time. The focus of this paper is mobile robotic platforms that must sense their environment and avoid obstacles as they navigate from one point to another. We present a design and analysis methodology for these platforms that integrates spatio-temporal attributes with fixed priority real-time scheduling through the use or-zone and processing window abstractions.", "paper_title": "Modelling computational requirements of mobile robotic systems using zones and processing windows", "paper_id": "WOS:000268234800001"}
