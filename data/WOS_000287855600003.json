We recorded beat-to-beat pulse interval (PI) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in 14 DM patients and 14 matched healthy controls. We computed the information domain synchronization index (IDSI), cross-multiscale entropy, joint symbolic dynamics, information-based similarity index (IBSI) in addition to time domain and spectral measures of BRS. This multi parametric analysis showed that baroreflex gain is well-preserved, but the time delay within the baroreflex loop is significantly increased in patients with DM. Further, the level of similarity between blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations was significantly reduced in DM. In conclusion, baroreflex function in young DM patients is changed. The quantification of nonlinear similarity and baroreflex delay in addition to baroreflex gain may provide an improved diagnostic tool for detection of subclinical autonomic dysfunction in DM.", "paper_title": "Baroreflex analysis in diabetes mellitus: linear and nonlinear approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000287855600003"}
