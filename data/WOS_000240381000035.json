Unlike current pixel-, patch- or texton-based schemes, that operate in image space, our approach is structural. We propose to assimilate texture images to corresponding 2D geometric meshes (called texture meshes). Our analysis mainly consists in generating automatically these meshes, while synthesis is then based on the creation of new vertex/polygon distributions matching some arrangement map. The output texture image is obtained by rasterizing the previously generated polygons using graphics hardware capabilities, which guarantees high speed performance. By operating in geometry space instead of image/pixel space, the proposed structural approach has a major advantage over current techniques: beyond pure texture reproduction, it allows us to define various tools, which allow users to further modify locally or globally and in real-time structural components of textures. By controlling the arrangement map, users can substitute new meshes in order to completely modify the structural appearance of input textures, yet maintaining a certain visual resemblance with the initial example image.", "paper_title": "Real-time structured texture synthesis and editing using image-mesh analogies", "paper_id": "WOS:000240381000035"}
