In the multiple antenna systems, the CS-CL-OSTBC not only achieves full rate and full diversity with linear maximum-likelihood detection but also obtains higher feedback gain than existing CL-OSTBCs due to more efficient utilization of channel feedback information. In the proposed scheme, all the complex-valued channel coefficients are rotated to positive real values with exact channel phase feedback information. As a result, the channel gain can be expressed as the square of the sum of all positive real values and can obtain the maximum value without any loss. Simulation results on bit error rate performance show that the CS-CL-OSTBC outperforms existing CL-OSTBCs for various modulation schemes.", "paper_title": "Four-Transmit-Antenna Closed-Loop Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code with Efficient Feedback Utilization", "paper_id": "WOS:000285489200024"}
