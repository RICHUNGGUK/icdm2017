First, based on fracture mechanics and the energy principle of Paris, the training data are generated by a set of FE-model-based equations in different crack cases. Then the validation of the method is verified by several selected crack cases. The results show that the trained ANN models have good performance to identify the crack location and depth with higher accuracy and efficiency, further, can be used in fast identification of crack fault in rotating machinery.", "paper_title": "Identification of crack location and depth in rotating machinery based on artificial neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300144"}
