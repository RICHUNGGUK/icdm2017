Theoretical analysis shows that these two algorithms are essentially the same. In this paper, an intelligible method is proposed, which is based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the cross-correlation of whitened source signals at a given time tag. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method has better extraction performance. Moreover, a great deal of experiments with AGWN show that Li and Zhang's method is slightly inferior to the Barros and Cicochi's, which is opposite to the claim by Li and Zhang.", "paper_title": "Notes on two temporal structure-based methods for blind extraction of fetal electrocardiogram", "paper_id": "WOS:000308825000015"}
