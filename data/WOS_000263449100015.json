By considering the weight of the links, each node orders its one-hop neighbors in an ordered list and then the ordered lists are exchanged between the neighbors. This information enables the nodes to compute their transmission radius on the basis of its one- and two-hop neighbors' information. We demonstrate that compared to the best known algorithms, the degree and transmission radius of the nodes in the topology produced by the proposed algorithm are smaller. In addition to Euclidean graphs, the algorithm works correctly on general weighted graphs. Also an extension of our algorithm is proposed which adapts its topology to network changes. Finally, we use the four metrics, node degree, transmission radius, the power stretch factor and, packet loss ratio to measure the performance improvements of the presented algorithms through simulations.
