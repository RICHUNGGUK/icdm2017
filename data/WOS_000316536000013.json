Firstly we postulate the existence of an intrinsic (i.e. rate-independent) fracture energy. Secondly, within a thermodynamically consistent damage-mechanics framework we assume that the evolution of the damage variable is related to the current free energy and to the intrinsic fracture energy. The underlying idea is that the energy of the bonds at the micro-level is rate-independent and that the rate-dependence of the overall dissipated energy during crack propagation is a natural by-product of the visco-elastic dissipation lumped on the zero-thickness interface. Quite good agreement within an expected range of loading rates was obtained between numerical and experimental results for a DCB specimen with steel arms bonded through a rubber interface. This is despite the fact that for this application the model has been kept as simple as possible using a quadratic elastic energy and linear visco-elasticity with one relaxation time only. Therefore, the presented results support the fundamental principles behind the proposed approach and indicate that the model has the potential to be refined into a highly accurate tool of analysis based on sound physical arguments.
