The results show that the selectivity of the inhibitor for two isozymes is due to the different side chain lengths between N67 of hCA II and Q64 of hCA VII. One more methene group in the side chain of Q64 of hCA VII makes it possible to form the hydrogen bond with the bromide atom of the known inhibitor. From the point of view, the modification to the known inhibitor was performed to obtain an inhibitor with higher selectivity. The complex conformations of the new designed inhibitor and two isozymes designate the formation of the hydrogen bond between the newly added group (hydroxypropyl group) and Q64 of hCA VII but N67 of hCA II. The results of the binding free energy from the MM/PBSA approach also prove the selectivity improvement of the new inhibitor in comparison with the known inhibitor. The work will help the design of the isozyme-specific inhibitors of hCA VII. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
