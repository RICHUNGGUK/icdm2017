In this context, RAMSAS, a modelbased method which supports the reliability analysis of systems through simulation by combining the benefits of popular OMG modeling languages with wide adopted simulation and analysis environments, has been recently proposed. This paper shows the effectiveness of RAMSAS through a real case study concerning the reliability analysis of an Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) of a satellite.
