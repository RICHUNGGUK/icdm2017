The measured Raman shift indicates the pressure currently retained in the inclusions at ambient external conditions, such that entrapment PT conditions (i.e., P and T of garnet growth) can be determined by elastic modeling. Most generally, trapping P is obtained with this method, based on an independent estimate of T. Here we describe QuIB Calc, a MATLAB((R)) program that iteratively solves for garnet growth conditions using the pressure retained in quartz inclusions (as revealed by Raman peak shifts). The program explicitly accounts for the anomalous effects of the quartz lambda transition on the thermal expansivity, and utilizes a mixing subroutine to account for the physical properties of garnet solid solutions. QuIB Calc thus facilitates sophisticated PT calculations using quartz inclusions, and is particularly effective for geobarometry in high pressure terranes.
