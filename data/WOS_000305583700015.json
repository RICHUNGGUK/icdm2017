However, these algorithms assume an idealized continuous-time CSMA protocol where collisions can never occur. In addition, simulation results indicate that the delay performance of these algorithms can be quite bad. On the other hand, although some simple heuristics (such as greedy maximal scheduling) can yield much better delay performance for a large set of arrival rates, in general they may only achieve a fraction of the capacity region. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time version of the CSMA algorithm. Central to our results is a discrete-time distributed randomized algorithm that is based on a generalization of the so-called Glauber dynamics from statistical physics, where multiple links are allowed to update their states in a single timeslot. The algorithm generates collision-free transmission schedules while explicitly taking collisions into account during the control phase of the protocol, thus relaxing the perfect CSMA assumption. More importantly, the algorithm allows us to incorporate heuristics that lead to very good delay performance while retaining the throughput-optimality property.", "paper_title": "Q-CSMA: Queue-Length-Based CSMA/CA Algorithms for Achieving Maximum Throughput and Low Delay in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000305583700015"}
