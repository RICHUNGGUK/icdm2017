In this paper, an approach based on Binary Imperialistic Competitive algorithm and Nelder-Mead simplex search has been proposed for placement of fault indicators in distribution networks. By using this method, the problem of locating fault indicators can be solved faster and more accurately by minimizing of cost function. In this paper, in addition to describing the BICA-NM hybrid algorithm, the fault indicator placement has been implemented using this method on a test system, and the simulation results have been compared with Genetic algorithm (GA), Binary Shuffled Frog Leap Algorithm (BSFLA) and Improved BSFLA (IBSFLA) and the accuracy and fastness of the proposed method has been demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Application of BICA-NM hybrid algorithm for optimal locating of fault indicators in distribution networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332245500029"}
