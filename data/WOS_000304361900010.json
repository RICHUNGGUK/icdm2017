In particular, the contribution of this article is three-fold. First, the proposed SAMRS employs the robust solution search scheme (RS3) as an approximation of the computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulation, thus reducing the computation cost of fitness evaluation in VRPSD, while directing the search towards robust and reliable solutions. Furthermore, a self-adaptive individual learning based on the conceptual modelling of memeplex is introduced in the SAMRS. Finally, SAMRS incorporates a gene-meme co-evolution model with genetic and memetic representation to effectively manage the search for solutions in VRPSD. Extensive experimental results are then presented for benchmark problems to demonstrate that the proposed SAMRS serves as an efficable means of generating high-quality robust and reliable solutions in VRPSD.", "paper_title": "A self-adaptive memeplexes robust search scheme for solving stochastic demands vehicle routing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000304361900010"}
