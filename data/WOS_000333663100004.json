Here, an adaptable framework is presented for integrating and developing multimodel simulations. This framework allows independent development of component simulations, limits coordination overhead between developers, and allows modularity and flexibility in the overall multimodel simulation.", "paper_title": "User-Steered Energy Generation and Consumption Multimodel Simulation for Pricing and Policy Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000333663100004"}
