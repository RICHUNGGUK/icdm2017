Design/methodology/approach - The development of the whole set of magnetostatic discrete formulations is proposed. Four formulations are computed: two in terms of fields and two in terms of potentials. Moreover, each computation is carried out on the primal and dual mesh. Two applications are presented and the results are analysed and discussed. Findings - The whole set of magnetostatic formulations gives only two solutions. The solutions do not depend of the formulation, but they depend of the choice of the field discretisation in primal or dual mesh. Originality/value - The computation is carried out on the dual mesh.", "paper_title": "Numerical solutions in primal and dual meshes of magnetostatic problems solved with the finite integration technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300006"}
