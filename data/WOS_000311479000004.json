The goal is comparing robustness of predictor-based strategies with respect to other (sub) optimal state feedback ones. A numerical example illustrates that improvements in tolerance to modelling errors can be achieved by using the predictor framework.", "paper_title": "Robustness analysis of discrete predictor-based controllers for input-delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000311479000004"}
