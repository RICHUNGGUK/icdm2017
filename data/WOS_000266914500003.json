In order to map their relationship over the Internet, a Web co-link analysis was applied to 18 websites of science centres and museums affiliated to the Network for the Popularization of Science and Technology in Latin America and the Caribbean - RedPOP. Clustering analysis, multidimensional scaling (MDS) and an analysis of all pages with links to at least two websites were performed. Results showed that language barriers played a prominent role in clustering, with external recognition by the target public representing a secondary issue.", "paper_title": "Mapping the web relations of science centres and museums from Latin America", "paper_id": "WOS:000266914500003"}
