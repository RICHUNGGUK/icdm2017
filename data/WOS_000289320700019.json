An eigenvalue analysis of the conservation part of the equations shows that the loss of hyperbolicity is due only to the reaction exerted by each fluid onto the other at the interface between the fluids. Three Riemann solvers derived from the HLL formalism are presented. In the first solver, the pressure-induced terms are accounted for by the source term; in the second solver, they are incorporated into the fluxes; the third solver uses the same formulation as the first, except that the mass and momentum balance for the bottom layer are replaced with the balance equations for the system formed by the two layers as a whole. Numerical results using the three solvers are presented for (1) static conditions such as two fluids of identical densities at rest above each other, (2) dam-break flows involving the collapse of a body of light fluid over a uniform layer of a denser fluid, and (3) Liska and Wendroffs ill-posed test cases [24] involving two-layer flows over a topographic bump. The three solvers produce quasi-undistinguishable results for the dam-break flows, and produce sharp solutions over the full range of density ratio, from 0 to 1. However, only the third solver allows a strict preservation of static configurations. Moreover, a method is proposed to assess the convergence of the numerical solutions in the configurations for which no analytical solution can be obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
