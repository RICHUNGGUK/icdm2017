One of the most important techniques in data pre-processing for classification is feature selection. Less relevant or highly correlated features decrease, in general, the classification accuracy and enlarge the complexity of the classifier. The goal is to find a reduced set of features that reveals the best classification accuracy for a classifier. Rule-based fuzzy models can be acquired from numerical data, and be used as classifiers. As rule based structures revealed to be a useful qualitative description for classification systems, this work uses fuzzy models as classifiers. This paper proposes an algorithm for feature selection based on two cooperative ant colonies, which minimizes two objectives: the number of features and the classification error. Two pheromone matrices and two different heuristics are used for these objectives. The performance of the method is compared with other features selection methods, achieving equal or better performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
