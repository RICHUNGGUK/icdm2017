This paper proposes a modified EDA (mEDA) for digital filter design. mEDA uses a novel sampling method, called centro-individual sampling, and a fuzzy C-means clustering technique to improve its performance. Extensive experiments conducted on a set of benchmark functions show that mEDA outperforms seven algorithms reported in the literature, in terms of the quality of solutions. Four types of digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filters are designed by using mEDA and the results show that mEDA can obtain better filter performance than four state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "A Modified Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for Digital Filter Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000306552400005"}
