The proposed method considers the bi-symmetrical weighted function and the bi-symmetrical weighted distance of fuzzy numbers for ranking fuzzy numbers. We also use some comparative examples to illustrate the advantage of the proposed method with the existing metric index ranking methods. The process of this method is easier than that of other. This method can effectively rank various fuzzy numbers, their images and overcome the shortcomings of the previous techniques.", "paper_title": "The Performance Order of Fuzzy Numbers Based on Bi-Symmetrical Weighted Distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000318195300008"}
