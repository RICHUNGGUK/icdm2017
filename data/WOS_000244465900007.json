In this paper, we study the optimal embeddings of paths of all possible lengths between two arbitrary distinct nodes in twisted cubes. We use TQn to denote the n-dimensional twisted cube and use dist(TQn; u; v_ to denote the distance between two nodes u and v in TQn, where n >= 1 is an odd integer. The original contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) We prove that a path of length l can be embedded between u and v with dilation 1 for any two distinct nodes u and v and any integer l with dist(TQn; u; v) + 2 <= l <= 2(n) - 1 (n >= 3) and 2) we find that there exist two nodes u and v such that no path of length dist(TQn; u; v) + 1 can be embedded between u and v with dilation 1 (n >= 3). The special cases for the nonexistence and existence of embeddings of paths between nodes u and v and with length dist(TQn; u; v) + 1 are also discussed. The embeddings discussed in this paper are optimal in the sense that they have dilation 1.", "paper_title": "Optimal embeddings of paths with various lengths in twisted cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000244465900007"}
