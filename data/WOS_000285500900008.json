The insight gained from this reformulation renders a broader, more encompassing inversion methodology based on a (pseudo) cross-coherence matrix associated to the singular vectors of the scattering or response matrix and the singular vectors intrinsic to a given, hypothesized support region for the scatterers (under a known background Green's function associated to a known embedding medium where the scatterers reside). A number of new imaging functionals based on that cross-coherence matrix are proposed and numerically shown to perform well in both imaging and shape reconstruction problems. The proposed approaches do not require for their implementation the estimation of a cutoff in the singular value spectrum separating signal from noise subspaces, which is a common computational difficulty in signal subspace methods. In the shape reconstruction context it is also shown how to combine the signal subspace approach with the level set method.", "paper_title": "Reinterpretation and Enhancement of Signal-Subspace-Based Imaging Methods for Extended Scatterers", "paper_id": "WOS:000285500900008"}
