In this system, each user tries to minimize its number of transmission attempts while meeting the throughput demand. The user interaction in such an ALOHA network is modeled as a random access game. A novel technique to better exploit the channel state information (CSI) named adaptive CSI transmission method is proposed. Benchmarking with the no-CSI method and threshold-based CSI method, it is revealed that the proposed adaptive CSI method can yield up to 9.9% more throughput and 12.3% power reduction. Two simple yet effective guidelines on selecting among these CSI-related methods are formulated for systems with different SNRs and capture ratios. A distributed algorithm is proposed to find the optimal transmission probability. Both analytical and simulation results show that the algorithm exhibits fast convergence speed and is robustness against changes on the number of active nodes in the network.", "paper_title": "Distributed Transmission Probability Control in Fading Channel with State Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000356308100001"}
