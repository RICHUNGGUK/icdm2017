DisGeNET allows user-friendly access to a new gene-disease database that we have developed by integrating data from several public sources. DisGeNET permits queries restricted to (i) the original data source, (ii) the association type, (iii) the disease class or (iv) specific gene(s)/disease(s). It represents gene-disease associations in terms of bipartite graphs and provides gene centric and disease centric views of the data. It assists the user in the interpretation and exploration of the genetic basis of human diseases by a variety of built-in functions. Moreover, DisGeNET permits multicolouring of nodes (genes/diseases) according to standard disease classification for expedient visualization.", "paper_title": "DisGeNET: a Cytoscape plugin to visualize, integrate, search and analyze gene-disease networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283919800027"}
