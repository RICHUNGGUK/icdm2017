However, their more broad use is still limited by the relatively high costs of their application. It seems that these limitations are partly caused by some essential characteristics and some weaknesses of these techniques. In this paper we propose a radically new knowledge representation and interpretation technique, NIMFA, specialized for knowledge expressed in natural languages. To test the basic ideas underlying NIMFA we have implemented a prototype Information Center that provides answers to natural language queries using Web services. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
