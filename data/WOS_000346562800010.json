The authors compare the discriminative power of global and local signature features between mobile devices and pen tablets, which are the prevalent acquisition device in the research literature. Individual feature discriminant ratios and feature selection techniques are used for comparison. Experiments are conducted on standard signature benchmark databases (BioSecure database) and a state-of-the-art device (Samsung Galaxy Note). Results show a decrease in the feature discriminative power and a higher verification error rate on handheld devices. It is found that one of the main causes of performance degradation on handheld devices is the absence of pen-up trajectory information (i.e. data acquired when the pen tip is not in contact with the writing surface).", "paper_title": "Mobile signature verification: feature robustness and performance comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000346562800010"}
