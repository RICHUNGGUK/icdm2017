Instead of simply fitting various data to a few predefined semantic object categories, we propose to generate proper results for different object instances based on their actual visual appearances. The results can be fine-grained and layered categorization along with absolute or relative localization. We present a generic model based on structured prediction and an efficient online learning algorithm to solve it. Experiments on a new benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and its superiority against traditional recognition methods.", "paper_title": "FINE-GRAINED AND LAYERED OBJECT RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000308104300005"}
