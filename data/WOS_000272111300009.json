This paper presents the small signal analysis of droop based generation control schemes for parallel connected DG inverters comprising of active power-frequency and reactive power-voltage controllers. Small-signal models are developed for microgrids consisting of several DGs connected in a parallel configuration. Mathematical propositions that develop sufficiency conditions for stability of the system are developed.", "paper_title": "SMALL SIGNAL STABILITY OF A MICROGRID WITH PARALLEL CONNECTED DISTRIBUTED GENERATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000272111300009"}
