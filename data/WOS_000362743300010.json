However, traditional approaches present several limitations, which reduce significantly their performance. Evolutionary algorithms, and more specifically their optimization capabilities, may be used in order to overcome particle-filtering weaknesses. In this paper, a novel FPGA-based particle filter that takes advantage of evolutionary computation in order to estimate motion patterns is presented. The evolutionary algorithm, which has been included inside the resampling stage, mitigates the known sample impoverishment phenomenon, very common in particle-filtering systems. In addition, a hybrid mutation technique using two different mutation operators, each of them with a specific purpose, is proposed in order to enhance estimation results and make a more robust system. Moreover, implementing the proposed Evolutionary Particle Filter as a hardware accelerator has led to faster processing times than different software implementations of the same algorithm.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Computing and Particle Filtering: A Hardware-Based Motion Estimation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000362743300010"}
