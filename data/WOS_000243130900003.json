We discuss the transition from verification conditions to verification constraints that occurs when the deductive method is applied to parameterized assertions instead of fixed expressions (e.g., p(0) + p(1)j + p(2)k >= 0, for parameters p(0), p(i), and p(2), instead of 3 + j - k >= 0) in order to discover inductive assertions. We then introduce two new verification constraint forms that enable the incremental and property-directed construction of inductive assertions. We describe an iterative method for solving the resulting constraint problems. The main advantage of this approach is that it uses off-the-shelf constraint solvers and thus directly benefits from progress in constraint solving.", "paper_title": "Verification constraint problems with strengthening", "paper_id": "WOS:000243130900003"}
