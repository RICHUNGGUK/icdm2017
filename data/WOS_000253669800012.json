However, a complex 2D curve flower pattern can be easily acquired or drawn by handcraft or a drawing software. This paper presents a quick integrative 3D modeling method of complex carving surface based on a 2D curve flower pattern. The proposed method uses a scanning analysis algorithm, a normal distribution function and a distance function to model and create carving tracks. In this paper, the delamination, combination and interpolation of modelling process are described as well. The provided research method will make the modelling of complex carving surface more intelligent, agile, and will meet the requirement of integrative 3D modelling of digital art carving. Experimental results show that this method is of quick modelling and multi-model effective characteristics with realizable interactive designing and excellent practicability. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
