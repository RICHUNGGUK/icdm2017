A 3D geological model was constructed from various geological maps, cross sections, boreholes, and gravity and magnetic data. Geological features associated with mineralization were extracted using the 3D geological model and metallogenic models of porphyry and skarn-type Mo and Pb-Zn-Ag deposits. The multifractal method, principal component analysis, and power spectrum-area method were used to separate regional variability from local variability in the geochemical data. A 2.5D forward modeling of gravity and magnetic data was carried out to define the geometry, depth, and physical properties of geological bodies at depth. 3D visualization of the results assisted in understanding the spatial relations between the deposits and the other geological bodies (e.g., igneous intrusions). The PNN method was applied to represent and integrate multiple anomalies for mineral potential modeling. The concentration-area fractal method was used to classify the PNN mineral potential model. Three levels (ground surface and two subsurface horizontal planes) of mineral potential models were evaluated for undiscovered Mo and Pb-Zn-Ag deposits. Validation of the results shows that 3D modeling was useful for not only accurately extracting geological features but also for predicting potential mineral targets and evaluating mineral resources. The mineral potential targets identified consist of eight Mo potential targets and 15 Pb-Zn-Ag potential targets. Based on grade-tonnage data from the known Mo and Pb-Zn-Ag deposits and the results of 3D modeling, estimated potential resources of each of these types of deposits are 10.8 and 153.1 Mt (Pb+Zn is 152.9 Mt and Ag is 0.92 Mt), respectively.
