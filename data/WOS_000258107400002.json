In the case when the utility of each player is a monotone submodular function, we prove that there is no polynomial time approximation algorithm which approximates the maximum social welfare by a factor better than 1-1/e similar or equal to 0.632, unless P=NP. Our result is based on a reduction from a multi-prover proof system for MAX-3-COLORING.", "paper_title": "Inapproximability results for combinatorial auctions with submodular utility functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258107400002"}
