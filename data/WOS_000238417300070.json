The research includes (1) development of a general mathematical framework and a family of mathematical and computational models of bio-heat transfer, tissue damage, and tumor viability, (2) dynamic calibration, verification and validation processes based on laboratory and clinical data and simulated response, and (3) design of effective thermo-therapeutic protocols using model predictions. At the core of the proposed systems is the adaptive-feedback control of mathematical and computational models based on a posteriori estimates of errors in key quantities of interest, and modern Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging (MRTI), and diode laser devices to monitor treatment of tumors in laboratory animals. This approach enables an automated systematic model selection process based on acceptance criteria determined a priori. The methodologies to be implemented involve uncertainty quantification methods designed to provide an innovative, data-driven, patient-specific approach to effective cancer treatment.", "paper_title": "Development of a computational paradigm for laser treatment of cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300070"}
