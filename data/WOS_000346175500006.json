So far, there have been two types of its extensions into higher dimensions: in the first type the maximum probability of nonlocal events is roughly 9% and remains the same as the dimension changes (dimension-independent), while in the second type the probability becomes larger as the dimension increases, reaching approximately 40% in the in finite limit. Here, we (i) give an alternative proof of the first type, (ii) study the situation in which the maximum probability of nonlocal events can also be dimension-independent in the second type and (iii) conjecture how the situation could be changed in order that (ii) still holds.", "paper_title": "Dimension-independent bounds for Hardy's experiment", "paper_id": "WOS:000346175500006"}
