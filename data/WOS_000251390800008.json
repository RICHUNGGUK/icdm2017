Let us mention, for instance, works on directional wavelets, steerable filters, dual-tree wavelet transform, curvelets, wave atoms, ridgelet packets, etc. In general, features that are best represented are straight lines or smooth curves as those de. ning contours of objects ( e. g. in curvelets processing) or oriented textures ( e. g. wave atoms, ridgelet packets). However, real images present also a set of details less oriented and more isotropic, like corners, spots, texture components, etc. This paper develops an adaptive representation for all these image elements, ranging from highly directional ones to fully isotropic ones. This new tool can indeed be tuned relatively to these image features by decomposing them into a Littlewood-Paley frame of directional wavelets with variable angular selectivity. Within such a decomposition, 2D wavelets inherit some particularities of the biorthogonal circular multiresolution framework in their angular behavior. Our method can therefore be seen as an angular multiselectivity analysis of images. Two applications of the proposed method are given at the end of the paper, namely, in the fields of image denoising and N-term nonlinear approximation.", "paper_title": "Multiselective pyramidal decomposition of images: Wavelets with adaptive angular selectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000251390800008"}
