In this paper, I show that this algorithm may be considered as a constrained decision tree ensemble and use this interpretation to introduce a series of modifications which enable the use of random ferns in general machine learning problems. Moreover, I extend the method with an internal error approximation and an attribute importance measure based on corresponding features of the random forest algorithm. I also present the R package rFerns containing an efficient implementation of this modified version of random ferns.", "paper_title": "rFerns: An Implementation of the Random Ferns Method for General-Purpose Machine Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000349841700001"}
