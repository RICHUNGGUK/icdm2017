The piezo-actuated stage utilizes a monolithic flexure-based mechanism (FBM) to achieve translations in X- and Y-axes instead of using stacked mechanisms. A hysteresis model with crossover term is proposed to alleviate the cross coupling effect between X- and Y-stages during precision positioning tasks. System identifications using real-coded genetic algorithm (RCA) and clonal selection algorithm (CSA) are compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results show that PSO provides better performance than the others. Therefore, a feedforward controller with cross-axis coupling compensation is studied and the used for the piezo-actuated FBM to enhance the precision of the coarse positioning stage. The experimental results confirm that the proposed controller can achieve precision tracking tasks with submicron precision. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
