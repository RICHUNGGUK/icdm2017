Our main theorem says that, if NP does not have measure 0 in EXP, then there exist disjoint pairs of NP languages that are P-inseparable, in fact -inseparable. We also relate these conditions to strong hypotheses concerning randomness and genericity of disjoint pairs.", "paper_title": "Inseparability and Strong Hypotheses for Disjoint NP Pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000304154600006"}
