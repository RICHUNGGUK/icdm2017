By exploiting the mathematical identities and hybrid architecture, the mean error and mean squarer error of the proposed squarer are reduced by up to 40%, compared with the best previous method presented in literature. Moreover, the proposed method can improve the speed and reduce the area of the squarer circuit. The implementation and chip measurement results in 0.18-mu m CMOS technology are also presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "An Improved Hybrid LUT-Based Architecture for Low-Error and Efficient Fixed-Width Squarer", "paper_id": "WOS:000306198400008"}
