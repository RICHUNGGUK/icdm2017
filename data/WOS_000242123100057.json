In this paper, an intelligent synchronization scheme is presented for the efficient use of WLAN convergence systems. The approach consists of intelligent protocol identification and intelligent frequency synchronization. Simulation results indicate that using the algorithm, the synchronization performance can significantly be improved in WLAN convergence systems.", "paper_title": "An intelligent synchronization scheme for WLAN convergence systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100057"}
