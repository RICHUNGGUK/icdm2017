The proposed method has a number of attractive computational properties: parameter-free, avoiding higher-order derivatives or edge-based data structures. Error estimates of the velocity and the pressure are obtained for both the continuous and the fully discrete versions. Finally, some numerical experiments show that this method is highly efficient for the non-stationary Navier-Stokes equations.", "paper_title": "A characteristic stabilized finite element method for the non-stationary Navier-Stokes equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000294691900004"}
