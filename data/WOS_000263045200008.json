In this paper, we show that combining both strategies, taking advantage of their individual properties, provides an improvement, particularly for correlated data sets. The combined strategy consists in deriving an enriched (generalized) dissimilarity representation by using the nearest feature rules, namely feature lines and feature planes. On top of that enriched representation, Bayesian classifiers can be constructed in order to obtain a good generalization. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
