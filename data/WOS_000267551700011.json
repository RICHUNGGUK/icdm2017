In this paper, a characterization of the aperiodicity in existential terms of some state is given. At the same time, a P system with external output is associated with any irreducible Markov chain. The designed system provides the aperiodicity of that Markov chain and spends a polynomial amount of resources with respect to the size of the input. A comparative analysis with respect to another known solution is described.", "paper_title": "P Systems Computing the Period of Irreducible Markov Chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000267551700011"}
