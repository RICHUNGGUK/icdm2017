For this reason, clock meshes are used in most high-performance designs, but this robustness consumes significant power. In this work, we present two techniques to optimize high-performance clock meshes. The first technique is a mesh perturbation methodology for nonuniform mesh routing. The second technique is a skew-aware buffer placement through iterative buffer deletion. We demonstrate how these optimizations can achieve significant power reductions and a near elimination of short-circuit power. In addition, the total wire length is decreased, the number of required buffers is decreased, and both skew and robustness are improved on average when variation is considered.", "paper_title": "High-Performance Clock Mesh Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000307079000015"}
