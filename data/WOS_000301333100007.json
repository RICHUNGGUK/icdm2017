It is shown that the blocking probability of high data rate requests is usually higher than the blocking probability of other requests. A relevant strategy aimed at solving this problem is proposed, investigated, and compared with the known solution. Numerical results confirm that the proposed strategy is able to substantially reduce the blocking probability of high data rate requests at the cost of increased utilization of the packet switching layer and more complex routing of lightpaths.", "paper_title": "Resource provisioning for multigranular traffic flows in multilayer networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301333100007"}
