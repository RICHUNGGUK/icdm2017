The redundancy allocation problem involves setting reliability objectives for components or subsystems in order to meet the resource consumption constraint, e.g. the total cost. RAP has been an active area of research for the past four decades. The difficulty that one is confronted with the RAP is the maintenance of feasibility with respect to three nonlinear constraints, namely, cost, weight and volume related constraints. In this paper nonlinearly mixed-integer reliability design problems are investigated where both the number of redundancy components and the corresponding component reliability in each subsystem are to be decided simultaneously so as to maximize the reliability of the system. The reliability design problems have been studied in the literature for decades, usually using mathematical programming or heuristic optimization approaches. To the best of our knowledge the ABC algorithm can search over promising feasible and infeasible regions to find the feasible optimal/near-optimal solution effectively and efficiently; numerical examples indicate that the proposed approach performs well with the reliability redundant allocation design problems considered in this paper and computational results compare favorably with previously-developed algorithms in the literature.
