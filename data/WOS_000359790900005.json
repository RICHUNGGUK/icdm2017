Firstly, the shortcomings of some existing arithmetic operations of trapezoidal IT2FNs are discussed along with their ranking methods, before some new arithmetic operations and ranking rules are proposed. Secondly, some new aggregation operators including the arithmetic averaging aggregation operator, the ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator and the hybrid weighted averaging aggregation operator for trapezoidal IT2FNs are also developed. Thirdly, a new approach for MCGDM problems is developed based on the proposed operators and ranking rules. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the feasibility and validity of this new approach, and a comparison analysis referring to the same example is also presented.", "paper_title": "An Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Number Based Approach for Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359790900005"}
