These various options can be used to incorporate various styles Or computation (set-theoretic, probabilistic, quantum) inside categories of C*-algebras. At first, this paper concentrates on the commutative case and shows that there are functors from several Kleisli categories, of monads that are relevant to model probabilistic computations, to categories of C*-algebras. T his yields a new probabilistic version of Gelfand duality, involving the \"Radon\" monad on the category of compact Hausdorff spaces. We then show that the state space functor from C*-algebras to Eilenberg-Moore algebras of the Radon monad is full and faithful. This allows us to obtain an appropriately commuting state-and-effect triangle for C*-algebras.", "paper_title": "FROM KLEISLI CATEGORIES TO COMMUTATIVE C*-ALGEBRAS: PROBABILISTIC GELFAND DUALITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000359470700001"}
