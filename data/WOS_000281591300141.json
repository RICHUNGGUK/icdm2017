In this paper, we propose a system based on multiple-kernel support vector machines for counterfeit banknote recognition. A support vector machine (SVM) to minimize false rates is developed. Each banknote is divided into partitions and the luminance histograms of the partitions are taken as the input of the system. Each partition is associated with its own kernels. Linearly weighted combination is adopted to combine multiple kernels into a combined matrix. Optimal weights with kernel matrices in the combination are obtained through semi-definite programming (SDP) learning. Two strategies are adopted to reduce the amount of time and space required by the SDP method. One strategy assumes the non-negativity of the kernel weights, and the other one is to set the sum of the weights to be unity. Experiments with Taiwanese banknotes show that the proposed approach outperforms single-kernel SVMs, standard SVMs with SDP, and multiple-SVM classifiers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
