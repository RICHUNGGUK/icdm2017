An existing scheme is preferable in its capability but incurs computation time that can be prohibitively large for some real-time systems, such as automotive control systems. Our proposed scheme, which we call voting sharing, can substantially reduce the computation time by sharing the diagnosis result obtained by each node with all nodes in the system. We clarify the properties of the voting sharing scheme with respect to fault tolerance and show some experimental results.", "paper_title": "Voting Sharing: An Approach to Reducing Computation Time for Fault Diagnosis in Time-Triggered Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100021"}
