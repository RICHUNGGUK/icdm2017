Designtmethodology/approach - A conceptual approach is taken. Findings - In the naive and the modem axiomatic set theories, it is a well-known fact that each predicate determines precisely one set. That is to say, for any precisely defined predicate P, there is always A = {x vertical bar P(x)} or x is an element of A <-> P(x). However, when the authors are influenced by the thinking logic of allowing both kinds of infinities and compare these two kinds of infinities, and potentially infinite and actually infinite intervals and number sets, it is found that the expressions of these number sets are not completely reasonable. Originality/value - Detailed analyses are given for the introduction of new symbols and representations for either potential or actual infinite sets.", "paper_title": "Problem of infinity between predicates and infinite sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000256048100017"}
