This paper presents a memetic algorithm for MSCP based on a tabu search procedure with two neighborhoods and a multi-parent crossover operator. Experiments on a set of 77 well-known DIMACS and COLOR 2002-2004 benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm achieves highly competitive results in comparison with five state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, the proposed algorithm can improve the best known results for 15 instances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
