The design is made in multiple layers which help to process information simultaneously, in different layers. Various components of CLB like (4 x 16) Decoder, Memory units, Multiplexers and RS-Flip flops are all designed in multiple layers using higher input majority gates to reduce the cell count and latency compared to previous designs. QCA Designer tool is used to design and simulate the model. The Coherence vector approximation is used for obtaining simulation results.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF A MULTI-LAYERED QCA CONFIGURABLE LOGIC BLOCK FOR FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000336384400013"}
