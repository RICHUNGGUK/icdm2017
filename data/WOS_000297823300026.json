In the HEDA, the individuals are encoded based on the extended active list (EAL) and decoded by serial schedule generation scheme (SGS), and a novel probability model updating mechanism is proposed for well sampling the promising searching region. To further improve the searching quality, a Forward-Backward iteration (FBI) and a permutation based local search method (PBLS) are incorporated into the EDA based search to enhance the exploitation ability. Simulation results based on benchmarks and comparisons with some existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HEDA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
