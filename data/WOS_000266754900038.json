We consider a case in which the demand at each customer is deterministic and relatively small compared to the vehicle capacity, and the customers are located closely such that a consolidated shipping strategy is appropriate. We develop constructive and improvement heuristics to obtain an approximate solution for this NP-hard problem and demonstrate their effectiveness through computational experiments.
