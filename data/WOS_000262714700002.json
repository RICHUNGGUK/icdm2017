However, such compressed video still suffers from the bad playback quality when packet loss occurs over unreliable networks. In this paper, we present an error concealment algorithm to tackle the whole-picture loss problem in H.264/AVC SVC when hierarchical B-picture coding is used to support temporal scalability. In the proposed algorithm, by taking advantage of the temporal relationship among the adjacent video pictures, the motion information of the lost picture is derived simply and efficiently based on the principle of temporal direct mode. Utilizing the derived motion information, the lost picture is concealed by performing motion compensation on the correctly received temporally previous and future video pictures. The experimental results, demonstrate that as a post-processing tool, the proposed error concealment algorithm is able to significantly improve both the objective and subjective qualities of the decoded video pictures in the presence of packet losses when compared to the error concealment algorithm used in H.264/AVC SVC reference software. The proposed method can also be applied to H.264/AVC with hierarchical R-picture coding for error concealment.", "paper_title": "Concealment of Whole-Picture Loss in Hierarchical B-Picture Scalable Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000262714700002"}
