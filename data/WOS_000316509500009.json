Replica management is one of the most important issues in the data grid, which can offer fast data access time, high data availability and low bandwidth consumption. Computing Intelligent Algorithm (CIA) has been proved to be effective in the solution of large-scale distributed computing problems, whereas Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) is one of these excellent optimization algorithms and little literatures are made for its application in Data Grid Replica Management (DGRM). This paper focuses on the application of the QEA in data grid replica creation strategy. A QEA-based global replica creation strategy is proposed after reviewing the replica creation strategies. The optimization model is divided into single and multi data replica creation two parts. The representation, evaluation and constraint procedure three key technologies problems for each part are discussed in detail. The detail algorithm of QEA based replica creation is provided. The experiments were carried out with OptorSim, and the results have shown that QEA-based replica creation strategy can effectively reduce the job response time and network bandwidth consumption, comparing to Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. Especially, its performance becomes better and better with the incensement of the number of jobs. The non-parametric statistical tests are used to verify the significant of QEA.
