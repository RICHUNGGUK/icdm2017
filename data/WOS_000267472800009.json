The medial axis, i.e. the centers of maximal balls (balls which are not contained in any other ball), is a powerful tool for shape representation and analysis. The extraction of maximal disks is performed in the general case by testing the inclusion of a ball in a local neighborhood with covering relations usually represented by lookup tables. The proposed method determines if a mask induces a norm and in this case, computes the lookup tables and the test neighborhood based on geometric properties of the balls of chamfer norms, represented as H-polytopes. The method does not need to repeatedly scan the image space, and improves the computation time of both the test neighborhood detection and the lookup table computation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
