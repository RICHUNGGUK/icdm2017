In this paper, we propose to use a system of \"Two inverted pendulums Coupled by a Spring\" to extend the existing study to investigate: (1) asynchronised multi-rate sampling in a NCS, (2) random, distributed and discrete time delay in networked signal-transfer with possible loss of signals, (3) NCS for nonlinear systems, (4) Robust control of NCS with plant uncertainties and external disturbances, and (5) using NCS to implement controller structure beyond the limit of decentralised control. This system has been used, in the context of point-to-point connections, to study a number of control problems including a study on robust stabilisation of nonlinear systems via decentralised control. Therefore the performances of the system having a NCS structure can be compared with those having a traditional structure of fixed connections. The detailed model, some simulation results of the system under both of a traditional structure and a NCS structure, and proposed further studies are presented in the paper.", "paper_title": "A proposed case study for networked control system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300130"}
