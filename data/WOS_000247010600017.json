Based on approximations of potential distribution, our solution scheme successfully takes the effect of doping concentration in each region. It provides an accurate description for partially and fully depleted MOSFET devices in different regions of operation. Comparison with numerical data shows that the solution gives good approximations of potential for MOSFETs under different biases and geometry configurations. The solution can be applied to estimate classical and quantum electron density of nanoscale double-gate MOSFETs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
