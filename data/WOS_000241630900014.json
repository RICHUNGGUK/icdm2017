Address proxying serves many useful functions in IP networks. In IPv6, the Secure Neighbor Discovery Protocol (SEND) provides powerful tools for securing the mapping between the IP address and the link address which is the basis of local link address proxying; however, these tools don't work for address proxies. In this paper, we present an extension to SEND for secure proxying. As an example of how secure address proxying can be used, we propose. a minor extension of the Mobile IPv6 protocol to allow secure proxying by the home agent. We then present measurements comparing SEND with and without the address proxying extensions.", "paper_title": "IP address authorization for secure address proxying using multi-key CGAs and ring signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630900014"}
