In this paper, under the general settings, the realizations of the BELS method as a weighted instrumental variables (WIV) method in both direct and indirect closed-loop system identification are established through constructing an appropriate weighting matrix in the WIV method. The constructed structures are similar in both cases, which reveals that all the proof procedures of the two realizations are the same. Thus, the unified realizations of the BELS as the WIV method for the closed-loop system identification can be built. A simulation example is given to validate our theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Realizations of BELS as WIV method in both direct and indirect closed-loop system identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000264923700015"}
