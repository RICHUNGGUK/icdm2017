To this end, a new GP that effectively handles multi-class problems is developed. In accordance with multi-tree structure, GP operators are innovated: crossover exchanges every subtree of parents without suffering from any incongruity problem and mutation fine-tunes candidate solutions by a less destructive process. Experimental results verifies the effectiveness of the proposed GP classifier over existing references.", "paper_title": "An efficient GP approach to recognizing cognitive tasks from fNIRS neural signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500024"}
