If most of the nodes in a network start to behave in this way, either a portion of the network would be isolated or total network functionality would be hampered. This behavior is known as selfishness. Therefore, selfishness mitigation and enforcing cooperation between nodes is very important to increase the availability of nodes and overall throughput and to achieve the robustness of the network. Both credit and reputation based mechanisms are used to attract nodes to forward others' packets. In light of this, we propose a game theoretic routing model, Secure Trusted Auction oriented Clustering based Routing Protocol (STACRP), to provide trusted framework for MANET. Two auction mechanisms procurement and Dutch are used to determine the forwarding cost-per-hop for intermediate nodes. Our model is lightweight in terms of computational and communication requirements, yet powerful in terms of flexibility in managing trust between nodes of heterogeneous deployments. It manages trust locally with minimal overhead in terms of extra messages. STACRP organizes the network into 1-hop disjoint clusters and elects the most qualified and trustworthy nodes as Clusterhead. The trust is quantified with carefully chosen parameters having deep impact on network functionality. The trust model is analyzed using Markov chain and is proven as continuous time Markov chain. The security analysis of the model is analyzed to guarantee that the proposed approach achieves a secure reliable routing solution for MANETs. The proposed model have been evaluated with a set of simulations that show STACRP detects selfish nodes and enforces cooperation between nodes and achieves better throughput and packet delivery ratio with lees routing overhead compare to AODV.", "paper_title": "STACRP: a secure trusted auction oriented clustering based routing protocol for MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000307985700008"}
