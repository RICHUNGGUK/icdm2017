The domain of the functions that define the problems is a convex set, which is determined by convex inequality constraints and affine equality constraints. The neural networks are based on gradient descent and exact penalization and the convergence analysis is based on a control Liapunov function analysis, since the dynamical system corresponding to each neural network may be viewed as a so-called variable structure closed loop control system.
