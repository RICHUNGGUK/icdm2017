In this work, we present an alternative expression for the parallel syndrome generation formula, with which CSE is able to search redundant computations in a maximally expanded space to achieve a significantly higher optimization efficiency. In particular, two search space expansion schemes are studied for syndrome generators of BCH and RS codes. Experiments demonstrate at most 81 % of area savings using the proposed optimization schemes, and the post-layout results show the power saving of 41 similar to 45 % compared to a straightforward design.", "paper_title": "Area-Efficient Parallel Syndrome Generators for Linear Block Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000343161400004"}
