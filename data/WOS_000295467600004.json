This is a highly common decision problem in the context of raster-based geographic information systems (GIS) and seems general enough to deserve inclusion in the standard functionality of such systems. Yet it is a computationally difficult optimization problem, for which no efficient exact solution method has been found. This article presents a new dynamic programming-based heuristic method for the problem. Its performance is tested with randomly generated raster layers with various degrees of spatial autocorrelation. Results suggest that the proposed heuristic is a promising alternative to the existing integer programming-based exact method, as it can handle significantly larger raster data with fair accuracy.", "paper_title": "A heuristic for the maximum value region problem in raster space", "paper_id": "WOS:000295467600004"}
