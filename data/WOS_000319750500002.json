Several elementary and then basic preservation properties of the new stochastic order under reliability operations of convolution, mixture, and shock models are discussed. We also derive characterizations of some well-known stochastic orders by the new order, and point out some results related to the weighted distributions. Some examples are included to illustrate the concepts.", "paper_title": "Reliability Analysis of the Harmonic Mean Inactivity Time Order", "paper_id": "WOS:000319750500002"}
