The new method is compared with the most popular Ahrens and Dieter method and the method proposed by Best. Like Ahrens and Dieter and Best methods our method also uses the acceptance-rejection principle. But it is observed that our method has greater acceptance proportion than Ahrens and Dieter or Best methods. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
