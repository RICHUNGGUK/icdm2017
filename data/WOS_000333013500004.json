A numerical optimisation algorithm, which specifically targets the worst elements in the mesh, but is a smooth function of nodal positions is introduced. A method of moving nodes on curved surfaces whilst maintaining the domain geometry and preserving mesh volume is proposed. This is shown to be very effective at improving meshes for which traditional mesh improvers do not perform well.", "paper_title": "Mesh improvement methodology for 3D volumes with non-planar surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000333013500004"}
