In this paper, we extend these known pruning schemes via a general algebraic construction based on commutative groups. We show that, under certain conditions, Cayley graphs based on the constructed groups are pruned networks when Cayley graphs of the original commutative groups are kD tori. Thus, our results offer a general mathematical framework for synthesizing and exploring pruned interconnection networks that offer lower node degrees and, thus, smaller VLSI layout and simpler physical packaging. Our constructions also lead to new insights, as well as new concrete results, for previously known interconnection schemes such as honeycomb and diamond networks.", "paper_title": "A group construction method with applications to deriving pruned interconnection networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000245136400006"}
