Based on a reduction semantics for the calculus we define a contextual equivalence to compare the external behaviour of such wireless networks. Further, we construct an extensional LTS (labelled transition system) which models the activities of stations that can be directly observed by the external environment. Standard bisimulations in this LTS provide a sound proof method for proving systems contextually equivalence. We illustrate the usefulness of the proof methodology by a series of examples. Finally we show that this proof method is also complete, for a large class of systems.", "paper_title": "MODELLING MAC-LAYER COMMUNICATIONS IN WIRELESS SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000353193000006"}
