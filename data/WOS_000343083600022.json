Our method allows (i) proteome-wide predictions; (ii) identification of soluble fragments within each sequences; (iii) exhaustive single-point mutation analysis. Results: Using coil/disorder, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, beta-sheet and alpha-helix propensities, we built a predictor of protein solubility. Our approach shows an accuracy of 79% on the training set (36990 Target Track entries). Validation on three independent sets indicates that ccSOL omics discriminates soluble and insoluble proteins with an accuracy of 74% on 31760 proteins sharing <30% sequence similarity.", "paper_title": "ccSOL omics: a webserver for solubility prediction of endogenous and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli", "paper_id": "WOS:000343083600022"}
