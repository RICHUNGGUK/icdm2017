While the optimal DR-planning problem is NP-hard even for (general) 2D bar-joint constraint systems, we describe an O(n(3)) algorithm for a broad class of constraint systems that are isostatic or underconstrained. The algorithm achieves optimality by using the new notion of a canonical DR-plan that also meets various desirable, previously studied criteria. In addition, we leverage recent results on Cayley configuration spaces to show that the indecomposable systems - that are solved at the nodes of the optimal DR-plan by recombining solutions to child systems - can be minimally modified to become decomposable and have a small DR-plan, leading to efficient realization algorithms. We show formal connections to well-known problems such as completion of underconstrained systems. Well suited to these methods are classes of constraint systems that can be used to efficiently model, design and analyze quasi-uniform (aperiodic) and self-similar, layered material structures. We formally illustrate by modeling silica bilayers as body-hyperpin systems and cross-linking microfibrils as pinned line-incidence systems.
