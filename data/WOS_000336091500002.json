Playful interactions and serious games incorporate elements of play for this purpose. As a fundamental human activity, play engages people at every age. This thematic issue explores how novel technologies can fuel fun and entertainment in ambient intelligence applications, and the societal implications and possibilities thereof.", "paper_title": "Playful interactions and serious games", "paper_id": "WOS:000336091500002"}
