Our results are related to the rate of convergence of a black-box algorithm that iteratively solves special quadratic integer problems with a constant approximation factor. Despite the generality of the underlying problem, we prove that we can find efficiently, with respect to our assumptions regarding the encoding of the problem, a feasible solution whose objective function value is close to the optimal value. We also show that this proximity result is the best possible up to a factor polynomial in the encoding length of the problem.", "paper_title": "Minimizing Lipschitz-continuous strongly convex functions over integer points in polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000306493800012"}
