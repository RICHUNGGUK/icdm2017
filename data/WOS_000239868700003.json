Current IDS do not provide support for historical data analysis and data summarization. This paper presents techniques to model network traffic and alerts using a multi-dimensional data model and star schemas. This data model was used to perform network security analysis and detect denial of service attacks. Our data model can also be used to handle heterogeneous data sources (e.g. firewall logs, system calls, net-flow data) and enable up to two orders of magnitude faster query response times for analysts as compared to the current state of the art. We have used our techniques to implement a prototype system that is being successfully used at Army Research Labs. Our system has helped the security analyst in detecting intrusions and in historical data analysis for generating reports on trend analysis.", "paper_title": "Data warehousing and data mining techniques for intrusion detection systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239868700003"}
