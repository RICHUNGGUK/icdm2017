This paper adapts the principles of automatic control theory to the field of software process improvement. In particular, the work described uses control theory to define a requirement engineering (RE) process control system, its dynamic and steady-state performance, and the steps in designing, analyzing and improving such a system. The work has highlighted the need for process activities relating to measuring elements, including those in feedback compensation and organizational support. The results of this research can be used to guide the establishment and improvement of RE processes, compare different requirement process solutions quantitatively, develop methods for evaluating benefits from process improvements, and structure the application of knowledge about RE.
