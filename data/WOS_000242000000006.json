The asymptotic terms with slow convergence in the double series are first accelerated by Poisson transformation and Ewald method, and then the remained series is accelerated by Shank transformation. It results in significant savings in memory and computing time. Numerical examples verify the validity of the hybrid acceleration algorithm.", "paper_title": "Hybrid algorithm for accelerating the double series of Floquet vector modes", "paper_id": "WOS:000242000000006"}
