Robustness issues for Kernel PCA are studied. The sensitivity of Kernel PCA to individual observations is characterized by calculating the influence function. A robust Kernel PCA method is proposed by incorporating kernels in the Spherical PCA algorithm. Using the scores from Spherical Kernel PCA, a graphical diagnostic is proposed to detect points that are influential for ordinary Kernel PCA. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
