These are tree languages definable by a first-order formula whose quantifier prefi x is there exists*for all*, and simultaneously by a first-order formula whose quantifier prefi x is for all*there exists*. For the quantifier free part we consider two signatures, either the descendant relation alone or together with the lexicographical order relation on nodes. We provide an effective characterization of tree and forest languages definable in Delta(2). This characterization is in terms of algebraic equations. Over words, the class of word languages definable in Delta(2) forms a robust class, which was given an effective algebraic characterization by Pin and Weil [11].", "paper_title": "TREE LANGUAGES DEFINED IN FIRST-ORDER LOGIC WITH ONE QUANTIFIER ALTERNATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000287816900011"}
