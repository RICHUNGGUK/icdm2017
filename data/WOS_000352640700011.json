The proposed converter can work with the input voltage as low as 20 mV. The extremely low input voltage makes it suitable for energy harvesting and power management. Four logic controlled outputs provide the best voltage for various applications to accommodate low power design requirements. A low current low dropout regulator (LDO) is utilized to provide a regulated 2.2V output for powering low power processors or other low power integrated circuit (ICs). Reserve energy on the storage capacitor CSTORE provides power when the input voltage source is unavailable, thus prolongs the life of the system and expands the application range. Extremely low quiescent current (6 mu A) and high efficiency design (64%@300 mu A load current) ensure the fastest possible charge times of the output reservoir capacitor. This work provides a complete power management solution for wireless sensing and data acquisition.", "paper_title": "A 20-mV Input DC/DC Converter for Energy Harvesting Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000352640700011"}
