And a Kernel function is defined to measure affinity between multi-relational data. Task of clustering multi-relational data is addressed by integrating the designed Kernel into ASVC. Experimental results indicate that the designed Kernel can capture structured features well and ASVC is of fine performance.", "paper_title": "Adaptive support vector clustering for multi-relational data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000181"}
