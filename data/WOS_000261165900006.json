A specific P system with external output is designed for each Boolean matrix associated with a finite set of individuals. The computation of the system allows us to obtain one of the possible classifications in a non-deterministic way. The amount of resources required in the construction is polynomial in the number of individuals and of characteristics analyzed.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING WITH MEMBRANE COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000261165900006"}
