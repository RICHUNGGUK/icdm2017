Simonnet, Automates et theorie descriptive (1992).] that every regular tree language of infinite trees is in a class (D-n(Sigma(0)(2))) for some natural number n >= 1, where is the game quantifier. We first give a detailed exposition of this result. Next, using an embedding of the Wadge hierarchy of non self-dual Borel subsets of the Cantor space 2(omega) into the class Delta(1)(2), and the notions of Wadge degree and Veblen function, we argue that this upper bound on the topological complexity of regular tree languages is much better than the usual Delta(1)(2).", "paper_title": "AN UPPER BOUND ON THE COMPLEXITY OF RECOGNIZABLE TREE LANGUAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000357697100002"}
