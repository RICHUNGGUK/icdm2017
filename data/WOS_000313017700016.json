Drawing on the trust and flow theory, this research identified the factors affecting user adoption of mobile purchase. We conducted data analysis with structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicated that contextual offering has strong effects on trust, flow, and perceived usefulness. In addition, structural assurance affects trust. Trust affects flow, which further affects perceived usefulness. These three factors determine mobile purchase intention.", "paper_title": "An empirical examination of the determinants of mobile purchase", "paper_id": "WOS:000313017700016"}
