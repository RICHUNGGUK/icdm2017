A hierarchical structure is stored implicitly in a standard half-edge data structure, while allowing us to efficiently navigate through the different level of subdivision. Subdivided meshes contain a majority of quad elements and a moderate amount of triangles and pentagons in the regions of transition across different levels of detail. Topological LOD editing is controlled with local conforming operators, which support both mesh refinement and mesh coarsening. We show two possible applications of this method: we define an adaptive subdivision surface scheme that is topologically and geometrically consistent with the Catmull-Clark subdivision; and we present a remeshing method that produces semi-regular adaptive meshes.", "paper_title": "Implicit Hierarchical Quad-Dominant Meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295129100002"}
