In particular, we define the concept of a possibilistic decision making framework which is based on a possibilistic default theory, a set of decisions and a set of prioritized goals. This set of goals captures user preferences related to the achievement of a particular state in a decision making problem. By considering the inference of the possibilistic well-founded semantics, the concept of argument with respect to a decision is defined. This argument captures the feasibility of reaching a goal by applying a decision in a given context. The inference in the argumentation decision making framework is based on basic argumentation semantics. Since some basic argumentation semantics can infer more than one possible scenario of a possibilistic decision making problem, we define some criteria for selecting potential solutions of the problem.", "paper_title": "A Possibilistic Argumentation Decision Making Framework with Default Reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000299978400004"}
