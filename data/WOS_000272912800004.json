The present paper improves this result by constructing conjunctive grammars for a larger class of unary languages. The results imply undecidability of a number of decision problems of unary conjunctive grammars, as well as non-existence of a recursive function bounding the growth rate of the generated languages. An essential step of the argument is a simulation of a cellular automaton recognizing positional notation of numbers using language equations.", "paper_title": "Conjunctive Grammars over a Unary Alphabet: Undecidability and Unbounded Growth", "paper_id": "WOS:000272912800004"}
