This paper proposed a Macroblock (MB) level perceptual energy scalable video encoding method noted as PMP-ESVE, in which just noticeable distortion (JND) model is introduced as the perceptual cue. PMP-ESVE includes three parts, first, PMP-ESVE can dynamic adapt the variable energy resource budget in MB level, second, PMP-ESVE jointly consider the available energy resource and the perceptual feature in order to provide a MB level scalable video encoding method under variable energy consumption budget. Third, JND model, which refers to the maximum distortion that human visual system cannot perceive, is extended from spatial domain to temporal domain so as to determine perceptual cue in unit of MB. This provides the guideline of resource allocation in MB's. Finally, both objective and subjective quality evaluations are given to evaluate the proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
