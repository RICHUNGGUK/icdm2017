The span of an L(2. 1)-labeling f of G, denoted as SP2(f. G), is the maximum value of f (x) over all x is an element of V (G). The L(2, 1)-labeling number of a graph G, denoted as lambda(G), is the least integer k such that G admits an L(2.1)-labeling of span k. The problem of computing lambda(G) of a graph is known to be NP-complete. Griggs and Yeh have conjectured that lambda(G) <= Delta(2)(G) for a graph G with maximum degree, Delta(G), at least two. In this paper, we propose constant approximation algorithms for the problem of computing lambda(G) for dually chordal graphs and strongly orderable graphs. As a by-product, we prove Griggs and Yell Conjecture for dually chordal graphs and for those strongly orderable graphs whose maximum degrees are different from three. Finally, we propose a 2-approximation algorithm for computing lambda(G) for chordal bipartite graphs, a special subclass of strongly orderable graphs, and prove that Griggs and Yeh Conjecture holds true for this class of graphs.
