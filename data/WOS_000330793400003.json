In our algorithm, a 512-bit long external secret key is used as the input value of the salsa20 hash function. First of all, the hash function is modified to generate a key stream which is more suitable for image encryption. Then the final encryption key stream is produced by correlating the key stream and plaintext resulting in both key sensitivity and plaintext sensitivity. This scheme can achieve high sensitivity, high complexity, and high security through only two rounds of diffusion process. In the first round of diffusion process, an original image is partitioned horizontally to an array which consists of 1,024 sections of size 8 x 8. In the second round, the same operation is applied vertically to the transpose of the obtained array. The main idea of the algorithm is to use the average of image data for encryption. To encrypt each section, the average of other sections is employed. The algorithm uses different averages when encrypting different input images (even with the same sequence based on hash function). This, in turn, will significantly increase the resistance of the cryptosystem against known/chosen-plaintext and differential attacks. It is demonstrated that the 2D correlation coefficients (CC), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), encryption quality (EQ), entropy, mean absolute error (MAE) and decryption quality can satisfy security and performance requirements (CC < 0.002177, PSNR < 8.4642, EQ > 204.8, entropy > 7.9974 and MAE > 79.35). The number of pixel change rate (NPCR) analysis has revealed that when only one pixel of the plain-image is modified, almost all of the cipher pixels will change (NPCR > 99.6125 %) and the unified average changing intensity is high (UACI > 33.458 %). Moreover, our proposed algorithm is very sensitive with respect to small changes (e.g., modification of only one bit) in the external secret key (NPCR > 99.65 %, UACI > 33.55 %). It is shown that this algorithm yields better security performance in comparison to the results obtained from other algorithms.", "paper_title": "A novel image encryption based on hash function with only two-round diffusion process", "paper_id": "WOS:000330793400003"}
