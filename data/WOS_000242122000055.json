Therefore, as it becomes more and more necessary to manage and protect massive XML data in an efficient way, the development of safe XML access control techniques needs a new method. Access control techniques should be flexible enough to support all protection granularity levels. Since access control policies are very likely to be specified in relation to document types, it is necessary to properly manage a situation in which documents fail to be dealt with by the existing access control policies. In terms of XML documents, it is necessary to describe policies more flexibly beyond simple authorization models and to consider access control methods which can be selected. In this paper, we present design of flexible authorization system and small memory management for XML data protection on the server.", "paper_title": "Design of flexible authorization system and small memory management for XML data protection on the server", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000055"}
