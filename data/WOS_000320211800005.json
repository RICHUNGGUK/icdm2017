In this paper, we propose several domino logic circuit techniques to improve the robustness and performance along with leakage power. Lower total power consumption is achieved by utilizing proposed techniques. According to the simulations in TSMC 65 nm CMOS process, the proposed circuits increase noise immunity for wide OR gates by at least 3.5X and shows performance improvement of up to 20% compared to conventional domino logic circuits. For FinFET simulation TCAD tools have been used. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
