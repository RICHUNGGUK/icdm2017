Utilizing the full capacity of cover images by embedding one bit of data per pixel, using methods such as LSB flipping or LSB matching, usually decreases the security, making the algorithm vulnerable to steganalytic attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient high payload +/- 1 steganographic method based on a special two variable binary function. This function uses the information of the least two significant bit planes of the cover image for the embedding and extraction purposes. Embedding efficiency, defined as the number of embeddable bits per one change in the cover medium, is a good criterion for concurrent evaluation of the capacity and security. Rather than randomly selecting +1 or -1, we achieve higher embedding efficiencies by choosing the correct modification component. In the generalized form of the proposed method, n bits of data are embedded in n pixels of the cover medium, by causing one unit change in only one third of these pixels. Analytical and experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method provides higher embedding efficiency than the other LSB embedding schemes. The proposed method is also applicable to other digital cover media.", "paper_title": "An efficient high payload +/- 1 data embedding scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000291953700001"}
