After the visa applicants' initial interview (and secret investigation of their backgrounds), they were given an ingeniously encoded \"Letter of Recommendation'' in the form of a personalized \"Carte de Visite'' (calling card) when they picked up such permits, which were, in turn, decoded by the count himself upon presentation at the Ministry. Vergennes could then keep such visitors under surveillance during their sojourn in France.", "paper_title": "Late 18th-Century French Encrypted Diplomatic \"Letters of Recommendation\"-Or, How to Unwittingly Carry Your Own Warrant", "paper_id": "WOS:000306321000003"}
