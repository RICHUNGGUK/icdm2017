The family G of authorized sets is called the access structure. To design new cryptographic protocols, we introduce in this work the concept of extension of an access structure: given a monotone family Gamma subset of 2(P) and a larger set P' = P boolean OR (P) over tilde, a monotone access structure Gamma' subset of 2(P') is an extension of G if the following two conditions are satisfied: ( 1) The set P is a minimal subset of Gamma', i.e. P is an element of Gamma' and P - {R-i} is not an element of Gamma' for every R-i is an element of P, (2) A subset A subset of P is in Gamma if and only if the subset A boolean OR (P) over tilde is in Gamma'. As our first contribution, we give an explicit construction of an extension Gamma' of a vector space access structure Gamma, and we prove that Gamma' is also a vector space access structure. Although the definition may seem a bit artificial at first, it is well motivated from a cryptographic point of view. Indeed, our second contribution is to show that the concept of extension of an access structure can be used to design encryption schemes with access structures that are chosen ad-hoc at the time of encryption. Specifically, we design and analyze a dynamic distributed encryption scheme and a ciphertextpolicy attribute-based encryption scheme. In some cases, the new schemes enjoy better properties than existing ones.", "paper_title": "Extensions of access structures and their cryptographic applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000278614200001"}
