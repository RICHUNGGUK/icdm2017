Biometrika, 52, 591-611.] test is unable to achieve the nominal significance level, and consider a subsequent extension proposed by Royston [Royston, J.P., 1992, Approximating the Shapiro-Wilk W-Test for non-normality. Statistics and Computing, 2, 117-119.] to correct this problem, which earlier studies appear to have ignored. A consistent and invariant test proposed by Henze and Zirkler [Henze, N. and Zirkler, B., 1990, A class of invariant consistent tests for multivariate normality. Communications in Statistics- Theory and Methods, 19, 3595-3617.] is found to have good power properties, particularly for sample sizes of 75 or more, while an approach suggested by Royston [Royston, J.P, 1992, Approximating the Shapiro-Wilk W-Test for non-normality. Statistics and Computing, 2, 117-119.] performs effectively at detecting departures from MVN for smaller sample sizes.
