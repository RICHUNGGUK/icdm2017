The sender and the receiver are also described by finite transducers which can respectively encode and decode binary messages. When the communication is reliable, we call the encoder/decoder pair a channel. We study the channel synthesis problem which, given a transducer, asks whether or not such sender and receiver exist and builds them if the answer is positive. To that effect we introduce the structural notion of encoding state in a transducer which is a necessary condition for the existence of a channel. It is not, however, a sufficient condition. In fact, we prove that the problem is undecidable. Nonetheless, we obtain a synthesis procedure when the transducer is functional. We discuss these results in relation to security properties.", "paper_title": "CHANNEL SYNTHESIS FOR FINITE TRANSDUCERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000311560300005"}
