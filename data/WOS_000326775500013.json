After presenting the GBT fundamental assumptions and kinematic relationships, the member non-linear equilibrium equations are derived and a non-linear one-dimensional (beam) finite element is formulated. The arc-length control technique is adopted in the numerical solution of the non-linear equations and J(2)-flow theory is used to model plasticity in conjunction with the Backward Euler return-mapping algorithm. In order to show the capabilities and potential of the implemented formulation, a set of numerical illustrative examples are presented and discussed. For validation purposes, most of the GBT results obtained (equilibrium paths, modal participation diagrams, displacement profiles, stress distributions and deformed configurations) are compared with values yielded by ABAQUS shell finite element analyses.
