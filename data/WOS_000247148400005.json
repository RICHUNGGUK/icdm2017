Abstract State Machines (ASMs) provide a mathematical framework for system modelling, while Model Checking is a technology for verification of system properties. Together, they form a powerful tool for checking systems. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a competitive model checking approach due to its ability to compactly encode BMC problems. In this paper, we present a method of applying ASP to BMC of ASMs. Given an ASM and a temporal property, we show how to efficiently translate the BMC problem for the ASM into a problem of answer set computation. Experimental results for our method using the answer set solvers SMODELS and CMODELS are also given.", "paper_title": "Model checking abstract state machines with answer set programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000247148400005"}
