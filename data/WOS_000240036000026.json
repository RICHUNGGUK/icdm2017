Our method has two distinguishing features. For one, it relies on explicit hierarchical descriptions of drawing structure by means of spatial relationships and shape characterization. However, unlike other approaches which attempt rigid shape classification, our method relies on estimating the likeness of a given shape to a restricted set of simple forms. It yields for a given shape, a feature vector describing its geometric properties, which is invariant to scale, rotation and translation. This provides the advantage of being able to characterize arbitrary two-dimensional shapes with few restrictions. Moreover, our technique seemingly works well when compared to established methods for two dimensional shapes.", "paper_title": "Generic shape classification for retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000026"}
