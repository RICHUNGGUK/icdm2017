Violation of this assumption affects not only the power of the standard F-test, but also its size. When a design is unbalanced, the effect of unequal error variances is even more complex. In this paper, we study the effect of heterogeneous error variances on the size of the F-test concerning the among-group variance component in an unbalanced random one-way model. We also provide a method for computing the true critical value of the F-test for a given level of significance.", "paper_title": "On the size of the F-test for the one-way random model with heterogeneous error variances", "paper_id": "WOS:000247911600001"}
