We study representability of these lattices and show that not all Stonian p-ortholattices can be represented by the set of regular sets of a topological space. We identify five conditions that hold in algebras of regular sets and which can be used to eliminate non-representable Stonian p-ortholattices. This shows not only that the original completeness theorem for RT (-) is incorrect, but is also an important step towards an algebraic representation (up to isomorphism) of the regular sets of topological spaces.", "paper_title": "On the algebra of regular sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000305908200002"}
