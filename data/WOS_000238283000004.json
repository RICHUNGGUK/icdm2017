As all electronics devices tends to be smaller and smaller, people pays more attention to \"linear sensor\" method. The most important factor for securing the reliable Fingerprint Recognition Technology is pursuing the enhancement of the captured fingerprint image from sensors. This paper presents an algorithm that uses Image Estimation and Reconstruction Method in order to embody precisely the image captured from Linear Sensors. The proposed algorithm is verified theoretically and experimentally that the image can be perfectly reconstructed from the fingerprint on the linear sensor even though the finger position is displaced vertically, horizontally, and/or rotationally. Also this system demonstrates much higher recognition and authentication rates than any other existing systems.", "paper_title": "An enhanced estimation algorithm for reconstructing fingerprint strip image", "paper_id": "WOS:000238283000004"}
