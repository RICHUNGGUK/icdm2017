In order to improve the robustness of motion vector, a novel motion estimation algorithm with center-biased diamond search and its parallel VLSI architecture are proposed in this paper. Experiments show that it works better than conventional motion estimation algorithms in terms of motion compensation error and robustness, and its architecture overcomes the irregular data flow and achieves high efficiency. It also efficiently reuses data and reduces the control overhead. So, it is highly suitable for HDTV applications.", "paper_title": "A robust motion estimation with center-biased diamond search and its parallel architecture for motion-compensated de-interlace", "paper_id": "WOS:000294498100006"}
