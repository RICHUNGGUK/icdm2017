This paper develops a new decision tree classifier SSC for multi-valued and multi-labeled data, on the basis of the algorithm MMDT, improves on the core formula for measuring the similarity of label-sets, which is the essential index in determining the goodness of splitting attributes, and proposes a new approach of measuring similarity considering both same and consistent features of label-sets, and together with a dynamic approach of adjusting the calculation proportion of the two features according to current data set. SSC makes the similarity of label-sets measured more comprehensive and accurate. The empirical results prove that SSC indeed improves the accuracy of MMDT, and has better classification efficiency.", "paper_title": "Research on multi-valued and multi-labeled decision trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200027"}
