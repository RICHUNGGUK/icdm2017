The design of trials with continuous-time survival endpoints has been studied for years, but very little is known about the design of trials with discrete-time survival endpoints. The optimal designs for trials where observations are recorded at discrete points in time is calculated using the generalized linear model and Weibull distribution. Applying a cost function, the optimal number of subjects and time periods are found in such a way that a sufficient power level is achieved at a minimal cost or the power level is maximized for a fixed budget. Taking the budget for a trial and the cost ratio between recruiting a new subject and obtaining a measurement per subject into account, it is observed that the cost ratio and the shape of the survival function have the greatest influence on the optimal design.
