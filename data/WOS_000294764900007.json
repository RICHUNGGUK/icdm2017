More precisely, a picture language will be generated from a finite set of initial pictures by iteratively applying rewriting rules from a given finite set of rules, called a tiling rule system (TRuS system). We prove that the TRuS systems have a greater generative capacity than the tiling systems of Giammarresi and Restivo. This is due mainly to the use of the notion of replacement site, but we further characterize the difference between these systems by comparing them to Wang systems.", "paper_title": "Picture Languages Generated by Assembling Tiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000294764900007"}
