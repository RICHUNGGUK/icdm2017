Design/methodology/approach - A multistage network discrete expansion model with budget restriction is formulated and a heuristic algorithm is developed by the technique of comparing the original shortest paths and the SLIM of crossed shortest paths to avoid computing the shortest paths matrix repeatedly. Findings - The optimal approach has a very significant effect in finding which roads to be built by the largest net benefit. Research limitations/implications - The paper discusses a new multistage network discrete expansion problem is the main research implications. Practical implications - The optimal choice for road building schedule of new urban district when budgets were limited. Originality/value - The paper presents a model and an algorithm for the optimization of road building schedule based on budget restriction.", "paper_title": "The optimization of road building schedule based on budget restriction", "paper_id": "WOS:000267416500019"}
