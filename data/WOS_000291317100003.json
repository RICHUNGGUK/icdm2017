As their dependability and autonomy are of great concern, self-healing is an ongoing challenge. This paper presents an innovative model and technology to realize the self-healing function under the real-time requirement. The proposed approach, different from existing technologies, is based on a new concept defined as consequence-oriented diagnosis and healing. Derived from the new concept, a prototype model for proactive self-healing actions is presented. Then, a hybrid diagnosis tool is proposed that takes advantages from the Multivariate Decision Diagram, Fuzzy Logic, and Neural Networks, achieving an efficient, effective, accurate, and intelligent result. The consequence-oriented diagnosis and self-healing function is also implemented. The experimental results exhibit that the innovative system is very effective and precise in predicting the consequence, and in preventing resulting software and system failures.", "paper_title": "Consequence Oriented Self-Healing and Autonomous Diagnosis for Highly Reliable Systems and Software", "paper_id": "WOS:000291317100003"}
