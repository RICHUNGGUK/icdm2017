In this sense, the role of scheduling strategies is critical and new proposals able to deal with the inherent uncertainty of the grid state are needed in a way that QoS can be offered. Fuzzy rule-based schedulers are emerging scheduling schemas in grid computing based on the efficient management of grid resources imprecise state and expert knowledge application to achieve an efficient workload distribution. Given the diverse and usually conflicting nature of the scheduling optimization objectives in grids considering both users and administrators requirements, these strategies can benefit from multi-objective strategies in their knowledge acquisition process greatly. This work suggests the QoS provision in the grid scheduling level with fuzzy rule-based schedulers through multi-objective knowledge acquisition considering multiple optimization criteria. With this aim, a novel learning strategy for the evolution of fuzzy rules based on swarm intelligence, Knowledge Acquisition with a Swarm Intelligence Approach (KASIA) is adapted to the multi-objective evolution of an expert grid meta-scheduler founded on Pareto general optimization theory and its performance with respect to a well-known genetic strategy is analyzed. In addition, the fuzzy scheduler with multi-objective learning results are compared to those of classical scheduling strategies in grid computing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
