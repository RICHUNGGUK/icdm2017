One of the most important service in Expert Cloud is to search trustworthy peoples in order to benefit from their knowledge and skills. In this paper we propose a new and applicable method for Trustworthy Human Resource Discovery (THRD) in Expert Cloud by introducing a resource discovery and trust evaluating method, implement the proposed method by using ASP.Net and SQL in Expert Cloud; verify the structures and compositions of THRD by describing the behavioral models and state diagrams; define a Kripke structure with marked states to provide the formal relationship between the expanded model and the original state diagram structures; define the expected properties of the structures and compositions of THRD by means of temporal logic languages; and implement the proposed model by NuSMV model checker. The results show that the proposed method can discover trustworthy people efficiently and is sound, complete, reachable, fair, deadlock-free and consistent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
