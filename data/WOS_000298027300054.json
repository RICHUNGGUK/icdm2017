One important category of risks is disruptions that block material flowing through a supply chain and that may even result in end-product manufacturing failure. This paper uses a Petri nets-based model as a tool to understand the dissemination of disruptions and to trace the operational performance of a supply chain. The presented approach models how changes propagate through a supply chain and calculates the impact of disruptions on supply chain attributes by concluding the states that are obtainable from a given initial status in the supply chain.
