In addition to the Gene Ontology (GO), GOElite allows the user to perform over- representation analysis on any structured ontology annotations, pathway database or biological IDs (e. g. gene, protein or metabolite). GO- Elite exploits the structured nature of biological ontologies to report a minimal set of nonoverlapping terms. The results can be visualized on WikiPathways or as networks. Built- in support is provided for over 60 species and 50 ID systems, covering gene, disease and phenotype ontologies, multiple pathway databases, biomarkers, and transcription factor and microRNA targets. GO- Elite is available as a web interface, GenMAPP- CS plugin and as a cross- platform application.", "paper_title": "GO-Elite: a flexible solution for pathway and ontology over-representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000307501100027"}
