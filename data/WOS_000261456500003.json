This way we can animate flows in which not only the liquid but also the air is a performer. Our Method allows the use of rigidly moving, articulated or deforming meshes. The paper shows how to do this practically, using a coupled level set and volume-of-fluid method. We also introduce to computer graphics a novel boundary condition, useful for open-field simulations. Animations of it swimmer in a pool, a hand scooping out water and a heart beating and spurting out either liquid or gas, showcase the strengths of our method. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
