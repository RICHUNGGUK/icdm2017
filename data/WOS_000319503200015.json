A necessary and sufficient condition for stability and strict (Q,S,R)-dissipativity of the closed-loop system is established in terms of a matrix inequality with free parametrisation matrix. An equivalent characterisation with some slack matrices for numerical solvability is then proposed. Based on this, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a desired controller is given, and a corresponding iterative algorithm is developed to solve the condition. The effectiveness of results developed in this article is demonstrated by some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Dissipative control for linear systems by static output feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000319503200015"}
