The algorithm can be applied to general test statistics and easily built into general design algorithms for sequential tests. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm is particularly useful for estimating tail probabilities, and may lead to significant computational efficiency gains over the crude Monte Carlo method.", "paper_title": "Multi-step variance minimization in sequential tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000251620300009"}
