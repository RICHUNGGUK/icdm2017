The system helps users save the screen images along with a user's handwritten strokes and in searching for them. We describe some of the important functions of the system and the effective retrieval keys for searching for saved images. We explain that the implementation of our prototype system consists of two subsystems: note-taking and browsing systems. An example of the usage of the system is also described.", "paper_title": "On-screen note pad for creative activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100106"}
