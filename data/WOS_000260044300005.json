Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken is design science, an artifact of automatic pricing system for co-branding goods. Findings - The results reveal that PT is superior to expected utility theory in terms of adjusted perceived prices and decision weight probabilities. Practical implications - This paper aims to provide clues for industries in terms of providing a customer-centric pricing method, systematic and automatic approach, and pricing-based strategic information system. Originality/value - The proposed pricing method: applies value-based method to estimate the co-brand price, considers risk and real-world decision making, provides an efficient and effective approach, and enhances the competitiveness of price through the system.", "paper_title": "A value-based pricing system for strategic co-branding goods", "paper_id": "WOS:000260044300005"}
