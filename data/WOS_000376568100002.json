Therefore, cloud interoperability based service evaluation certification demands precise and professional requirements. This study presents the quality, interoperability, and security as three key areas of overall cloud services. It also presents a proposal to evaluate the quality and interoperability through an existing cloud service certification system considering practical convenience and reality in establishing the certification system.", "paper_title": "Development of a Cloud Computing Interoperability-Based Service Certification", "paper_id": "WOS:000376568100002"}
