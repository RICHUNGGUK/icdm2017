We improve the ARAP animation technique in two aspects. First, we introduce a new ARAP-type energy, named SR-ARAP, which has a consistent discretization for surfaces (triangle meshes). The quality of our new surface deformation scheme competes with the quality of the volumetric ARAP deformation (for tetrahedral meshes). Second, we propose a new ARAP shape interpolation method that is superior to prior art also based on the ARAP energy. This method is compatible with our new SR-ARAP energy, as well as with the ARAP volume energy.", "paper_title": "Smooth Rotation Enhanced As-Rigid-As-Possible Mesh Animation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347306600009"}
