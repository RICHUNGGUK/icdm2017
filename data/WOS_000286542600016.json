It is first proved that Tor(j)(C) is an ideal of (S) over bar = FpmE[omega]/(omega(ps-1)), so that the structure of ideals over extension ring S-uk(m, omega) = GR(u(k),m)[omega]/<omega(ps) - 1 > is determined. Then, an isomorphism between R[X]/< X-N -1 > and a direct sum circle plus S-h is an element of l(uk)(m(h), omega) can be obtained using discrete Fourier transform. The generator polynomial representation of the corresponding ideals over F-p + uF(p) + ... + u(k-1)F(p) is calculated via the inverse isomorphism. Moreover, torsion codes, MS polynomial and inversion formula are described. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
