We are mainly concerned with problems related to chord sequences which exhibit a certain kind of regular harmonic structure, and provide also algorithms to solve some of them. In particular, we present an O(n + m)-time algorithm, based on bit-parallelism, to check whether a given chord progression of length n is regular, where m is the size of the chords in the progression.", "paper_title": "On some combinatorial problems concerning the harmonic structure of musical chord sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000253948900008"}
