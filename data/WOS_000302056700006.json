An iterative algorithm is used to obtain the environmental indexes for JRA, and standard multiple comparison procedures are adapted for genotype comparison and selection. This study includes three data sets from a spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) breeding programme carried out between 2004 and 2006 in Czech Republic. The results from both techniques are integrated in order to advise plant breeders, farmers and agronomists for better genotype selection and prediction for new years and/or new environments.", "paper_title": "A comparison between joint regression analysis and the AMMI model: a case study with barley", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056700006"}
