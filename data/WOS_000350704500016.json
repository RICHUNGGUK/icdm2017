The existence of the least element of <= among connected graphs of order n and size m is conjectured. Special cases of m = n - 1, n, and n +1 are known in literature. In this paper, we further affirm the conjecture by finding the least elements for the cases of n - 1 <= m <= 2n - 3 and n(n-1)/2 - (n - 2) <= m <= n(n-1)/2. As consequences, we determine the graphs with the minimum matching energy, and with the minimum Hosoya index among connected graphs of order n and size m where n - 1 <= M <= 2n - 3 and n(n-1)/2 - (n-2) <= m <= n(n-1)/2.", "paper_title": "Finding the Least Element of the Ordering of Graphs with Respect to their Matching Numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000350704500016"}
