Human eyes, often referred as the gates to the soul, can possibly comprise a rich source of idiosyncratic information which may be used for the recognition of an individual's identity. In this paper an innovative experiment and a novel processing approach for the human eye movements is implemented, ultimately aiming at the biometric segregation of individual persons. In our experiment, the subjects observe face images while their eye movements are being monitored, providing information about each participant's attention spots. The implemented method treats eye trajectories as 2-D distributions of points on the image plane. The efficiency of graph objects in the representation of structural information motivated us on the utilization of a non-parametric multivariate graph-based measure for the comparison of eye movement signals, yielding promising results at the task of identification according to behavioral characteristics of an individual.
