Sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator packet dropouts and time delays are considered simultaneously. According to the stochastic characteristic of the packet dropouts and time delays, a model based on a Markov jump system framework is proposed to randomly compensate for the adverse effect of the two-channel packet dropouts and time delays. To analyze the robust stability of the resulting closed-loop system, a Lyapunov function is proposed, based on which sufficient conditions for the existence of the H-2/H-infinity controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities, ensuring robust stochastic stability as well as the prescribed H-2 and H-infinity performance. Finally, an angular positioning system is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design strategy.", "paper_title": "Network-Based Robust H-2/H-infinity Control for Linear Systems With Two-Channel Random Packet Dropouts and Time Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000358213100006"}
