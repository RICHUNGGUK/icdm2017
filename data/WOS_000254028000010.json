Current methods can not meet the needs for precision, machining on Non-cylinder piston pinhole(NCPPH). A novel mechanism based on Giant Magnetostrictive Materials(GMM) is presented. New models are established for the servo mechanism, GMM and magnetizing force of the control solenoid to characterize the relationship between the control current of the solenoid and the displacement of the GMA (Giant Magnetostrictive Actuator). Special designed CNC system is employed to control the GMA system. Some boring experiments are performed. It is demonstrated that the novel mechanism can meet the needs to perform fine machining on NCPPH effectively.", "paper_title": "Flexible machining for non-cylinder piston pinhole based on GMM", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000010"}
