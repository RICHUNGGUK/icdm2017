Moreover, Power-Control-Based Real-Time Routing Protocol (PCBRRP) is designed capable with CLPCA. In this protocol, the transmission power of the node is adjusted dynamically to increase the energy efficiency. The next hop node is selected via the link quality of the communication and the residual energy of every node. Simulation results show that the energy consumption of the network is reduced while real-time end-to-end data transmission is guaranteed.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Power-Control-Based Real-Time Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327341000001"}
