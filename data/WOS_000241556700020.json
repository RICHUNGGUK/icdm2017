Feature extraction is essential for getting efficient patterns to detect contractions in wireless video endoscopy of small intestine. We propose a novel method based on anisotropic image filtering and efficient statistical classification of contraction features. In particular, we apply the image gradient tensor for mining informative skeletons from the original image and a sequence of descriptors for capturing the characteristic pattern of contractions. Features extracted from the endoluminal images were evaluated in terms of their discriminatory ability in correct classifying images as either belonging to contractions or not. Classification was performed by means of a support vector machine classifier with a radial basis function kernel. Our classification rates gave sensitivity of the order of 90.84% and specificity of the order of 94.43% respectively. These preliminary results highlight the high efficiency of the selected descriptors and support the feasibility of the proposed method in assisting the automatic detection and analysis of contractions.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic feature extraction from endoluminal images for detection of intestinal contractions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700020"}
