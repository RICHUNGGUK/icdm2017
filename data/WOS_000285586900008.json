It provides quick access to random screen regions and manipulation methods for screen widgets which are difficult or impossible to reach. It consists of a dynamic global thumbnail, a touchpad widget that drives the screen cursor, and a teleport widget in which interactions are transferred to its target screen region. Javelin can be easily integrated into many programs to optimize their inter-action performance in large screens. The experiment and user study show that Javelin can extend user access field and enhance widget manipulation in large displays.", "paper_title": "Javelin: an access and manipulation interface for large displays", "paper_id": "WOS:000285586900008"}
