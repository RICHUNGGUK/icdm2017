Unlike the well-known nested-loop quantization algorithm, which requires a large and unpredictable amount of iterations, the proposed algorithm uses a single loop with only three iterations to reduce the computational complexity. Since most of the existing quantization algorithms reported in the literature require peak number of iterations higher than three, our approach can effectively reduce the peak computing demand for a real-time encoder. We conduct several experiments (including the ODG rating) to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and the results are acceptable. We implement the proposed algorithm on a 16-bit fixed-point digital signal processor, and the encoder requires 35 MIPS of computation for encoding stereo music at 128 kbps.", "paper_title": "Efficient quantization algorithm for real-time MP-3 encoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000260068700002"}
