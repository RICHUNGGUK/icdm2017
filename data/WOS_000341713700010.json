The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel way to achieve hybrid excitation by use of tooth harmonic field. Design/methodology/approach - Unlike weakening the tooth harmonics field and EMF in traditional machines, in this paper the tooth harmonics field is proposed to form a novel hybrid excitation permanent magnet synchronous generator (HEPMSG). Findings - The generation mechanism of tooth harmonic electromotive force (EMF) of rotor winding is introduced, and its influencing factors are discussed in detail. The matching design of tooth harmonic winding and field winding for maximum output field current of tooth harmonic excitation system is analyzed. Practical implications - This machine can achieve not only effective adjustment of the air-gap magnetic field, but also elimination of the brushes and slip rings. Originality/value - Unlike weakening the tooth harmonics field and EMF in traditional machines, in this paper the tooth harmonics filed is proposed to form a novel hybrid excitation PM synchronous generator. This machine can achieve not only effective adjustment of the air-gap magnetic field, but also elimination of the brushes and slip rings.", "paper_title": "Research on new hybrid excitation PM synchronous generators with tooth harmonic excitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713700010"}
