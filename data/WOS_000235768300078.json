This paper presents the technology evaluations on the TH-FACE recognition system. The main objectives of the evaluations are to 1) test the performance of the TH-FACE recognition system objectively; 2) provide a method to design and organize a database for evaluations; 3) identify the advantage and weakness for the TH-FACE recognition system. Particular description of the test database used in the evaluations is given in this paper. The database contains different subsets which are sorted by different poses, illuminations, ages, accessory, etc. Results and analysis on the entire performances of the TH-FACE recognition system would be also presented.", "paper_title": "Technology evaluations on the TH-FACE recognition system", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300078"}
