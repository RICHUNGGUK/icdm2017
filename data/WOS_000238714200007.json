We develop a new framework of multitree dictionaries, which includes some previously proposed dictionaries as special cases. We show how to efficiently find the best representation in a multitree dictionary using a recursive tree-pruning algorithm. We illustrate our framework through several examples, including a novel block image coder, which significantly outperforms both the standard JPEG and quadtree-based methods and is comparable to embedded coders such as JPEG2000 and SPIHT.", "paper_title": "Fast search for best representations in multitree dictionaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000238714200007"}
