A parallel distributed compensation (PDC) controller is designed in finite frequency domain. With the aid of the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (GKYP) lemma, the design problem is formulated as solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulation examples illustrate that the finite frequency design approach proposed in this paper receives better results than those of existing full frequency approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
