Radio environment map (REM) is a kind of improved geolocation database and an emerging topic with the latest regulations on TV white space communications. It constructs a comprehensive temperature map of the cognitive radio network operation area by utilizing multi-domain information from geolocation databases, characteristics of spectrum use, geographical terrain models, propagation environment, and regulations. REMs act as cognition engines by building long-term knowledge via processing spectrum measurements collected from sensors to estimate the state of locations without any measurement data. Active transmitter LocatIon Estimation based REM construction technique is proposed and compared with the well-known REM construction techniques such as Kriging and inverse distance weighted interpolation in shadow and multipath fading channels. The simulation results suggest that the LocatIon Estimation based REM construction outperforms the compared methods in terms of RMSE and correct detection zone ratio by utilizing additional information about channel parameters that can be estimated by classical least squares method easily.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Location estimation-based radio environment map construction in fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141800013"}
