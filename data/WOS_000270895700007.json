Multiresolution wavelet analysis enabled the frequency contents of the Doppler signals to be linked to the opening (o) and closing (c) of the heart's valves (Aortic (A) and Mitral (M)). M-mode, B-mode and pulsed Doppler ultrasound were used to verify the timings of opening and closure of these valves. In normal fetuses, the time intervals from Q-wave of QRS complex of FECG to opening and closing of aortic valve, i.e., Q-Ao and Q-Ac were found to be 79.3 +/- A 17.4 and 224.7 +/- A 13.3 ms, respectively. For the mitral valve, Q-Mc and Q-Mo were found to be 27.7 +/- A 9.4 and 294.6 +/- A 21.3 ms, respectively. Correlations among the timings in opening and closing of cardiac valves were found to be higher in abnormal fetuses than that in normal ones.", "paper_title": "Antepartum non-invasive evaluation of opening and closing timings of the cardiac valves in fetal cardiac cycle", "paper_id": "WOS:000270895700007"}
