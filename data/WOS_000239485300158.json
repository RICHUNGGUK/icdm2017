The ANN left-inversion is composed of two relatively independent parts - a static ANN used to approximate the complex nonlinear function and several differentiators used to represent its dynamic behaviors, so that the ANN left-inversion is a special kind of dynamic ANN in essence. Different from common dynamic ANNs, such a separate structure makes the ANN left-inversion easier to use, hence facilitating its application. The ANN left-inversion has been used to estimate such immeasurable variables as mycelia concentration, sugar concentration and chemical potency in erythromycin fermentation process. The experimental results show its validity.", "paper_title": "Estimation of some crucial variables in erythromycin fermentation process based on ANN left-inversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300158"}
