The deterministic algorithm runs in sub-quadratic time in the dense size of the input polynomial, and the probabilistic algorithm is softly optimal when the number of variables is at least three. We also investigate the reduction from several to two variables and improve the quantitative version of Bertini's irreducibility theorem. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
