Observation can be costly, so it makes sense to try and reduce the number of observations, without losing full certainty about the event's actual occurrence. In this paper, we propose a formalization of this problem. We formally show that, whenever the event to be detected follows a discrete spatial or temporal pattern, then it is possible to reduce the number of observations. We discuss exact and approximate algorithms to solve the problem, and provide an experimental evaluation of them. We apply the resulting algorithms to verification of linear temporal logics formulae. Finally, we discuss possible generalizations and extensions, and, in particular, how event detection can benefit from logic programming techniques.", "paper_title": "Observation strategies for event detection with incidence on runtime verification: theory, algorithms, experimentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000300019900002"}
