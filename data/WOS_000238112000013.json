Some applications require that the equilibrium points of the designed network be stable. In this paper, the passivity-based approach is used to derive stability conditions for dynamic neural networks with different time-scales. Several stability properties, such as passivity, asymptotic stability, input-to-state stability and bounded input bounded output stability, are guaranteed in certain senses. Numerical examples are also given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Passivity analysis of dynamic neural networks with different time-scales", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000013"}
