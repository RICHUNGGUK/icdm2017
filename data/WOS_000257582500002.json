However, how an information table is available in representation, in treatment, and in interpretation, can still be discussed. In this paper, these matters are discussed on the basis of \"granularity.\" First, an explanation is given to identify the reasons why different goals/treatments of information tables exist in some different research fields. In this stage, it will be emphasized that \"granularity concept\" plays an important role. Next, a framework of information tables is reformulated in terms of attribute sets and tuple sets. Here, a \"Galois connection\" helps to understand their relationship. Then, the use of \"closed subsets\" is proposed instead of given tuples, for efficiency and for interpretability. With a special type of closed subsets, the traditional logical DNF expression framework can be naturally extended to those with multivalues and continuous values. Last, several concepts on rough sets are reformulated using \"variable granularity\" connected to closed subsets. This paper determines how and in what points granularity can give flexibility in dealing with several problems. Through several concepts defined in this paper, some intuitions toward development of data exploration and data mining are given.", "paper_title": "Extended DNF expression and variable granularity in information tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500002"}
