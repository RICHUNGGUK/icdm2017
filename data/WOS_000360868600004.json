They also promise allocating part of the traffic aggregation function to the optical layer, thus reducing the use of energy-hungry electronic devices. Accordingly, in this work, we analyzed these architectures from the power consumption perspective by evaluating the energy efficiency derived from introducing the Flexgrid technology in order to allow the shift of grooming and bandwidth aggregation functions at the optical layer, by envisioning a next generation of IP/MPLS-over-flexgrid transport architectures.
