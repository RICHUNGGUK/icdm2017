We introduce world-set decompositions (WSDs), a space-efficient and complete representation system for finite sets of worlds. We study the problem of efficiently evaluating relational algebra queries on world-sets represented by WSDs. We also evaluate our technique experimentally in a large census data scenario and show that it is both scalable and efficient.", "paper_title": "10((106)) worlds and beyond: efficient representation and processing of incomplete information", "paper_id": "WOS:000270651600003"}
