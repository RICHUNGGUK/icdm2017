Sometimes a video could be treated as a top secret for an organization, for example military secrets, surveillance footage and corporate product designs, and may need to be shared among a group of people in a secure manner. Traditional data security methods such as encryption techniques are prone to single-point attack, i.e. the secret can be revealed by obtaining the decryption key from any single person. Alternatively, the secret sharing scheme provides collective control over the secrecy of information and is considered information theoretically secure. In this paper, we propose to adopt a secret sharing based approach to provide collective control over a given sensitive video. We present three methods that utilize the spatial and temporal redundancy in videos in different ways. We analyze the security of these methods and compare them for efficiency in terms of computation time and space using extensive experimentation.", "paper_title": "Collective control over sensitive video data using secret sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200017"}
