The graph is composed of control polygons of linear and quadratic Bezier curves. The radial function of the Voronoi diagram, which defines distance from the Voronoi edges to the generator sites, is described similarly with the help of the Bezier curves. The method allows one to construct an explicit medial representation of polygonal figures for the image shape analysis and transformation.", "paper_title": "Representation of segment Voronoi diagram by Bezier curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000361060900006"}
