Generating such diagrams presents a major problem in graph drawing, with automatic approaches often resulting in errors or uninterpretable results. Here we apply a breakthrough in diagram layout to protein topology cartoons, providing clear, accurate, interactive and editable diagrams, which are also an interface to a structural search method.", "paper_title": "Automatic generation of protein structure cartoons with Pro-origami", "paper_id": "WOS:000297352100014"}
