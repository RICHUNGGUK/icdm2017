In contrast with other previous proposals, these techniques have been designed and evaluated in the context of a user centred process. The results of this evaluation and some relevant findings for the field of human computer interaction are also described.", "paper_title": "Usability evaluation of virtual reality interaction techniques for positioning and manoeuvring in reduced, manipulation-oriented environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800022"}
