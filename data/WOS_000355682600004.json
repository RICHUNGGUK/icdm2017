The inlined reference monitor approach to policy enforcement, pioneered by Erlingsson and Schneider, implements runtime enforcement through program rewriting: security checks are inserted inside untrusted programs. Ensuring complete mediation-the guarantee that every security-relevant event is actually intercepted by the monitor-is non-trivial when the program rewriter operates on an object-oriented intermediate language with state-of-the-art features such as virtual methods and delegates. This paper proposes a caller-side rewriting algorithm for MSIL-the bytecode of the. NET virtual machine-where security checks are inserted around calls to security-relevant methods. We prove that this algorithm achieves sound and complete mediation and transparency for a simplified model of MSIL and report on our experiences with the implementation of the algorithm for full MSIL.", "paper_title": "Policy ignorant caller-side inline reference monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000355682600004"}
