We first present, for the deterministic-system-parameter situation, contract-designing procedures under two contract formats; namely, a \"regular\" version of [VD] (hereafter \"[RVD]\") and a \"continuous\" version of [VD] (hereafter \"[CVD]\"). Our solutions show that [RVD] cannot perfectly coordinate this (p,e)-sensitive channel; moreover, very often [RVD] leads to a lower channel efficiency than the simple price-only contract. In contrast, we show that [CVD] leads to perfect channel coordination a significant result since most contract formats have been shown in the literature to be unable to coordinate - a (p,e)-channel. Next, we consider the more realistic situations in which the manufacturer is uncertain about one of the system parameters - specifically, either the market size \"a\" or the effort cost \"eta\". Our results show that, if Manu is uncertain about a, [RVD] becomes useless but the manufacturer can still use [CVD] to benefit himself. When the manufacturer is uncertain about eta, [CVD] remains useful (as expected); however, surprisingly, [RVD] can outperform [CVD] when both the mean value and the uncertainty of n are sufficient high. These results underline the necessity of evaluating a contract format under various forms of system-parameter uncertainties - often at the expense of analytical tractability. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
