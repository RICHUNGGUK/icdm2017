We assume Markov models for the packet arrival processes and the channel gain processes. Perfect channel state information is assumed to be available at the transmitter and the receiver. The transmissions are subject to a long-run average transmitter power constraint. The control problem is to assign power and rate dynamically as a function of the fading and the queue lengths so as to minimize a weighted sum of long run average packet transmission delays. First, we study the problem for a single-user system and obtain structural properties of the optimal policy. We obtain numerical results for the delay-power tradeoff. Then, we consider the multiuser system and obtain a value iteration algorithm for computing the optimal policy. We identify that the problem is computationally intractable and consider an approximation for the cost to go function The approximating function provides a tight upped bound for the optimal cost function and thus a one-step value iteration could result in a close to optimal policy. A one-step value iteration is then carried out to improve upon the policy. We obtain, structural properties of the one-step iterated policy and show that the resulting policy can be obtained by solving a fixed point iteration on a family of suitably modified single-user optimal control policies.", "paper_title": "Optimal cross-layer scheduling of transmissions over a fading multiaccess channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000257861400010"}
