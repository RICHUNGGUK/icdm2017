Air injection rates were varied from 0.99 x 10(-5) to 4.94 x 10(-5) kg/s, while maintaining a constant liquid cross-flow rate of 0.298 kg/s. Though gas-liquid ratio (GLR) and flow velocities dominate bubble formation, intermittent choking at the exit nozzle is shown to have a morphological impact on the bubbly flow. This impact is visible as a pressure wave that propagates upstream from the nozzle exit. This pulse is found to have a strong influence on bubble formation at the gas injection location leading to bubble distortion and breakup. In most cases, a liquid jet is observed to propagate through the centreline of larger bubbles as the pressure pulse passes.", "paper_title": "Bubble formation and flow instability in an effervescent atomizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000334506900003"}
