Word segments are thus a relevant cue for the automatic acquisition of semantic relationships. We have developed an unsupervised method for morphological segmentation devised for this objective. Semantic relationships are deduced from specific morphological structures based on the segments discovered. Evaluation of the validity of the semantic relationships inferred is performed against WordNet and the NCI Thesaurus.", "paper_title": "Automatic acquisition of semantic relationships from morphological relatedness", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400012"}
