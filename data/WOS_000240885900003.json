The vorticity is generated on the wall of the entrance channel whose length has been fixed in order to obtain a fully developed velocity profile at the entry of the jet. The transient behaviour of the velocity field starting from rest has been observed until reaching a quasi steady regime. The mean value of the velocity field is compared with the results of a finite volume computation on the same mesh. The velocity fluctuations obtained using this method are analysed. Their effect on the mean flow is estimated to be smaller than the viscous effect.
