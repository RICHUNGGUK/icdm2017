The construction arises from a scattered subspace with respect to a Desarguesian spread in . By construction there are two systems of maximum subspaces (in this case -dimensional) which cover this hypersurface. However, unlike the standard Segre embedding, the minimum embedding constructed here allows another systems of maximum subspaces which cover this embedding. We describe these systems and study the stabiliser of these embeddings. The results can be considered as a generalization of the properties of the hyperbolic quadric Q(+)(3, q).", "paper_title": "On embeddings of minimum dimension of PG(n, q) x PG(n, q)", "paper_id": "WOS:000348340600008"}
