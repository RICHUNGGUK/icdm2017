We show the existence of a threshold effect for the phase transition associated with the satisfiability of random quantified boolean CNF formulas of the form. for all X there exists Upsilon phi(X, Y), where X has m variables, Y has n variables and each clause in phi has one literal from X and two from Y. For such formulas, we show that the threshold phenomenon is controlled by the ratio between the number of clauses and the number n of existential variables. Then we give the exact location of the associated critical ratio c*: it is a decreasing function of alpha where alpha is the limiting value of m/log(n) when n tends to infinity. Thus we give a precise location of the phase transition associated with a coNP-complete problem.", "paper_title": "EXACT LOCATION OF THE PHASE TRANSITION FOR RANDOM (1,2)-QSAT", "paper_id": "WOS:000353576100002"}
