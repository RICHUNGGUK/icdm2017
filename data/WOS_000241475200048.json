Support for the existence in the brain of the various modules thereby introduced is presented, especially those components involving an observer. The manner in which the model can be extended to executive functions involving the prefrontal cortices is then outlined, Finally the manner in which conscious experience may be supported by the architecture is described.", "paper_title": "Towards a control theory of attention", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200048"}
