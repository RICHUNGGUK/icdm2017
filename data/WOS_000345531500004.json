However, in the real world, the noise from actual cameras is better modeled as signal-dependent noise (SDN). In this paper, we focus on the SDN model and propose an algorithm to automatically estimate its parameters from a single noisy image. The proposed algorithm identifies the noise level function of signal-dependent noise assuming the generalized signal-dependent noise model and is also applicable to the Poisson-Gaussian noise model. The accuracy is achieved by improved estimation of local mean and local noise variance from the selected low-rank patches. We evaluate the proposed algorithm with both synthetic and real noisy images. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed estimation algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Practical Signal-Dependent Noise Parameter Estimation From a Single Noisy Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000345531500004"}
