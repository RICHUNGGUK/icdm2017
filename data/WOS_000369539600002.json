Trouble ticket systems are frequently used to organize the workflow of the fault resolution process. In this context, we introduce DisCaRia, a distributed case-based reasoning system that assists system administrators and network operators in resolving faults. DisCaRia integrates various fault knowledge resources that are already available in the Internet, and it exploits them by applying a distributed case-based reasoning methodology, which is based on scalable peer-to-peer technology. We present the architecture of DisCaRia, the key algorithms used by DisCaRia, and provide an evaluation of a prototype implementation of the system.", "paper_title": "DisCaRia-Distributed Case-Based Reasoning System for Fault Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000369539600002"}
