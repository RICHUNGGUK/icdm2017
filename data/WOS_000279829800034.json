The computing results show that, when compared with the short-term rate of return and its variance, both the long-term rate of return and variance decrease with the increasing of investment term; and when the short-term rate of return is a relatively minor positive value, the long-term rate of return, might be significantly negative. In addition, this paper also studies the long-term rate of return and variance with stop-loss strategy, and the results showed that the stop-loss strategy improve the long-term investment rate of return greatly. The relation between, the distribution of short-term rate of return and that of long-term rate of return is complicated, it is improper to directly and blindly judge the long-term rate of return and variance only according to the distribution of short-term rate of return.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN WHEN HOLDING RISK ASSET", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800034"}
