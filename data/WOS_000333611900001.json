First, moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition image chips have been segmented and then passed to a number of preprocessing stages such as histogram equalisation, position and size normalisation. Second, the feature extraction based on Zernike moments (ZMs) having linear transformation invariance properties and robustness in the presence of the noise has been introduced for the first time. Third, a genetic algorithm-based feature selection and a support vector machine classifier have been presented to select the optimal feature subset of ZMs for decreasing the computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in target recognition of SAR imagery. The authors obtained results show that just a small amount of ZMs features is sufficient to achieve the recognition rates that rival other established methods, and so ZMs features can be regarded as a powerful discriminatory feature for automatic target recognition applications relevant to SAR imagery. Furthermore, it can be observed that the classifier performs fairly well until the signal-to-noise ratio falls beneath 5 dB for noisy images.", "paper_title": "Automatic target recognition of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images based on optimal selection of Zernike moments features", "paper_id": "WOS:000333611900001"}
