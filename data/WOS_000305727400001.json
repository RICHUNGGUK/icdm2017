Hence, different proposals to tackle and manage the uncertainty have been developed. Probabilistic models are quite common, but when the uncertainty is not probabilistic in nature other models have arisen such as fuzzy logic and the fuzzy linguistic approach. The use of linguistic information to model and manage uncertainty has given good results and implies the accomplishment of processes of computing with words. A bird's eye view in the recent specialized literature about linguistic decision making, computing with words, linguistic computing models and their applications shows that the 2-tuple linguistic representation model [44] has been widely-used in the topic during the last decade. This use is because of reasons such as, its accuracy, its usefulness for improving linguistic solving processes in different applications, its interpretability, its ease managing of complex frameworks in which linguistic information is included and so forth. Therefore, after a decade of extensive and intensive successful use of this model in computing with words for different fields, it is the right moment to overview the model, its extensions, specific methodologies, applications and discuss challenges in the topic.
