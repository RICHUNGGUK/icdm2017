Various reconstructors of time to failure of units censored in a left-censored sample from the proportional reversed hazard rate models are demonstrated. The maximum-likelihood, best unbiased and conditional median reconstructors are obtained. We also present two methods, non-Bayesian and Bayesian, for obtaining reconstruction intervals for the past failure times. Numerical example and a Monte Carlo simulation study are given to illustrate all the reconstruction methods discussed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of the past failure times for the proportional reversed hazard rate model", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056900010"}
