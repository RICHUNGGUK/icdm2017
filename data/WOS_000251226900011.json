Conventional motion-adaptive deinterlacing algorithm selects from inter-field and intra-field interpolations according to motion. Accurate determination of motion information is essential for this purpose. Fine textures, having high local pixel variation, tend to cause false detection, of motion. Based on hierarchical wavelet analysis, this algorithm provides much better perceptual visual quality and considerably higher PSNR than other motion adaptive deinterlacers as shown. In addition, a recursive 3-field motion detection algorithm is also proposed to achieve better performance than the traditional 2-field motion detection algorithm with little memory overhead.", "paper_title": "Multiresolution-based texture adaptive algorithm for high-quality deinterlacing", "paper_id": "WOS:000251226900011"}
