This letter proposes a novel analytical framework, based on which the averaged signal-to-noise ratio and the ergodic capacity performance of clustering-based LFB beamforming in multiple-antenna OFDM systems are studied. Simulations are also provided to verify the analysis.", "paper_title": "On performance of clusterring-based limited feedback beamforming in multiple-antenna OFUM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257990300044"}
