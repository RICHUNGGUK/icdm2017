If H has bounded maximum degree and G is suitably dense and pseudorandom, then the algorithm succeeds with high probability. Our algorithm proves that, for every integer d3 and a large enough constant C = C-d, as n, asymptotically almost all graphs with n vertices and at least Cn2-1/dlog1/dn edges contain as subgraphs all graphs with n vertices and maximum degree at most d.
