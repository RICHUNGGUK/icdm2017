This scheme has Theta (min[r(2) ln n, n]) tests which is as many as the best nonexplicit schemes have. In our construction, we use a fact that may have a value by its own right: Linear error-correction codes with parameters [m, k, delta m](q) meeting the Gilbert-Varshamov bound may be constructed quite efficiently, in Theta (q(k)m) time.", "paper_title": "Explicit Nonadaptive Combinatorial Group Testing Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000297807300022"}
