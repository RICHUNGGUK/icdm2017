However, studies on the error reconciliation algorithm mainly focuses on the reconciliation efficiency. Since the ultimate goal of study on the error reconciliation is to find the most suitable algorithm for a quantum key distribution system and maximize the throughput rate of the whole system, the indicator of reconciliation efficiency is not full-scale enough to evaluate an error reconciliation algorithm. In this paper we propose a new evaluation scheme, including four direct indicators and one composite indicator to solve the problem. Following the new scheme, seven representative error reconciliation algorithms are simulated and compared thoroughly, i.e. BBBSS, the original Cascade and two improved Cascade algorithms, Winnow, and two LDPC based algorithms. Our works are very beneficial to the evaluation, comparison, selection and optimization of error reconciliation algorithms for a practical quantum key distribution system.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON ERROR RECONCILIATION IN QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579900005"}
