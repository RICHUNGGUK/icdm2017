This letter gives a brief overview of the existing power allocation design in the literature and unifies them into a general power allocation framework. Based on the closed-form solution derived for this general problem, the impact of network topology on the system performance is highlighted, which motivates us to propose a novel location-aware strategy that intelligently utilizes frequency and space opportunities and minimizes the overall power consumption while maintaining the quality of service of the primary system. This work shows that in addition to exploring spectrum holes in time and frequency domains, spatial opportunities can be utilized to further enhance energy efficiency for CR systems.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Location-Aware Strategies in Cognitive Radio Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209695900008"}
