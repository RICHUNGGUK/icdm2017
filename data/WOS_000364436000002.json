The geodesics on surfaces are traced in a simple way which is independent of the complex description of the geodesic equations. Through derivation process, the calculation error of this algorithm is obtained. A step size adjustment strategy which enables the step size adapt to the geometry of surface is introduced. The proposed method is also compared to some other well-known methods in this study. Many geodesics computed using these approaches on various B-spline surfaces or their equivalent tessellated surfaces have been presented. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient. Meanwhile, the results show that the step size adjustment strategy works well for most of the cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
