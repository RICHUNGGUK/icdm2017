Virtual communities defined by hashtags in Twitter are created for exchanging information about the news topic. Finding influential Twitter users in these communities related to a news topic would help us understand why some opinions are popular, and get valuable and reliable information for the news topic. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect news-topic-related user communities defined by hashtags based on characteristic co-occurrence word detection. We also propose RetweetRank and MentionRank to find two types of influential Twitter users from these news-topic-related communities based on user's retweet and mention activities. Experimental results show that our characteristic co-occurrence word detection methods could detect words which are highly relevant to the news topic. RetweetRank could find influential Twitter users whose tweets about the news topic are valuable and more likely to interest others. MentionRank could find influential Twitter users who have high authority on the news topic. Our methods also outperform other related methods in evaluations.", "paper_title": "FINDING NEWS-TOPIC ORIENTED INFLUENTIAL TWITTER USERS BASED ON TOPIC RELATED HASHTAG COMMUNITY DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000342116800003"}
