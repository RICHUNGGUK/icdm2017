Utilizing it as the threshold key generation protocol, we present a secure (t, n) threshold signature scheme based on the Waters' signature scheme. We prove that Our scheme is unforgeable and robust against my adaptive adversary who can choose players for corruption at any time during the run of the protocols and make adaptive chosen-message attacks. And the security proof Of Ours is in the standard model (without random oracles). In addition Our scheme achieves optimal resilience, that is, the adversary can corrupt any t < n/2 players.", "paper_title": "Adaptively Secure Threshold Signature Scheme in the Standard Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000273198800009"}
