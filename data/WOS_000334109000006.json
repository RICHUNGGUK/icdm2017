We present a family of fast recursive algorithms and prove they are robust under any small perturbations of the input data matrix. This family generalizes several existing hyperspectral unmixing algorithms and hence provides for the first time a theoretical justification of their better practical performance.", "paper_title": "Fast and Robust Recursive Algorithms for Separable Nonnegative Matrix Factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000334109000006"}
