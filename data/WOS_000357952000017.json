This article presents Contech, a high performance framework for generating dynamic task graphs from arbitrary parallel programs, and a novel representation enabling programmers and compiler optimizations to understand and exploit program aspects. The Contech framework supports a variety of languages (including C, C++, and Fortran), parallelization libraries, and ISAs (including x86 and ARM). Running natively for collection speed and minimizing program perturbation, the instrumentation shows 4x improvement over a Pin-based implementation on PARSEC and NAS benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Contech: Efficiently Generating Dynamic Task Graphs for Arbitrary Parallel Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000357952000017"}
