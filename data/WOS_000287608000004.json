Starting with a given graph, repeatedly add edges that join the midpoints of two randomly chosen edges. We show that the growing graph asymptotically almost surely has logarithmic diameter. This process is motivated by a particular type of peer-to-peer network. Our method extends to similar processes that generate regular graphs of higher degree.", "paper_title": "Pegging Graphs Yields a Small Diameter", "paper_id": "WOS:000287608000004"}
