It is based on a block version of the square-root Kalman Filter algorithm that was initially devised to solve the RLS problem. It has been parallelized in a pipelined way obtaining a good efficiency and scalability. The optimum load balancing for this parallel algorithm is dynamic, but we derive a static load balancing scheme with good performance.", "paper_title": "Heterogeneous pipelined square-root Kalman Filter algorithm for the MMSE-OSIC problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000296012700012"}
