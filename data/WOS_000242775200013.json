Methods: Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2006. Results: The selection process for this yearbook's section \"Sensor, signal and imaging informatics\" results in six excellent articles, representing research in five different nations. We selected a cross section of the wide range of application, ranging from model based image segmentation, image retrieval and data mining, image based diagnosis assistance, bio-impedance based skin cancer screening, brain computer interfaces to MRI based computational models for fluid-structure-interactions. Conclusions: The selected articles indicate a small but meaningful extract from the research field of sensors, signal and image processing, which has a wide range of applications in medical informatics. The articles present excellent research with a possibility of having high relevance for the future in patient cafe.", "paper_title": "Sensors, medical image and signal processing - Findings from the section on sensor, signal and imaging informatics", "paper_id": "WOS:000242775200013"}
