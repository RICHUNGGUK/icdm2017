When M is an M-matrix of order n, the algorithm is known to converge in at most n iterations. We show in this paper that this result no longer holds when M is a P-matrix of order a parts per thousand yen 3, since then the algorithm may cycle. P-matrices are interesting since they are those ensuring the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the LCP for an arbitrary q. Incidentally, convergence occurs for a P-matrix of order 1 or 2.", "paper_title": "Nonconvergence of the plain Newton-min algorithm for linear complementarity problems with a P-matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000307998000002"}
