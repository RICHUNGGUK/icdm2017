This approach allows us to explain why, in the periodic case, the Godunov scheme applied to the resolution of the compressible Euler or Navier-Stokes system is accurate at low Mach number when the mesh is triangular or tetrahedral and is not accurate when the mesh is a 2D (or 3D) cartesian mesh. This approach confirms also the fact that a Godunov scheme remains accurate when it is modified by simply centering the discretization of the pressure gradient. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
