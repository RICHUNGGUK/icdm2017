The cost of the grooming is the sum, over all subgraphs, of the number of vertices of nonzero degree in the sub-graph. The optimum grooming is the one of lowest cost. An integer linear programming formulation is used to determine precise lower bounds on this minimum cost for all choices of n and v when 1 <= C' < C <= 3. In most cases, this approach determines not only the bound but also the specific structure of any grooming that could realize the bound. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
