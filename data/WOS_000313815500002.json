However, numerous challenges exist in the implementation of traceability in the software engineering industry. Some of these challenges can be overcome through organizational policy and procedure changes, but the lack of cost-effective traceability models and tools remains an open problem. A novel, cost-effective solution for the traceability tool problem is proposed, prototyped, and tested in a case study using an actual software project. Metrics from the case study are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed solution for the traceability tool problem. The results show that the proposed method offers significant advantages over implementing traceability manually or using existing commercial traceability approaches.", "paper_title": "A streamlined, cost-effective database approach to manage requirements traceability", "paper_id": "WOS:000313815500002"}
