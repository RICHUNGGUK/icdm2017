These measures quantify the complexity of the angular diffusion profile modeled using a higher order model, thereby giving more information than classical diffusion tensor-derived parameters. The method is based on the spherical harmonic (SH) representation of the angular diffusion information, and is generalizable to a range of HARDI reconstruction models. These scalars are obtained as homogeneous polynomials of the SH representation of a HARDI reconstruction model. We show that finding such polynomials is equivalent to solving a large linear system of equations, and present a numerical method based on sparse matrices to efficiently solve this system. Among the solutions, we only keep a subset of algebraically independent polynomials, using an algorithm based on a numerical implementation of the Jacobian criterion. We compute a set of 12 or 25 rotationally invariant measures representative of the underlying white matter for the rank-4 or rank-6 spherical harmonics (SHs) representation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) profile, respectively. Synthetic data was used to investigate and quantify the difference in contrast. Real data acquired with multiple repetitions showed that within subject variation in the invariants was less than the difference across subjects - facilitating their use to study population differences. These results demonstrate that our measures are able to characterize white matter, especially complex white matter found in regions of fiber crossings and hence can be used to derive new biomarkers for HARDI and can be used for HARDI-based population analysis.
