Optimal order error estimate in a discrete H-1 norm is established for the corresponding iDG-FEM solutions. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the robustness, reliability, and accuracy of the iDG-FEM.", "paper_title": "An incomplete discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for second order elliptic problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000330602400009"}
