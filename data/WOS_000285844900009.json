This grading scheme is often subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, a novel computer-aided diagnosis method via ranking is proposed to facilitate nuclear cataract grading following conventional clinical decision-making process. The grade of nuclear cataract in a slit-lamp image is predicted using its neighboring labeled images in a ranked image list, which is achieved using a learned ranking function. This ranking function is learned via direct optimization on a newly proposed approximation to a ranking evaluation measure. Our proposed method has been evaluated by a large dataset composed of 1000 different cases, which are collected from an ongoing clinical population-based study. Both experimental results and comparison with several existing methods demonstrate the benefit of grading via ranking by our proposed method.", "paper_title": "A Computer Assisted Method for Nuclear Cataract Grading From Slit-Lamp Images Using Ranking", "paper_id": "WOS:000285844900009"}
