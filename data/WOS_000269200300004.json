The proposed cluster leader logic algorithm is motivated by the GPS quorum hybrid routing algorithm, where clusterheads are positioned on the terrain upon a conceptual cellular grid. The proposed distributed clustering algorithm chooses the clusterheads based on the traffic flow patterns, i.e. the nodes best suited to forward and route network traffic are selected. Our approach allows a clusterhead which is overwhelmed with sending packets to identify an additional clusterhead from nodes available in its cell to share its load. Likewise, clusterheads with low load will try to relinquish their role as a clusterhead. We propose a new concept called cell fanning that allows collocated clusterheads in one cell to share routing responsibilities by declaring which cells they are responsible for routing packets to. We conducted extensive simulation experiments with enforced directional traffic patterns. Two important results are presented: power consumption per clusterhead and average queuing delay for each clusterhead. Results in terms of message overheads, number of clusterheads, power consumption, and queuing delay reveal that system performance is enhanced when clusterheads are chosen considering the direction of the traffic flow.", "paper_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Distributed Clustering Algorithm for Mobile ad hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269200300004"}
