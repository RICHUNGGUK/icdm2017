In comparison to other communication networks, VCNs come with major challenges: high mobility and velocity of vehicles that cause rapidly change topology of network and fast change of vehicle's locations. Location information services (LISs) or location management systems (LMSs) are used to provide location information about vehicles such as current location, speed, direction and report this information to other vehicles or network entities that require this information. We present a survey for LISs in VCNs and introduce 11 approaches in literature. Moreover, we present a classification for LISs and compare mentioned approaches based on our classification. Finally we evaluate studied LISs by some performance properties to measure their overall efficiency.", "paper_title": "Survey on location information services for Vehicular Communication Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339379900020"}
