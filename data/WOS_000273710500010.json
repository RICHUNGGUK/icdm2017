Securing intersensor communications within BANs is essential for preserving not only the privacy of health data, but also for ensuring safety of healthcare delivery. This paper presents physiological-signal-based key agreement (PSKA), a scheme for enabling secure intersensor communication within a BAN in a usable (plug-n-play, transparent) manner. PSKA allows neighboring nodes in a BAN to agree to a symmetric (shared) cryptographic key, in an authenticated manner, using physiological signals obtained from the subject. No initialization or predeployment is required; simply deploying sensors in a BAN is enough to make them communicate securely. Our analysis, prototyping, and comparison with the frequently used Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol shows that PSKA is a viable intersensor key agreement protocol for BANs.", "paper_title": "PSKA: Usable and Secure Key Agreement Scheme for Body Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273710500010"}
