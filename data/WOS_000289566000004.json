Using an optimal quadratic programming method is to solve the singularity problem and the computing load of motion planning is reduced by a novel hybrid motion planning method. To achieve contour tracking with output feedback, an integral sliding mode control with a high-gain observer is employed to eliminate the chattering due to discontinuous switching control of the sliding-mode control and maintain robustness of the ideal sliding mode.", "paper_title": "Contour Tracking of a Redundant Robot Using Integral Variable Structure Control with Output Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000289566000004"}
