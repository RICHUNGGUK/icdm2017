Here, multiple execution modes are available for the individual activities of the project. In addition, minimum as well as maximum time lags between different activities may be given. The objective is to determine a mode and a start time for each activity such that the temporal and resource constraints are met and the project duration is minimised. Project scheduling problems of this type occur e.g. in process industries. The heuristic is a two-phased genetic algorithm with different representation, fitness, crossover operator, etc., in each of them. One of the contributions of the paper is the optimisation in the first phase of a problem dual to the original, the searching for the best modes of the activities. Computational results show that the algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in medium and large instances. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
