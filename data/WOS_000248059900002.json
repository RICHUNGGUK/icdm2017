Based on the same principles of RCR (Relative Citation Rate) and RW (Relative Subfield Citedness), a new dimension - the Relative Superiority Coefficient (SC (n) ) in research quality was introduced. This can indicate clearly the relative research level for research groups at multiple levels in the respective field by consistent criteria in terms of research quality. Comparison of the SC (n) within or across 22 broad fields among 5 countries were presented as an application model. Hierarchical Cluster and One-Way ANOVA were applied and processed by the statistical program SPSS. All original data were from Essential Science Indicators (ESI) 1996-2006.", "paper_title": "Relative Superiority Coefficient of papers: A new dimension for institutional research performance in different fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000248059900002"}
