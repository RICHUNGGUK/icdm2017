Using a general reliability model for grid computing to relax some impractical assumptions, a heuristic algorithm is presented to evaluate grid program/service reliability. The heuristic algorithm is based on two heuristic criteria that determine the significance of an entity and prune those insignificant ones. Through algorithm analysis, the heuristic algorithm is shown to have a linear complexity. This is much better than the previous algorithms, which are of exponential complexity. Another advantage of the heuristic algorithm is that the running time is controllable by adjusting the parameter of significant level (SL) and significant rate. A regression method is proposed to adjust the SL and predict the running time. Two examples are given.", "paper_title": "A heuristic algorithm for reliability modeling and analysis of grid systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244401800006"}
