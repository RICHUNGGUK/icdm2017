This seems to be especially inevitable in digital forensic investigations. Consequently, there is an urgent need to balance the desire for privacy preservation and information extraction in the process of digital forensic investigations. This paper focuses on the issues related to personal privacy protection by proposing a digital forensics framework based on the theory of ontology. In addition to introducing the basic concepts that will lead to the establishment of the framework, we will also present some experiments that can be viewed as the demonstration of the effectiveness of the framework in privacy protection in the process of digital forensic investigations. The framework can thus serve as the foundation in the design of digital forensic tools and systems that can respect the privacy of individuals.", "paper_title": "Ontology-based Privacy Preserving Digital Forensics Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000361378000008"}
