We present in this paper an approach to image chromatic adaptation using Neural Networks (NN) with application for detecting - adapting human skin color. The NN is trained on randomly chosen color images containing human subject under various illuminating conditions, thereby enabling the model to dynamically adapt to the changing illumination conditions. The proposed network predicts directly the illuminant estimate in the image so as to adapt to human skin color. The comparison of our method with Gray World, White Patch and NN on White Patch methods for skin color stabilization is presented. The skin regions in the NN stabilized images are successfully detected using a computationally inexpensive thresholding operation. We also present results on detecting skin regions on a data set of test images. The results are promising and suggest a new approach for adapting human skin color using neural networks.", "paper_title": "Neural network approach for image chromatic adaptation for skin color detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000245483600001"}
