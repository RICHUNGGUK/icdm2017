These polytopes can be expressed as Minkowski sums and differences of dilated faces of a standard simplex as described by Ardila et al. (Discret Comput Geom, 43:841-854, 2010). The coefficients of such a Minkowski decomposition can be computed by Mobius inversion if tight right-hand sides are known not just for the facet-defining inequalities of the associahedron but also for all inequalities of the permutahedron that are redundant for the associahedron. We show for certain families of these associahedra: (1) How to compute the tight value for any inequality that is redundant for an associahedron but facet-defining for the classical permutahedron. More precisely, each value is described in terms of tight values of facet-defining inequalities of the corresponding associahedron determined by combinatorial properties of . (2) The computation of the values of Ardila, Benedetti & Doker can be significantly simplified and depends on at most four values and . (3) The four indices and are determined by the geometry of the normal fan of the associahedron and are described combinatorially. (4) A combinatorial interpretation of the values using a labeled -gon. This result is inspired from similar interpretations for vertex coordinates originally described by Loday and well-known interpretations for the -values of facet-defining inequalities.", "paper_title": "Minkowski Decomposition of Associahedra and Related Combinatorics", "paper_id": "WOS:000327891900004"}
