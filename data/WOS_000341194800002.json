Assume that the probability that F is unsatisfiable is O(1/log(n)(1+delta)) for some delta > 0. We show that (possibly excluding a countable set of \"exceptional\" alpha's) the number of solutions concentrates, i.e., there exists a non-random function alpha bar right arrow phi(s)(alpha) such that, for any epsilon > 0, we have Z(F) is an element of [2(n(phi s-epsilon)), 2(n(phi s+epsilon))] with high probability. In particular, the assumption holds for all alpha < 1, which proves the above concentration claim in the whole satisfiability regime of random 2-SAT. We also extend these results to a broad class of constraint satisfaction problems.
