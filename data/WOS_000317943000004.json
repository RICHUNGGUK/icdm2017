This increase will reduce the extraction costs and the resulting environmental impact. This paper presents a computational approach to automatically predict and optimise the cutting of ornamental commercial rock quarry from primary blocks. Our work complements previous ones, which are focused on the primary blocks prediction, since we start with primary blocks and optimise their cutting for ornamental purposes. The developed method uses data from the three main families found in an exploited deposit and numerical procedures to calculate the appropriate advance direction for the exploitation yield optimisation. Specifically, the family system is numerically modelled to determine the maximum block to be extracted and its surrounding parallelepiped (SP). Then a 3D mesh is created for use in the rock-cutting process and to determine the optimum advance direction. Modelling the rock-cutting process permits the results for any cutting parameter and advance direction to be obtained automatically. The obtained data have allowed us to observe large variations in the exploitation yield by modifying the cutting advance direction and how the developed method automatically predicts the optimum advance direction for maximising exploitation yield. Furthermore, the developed method has been implemented in a computer tool, which presents the results graphically. The automatic prediction of the cutting output is of significant practical utility because it enables exploitation yield to increase while reducing dump size. These improvements imply economic and environmental benefits because more commercial blocks will be extracted from a single exploitation, and the disposable volume will decrease.
