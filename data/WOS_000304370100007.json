We have studied dominant management orientation, researching whether there is a significant difference in the adoption of ICT between organisations where dominant management orientation is towards results and organisations where dominant management orientation is towards people. Research was conducted using case studies for 71 organisations, which yielded quantitative data used for statistical analysis. Empirical research has shown significant difference between two mentioned groups of organisations, and organisations where dominant management orientation was towards results had much better ICT adoption. Also, composite index of ICT adoption, which we have used in previous research, was checked again as a tool for ICT adoption measurement in a different context. Results can provide guidelines regarding desired changes in dominant management orientation for organisations adopting ICT and contribute to improving theoretical framework of factors in ICT adoption.", "paper_title": "Adoption of information and communication technologies and dominant management orientation in organisations", "paper_id": "WOS:000304370100007"}
