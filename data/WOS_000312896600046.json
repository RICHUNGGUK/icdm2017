Nonlinearity is introduced into state cycles by adding a non-linear Boolean function to the feedback polynomial of the LFSR. Each assignment of variables for which this function evaluates to 1 acts as a crossing point for the LFSR state cycle. The effect of non-linearity is cancelled and state cycles are joined back by adding a copy of the same function to a later stage of the register. The presented method requires no extra time steps and it has a smaller area overhead compared to the previous approaches based on cross-join pairs. It is feasible for large n.", "paper_title": "A Scalable Method for Constructing Galois NLFSRs With Period 2(n)-1 Using Cross-Join Pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000312896600046"}
