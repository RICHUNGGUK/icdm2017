Based on wave-number analysis of the structures, the acoustic radiation performance of the flexible linkage mechanism call be valued with the vibration of a \"virtual linkage mechanism\". The integrated structural design and control design is carried out to attenuate the acoustic radiation of the mechanism. In which, the thickness of the links and the parameters of control system are taken as independent design variables simultaneously. The weighted sum of structural mass, acoustic radiation energy of the mechanism, and energy cost of the control system is taken as the performance index, and optimization is carried out based oil the modified constrained variable metric method. At last, simulation is carried out to verify the method presented. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
