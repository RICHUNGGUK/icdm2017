A margin condition, which measures how quickly the a posteriori probabilities cross the decision boundary, smoothness conditions on the a posteriori probabilities, and boundedness of the feature vector are imposed. The rates of convergence of the plug-in classifiers shown in this paper are faster than previously known.", "paper_title": "On the rate of convergence of local averaging plug-in classification rules under a margin condition", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034600008"}
