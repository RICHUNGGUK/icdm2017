In this model, we estimate the independence number alpha(G(n,m,lambda)), for the wide range m = left perpendicularn(alpha)right perpendicular, alpha < 1 and lambda = O(m(1/4)). We also prove the Hamiltonicity of this model by an interesting combinatorial construction. Finally, we give a brief note concerning the independence number of G(n,m,p) random intersection graphs, in which each vertex chooses labels with probability p. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
