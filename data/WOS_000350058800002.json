This is despite a wealth of available large-scale physical and genetic interaction data. To address this, we extended the GeneMANIA function prediction web application developed for model eukaryotes to support E.coli. Results: We integrated 48 distinct E.coli functional interaction datasets and used the GeneMANIA algorithm to produce thousands of novel functional predictions and prioritize genes for further functional assays. Our analysis achieved cross-validation performance comparable to that reported for eukaryotic model organisms, and revealed new functions for previously uncharacterized genes in specific bioprocesses, including components required for cell adhesion, iron-sulphur complex assembly and ribosome biogenesis. The GeneMANIA approach for network-based function prediction provides an innovative new tool for probing mechanisms underlying bacterial bioprocesses.", "paper_title": "Novel function discovery with GeneMANIA: a new integrated resource for gene function prediction in Escherichia coli", "paper_id": "WOS:000350058800002"}
