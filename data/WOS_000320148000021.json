These interactions are treated by interpolating the MD particle density onto a discrete lattice, which is then coupled to the fluid. A thermal lattice-Boltzmann algorithm is used to model the fluid, which includes mass and momentum conserving noise, providing a thermostat for both the particles and the fluid.

Computer: All. Operating system: All. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes. Parallelized using MPI directives. RAM: Depends on the problem Supplementary material: The data file for the \"conflned_colloid\" example can be downloaded here. Classification: 7.7. External routines: LAMMPS [1] (http://lammps.sandia.gov) Nature of problem: The inclusion of long-range hydrodynamic effects into molecular dynamics simulations requires the presence of an explicit solvent. Currently, the only option for incorporating such a solvent into a LAMMPS [1] simulation is the explicit inclusion of each of the individual solvent molecules. This is obviously quite computationally intensive, and for large system sizes can quickly become impractical. Solution method: As an alternative, we have implemented a coarse-grained model for the fluid, simplifying the problem, while retaining the solvent degrees of freedom. We use a thermal lattice-Boltzmann model for the fluid, which is coupled to the molecular dynamics particles at each fluid time step [2,3]. Restrictions: While LAMMPS supports non-orthogonal simulation boxes, this particular fix can only be performed using a three-dimensional, orthogonal simulation domain. In addition, this fix allows for external walls in the z-direction (x-y plane) only; the simulation domain is always assumed to be periodic along the x and y directions. However, immersed boundaries can be added anywhere by the user. Running time: The run time for fix_lb_fluid varies from minutes to days depending on the system size, the number of lattice mesh points, and the number of processors used. References: [1] S.
