Three low energy conformers of fluvastatin have been calculated. The vibrational spectroscopic properties calculated for the most stable conformer were in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. A series of hydrogen bonded complexes of the most stable conformer of fluvastatin anion with low molecular weight models of the polymers have been fully optimized. In almost all, intermolecular H-bonds are formed between the sulfate groups of iota- or lambda-carrageenan and fluvastatin's hydroxyls, resulting in a red shift of the fluvastatin's O -aEuro parts per thousand H stretching vibrations. Cooperative intramolecular H-bonds within fluvastatin or iota-, lambda-carrageenan are also present. The BSSE and ZPE corrected interaction energies were estimated in the range 281-318 kJ mol(-1) for iota-carrageenan - fluvastatin and 145-200 kJ mol(-1) for lambda-carrageenan - fluvastatin complexes. The electron density (rho (bcp)) and Laplacian (a double dagger(2) rho (bcp)) properties at critical points of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, estimated by AIM (atoms in molecules) calculations, have a low and positive character (a double dagger(2) rho (bcp) > 0), consistent with the electrostatic character of the hydrogen bonds. The structural and energetic data observed, as well as the extent of the red shift of the fluvastatin's O -aEuro parts per thousand H stretching vibrations upon complex formation and the properties of electron density show a stronger binding of fluvastatin to iota- than to lambda-carrageenan.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of hydrogen bond interactions of fluvastatin with iota-carrageenan and lambda-carrageenan", "paper_id": "WOS:000292290600014"}
