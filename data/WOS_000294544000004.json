Multidomain collaboration (MDC) has emerged as a new framework to solve the problem, to some extent, with a great spectrum efficiency improvement. In this article, we introduce the concept of MDC with the help of some intuitive examples. Specifically, the underlying rationale of MDC for increasing transmission capacity is revealed from the perspective of both multiplexing gain and power gain. Cases studies of point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, multipoint-to-point, and multipoint-to-multipoint transmissions are conducted as preliminary evaluations of the performance limits that may be achieved by MDC.", "paper_title": "MULTIDOMAIN COLLABORATION: A NEW FRAMEWORK OF WIRELESS NETWORKS WITH HIGH TRANSMISSION CAPACITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000294544000004"}
