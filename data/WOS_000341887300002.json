Design/methodology/approach - Using a large-scale data set of individual content usage in a particular music mobile app, the author builds a simultaneous equation panel data model to examine dynamic interdependent usage of mobile app. Findings - The paper finds a positive temporal effect of self-oriented content usage (download) on other-oriented content usage (gift), based on behavioral orientation, and also a temporal interdependence between external (ringtone) and internal usage (mp3) based on types of content. The paper also finds that the fourth generation communications standard increases content usage in this mobile app. Practical implications - These findings provide useful insights for mobile app developers, mobile network operators, content providers, and mobile device manufacturers. Originality/value - This paper is one of the first to consider and empirically test the interrelationship between various kinds of content usage in music apps.", "paper_title": "An empirical analysis of usage dynamics in a mobile music app: evidence from large-scale data", "paper_id": "WOS:000341887300002"}
