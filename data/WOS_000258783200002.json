The incorporation of local correlation narrows the distribution for \"frequent\" events, whereas global correlations due to technical analysis leads to fat tails. Delay of market transactions in the trading process shifts the fat tail probabilities dowmwards. Such an inclusion of reactions to market fluctuations leads to mini-trends which are distributed with unit variance.", "paper_title": "Random-walk type model with fat tails for financial markets", "paper_id": "WOS:000258783200002"}
