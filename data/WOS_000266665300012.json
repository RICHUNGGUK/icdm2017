In the proposed scheme, independent component analysis is used to extract a dynamic frame from two successive frames of original video, and the motion is located by using the variance of 8 x 8 block in the extracted dynamic frame. Then according to the located motion, we choose a corresponding region in the former frame of the two successive frames, where watermark is embedded by using the quantization index modulation algorithm. The procedure above is repeated until each frame of the video (excluding the last one) is watermarked. The simulations show that the proposed scheme has a good performance to resist Gaussian noising, MPEG2 compression, frame dropping, frame cropping, etc.", "paper_title": "A motion location based video watermarking scheme using ICA to extract dynamic frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000266665300012"}
