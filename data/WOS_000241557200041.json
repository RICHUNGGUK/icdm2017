This contribution presents an approach to FSI problems with incompressible Newtonian fluids and elastic structures and discusses its realization in a general purpose parallel finite element research code. The resulting algorithm is robust and efficient and scales well on parallel machines. Recent attempts on efficiency improvements are discussed and a numerical example is shown.", "paper_title": "An approach for parallel fluid-structure interaction on unstructured meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241557200041"}
