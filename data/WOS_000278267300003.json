Using recently introduced information-theoretic measures for quantum processes, we quantify their information storage and processing in terms of entropy rate and excess entropy, giving closed-form expressions where possible. To illustrate the impact of measurement on information storage in quantum processes, we analyze two spin-1 sofic quantum systems that differ only in how they are measured.", "paper_title": "Computation in Sofic Quantum Dynamical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278267300003"}
