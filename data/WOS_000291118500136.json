This approach is based on an automatic four step algorithm. First the acquired voltage signals are represented in a 3-D space referential. Then principal component analysis is performed. In the third, features are extracted from the obtained eigenvalues of each disturbance waveforms. Finally a neuro-fuzzy based classifier automatically classifies the PQ disturbances. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method several case studies are presented. From the obtained results it is possible to confirm that the proposed approach can effectively classify different PQ disturbances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
