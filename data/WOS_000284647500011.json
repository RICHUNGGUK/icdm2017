A stabilization condition is obtained by applying a new Lyapunov function. It is shown that our new theorem is equivalent to an existing result in guaranteeing the stability of the fuzzy system but consumes less computational time than the latter. The effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed design approach are demonstrated by an example borrowed from the literature.", "paper_title": "Stabilization for discrete-time fuzzy systems with Takagi-Sugeno's models: reduce the complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500011"}
