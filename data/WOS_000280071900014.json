The focus of the present experiments are secondary disturbances of the boundary layer which is modulated by stationary streamwise vortices. Both the stationary vortices and the secondary oscillations of interest are generated in a controlled manner. The experimental data are obtained through hot-wire measurements. Thus, evolution of the vortices, either isolated or interacting with each other, is reconstructed in detail. As is found, the secondary disturbances, initiating the laminar-flow breakdown, are strongly affected by configuration of the stationary boundary-layer perturbation that may have an implication to laminar-turbulent transition control.", "paper_title": "Secondary instability of a swept-wing boundary layer disturbed by controlled roughness elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000280071900014"}
