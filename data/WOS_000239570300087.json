How to add relay sensors such that the underlying graph is connected and the number of relay sensors added is minimized is an important problem in wireless sensor networks. This paper presents an Efficient Relay Sensors Placing Algorithm (ERSPA) for solving such a problem. Compared with minimum spanning tree algorithm and greedy algorithm, ERSPA achieves a better performance in terms of number of relay sensors added. Simulation results show that the average number of relay sensors added by minimal spanning tree algorithm is approximately up to two times than ERSPA algorithm.", "paper_title": "An efficient relay sensors placing algorithm for connectivity in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300087"}
