The evolution of recombinant sequences can not be properly explained by a single phylogenetic tree, but several phylogenies may be used to correctly model the evolution of non-recombinant fragments. Results: We developed a likelihood-based model selection procedure that uses a genetic algorithm to search multiple sequence alignments for evidence of recombination breakpoints and identify putative recombinant sequences. GARD is an extensible and intuitive method that can be run efficiently in parallel. Extensive simulation studies show that the method nearly always outperforms other available tools, both in terms of power and accuracy and that the use of GARD to screen sequences for recombination ensures good statistical properties for methods aimed at detecting positive selection.
