The results for the special cases of complete and ordinary Type-II right censored samples are then deduced. Several numerical examples from the literature are presented for the purpose of illustrating the established results.", "paper_title": "On the likelihood estimation of the parameters of Gompertz distribution based on complete and progressively Type-II censored samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000335214900011"}
