In this paper we extend this result to random graphs. Motivated by the study of resilience of random graph properties we prove that if p >> log n/n, then a.a.s. every subgraph of G(n, p) with minimum degree at least (1/2 + o(1))np is Hamiltonian. Our result improves on previously known bounds, and answers an open problem of Sudakov and Vu. Both, the range of edge probability p and the value of the constant 1/2 are asymptotically best possible. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
