Spherical uncertainties of a given norm are considered, minimal in Frobenius norm sense, producing a maximum influence on the stability margin of the system. The resulting procedure nonconservatively calculates the stability margin change incorporating given spherically bounded uncertainties. The extremal uncertainties are derived in their structural details. Both large-scale and small uncertainties are taken into consideration. The calculations also determine how much the uncertainties may be increased without violating a lower limit of the stability margin or before instability would occur. Entirely and partially perturbed coefficient matrices of the dynamic system representation are looked into.", "paper_title": "Stability margin and spherical uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000241278300001"}
