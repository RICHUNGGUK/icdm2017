Using the differential equation that governs the vibration of plates traveling at a constant axial speed, and utilizing the rheological models to model the viscoelastic behavior of materials, the exact stiffness matrix of a finite strip of plate is extracted in the frequency domain. Terms of this matrix are implicit functions of the eigenvalues of free vibration, in-plane forces, viscoelasticity parameters, axial speed and the geometry of the plate. By assembling the stiffness matrices of these finite strips, the global stiffness matrix of a plate moving oil intermediate rollers is obtained, from which the eigenvalues defining the free vibration of the plate are extracted within the domain of complex numbers using a suitable algorithm. These values (that represent the exact frequencies of the plate vibration and damping) can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of other numerical techniques. Finally, by presenting a set of numerical examples, the effects of axial speed and viscoelastic parameters on the free vibration of moving plates are examined in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
