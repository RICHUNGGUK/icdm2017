Our method generalizes the simplex method for linear programming to deal with complementarity conditions. We develop an anticycling scheme that can verify Bouligand stationarity. We also give an optimization-based technique to find an initial feasible vertex. Starting with a feasible vertex, our algorithm always finds a minimizer or an unbounded descent search direction in a finite number of pivoting steps.", "paper_title": "A pivoting algorithm for linear programming with linear complementarity constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000302315500006"}
