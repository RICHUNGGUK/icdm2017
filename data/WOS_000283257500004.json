The objective is to minimize the makespan. Two algorithms are presented, where the first is optimal for 1.559 <= s <= 2 and s >= 3+root 17/2 . In addition, the improvement on lower bounds is made for 2 < s < 3+root 17/2.", "paper_title": "Semi-online scheduling with known maximum job size on two uniform machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000283257500004"}
