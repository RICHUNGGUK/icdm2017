This study suggests two determinants of consumer attitude toward the e-commerce website with customization options: perceived participation and perceived company responsiveness. Consumer attitude was posited to influence consumers' intention to consider a long-term relationship with an e-commerce company. In this model, two consumer characteristics-consumer expertise and preference stability-were considered as moderators of the relations between consumers' perception of participation and company's responsiveness and consumer attitude toward the customization program. The model was tested by structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS 14.0, and the posited relations were confirmed. The moderating effect of preference stability was found significant. The perceived participation level of those with a more stable preference influenced their attitude toward the customization experience, while the company's responsiveness was influential only for those with a less stable preference.
