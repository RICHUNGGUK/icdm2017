We describe an optical self-routing network based on a combination of \"clockwork\" routing and wavelength division multiplexing to provide low latency and high bandwidth, with large scalability. The optical-layer architecture is described in detail, and results obtained from full numerical simulations of traffic performance demonstrate scalability to networks as large as 2048 nodes in a flat single-stage network architecture.
