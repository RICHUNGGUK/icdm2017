This class of connected filters suppresses details but preserves the contours of the remaining structures or objects. As the notion of \"color structure\" is not trivial, the formulation of morphological operators for color images involves many open issues. The principle choice of a well-defined color space is crucial and it is proposed to work on a luminance/saturation/hue representation defined by the norm L(1). A family of morphological color operators is then introduced using the classical formulation with total orderings by means of lexicographic cascades. In this framework, a methodology for color image simplification is introduced, which takes advantage of a saturation-controlled combination of the chromatic and the achromatic (or the spectral and the spatio-geometric) components. More precisely, it is based on the application of a color leveling to each significant region, specifically adapted to the nature (chromatic/achromatic) of the region and which needs an initial image partition into the homogenous regions. Experimental results illustrate the performance of the new developed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Morphological color image simplification by saturation-controlled regional levelings", "paper_id": "WOS:000243988600005"}
