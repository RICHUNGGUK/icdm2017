At each outer iteration k the method requires the epsilon(k)-global minimization of the Augmented Lagrangian with simple constraints, where epsilon(k) -> epsilon. Global convergence to an epsilon-global minimizer of the original problem is proved. The subproblems are solved using the alpha BB method. Numerical experiments are presented.", "paper_title": "Global minimization using an Augmented Lagrangian method with variable lower-level constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000281761500007"}
