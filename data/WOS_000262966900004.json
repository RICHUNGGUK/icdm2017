In the macroscopic chemistry method (MCM) for DSMC, chemical reactions are decoupled from the specific particle pairs selected for collisions. Information from all of the particles within a cell, not just those selected for collisions, is used to determine a reaction rate coefficient for that cell. Unlike collision-based methods, MCM can be used with any viscosity or non-reacting collision models and any non-reacting energy exchange models. It can be used to implement any reaction rate formulations, whether these be from experimental or theoretical studies. MCM has been previously validated for steady flow DSMC simulations. Here we show how MCM can be used to model chemical kinetics in DSMC simulations of unsteady flow. Results are compared with a collision-based chemistry procedure for two binary reactions in a 1-D unsteady shock-expansion tube simulation. Close agreement is demonstrated between the two methods for instantaneous, ensemble-averaged profiles of temperature, density and species mole fractions, as well as for the accumulated number of net reactions per cell.
