A key to the success of MAS is efficient and effective multiagent learning (MAL). The past 25 years have seen a great interest and tremendous progress in the field of MAL. This article introduces and overviews this field by presenting its fundamentals, sketching its historical development, and describing some key algorithms for MAL. Moreover, main challenges that the field is facing today are identified.", "paper_title": "Multiagent Learning: Basics, Challenges, and Prospects", "paper_id": "WOS:000309621600004"}
