In recent years, it has been a widely studied topic in computer network security. In this paper, we present two methods, namely, the Hidden Markov Models (HMM) method and the Self Organizing Maps (SOM) method, to profile normal program behavior for anomaly intrusion detection based on computer audit data. The HMM method utilizes the transition property of events while SOM method relies on the frequency property of events. Two data sets, CERT synthetic Sendmail system call data collected in the University of New Mexico (UNM) and Live FTP system call data collected in the CNSIS lab of Xi'an Jiaotong University, were used to assess the two methods. Testing results show that the HMM method using the transition property of events produces good detection performance while high The HMM method is better than other two methods reported previously in terms of detection accuracy for the same data set. The SOM method considering the frequency property of events, on the other hand, is suitable for real-time intrusion detection because of its capability of processing a large amount of data with low computational overhead.
