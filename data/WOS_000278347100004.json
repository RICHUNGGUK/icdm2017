The duplexer is designed for application on W-CDMA handsets (Tx: 1920-1980 MHz, Rx: 2110-2170 MHz). The design methodology and implementation issues are discussed. A combined electromagnetic acoustic analysis results in a maximum insertion loss of 1.75 and 2.3 dB for Tx and Rx paths. The Tx-Rx isolation is better than 47/57 dB. The assembly of both Rx and Tx filters on the IPD will be discussed, as well as the simulated and measurement results.", "paper_title": "SMR-BAW duplexer for W-CDMA application", "paper_id": "WOS:000278347100004"}
