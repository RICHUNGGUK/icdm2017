Using Brown Motion Model and Multi-Dimensional Normal Distribution method, it is proved that a sensor node has higher probability to meet the sink node if and only if it moves more actively. Then, we propose an activity-based approach, in which, node compares the activity with others to make decision on when and how to exchange data message. The proposed scheme is generally applicable to any mobile sensor network, because sensors in our approach can have different speed and different activities. Extensive simulations are conducted for performance evaluation. The results show that activity-based data delivery scheme achieves the comparatively high successful delivery ratio with small delay and acceptable transmission overhead.", "paper_title": "A novel data transmission scheme for mobile sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000277952100005"}
