Sensor networks hold the promise of facilitating large-scale and real-time data processing in complex environments. Security is critical for many sensor network applications, such as military target tracking and security monitoring. To provide security and privacy to small sensor nodes is challenging, due to the limited capabilities of sensor nodes in terms of computation, communication, memory/storage, and energy supply. In this article we survey the state of the art in research on sensor network security.", "paper_title": "Security in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258868300007"}
