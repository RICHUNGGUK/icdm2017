It has modified F5 algorithm (Westfeld, 2001) [1] which provides higher security and embedding capacity in transform domain such that in the same cover image larger amount of data can be embedded. In this paper, the embedding capacity of the cover image has been improved by increasing the non-zero DCT coefficients. Experimental results show that for the test images under consideration, it can achieve the improvement of embedding capacity by about 53% and has better embedding efficiency in transform domain as compared to the original F5 algorithm for the same cover image.
