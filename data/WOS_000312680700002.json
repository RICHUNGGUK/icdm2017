For example, in a drama, after a user watches interesting content such as a highlight scene, he/she will watch the main program continuously. In close-range broadcasting, the necessary bandwidth for continuously playing the two types of data increases. Conventional methods reduce the necessary bandwidth by producing an effective broadcast schedule for continuous media data. However, these methods do not consider the broadcast schedule for two types of continuous media data. When the server schedules two types of continuous media data, waiting time that occurs from finishing the highlight scene to starting the main scene, may increase. In this paper, we propose a scheduling method to reduce the waiting time for close-range broadcasting. In our proposed method, by dividing two types of data and producing an effective broadcast schedule considering the available bandwidth, we can reduce the waiting time.", "paper_title": "A scheduling method to reduce waiting time for close-range broadcasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000312680700002"}
