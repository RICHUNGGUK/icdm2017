The advantages of an RSS-based operating principle over more traditional methods (e.g., time-of-arrival and time-difference-of-arrival) are described. Laboratory measurements of PD that emulate the operation of a PDWSN are presented. The hardware architecture of a prototype PD WSN is described and the particular challenges of an RSS-based location approach in an environment with an unknown, and spatially varying, path-loss index are discussed. It is concluded that an RSS-based PDWSN is a plausible solution for the monitoring of insulation integrity in electricity substations.", "paper_title": "Radiometric Wireless Sensor Network Monitoring of Partial Discharge Sources in Electrical Substations", "paper_id": "WOS:000362002100001"}
