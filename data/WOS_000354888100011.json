Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is considered as an effective approach for realising accurate and reliable vehicle positioning. To overcome the GNSS-challenged environments in urban areas, a low-cost cooperative vehicle positioning solution is proposed in this paper by exploring the capability of dedicated short range communication (DSRC) and dead reckoning (DR). The mechanism of DSRC-based cooperative positioning using the carrier frequency offset (CFO) observation is analysed. The Bayesian filtering scheme is employed for realising the information fusion of DSRC and DR, which promotes a DSRC/DR integration-based solution to compensate GNSS and achieve the desirable accuracy and availability. Results from a cooperative simulation platform show an encouraging performance stage of the proposed solution. Under the GNSS-challenged conditions, the accuracy and service availability are assured for supporting the cooperative vehicular applications.", "paper_title": "Integrating DSRC and dead-reckoning for cooperative vehicle positioning under GNSS-challenged vehicular environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000354888100011"}
