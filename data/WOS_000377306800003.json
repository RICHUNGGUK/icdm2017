In particular, joint power, sub-carrier, and antenna allocation problems are presented for both perfect and imperfect channel knowledge cases, aiming to maximize a sum-utility while maintaining a minimum rate per slice. Subsequently, relaxation and variable transformation are applied to develop the efficient algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex, combinational optimization problem. Simulation results reveal the benefits of applying a large number of antennas in this setup and evaluate the network performance for different system conditions.", "paper_title": "Resource Provisioning in Wireless Virtualized Networks via Massive-MIMO", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800003"}
