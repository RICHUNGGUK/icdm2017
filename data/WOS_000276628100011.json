The proposed registration method is essentially a model-based method, in which the CAD model is acquired by reverse engineering. The CAD model is converted into a two-dimensional (2D) image by a rendering technique, and the compatibility of the X-ray image and the image of the CAD model is investigated. To avoid the optimisation of six unknown parameters with respect to the relative pose between the condyle and tibial models, a 2D coordinate system is set on each component of the X-ray images. A 3D coordinate system is also set on each of the two nearthrosis components. With such a setup, there is only one unknown rotational angle on each component, which is determined by an optimum algorithm in accordance with the contour error between the X-ray image and the image of the CAD model. Extensive computer simulation and in vitro experiments using real X-ray images have been implemented to investigate the feasibility of the proposed registration method.", "paper_title": "A new registration method for three-dimensional knee nearthrosis model using two X-ray images", "paper_id": "WOS:000276628100011"}
