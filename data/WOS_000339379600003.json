More specifically, we apply a refined PageRank method initially proposed by Xu et al. (2011) to evaluate the top 31 OR/MS journals for 2010, and report our findings. We also report the shifts in the rankings that span 5 years, from 2006 to 2010. We observe that Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, indexed by the SCI only in 2008, is a specialized journal that is consistently highly regarded within the discipline. The rankings also suggest that Management Science is more established as a generalized journal as it has more external impact. In general, our ranking results correlate with expert opinions, and we also observe, report and discuss some interesting patterns that have emerged over the past 5 years from 2006 to 2010.", "paper_title": "OR/MS journals evaluation based on a refined PageRank method: an updated and more comprehensive review", "paper_id": "WOS:000339379600003"}
