For this purpose, the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has become increasingly popular. Unfortunately, standard linear solvers are usually too inefficient for the aforementioned application. To increase the efficiency of the conjugate gradient (CG) method for linear systems resulting from symmetric interior penalty (discontinuous) Galerkin (SIPG) discretizations, we cast an existing two-level preconditioner into the deflation framework. The main idea is to use coarse corrections based on the DG solution with polynomial degree p = 0. This paper provides a numerical comparison of the performance of the original preconditioner and the resulting deflation variant in terms of scalability and overall efficiency. Furthermore, it studies the influence of the SIPG penalty parameter, weighted averages in the SIPG formulation (SWIP), the smoother, damping of the smoother, and the strategy for solving the coarse systems. We have found that the penalty parameter can best be chosen diffusion-dependent. In that case, both two-level methods yield fast and scalable convergence. Whether preconditioning or deflation is to be favored depends on the choice of the smoother and on the damping of the smoother. Altogether, both two-level methods can contribute to cheaper and more accurate fluid pressure simulations.", "paper_title": "Fast linear solver for diffusion problems with applications to pressure computation in layered domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000341492200006"}
