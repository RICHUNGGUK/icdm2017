The method improves the captured image in real time through the use of two additional preview images whose parameters can be calculated in advance and stored in a look-up table. The method does not require frame memory, and thus it can significantly reduce the chip size. The scheme is suitable for integration into a low-cost image sensor of a cell phone camera.", "paper_title": "A Low-Cost Imaging Method to Avoid Hand Shake Blur for Cell Phone Cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000305203800019"}
