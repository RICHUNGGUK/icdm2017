However, key storage management problems have arisen, because the public key computation is still the large overhead to USIM, and the mobile equipment has potential threats of the key leakage or loss. In order to solve such shortcomings, we improve the key-insulated models and propose \"Trust Delegation\" model that the overall security computations are operated in ME, while the initial private key still remains in the secure storage in USIM. Our model is resilient against not only key exposure but also key loss. Finally, we show that the overall transactions can be reduced to one-third than current 3GPP Generic Authentication Architecture.", "paper_title": "Secure and efficient public key management in next generation mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000306826800008"}
