This article describes an overview of CS, which is inspired by the life of a bird family, as well as an overview of CS applications in various categories for solving optimization problems. Optimization is a process of determining the best solution to make something as functional and effective as possible by minimizing or maximizing the parameters involved in the problems. The categories reviewed are Engineering, Pattern Recognition, Job Scheduling, Networking, Object-Oriented Software (Software Testing), and Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks. From the reviewed literature, CS is mostly applied in the engineering area for solving optimization problems. The objective of this study is to provide an overview and to summarize the review of applications of the CS.", "paper_title": "CUCKOO SEARCH ALGORITHM FOR OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS-A LITERATURE REVIEW AND ITS APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000337240100001"}
