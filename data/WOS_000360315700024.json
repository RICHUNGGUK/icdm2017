Furthermore, it results in substantially increased carbon dioxide emissions. As a powerful countermeasure, in the case of full-rank channel matrices, MIMO techniques are potentially capable of linearly increasing the capacity or decreasing the transmit power upon commensurately increasing the number of antennas. Hence, the recent concept of large-scale MIMO (LS-MIMO) systems has attracted substantial research attention and been regarded as a promising technique for next-generation wireless communications networks. Therefore, this paper surveys the state of the art of LS-MIMO systems. First, we discuss the measurement and modeling of LS-MIMO channels. Then, some typical application scenarios are classified and analyzed. Key techniques of both the physical and network layers are also detailed. Finally, we conclude with a range of challenges and future research topics.", "paper_title": "Survey of Large-Scale MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000360315700024"}
