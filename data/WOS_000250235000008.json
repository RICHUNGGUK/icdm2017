A CAC with maximum code size for given n and k is called optimal. Furthermore, an optimal CAC C is said to be tight equi-difference if boolean OR (x is an element of C) Delta( x) = Z(n) \\ {0} holds and any codeword x is an element of C has the form {0, i, 2i,..., ( k - 1) i}. The concept of a CAC is motivated from applications in multiple- access communication systems. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition to construct tight equidifference CACs ofweight k = 3 and characterize the code length n's admitting the condition through a number theoretical approach.", "paper_title": "Necessary and sufficient conditions for tight equi-difference conflict-avoiding codes of weight three", "paper_id": "WOS:000250235000008"}
