The main idea is to use a special \"characterization mode\" such that we can use only one input pattern to get all required circuit parameters with parasitic effects. After carefully adjustment, all parameters in our behavioral models can be measured at the outputs of the PLL system without simulating each block separately. Therefore, this approach is more suitable to accurately model protected IPs or flattened post-layout netlists. In the experimental results, we will build an accurate PLL behavioral model for demonstration and compare the results with HSPICE simulation and traditional behavioral models.", "paper_title": "An efficient approach to build accurate behavioral models of PLL designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508900006"}
