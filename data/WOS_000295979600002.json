As a search result is often assembled from multiple relational tables, traditional IR-style ranking and query evaluation methods cannot be applied directly. In this paper, we study the effectiveness and the efficiency issues of answering top-k keyword query in relational database systems. We propose a new ranking formula by adapting existing IR techniques based on a natural notion of virtual document. We also propose several efficient query processing methods for the new ranking method. We have conducted extensive experiments on large-scale real databases using two popular RDBMSs. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvement to the alternative approaches in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.", "paper_title": "SPARK2: Top-k Keyword Query in Relational Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000295979600002"}
