The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) is one of the most widely used repositories of such sets. Results: We report the availability of a new version of the database, MSigDB 3.0, with over 6700 gene sets, a complete revision of the collection of canonical pathways and experimental signatures from publications, enhanced annotations and upgrades to the web site.", "paper_title": "Molecular signatures database (MSigDB) 3.0", "paper_id": "WOS:000291261300036"}
