Here, we introduce GlycoDigest, a tool that simulates exoglycosidase digestion, based on controlled rules acquired from expert knowledge and experimental evidence available in GlycoBase. The tool allows the targeted design of glycosidase enzyme mixtures by allowing researchers to model the action of exoglycosidases, thereby validating and improving the efficiency and accuracy of glycan analysis.", "paper_title": "GlycoDigest: a tool for the targeted use of exoglycosidase digestions in glycan structure determination", "paper_id": "WOS:000344644600023"}
