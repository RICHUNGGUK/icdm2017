First, a stable state observer is constructed and the system state is observed, and then the adaptive output-feedback controller is constructively designed for tracking the given reference signal. It is proven that the constructed controller is robust to the uncertainties of both the unknown parameters and the system states. These results show that the global stability of the resulting closed-loop systems has been guaranteed and the epsilon-tracking problem has been solved. Meanwhile, it is also proven that the tracking error tends to a 'steady state' at the negative exponential attenuating rate. Simulation examples show that the tracking effects of the designed adaptive control systems are good, and the control quantities used in the simulation examples are always within the range of the admissible control.", "paper_title": "Robust adaptive output-feedback control for a class of nonlinear systems with general uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000237243100001"}
