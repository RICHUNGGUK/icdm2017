Many previous algorithms for distributed topology control have assumed an ability at each node to deduce some location-based information such as the direction and the distance of its neighbor nodes with respect to itself. Such a deduction of location-based information, however, cannot be relied upon in real environments where the path loss exponents vary greatly leading to significant errors in distance estimates. Also, multipath effects may result in different signal paths with different loss characteristics, and none of these paths may be line-of-sight, making it difficult to estimate the direction of a neighboring node. In this paper, we present Step Topology Control (STC), a simple distributed topology control algorithm which reduces energy consumption while preserving the connectivity of a heterogeneous sensor network without use of any location-based information. The STC algorithm avoids the use of GPS devices and also makes no assumptions about the distance and direction between neighboring nodes. We show that the STC algorithm achieves the same or better order of communication and computational complexity when compared to other known algorithms that also preserve connectivity without the use of location-based information. We also present a detailed simulation-based comparative analysis of the energy savings and interference reduction achieved by the algorithms. The results show that, in spite of not incurring a higher communication or computational complexity, the STC algorithm performs better than other algorithms in uniform wireless environments and especially better when path loss characteristics are non-uniform.
