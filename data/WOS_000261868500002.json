We hypothesized that the mechanism of tachycardia-induced EADs depends on the spatial and temporal morphology of spontaneous SR Ca release, and tested this hypothesis in computer Simulations using a ventricular action potential mathematical model. Using two previously suggested spontaneous release morphologies, we found two distinct tachycardia-induced EAD mechanisms: one mechanistically similar to bradycardia-induced EADs, the other to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs).
