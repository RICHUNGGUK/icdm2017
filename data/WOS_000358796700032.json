In several orthogonal coordinate systems separation of variables applied to the Helmholtz, Laplace, or Schrodinger equation leads to a multiparameter eigenvalue problem (MEP); important cases include Mathieu's system, Lame's system, and a system of spheroidal wave functions. Although multiparameter approaches are exploited occasionally to solve such equations numerically, MEPs remain less well known, and the variety of available numerical methods is not wide. The classical approach of discretizing the equations using standard finite differences leads to algebraic MEPs with large matrices, which are difficult to solve efficiently. The aim of this paper is to change this perspective. We show that by combining spectral collocation methods and new efficient numerical methods for algebraic MEPs it is possible to solve such problems both very efficiently and accurately. We improve on several previous results available in the literature, and also present a MATLAB toolbox for solving a wide range of problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
