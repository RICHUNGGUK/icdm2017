We consider the combinatorial problem of efficiently and optimally boosting a pair of classifiers by reducing this problem to that of constructing the optimal linear separator for two sets of points in two dimensions.- Specifically, let each point x is an element of R(2) be assigned a weight W(x) > 0, where the weighting function can be an arbitrary positive function. We give efficient (low-order polynomial time) algorithms for constructing an optimal linear \"separator\" l defined as follows. Let Q be the set of points misclassified by l. Then, the weight of Q, defined as the sum of the weights of the points in Q, is minimized. If W(z) = 1 for all points, then the resulting separator minimizes (exactly) the misclassification error. Without an increase in computational complexity, our algorithm can be extended to output the leave-one-out error, an unbiased estimate of the expected performance of the resulting boosted classifier.", "paper_title": "Efficient optimal linear boosting of a pair of classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000244970900001"}
