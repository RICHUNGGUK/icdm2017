One of its main drawbacks concerns the difficulty to recover attributes of data samples accurately, which typically lie in the [0.1] interval, given the locations of the low-dimensional embeddings and the vectors. In this paper we show that centering the data can considerably increase attribute estimation accuracy, where data values can be read off approximately by projecting embedded points onto calibrated (i.e.. labeled) axes. similarly to classical statistical biplots. In addition, this idea can be coupled with a recently developed orthonormalization process on the axis vectors that prevents unnecessary distortions. We demonstrate that the combination of both approaches not only enhances the estimates, but also provides more faithful representations of the data.", "paper_title": "Axis Calibration for Improving Data Attribute Estimation in Star Coordinates Plots", "paper_id": "WOS:000344991700046"}
