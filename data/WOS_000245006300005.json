This paper presents a runtime engine that addresses the scalability of SAMR applications with localized refinements and high SAMR efficiencies on large numbers of processors (upto 1024 processors). The SAMR runtime engine augments hierarchical partitioning with bin-packing based load-balancing to manage the space-time heterogeneity of the SAMR grid hierarchy, and includes a communication substrate that optimizes the use of MPI non-blocking communication primitives. An experimental evaluation on the IBM SP2 supercomputer using the 3-D Richtmyer-Meshkov compressible turbulence kernel demonstrates the effectiveness of the runtime engine in improving SAMR scalability.", "paper_title": "Enabling scalable parallel implementations of structured adaptive mesh refinement applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000245006300005"}
