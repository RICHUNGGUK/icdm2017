Design/methodology/approach - Constitutive equations are implemented incrementally by the Von-Karman finite deflection system which is coupled with a mixed strain hardening rule and physical-base viscoplastic models. Time integrations of the equations are done by the return mapping technique through the cutting-plane algorithm. An integrated solution is established by pseudo-spectral collocation methodology. The Chebyshev basis functions are utilized to evaluate the coefficients of displacement fields. Temporal terms are discretized by the Houbolt marching method. Spatial linearizations are accomplished by the quadratic extrapolation technique. Findings - Results of the center point deflections, effective plastic strain and stress (dynamic flow stress) and temperature rise are compared for three features of the Von-Karman system. Identifying time history of resultant stresses, propagations of the viscoplastic plastic zones are illustrated for two circumstances; with considering strain rate and hardening effects, and without them. Some of modeling and computation aspects are discussed, carefully. When the results are compared with experimental data of shock wave loadings and finite element simulations, good agreements between them are observed. Originality/value - This computational approach makes coupling the structural equations with the physical descriptions of the high rate deformation through step-by-step spectral solution of the constitutive equations.", "paper_title": "A computational investigation for propagation of elasto-viscoplastic zones in the shock loaded circular plates", "paper_id": "WOS:000343322300014"}
