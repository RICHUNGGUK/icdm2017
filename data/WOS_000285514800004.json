First, motion models are established as: 1) initial SIFT matches are obtained and grouped into a set of clusters using our developed topological clustering algorithm; 2) for each cluster with no less than three matches, an affine transformation is estimated with least-square solution as tentative motion model; and 3) the tentative motion models are refined and the invalid models are pruned. Then, with the obtained motion models, a graph cuts based layer assignment algorithm is employed to segment the scene into several motion layers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can successfully segment scenes containing objects with large interframe motion or even with significant interframe scale and pose changes. Furthermore, compared with the previous method invented by Wills et al. and its modified version, our method is much faster and more robust.", "paper_title": "Large Disparity Motion Layer Extraction via Topological Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000285514800004"}
