Similarly, an effective eLearning program must be implemented in the organization and exploit the organizational memory to manage competence evolution. In this paper, we introduce a framework to manage organizational knowledge through the creation and management of an ontology-based Organizational Memory (OM). We also explain how an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) can benefit from this OM in order to provide a just-in time, just enough learning solution to the organization's members.", "paper_title": "An ontology-based solution for knowledge management and eLearning integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100078"}
