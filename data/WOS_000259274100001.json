This paper presents the architecture, design and implementation of a framework for modeling and simulating virtualized autonomic service centers. This provides methods of estimating the system behavior for capacity planning before real establishment or execution. In addition, the performance of an existing service center can be efficiently evaluated. Performance analysis shows that our system is moderately efficient to perform large-scale simulation. Moreover, detailed evaluation results also depict various aspects of the feasibility and the efficiency of our modeling and simulation approaches, which can help to improve the productivity of researchers via quick proof of concepts.", "paper_title": "Modeling and simulation of virtualized autonomic service centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000259274100001"}
