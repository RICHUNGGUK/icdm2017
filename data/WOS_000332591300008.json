The unbalanced arbiters are implemented with cross-coupled standard NAND cells and the combination of the NAND cells decides the timing offset between two input signals. Simulations and measurements are conducted to validate the new circuit, which provides variable time difference ranges by controlling the slope of input signals. Since the proposed flash TDC uses only NAND cells in a standard cell library for the arbiters which easily enables the TDC to be used as a soft macro in a typical digital circuit design flow.", "paper_title": "A Flash TDC with 2.6-4.2 ps Resolution Using a Group of UnbalancedCMOS Arbiters", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300008"}
