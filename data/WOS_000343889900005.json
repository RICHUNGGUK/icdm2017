Indecomposable extremely simple form (IESF) is a basic concept of -resolution automated reasoning in lattice-valued logic based in lattice implication algebra (LIA). In this paper we establish a unified method for finding the structure of -IESF in . Firstly, some operational properties of logical formulae in are studied, and some rules are obtained for judging whether a given logical formula is a -IESF, which are used to contrive an algorithm for finding -IESF in . Then, all the results are extended into . Finally, a unified algorithm for finding all -IESFs in is proposed. This work provides theoretical foundations and algorithms for -resolution automated reasoning in linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued logic based in linguistic truth-valued LIAs and formal tools for symbolic natural language processing.", "paper_title": "A unified algorithm for finding -IESFs in linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued propositional logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000343889900005"}
