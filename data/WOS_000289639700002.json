In the static mode, results of five algorithms are used to highlight the pros and cons for each algorithm. These results provide new insight into the mobility management problem that can influence the design of future wireless networks. In the dynamic mode in which mobile users' past movement patterns are used in making future paging decisions by the network, the performance of an online location management algorithm is examined under different deployment setups. Performance results of this algorithm show its advantages over the currently implemented and/or proposed static location management systems (including GSM).", "paper_title": "ON THE PERFORMANCE OF STATIC AND DYNAMIC LOCATION MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN MOBILE COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000289639700002"}
