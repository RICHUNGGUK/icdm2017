These include relations between the interlace polynomial and the Tutte polynomial and the computational complexity of the vertex-nullity interlace polynomial. Here, using the medial graph of a planar graph, we relate the one-variable vertex-nullity interlace polynomial to the classical Tutte polynomial when x = y, and conclude that, like the Tutte polynomial, it is in general #P-hard to compute. We also show a relation between the two-variable interlace polynomial and the topological Tutte polynomial of Bollobas and Riordan in [ 13]. We define the gamma invariant as the coefficient of x(1) in the vertex-nullity interlace polynomial, analogously to the beta invariant, which is the coefficient of x(1) in the Tutte polynomial. We then turn to distance hereditary graphs, characterized by Bandelt and Mulder in [9] as being constructed by a sequence of adding pendant and twin vertices, and show that graphs in this class have gamma invariant of 2(n+1) when n true twins are added in their construction. We furthermore show that bipartite distance hereditary graphs are exactly the class of graphs with gamma invariant 2, just as the series-parallel graphs are exactly the class of graphs with beta invariant 1. In addition, we show that a bipartite distance hereditary graph arises precisely as the circle graph of an Euler circuit in the oriented medial graph of a series-parallel graph. From this we conclude that the vertex-nullity interface polynomial is polynomial time to compute for bipartite distance hereditary graphs, just as the Tutte polynomial is polynomial time to compute for series-parallel graphs.", "paper_title": "Distance hereditary graphs and the interlace polynomial", "paper_id": "WOS:000251407800007"}
