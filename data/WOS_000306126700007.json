In this paper, we propose a joint discriminative probabilistic framework to optimize all relevant subtasks simultaneously. This framework offers a great flexibility to incorporate the advantage of both uncertainty for sequence modeling and first-order logic for domain knowledge. The first-order logic model provides a more expressive formalism tackling the issue of limited expressiveness of traditional attribute-value representation. Our framework defines a joint probability distribution for both segmentations in sequence data and possible worlds of relations between segments in the form of an exponential family. Since exact parameter estimation and inference are prohibitively intractable in this model, a structured variational inference algorithm is developed to perform parameter estimation approximately. For inference, we propose a highly coupled, bi-directional Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignments for both segmentations and relations. Extensive experiments on two real-world information extraction tasks, entity identification and relation extraction from Wikipedia, and citation matching show that (1) the proposed model achieves significant improvement on both tasks compared to state-of-the-art pipeline models and other joint models; (2) the bi-directional MH inference algorithm obtains boosted performance compared to the greedy, N-best list, and uni-directional MH sampling algorithms.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic joint models incorporating logic and learning via structured variational approximation for information extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000306126700007"}
