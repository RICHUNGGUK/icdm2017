Our results establish rates of convergence that express the trade-off between exploration and estimation, and fully characterize the limit distributions that arise. Our rates of convergence results should be viewed as a baseline against which to compare more intelligent algorithms.", "paper_title": "Limit Theorems for Simulation-Based Optimization via Random Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000322829500002"}
