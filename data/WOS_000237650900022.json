This kind of platform highly distributed accross different domains leads to several design and implementation problems. We have designed a new monitoring platform and visualization tool adapted for Network Enabled Server systems. This environment, highly tunable for different middleware platform has been successfully validaded on the DIET platform. In this paper, we present its architecture and main features as well as details of the validation on the DIET environment and experimental results on a large scale grid platform.", "paper_title": "A monitoring and visualization tool and its application for a network enabled server platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900022"}
