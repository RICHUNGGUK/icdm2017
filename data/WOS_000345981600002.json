In order to aggregate dynamic 2-tuple linguistic information, some new dynamic aggregation operators are proposed: the dynamic 2-tuple weighted averaging (DTWA) operator, dynamic 2-tuple weighted geometric (DTWG) operator and dynamic 2-tuple weighted harmonic averaging (DTWHA) operator. Furthermore, some procedures based on the DTWA/DTWG/DTWHA operators and TWA/TWG/TWHA operators are developed to solve the dynamic 2-tuple linguistic multiple attribute decision making problems where all the decision information about attribute values takes the form of 2-tuple linguistic information collected at different periods. Finally, an illustrative example for evaluating enterprise financial performance is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Approaches to dynamic multiple attribute decision making with 2-tuple linguistic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000345981600002"}
