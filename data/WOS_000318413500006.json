The resulting propagation is temporally consistent and blends seamlessly with its spatial surroundings. In addition, the presented model is able to cope with additive illumination changes and handles occlusions/dis-occlusions. The problem of propagation along the optical flow arises in different video editing applications. In this work we consider the application where a user edits a frame by modifying the texture of an object's surface and wishes to propagate this editing throughout the video.", "paper_title": "A Variational Model for Gradient-Based Video Editing", "paper_id": "WOS:000318413500006"}
