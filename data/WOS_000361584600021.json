The limitations detected in conventional numerical methods to calculate derivatives of experimental data are overcome with this new application of WENO-based techniques. The numerical noise that comes up in the experimental and simulated data usually employed to characterize MOSFETs transistors is strongly reduced. The need for an accurate determination of the threshold voltage motivates the use of this advanced numerical approach that solves many of the issues that affect the conventional parameter extraction procedures currently in use in the microelectronics industry. In addition, also the influence of DIBL effects on the threshold voltage in short channel MOSFETs has been analyzed with this smart weighted ENO procedure.
