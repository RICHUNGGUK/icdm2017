One experiment was based on the localization response operating characteristic (LROC) model. The other estimated detection and localization accuracy rates. The results of both studies showed that the two algorithms consistently improved radiologists' performance although not always in a statistically significant way. An important outcome of this work was that lossy wavelet compression was as successful in improving the quality of digitized mammograms as the wavelet enhancement technique. The compression algorithm not only did not degrade the readers' performance but it improved it consistently while achieving compression rates in the range of 14 to 2051:1. The proposed wavelet algorithms yielded superior results for digitized mammography relative to conventional processing methodologies. Wavelets are valuable and diverse tools that could make digitized screen/film mammography equivalent to its direct digital counterpart leading to a filmless mammography clinic with full inlet- and intra-system integration and real-time telemammography.", "paper_title": "Observer evaluations of wavelet methods for the enhancement and compression of digitized mammograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900065"}
