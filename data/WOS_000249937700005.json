The pattern of the contraction along the LV long axes was assessed on the LV free wall on seven guinea pig hearts in situ with ultra fast video system and epicardial markers by means of the latitude and the size of the areas defined by markers. We found that the contraction occurs as a continuous contraction wave from the apex towards the base, which might yield functional adaptation of these two regions to diastolic and systolic function, respectively.
