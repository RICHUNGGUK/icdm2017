However, the longer a job executes, the more energy in the leakage current the device/processor consumes for the job. To reduce the energy consumption resulting from the leakage current, a system might enter the dormant mode. This paper targets energy-efficient rate-monotonic scheduling for periodic real-time tasks on a uniprocessor DVS system with non-negligible leakage power consumption. An on-line simulated scheduling strategy and a virtually blocking time strategy are developed for procrastination scheduling to reduce energy consumption. The proposed algorithms derive a feasible schedule for real-time tasks with worst-case guarantees for any input instance. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms could derive energy-efficient solutions.", "paper_title": "Procrastination for leakage-aware rate-monotonic scheduling on a dynamic voltage scaling processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000202972200018"}
