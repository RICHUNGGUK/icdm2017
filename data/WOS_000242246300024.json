In contrast to other programs MetaQuant is able to quantify hundreds of substances simultaneously with minimal manual intervention. The integration of a self-acting calibration function allows the parallel and fast calibration for several metabolites simultaneously. Finally, MetaQuant is able to import GC/MS data in the common NetCDF format and to export the results of the quantification into Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), Comma Separated Values (CSV) or Microsoft Excel (XLS) format.", "paper_title": "MetaQuant: a tool for the automatic quantification of GC/MS-based metabolome data", "paper_id": "WOS:000242246300024"}
