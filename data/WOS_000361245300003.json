These services are now dealing with rapidly arriving queries, that are issued by a massive amount of users. While overlay graph-based indices can answer shortest path queries efficiently, there have been no studies on utilizing such indices to answer kNN queries efficiently. In this paper, we fill this research gap and present two efficient kNN search solutions on overlay graph-based indices. Experimental results show that our solutions offer very low query latency (0.1 ms) and require only small index sizes, even for 10-million-node networks.", "paper_title": "Beyond Millisecond Latency kNN Search on Commodity Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000361245300003"}
