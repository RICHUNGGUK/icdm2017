For each of retracting and stretching modes, a specific sliding mode controller has been adopted. Drawing upon input/output linearization to globally linearize the nonlinear model of the hypersonic aircraft at first, a type-2 TSK fuzzy logic system is devised for robust mode switching between these sliding mode controllers. For rapid stabilization of the system, the adaptive law for mode switching is designed using a direct constructive Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the stability and smooth transition using the proposed switched control scheme.", "paper_title": "Adaptive mode switching of hypersonic morphing aircraft based on type-2 TSK fuzzy sliding mode control", "paper_id": "WOS:000358136300006"}
