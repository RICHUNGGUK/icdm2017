So far, the studies on covering generalized rough sets mainly focus on constructing different types of approximation operations. However, little attention has been paid to uncertainty measurement in covering cases. In this paper, a new kind of partial order is proposed for coverings which is used to evaluate the uncertainty measures. Consequently, we study uncertain measures like roughness measure, accuracy measure, entropy and granularity for covering rough set models which are defined by neighborhoods and friends. Some theoretical results are obtained and investigated.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty Measurement for Covering Rough Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000334734600004"}
