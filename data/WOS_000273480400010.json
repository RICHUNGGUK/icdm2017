Optical signal transmission quality is subject to various types of physical impairment introduced by optical fibers, switching elements, or other network components. The signal degradation due to physical impairment may be significant enough such that the bit-error rate of received signals is unacceptably high at the destination, rendering the signal to not usable. In this article, based on earlier study, we study the burst-scheduling problem in OBS networks using two control packets for each data burst, taking into account physical impairment effects. We propose a burst-scheduling algorithm that accommodates incoming bursts by primary path routing, deflection routing, and burst scheduling. We design an admission control mechanism to use network resources efficiently. At an OBS node, the proposed algorithm schedules bursts for transmission by searching for available resources as well as verifying signal quality. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in terms of reducing the burst-blocking probability.", "paper_title": "Impairment-aware ordered scheduling in dual-header optical burst switched networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480400010"}
