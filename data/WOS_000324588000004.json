Storage of large synaptic connectivity (SNN topology) information in SNNs require large distributed on-chip memory, which poses serious challenges for compact hardware implementation of such architectures. Based on the structured neural organisation observed in human brain, a modular neural networks (MNN) design strategy partitions complex application tasks into smaller subtasks executing on distinct neural network modules, and integrates intermediate outputs in higher level functions. This paper proposes a hardware modular neural tile (MNT) architecture that reduces the SNN topology memory requirement of NoC-based hardware SNNs by using a combination of fixed and configurable synaptic connections. The proposed MNT contains a 16:16 fully-connected feed-forward SNN structure and integrates in a mesh topology NoC communication infrastructure. The SNN topology memory requirement is 50 % of the monolithic NoC-based hardware SNN implementation. The paper also presents a lookup table based SNN topology memory allocation technique, which further increases the memory utilisation efficiency. Overall the area requirement of the architecture is reduced by an average of 66 % for practical SNN application topologies. The paper presents micro-architecture details of the proposed MNT and digital neuron circuit. The proposed architecture has been validated on a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA and synthesised using 65 nm low-power CMOS technology. The evolvable capability of the proposed MNT and its suitability for executing subtasks within a MNN execution architecture is demonstrated by successfully evolving benchmark SNN application tasks representing classification and non-linear control functions. The paper addresses hardware modular SNN design and implementation challenges and contributes to the development of a compact hardware modular SNN architecture suitable for embedded applications.", "paper_title": "Modular Neural Tile Architecture for Compact Embedded Hardware Spiking Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000324588000004"}
