Furthermore, in addition to the known label information, domain knowledge can often be obtained from various sources, e.g., multiple domain experts. To address such problems, in this paper, we propose a general optimization framework for dealing with tensor inputs while taking into consideration domain knowledge. To be specific, our framework is based on a linear model, and we obtain the weight tensor in a hierarchical way-first approximate it by a low-rank tensor, and then estimate the low-rank approximation using the domain knowledge from various sources. This is motivated by wafer quality prediction in semiconductor manufacturing. We also propose an effective algorithm named H-MOTE for solving this framework, which is guaranteed to converge. For each iteration, the time complexity of H-MOTE is linear with respect to the number of examples as well as the size of the weight tensor. Therefore, H-MOTE is scalable to large-scale problems. Experimental results show that H-MOTE outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on both synthetic and real data sets.", "paper_title": "A general framework for predictive tensor modeling with domain knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000361826200008"}
