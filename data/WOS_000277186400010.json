Examples include linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gaussian Processes, Logistic Regression, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and Lasso amongst others. This paper describes the theory and implementation of a scalable and modular convex solver which solves all these estimation problems. It can be parallelized on a cluster of workstations, allows for data-locality, and can deal with regularizers such as L(1) and L(2) penalties. In addition to the unified framework we present tight convergence bounds, which show that our algorithm converges in O(1/epsilon) steps to e precision for general convex problems and in O(log(1/epsilon)) steps for continuously differentiable problems. We demonstrate the performance of our general purpose solver on a variety of publicly available data sets.", "paper_title": "Bundle Methods for Regularized Risk Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000277186400010"}
