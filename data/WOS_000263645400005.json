In this paper, an online price quotation model (OPQM) for the 'exchange the new part with the old one' is proposed. The main aim of OPQM is to minimise the exchange price, based on jointly optimising the disassembly and remanufacturing plan for the used part throughout the supply chain. The disassembly and remanufacturing plan problem, however, resembles a combinatorial problem, whose computation time to obtain an optimal solution increases exponentially in proportion to the size of the problem. Therefore, the authors propose an enhanced particle swarm optimisation (EPSO) method to generate a relatively good solution within a given time. Through a series of experiments with several benchmark methods, the proposed EPSO method is found to be superior to the conventional optimisation methods, such as LINGO solver, in time, and preferable to the traditional particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) in quality.", "paper_title": "The research of online price quotation for the automobile parts exchange programme", "paper_id": "WOS:000263645400005"}
