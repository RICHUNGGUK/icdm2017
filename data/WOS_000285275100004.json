Routing in MANET is a challenge owing to the dynamic nature of network topology and resource constraints. A stable routing mechanism is proposed for UWB network in this paper, focusing on the instability problem derived from communication gray zone. This mechanism is a cross-layer enhancement of ad hoc on-demand vector (AODV) routing protocol, which is named as CLS_AODV. The routing discovery algorithm is extended by introducing the notion of source routing and ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector (AOMDV) routing. A computing model is established to map received signal strengths into link stability factor and route stability factor which serves as a routing metric for path selection. In contrast to the reactive way in AODV, the received signal strength can be used to reveal the link state information for gray zone prediction, as well as for route state monitoring. A HELLO-based preemptive local route repair algorithm is presented to prevent the occurrence of link breakage. HELLO message is extended not only for neighbor sensing and neighborhood information exchanging, but also as an ON/OFF command to control the position location scheme and HELLO scheme of neighbor nodes. The simulation results show the improvements of CLS_AODV in terms of packet loss ratio and average end-to-end delay without compromising the throughput performance compared with AODV.
