The system is subject to random deterioration which impacts not only the product quality but also the environment. We assume that the environment degrades whenever a specific level of system deterioration is reached. The proposed maintenance model aims to assess the degradation in such a way to reduce the deterioration of the environment. To control this deterioration, inspections are performed and after which the system is preventively replaced or left as it is. Preventive replacement occurs whenever the level of the system degradation reaches a specific level threshold. The objective is to determine optimal inspection dates which minimize the average total cost per unit of time in the infinite horizon. Cost function is composed of inspection and maintenance costs in addition to a penalty cost due to environmental deterioration. The maintenance optimization model is formally derived. On the basis of Nelder-Mead method, inspection dates as optimal solutions are computed. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed maintenance model.", "paper_title": "A condition-based maintenance policy for a production system under excessive environmental degradation", "paper_id": "WOS:000339375400006"}
