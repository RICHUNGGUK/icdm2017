This paper presents an enterprise architecture analysis framework which can be used to assess application usage. The framework, in the form of an architecture metamodel, incorporates variables from the previously published Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model. The paper describes how the metamodel has been tailored for a specific domain, viz, industry maintenance management. The metamodel was tested in the maintenance management domain through a survey with 55 respondents at five companies. Data collected in the survey showed that the domain-specific metamodel is able to explain variations in maintenance management application usage. Integrating the TAM and TTF variables with an architecture metamodel allows architects to reuse research results smoothly, thereby aiding them in producing good application portfolio decision-support.
