It utilizes constrained molecular dynamics where atoms determined to be immobile from difference distance matrix studies are fixed. Application of this methodology to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as the example target protein has demonstrated its robustness. Short simulation times are sufficient to achieve good refinement of docking poses resulting from exchange of structurally dissimilar inhibitors between crystal structures. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
