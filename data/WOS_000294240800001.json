In particular, we explored how positive messages in online discussion forums may affect consumers' decisions to shop online. We used a laboratory experiment in which the treatment group was required to read positive messages about online shopping experience in an online discussion forum. Positive social influence was found to reinforce the relationship between beliefs about and attitude toward online shopping, as well as the relationship between attitude and intention to shop. We believe our alternative theory provides new insight into the complex processes through which social influence is brought to bear on consumers' online shopping decisions. Implications of our work are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
