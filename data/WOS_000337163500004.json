Uncertainty in data is often caused by the deficiency in underlying data collecting equipments or sometimes manually introduced to preserve data privacy. This work discusses the problem of distance-based outlier detection on uncertain datasets of Gaussian distribution. The Naive approach of distance-based outlier on uncertain data is usually infeasible due to expensive distance function. Therefore a cell-based approach is proposed in this work to quickly identify the outliers. The infinite nature of Gaussian distribution prevents to devise effective pruning techniques. Therefore an approximate approach using bounded Gaussian distribution is also proposed. Approximating Gaussian distribution by bounded Gaussian distribution enables an approximate but more efficient cell-based outlier detection approach. An extensive empirical study on synthetic and real datasets show that our proposed approaches are effective, efficient and scalable.", "paper_title": "Efficient distance-based outlier detection on uncertain datasets of Gaussian distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000337163500004"}
