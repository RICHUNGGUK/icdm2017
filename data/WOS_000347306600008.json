Our approach separates a complex line drawing representing a manifold object into a series of simpler line drawings, based on the degree of reconstruction freedom (DRF). We then progressively reconstruct a complete 3D model from these simpler line drawings. Our experiments show that our decomposition algorithm is able to handle complex drawings which are challenging for the state of the art. The advantages of the presented progressive 3D reconstruction method over the existing reconstruction methods in terms of both robustness and efficiency are also demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Progressive 3D Reconstruction of Planar-Faced Manifold Objects with DRF-Based Line Drawing Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000347306600008"}
