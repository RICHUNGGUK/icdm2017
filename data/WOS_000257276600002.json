To make the time approximation match the order of accuracy of the spatial representation of the linear triangular elements by the Galerkin finite-element method, the fourth-order time integration of implicit multistage Pade method is used for the development of the numerical scheme. The streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method with crosswind diffusion is employed to stabilize the scheme and suppress the spurious oscillations, usually common in the numerical computation of convection-dominated flow problems. The performance of numerical stabilization and accuracy is addressed. Treatments of various boundary conditions, including the open boundary conditions, the perfect reflecting boundary conditions along boundaries with irregular geometry, are also described. Numerical results showing the comparisons with analytical solutions, experimental measurements, and other published numerical results are presented and discussed.
