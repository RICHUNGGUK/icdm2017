An efficient index structure is presented to guide mobile clients to the NN-objects. The proposed broadcast scheduling and indexing is aimed at minimizing query access time and energy consumption of the clients when retrieving NN-objects through wireless channels. We have experimentally studied the proposed scheme and its comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. The results suggest the efficacy of our proposed approach in offering minimum latency and energy consumption, which is critically important especially for resource-constrained wireless environments.", "paper_title": "Clustering-Based Index and Data Broadcasting for Mobile Nearest Neighbor Query Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700016"}
