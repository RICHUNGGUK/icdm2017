The results obtained from the numerical simulations are firstly verified against the existing experimental results. An extensive parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of different concrete strength on the behaviour and load-bearing capacity of the CFT stub columns. The strength of concrete considered in this study ranges from 30 to 110 MPa. Both the load-bearing capacity and load-displacement curves of CFT columns are evaluated. In particular, the crack propagation during the deformation and failure processes of the columns is predicted and the associated mechanisms related to the increased load-bearing capacity of the columns are clarified. The numerical results indicate that there are two mechanisms controlling the failure of the CFT columns. For the CFT columns with the lower concrete strength, they damage when the steel tube yields at first. By contrast, for the columns with high concrete strength it is the damage of concrete that controls the overall loading capacity of the CFT columns. The simulation results also demonstrate that RFPA3D is not only a useful and effective tool to simulate the concrete-filled steel tubular columns, but also a valuable reference for the practice of engineering design.", "paper_title": "The 3D-numerical simulation on failure process of concrete-filled tubular (CFT) stub columns under uniaxial compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000301995900002"}
