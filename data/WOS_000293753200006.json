A DoS attack over-loads the target server with a large volume of adverse requests, thereby rendering the server unavailable to \"well-behaved\" users. In this paper, we propose two algorithms that allow attack targets to dynamically filter their incoming traffic based on a distributed policy. The proposed algorithms defend the target against DoS and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks and simultaneously ensure that it continues to serve \"well-behaved\" users.", "paper_title": "TRAWLING TRAFFIC UNDER ATTACK OVERCOMING DDoS ATTACKS BY TARGET-CONTROLLED TRAFFIC FILTERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000293753200006"}
