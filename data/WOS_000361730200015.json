Based on the finite variation processes, a new uncertain integral is proposed in this paper. Besides, some basic properties are discussed. In the framework of the uncertain integral, uncertain differential is introduced, and the fundamental theorem of uncertain calculus is derived. Finally, the integration by parts theorem is studied.", "paper_title": "Uncertain calculus with finite variation processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000361730200015"}
