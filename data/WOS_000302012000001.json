Information Systems researchers have not been slow to embrace this combination of method and data. Such systems increasingly provide \"digital trace data\" that provide new research opportunities. Yet digital trace data are substantively different from the survey and interview data for which network analysis measures and interpretations were originally developed. This paper examines 10 validity issues associated with the combination of digital trace data and social network analysis methods, with examples from the IS literature, to provide recommendations for improving the validity of future research.", "paper_title": "Validity Issues in the Use of Social Network Analysis with Digital Trace Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000302012000001"}
