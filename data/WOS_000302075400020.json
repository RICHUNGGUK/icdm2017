PolyMAX is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) module and our specific contributions consist on the design and implementation of the Quality of Service (QoS) classes and QoS management messages, the uplink access grant-request mechanisms, Adaptive Modulation and Coding, and a scheduler handling all five WiMAX QoS classes. We also present validation results for the different components of our module and typical WiMAX simulation scenarios illustrating its flexibility and some of its features. The PolyMAX module represents an important tool enabling researchers to easily implement their Mobile WiMAX scheduling and Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) algorithms and accurately evaluate their performance for realistic scenarios.
