In three dimensional integration circuits (3D ICs), through silicon vias (TSVs) are used to communicate signals between layers. However, TSVs act as obstacles during placement and routing and have a negative impact on chip yield. Therefore, TSV number minimization is an important topic in 3D IC design. However, previous high-level synthesis approach only tries to maximize the number of same-layer operation-level data-transfers. In fact, a TSV should correspond to a cross-layer resource-level data-transfer. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) approach to perform TSV number minimization by minimizing the number of cross-layer resource-level data-transfers. Experimental results consistently show that our approach is more effective than the previous approach in TSV number minimization.", "paper_title": "Accurate TSV Number Minimization in High-Level Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000295605300002"}
