Some theoretical developments provide an explicit expression for this error, which is shown to depend explicitly on the filter kernel properties, and on the time derivative of the cut-off length. From this analysis, some constraints on the filter kernel are derived in order to minimize the error. The particular case of a Gaussian filter is considered, which yields to a first error term. Finally. the dependency of the temporal commutation error to the variations of the filter width is investigated by performing a priori tests in the case of isotropic homogeneous turbulence with a varying cut-off length.
