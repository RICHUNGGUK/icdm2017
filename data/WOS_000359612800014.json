Extensive simulation experiments are carried out to study the impacts of important factors on file pollution, and some insights are provided to defense file pollution. These factors include the initial pollution level of network, the file-sharing rate and the detection rate of polluted files. The simulation results show that the initial pollution level of network can greatly affect the degree of pollution. Therefore, an appropriate strategy is necessary to validate the files before the release, which can inhibit the diffusion of polluted files and keep a low initial pollution level of network. And P2P file-sharing networks can efficiently spread normal files and inhibit file pollution by increasing the file-sharing rate and the detection rate of polluted files at the same time.", "paper_title": "Analysis of File Pollution in P2P Networks with Epidemic Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000359612800014"}
