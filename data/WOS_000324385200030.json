First of all, a multi-scale reblurring model is used to detect the object of interest (OOI) in saliency space. Then, to determine the boundary of OOI, an active contour model based on hybrid energy function is proposed. In this model, a global energy item related with the saliency map is adopted to find the global minimum, and a local energy term regarding the low DOF image is used to improve the segmentation precision. In addition, an adaptive parameter is attached to this model to balance the weight of global and local energy. Furthermore, an unsupervised curve initialization method is designed to reduce the number of evolution iterations. Finally, we conduct experiments on various low DOF images, and the results demonstrate the high robustness and precision of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Curve Evolution Approach for Unsupervised Segmentation of Images With Low Depth of Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000324385200030"}
