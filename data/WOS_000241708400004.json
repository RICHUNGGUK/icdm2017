The focus of the paper is about the way to handle the distributing factors and the communication model among nodes within a collaborative virtual environment. Within the system, all objects are decentralized and scattered among three tiers of object databases. By limiting the knowledge and refining the tasks for each server, the network and processor workload can be reduced. The objective of the system is to provide a virtual environment for distributed computing that is k-fault tolerant and subject to expansion without the interruption of services.
