An effective method is product family development and design based on product platforms. Considering the characteristics of the complex modular products, two types of network models including parts connection network and generic-modules connection network are built taking parts or generic-modules as nodes. Based on the network model and network properties, generic-modules are divided into basic modules, must-selected module and may-selected module, and the modular main structure of the product family is constructed layer-by-layer via breadth first search. A layer-build model of the modular product platform is proposed and a bottom-up development method is provided for the industrial steam turbine as a case study.", "paper_title": "A network methodology for structure-oriented modular product platform planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000354487400010"}
