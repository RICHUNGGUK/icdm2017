However, it still encounters two main problems, which are efficiently representing faces in frames and sufficiently exploiting temporal-spatial constraints between frames. The authors investigate the existing real-time features for face description, and compare their performance. Moreover, a novel approach is proposed to model temporal-spatial information which is then combined with real-time features to further enforce the consistent constraints between frames to improve the recognition performance. The experiments are validated on three video face databases and the results demonstrate that temporal-spatial cues combined with the most powerful real-time features largely improve the recognition rate.", "paper_title": "Video face recognition via combination of real-time local features and temporal-spatial cues", "paper_id": "WOS:000338559500009"}
