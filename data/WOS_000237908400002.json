In this paper, we investigate the complexity of a wide variety of model-checking problems for nonflat systems under the light of parameterized complexity, taking the number of synchronized components as a parameter. We provide precise complexity measures (in the parameterized sense) for most of the problems we investigate, and evidence that the results are robust. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
