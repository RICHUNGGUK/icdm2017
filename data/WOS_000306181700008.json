The effect is surprising and not commonly seen in the real world. We present algorithms for constructing SHADOWPIX that allow up to four images to be embedded in a single surface. SHADOWPIX can produce a variety of unusual effects depending on the embedded images: moving the light can animate or relight the object in the image, or three colored lights may be used to produce a single colored image. SHADOWPIX are easy to manufacture using a 3D printer and we present photographs, videos, and renderings demonstrating these effects.", "paper_title": "SHADOWPIX: Multiple Images from Self Shadowing", "paper_id": "WOS:000306181700008"}
