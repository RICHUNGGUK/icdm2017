First, we introduce a new medoid-based method for ACO-based clustering in the Ant-ClustB(MB) algorithm to learn BMNs. Both this algorithm and our previously introduced Ant-ClustB(IB) for instance-based clustering have their effectiveness empirically compared in the context of the \"cluster-then-learn\" approach, in which the ACO clustering step completes before learning the local BN classifiers. Second, we propose a novel \"cluster-with-learn\" approach, in which the ACO meta-heuristic performs the clustering and the BMN learning in a synergistic fashion. Third, we adopt the latter approach in two new ACO algorithms: ACO-ClustE(IB), using the instance-based method, and ACO-ClustB(MB), using the medoid-based method. Empirical results are obtained on 30 UCI datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
