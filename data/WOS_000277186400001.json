The method is based on fundamental concepts from coalitional game theory and predictions are explained with contributions of individual feature values. We overcome the method's initial exponential time complexity with a sampling-based approximation. In the experimental part of the paper we use the developed method on models generated by several well-known machine learning algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data sets. The results demonstrate that the method is efficient and that the explanations are intuitive and useful.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Explanation of Individual Classifications using Game Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000277186400001"}
