Nevertheless, it is based on solid mathematical formulations and is not fully comprehensible by end users, who often need graphical trace and explanation mechanisms for the derived conclusions. Directed graphs (or digraphs) car assist in this affair, but their applicability is balanced by the fact that it is difficult to associate data of a variety of types with the nodes and the connections in the graph. In this paper we try to utilize digraphs in the graphical representation of defeasible rules, by exploiting their expressiveness, but also trying to counter their major disadvantage, by defining multiple node and connection types.", "paper_title": "Graphical representation of defeasible logic rules using digraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100059"}
