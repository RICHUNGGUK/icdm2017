In order to reduce the false alarms rate, this paper extends the DPCA based monitoring for non-stationary data of linear dynamic systems, including an on-line means estimator to standardize new observations according to the estimated means. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated for fault detection in a interconnected tanks system.", "paper_title": "Fault detection for large scale systems using Dynamic Principal Components Analysis with adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255332900008"}
