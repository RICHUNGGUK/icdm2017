Despite its theoretical and empirical success, the method has one major bottleneck, which is the high computational complexity. In this brief, we propose a both practical and theoretical guaranteed algorithm, block-quantized support vector ordinal regression (BQSVOR), where we approximate the kernel matrix K with (K) over tilde that is composed of k(2) constant blocks. We provide detailed theoretical justification on the approximation accuracy of BQSVOR. Moreover, we prove theoretically that the OR problem with the block-quantized kernel matrix (K) over tilde could be solved by first separating the data samples in the training set into k clusters with kernel k-means and then performing SVOR on the k cluster representatives. Hence, the algorithm leads to an optimization problem that scales only with the number of clusters, instead of the data set size. Finally, experiments on several real-world data sets support the previous analysis and demonstrate that BQSVOR improves the speed of SVOR significantly with guaranteed accuracy.", "paper_title": "Block-Quantized Support Vector Ordinal Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000265748600011"}
