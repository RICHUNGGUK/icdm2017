The structure which is a combination of SAR-ADC and pipelined ADC benefits from each of their advantages. A new synchronization method is proposed to improve the pipelined SAR-ADC's speed. The proposed method reduces the total conversion without limiting the ADC performance. To evaluate the proposed method a 10-bit 100 MS/s is designed in 0.5 mu m CMOS process technology. According to the obtained simulation results, the designed ADC digitizes a 9-MHz input with 54.19 dB SNDR while consuming 57.3 mw from a 5-V supply.", "paper_title": "100 MS/s, 10-BIT ADC USING PIPELINED SUCCESSIVE APPROXIMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000336150600001"}
