Two approaches are considered: the Cluster Expansion (CE) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The first is found to be unpromising because of its high computational complexity. On the contrary, the second provides very encouraging results and is found to be very well behaved.", "paper_title": "Use of computational intelligence for the prediction of vacancy migration energies in atomistic kinetic monte carlo simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000264144100006"}
