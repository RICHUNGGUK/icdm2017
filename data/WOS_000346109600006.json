The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel topology optimization in which simulated annealing (SA) is introduced to overcome the difficulties in level-set method. Design/methodology/approach - Level-set based topology optimization for two-dimensional optimization problem. Findings - It is shown in the numerical examples, where conventional and present methods are applied to shape optimization of ferrite inductor and Interior Permanent Magnetic (IPM)-motor, the present method can find solutions with better performance than those obtained by the conventional method. Originality/value - SA is introduced to improve the search performances of level-set method.", "paper_title": "Stochastic topology optimization based on level-set method", "paper_id": "WOS:000346109600006"}
