The total domination number of G is the minimum number of vertices that can dominate all vertices in G, and the paired domination number of G is the minimum number of vertices in a dominating set whose induced subgraph contains a perfect matching. This paper determines the total domination number and the paired domination number of the toroidal meshes, i.e., the Cartesian product of two cycles C (n) and C (m) for any na parts per thousand yen3 and ma{3,4}, and gives some upper bounds for n,ma parts per thousand yen5.", "paper_title": "Total and paired domination numbers of toroidal meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000330590400012"}
