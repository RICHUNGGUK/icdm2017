In this paper we extend our previous work (Ciobanu and Corte-Real, Multimed Tools Appl 48(3):411-436, 2010) (for scenarios with permanent complete-overlapping among views) and propose a solution to this problem by exploiting the past visual data associated with each view, gathered over time as a panoramic image (sprite). The entire collection of temporal data from all the cameras is subsequently used for generating the side information. We tackle several topics related to these scenarios and propose solutions for the encountered issues. Optimization techniques are also discussed, e.g., temporal tags and block alternatives associated with the sprite contents for an improved generation of side information. This paper also presents a post-processing technique for additional refinement of generated side information. Practical results show an overall significant enhancement of side information by over 2 dB.", "paper_title": "Sprite-based generation of side information for multi-view Distributed Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000305805300008"}
