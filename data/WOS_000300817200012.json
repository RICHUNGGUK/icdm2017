However, since collecting labeled data is bothersome for new users, it is desirable to utilize data obtained from existing users. In this paper, we formulate this adaptation problem as learning under covariate shift, and propose a cornputationally efficient probabilistic classification method based on adaptive importance sampling. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated in real-world human activity recognition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
