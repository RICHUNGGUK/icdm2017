The proposed structure is to decompose each fuzzy variable into layers of fuzzy systems, and each layer is to characterize one traditional fuzzy set. Similar to forming fuzzy rules in traditional fuzzy systems, layers from different variables form the so-called component fuzzy systems. DFS is proposed to provide more adjustable parameters to facilitate possible adaptation in fuzzy rules, but without introducing a learning burden. It is because those component fuzzy systems are independent so that it can facilitate minimum distribution learning effects among component fuzzy systems. It can be seen from our experiments that even when the rule number increases, the learning time in terms of cycles is still almost constant. It can also be found that the function approximation capability and learning efficiency of the DFS are much better than that of the traditional fuzzy systems when employed in adaptive fuzzy control systems. Besides, in order to further reduce the computational burden, a simplified DFS is proposed in this paper to satisfy possible real time constraints required in many applications. From our simulation results, it can be seen that the simplified DFS can perform fairly with a more concise decomposition structure.", "paper_title": "Decomposed Fuzzy Systems and their Application in Direct Adaptive Fuzzy Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000342228100006"}
