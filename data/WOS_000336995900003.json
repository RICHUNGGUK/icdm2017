We propose a novel label to region assignment (LRA) technique called Fuzzy-based Contextual-cueing Label Propagation (FCLP) with four parts: First, an image is over-segmented into a set of atomic patches and the local visual information of color features and texture features are extracted. Second, fuzzy representation and fuzzy logic are used to model spatial invariants of contextual cueing information, especially for the imprecise position information and ambiguous spatial topological relationships. Third, labels are propagated inter images and intra images in visual space and in contextual cueing space. Finally, the fuzzy C-means clustering based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN-FCM) is utilized to segment the images into semantic regions and associate with corresponding annotations. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Region level annotation by fuzzy based contextual cueing label propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336995900003"}
