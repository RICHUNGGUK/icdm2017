Its original promise of computationally efficient, yet accurate approximation of coherent structures in high Reynolds number turbulent flows, however, still remains to be fulfilled. To balance the low computational cost required by reduced-order modeling and the complexity of the targeted flows, appropriate closure modeling strategies need to be employed. Since modern closure models for turbulent flows are generally nonlinear, their efficient numerical discretization within a proper orthogonal decomposition framework is challenging. This paper proposes a two-level method for an efficient and accurate numerical discretization of general nonlinear closure models for proper orthogonal decomposition reduced-order models. The two-level method computes the nonlinear terms of the reduced-order model on a coarse mesh. Compared with a brute force computational approach in which the nonlinear terms are evaluated on the fine mesh at each time step, the two-level method attains the same level of accuracy while dramatically reducing the computational cost. We numerically illustrate these improvements in the two-level method by using it in three settings: the one-dimensional Burgers equation with a small diffusion parameter nu = 10(-3), the two-dimensional flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 200, and the three-dimensional flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 1000.
