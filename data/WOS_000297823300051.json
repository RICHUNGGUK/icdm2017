For this practical task, two important issues are to be discussed: personal named entity ambiguity and the extraction of personal information for a specific person. For personal named entity ambiguity, which is a common phenomenon in the fast growing web resource, we propose a robust system which extracts lightweight features with a totally unsupervised approach from broad resources. The experiments show that these lightweight features not only improve the performances, but also increase the robustness of a disambiguation system. To extract the information of the focus person, an integrated system is introduced, which is able to effectively re-use and combine current well-developed tools for web data, and at the same time, to identify the expression properties of web data. We show that our flexible extraction system achieves state-of-the-art performances, especially the high precision, which is very important for real applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
