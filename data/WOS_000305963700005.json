We state and prove regularity conditions for the convergence of these algorithms. In addition to these theoretical results we introduce a number of methodological innovations that can be applied much more generally. We assess the performance of these algorithms with simulation studies, including an example of the statistical analysis of a point process driven by a latent log-Gaussian Cox process.", "paper_title": "An adaptive approach to Langevin MCMC", "paper_id": "WOS:000305963700005"}
