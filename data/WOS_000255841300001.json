Several analytical models have been proposed in the literature for different interconnection network systems. This paper proposes an accurate analytical model to predict message latency in wormhole-switched star graphs with fully adaptive routing. Although the focus of this research is on the star graph but the approach used for modelling can be, however, used for modelling some other regular and irregular interconnection networks. The results obtained from simulation experiments confirm that the proposed model exhibits a good accuracy for various network sizes and under different operating conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
