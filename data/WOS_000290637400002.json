A k-chain of a regular n-gon is the segment of the boundary of the regular n-gon formed by a set of k (<= n) consecutive vertices of the regular n-gon. We show that for every odd positive integer k, there exists an integer N(k), such that the Fermat-Weber point of a set of k fixed points lying on the vertices a k-chain of a n-gon coincides with a vertex of the chain whenever n >= N(k). We also show that inverted right perpendicular pi m(m + 1) - pi(2)/4inverted left perpendicular <= N(k) <= left perpendicular pi m(m + 1) + 1right perpendicular, where k (= 2m + 1) is any odd positive integer. We then extend this result to a more general family of point set, and give an O(hk log k) time algorithm for determining whether a given set of k points, having it points on the convex hull, belongs to such a family.", "paper_title": "On the Fermat-Weber Point of a Polygonal Chain and its Generalizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000290637400002"}
