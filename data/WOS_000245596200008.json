By interpolating the coefficients of elliptic Fourier descriptors for a set of parallel contours, a new set of slices can be directly generated at desired axial locations. Neither an explicit correspondence between points on adjacent contours nor a 3D interpolating surface needs to be obtained. We apply the proposed reslicing method to experimental datasets of both synthetic 3D shapes and real prostate contours, and demonstrate that it performs as well as a common method based on variational implicit surfaces, for a much lower computational cost. We also show that reslicing and putting into correspondence an ensemble of axially sampled 3D organs enables the construction of shape models for accurate 3D segmentation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
