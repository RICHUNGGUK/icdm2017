Dynamic scaling is a heuristic discipline that exploits the geometrical features of growing fronts using different concepts from the theory of stochastic processes and fractal geometry. This work is concerned with some problems that arise in the study of tumour-host interfaces. The behaviour of their fluctuations leads to some stochastic evolution equations, which are studied here in the radial symmetry case. Some questions concerning the dynamic scaling of these models and their comparison with experimental results are addressed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
