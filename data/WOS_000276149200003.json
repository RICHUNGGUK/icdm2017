Two different point matching algorithms for the identification of the corner-points of the tanker are proposed. A detailed study of the algorithms is performed with special emphasis on the correct matching and required computational effort. The results show the importance of a correct point-matching scheme for obtaining accurate pose estimation; furthermore, the analysis highlights the tradeoffs involved in the selection of the appropriate algorithms.", "paper_title": "Comparison of point matching algorithms for the UAV aerial refueling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000276149200003"}
