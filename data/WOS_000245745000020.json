The recognition is carried out by modifying the exponential membership functions fitted to the fuzzy sets. These fuzzy sets are derived from features consisting of normalized distances obtained using the Box approach. The membership function is modified by two structural parameters that are estimated by optimizing the entropy subject to the attainment of membership function to unity. The overall recognition rate is found to be 95% for Hindi numerals and 98.4% for English numerals. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
