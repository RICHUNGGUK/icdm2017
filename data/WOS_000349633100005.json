A top-k spatial preference query retrieves a ranked list of the k best data objects based on the scores (e.g., qualities) of feature objects in their spatial neighborhoods. Several solutions have been proposed for top-k spatial preference queries in Euclidean space. However, far too little attention has been paid to top-k spatial preference queries in road networks, where the distance between two points is defined by the length of the shortest path connecting them. A simple way to answer top-k spatial preference queries is to examine the scores of feature objects in the proximity of each data object before returning a ranked list of the k best data objects. However, this simple method causes intolerable computation delays, thus rendering online processing inapplicable. Therefore, in this paper, we address this problem by presenting a new <Emphasis Type=\"ItalicUnderline\">algorithm, called ALPS, for top-k spatial <Emphasis Type=\"ItalicUnderline\">preference <Emphasis Type=\"ItalicUnderline\">searches in road networks. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of ALPS for a wide range of problem settings.", "paper_title": "ALPS: an efficient algorithm for top-k spatial preference search in road networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349633100005"}
