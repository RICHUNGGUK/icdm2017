This trend is fueled by the proliferation of storage engines and query languages based on the observation that \"no one size fits all\". To address this shift, we propose a polystore architecture; it is designed to unify querying over multiple data models. We consider the challenges and opportunities associated with polystores. Open questions in this space revolve around query optimization and the assignment of objects to storage engines. We introduce our approach to these topics and discuss our prototype in the context of the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data.", "paper_title": "The BigDAWG Polystore System", "paper_id": "WOS:000364948700002"}
