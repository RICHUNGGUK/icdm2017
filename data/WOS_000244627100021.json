The proposed algorithm predicts the average queue length and controls it to maintain a certain reference value to achieve high link utilization and low queueing delay. It also has low complexity and easy configuration. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed algorithm under various environments and show its advantage over other existing AQM algorithms. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
