The aim of the present paper is to give a mathematically exact and consistent description of digital straight lines according to Rosenfeld's definition. The digitizations of lines with slopes 0 < a < 1, where a is irrational, are considered. We formulate a definition of digitization runs, and formulate and prove theorems containing necessary and sufficient conditions for digital straightness. The proof was successfully constructed using only methods of elementary mathematics. The developed and proved theory can be used in research into the theory of digital lines, their symmetries, translations, etc. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
