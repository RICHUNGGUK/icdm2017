We propose a method for synthesizing stripe patterns on triangulated surfaces, where singularities are automatically inserted in order to achieve userspecified orientation and line spacing. Patterns are characterized as global minimizers of a convex-quadratic energy which is welldefined in the smooth setting. Computation amounts to finding the principal eigenvector of a symmetric positive-definite matrix with the same sparsity as the standard graph Laplacian. The resulting patterns are globally continuous, and can be applied to a variety of tasks in design and texture synthesis.", "paper_title": "Stripe Patterns on Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000358786600005"}
