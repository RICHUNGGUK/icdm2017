Method: A longitudinal case study was used to trace implementation, adoption and use of nursing classifications as an integral part of an electronic nursing module. A mixed method of data collection was used, including semi-structured interviews, observation and document analysis. Results: A surprisingly high proportion of nursing diagnoses was consistent with the global standard, in spite of a gradual increase of user-generated concepts. This is elaborated more thoroughly through a co-constructing perspective, emphasizing how the global standard and the practice mutually shaped each other over several years. Conclusion: Standardization is an iterative process that is performed in close relationship with practice. The mutual interrelation between formal classifications (NANDA) and local practices are co-constructed in a dynamic interplay that evolves over time. In such a process, the use of local classifications and local strategies can be a means to bridge the gap between these two extreme points.
