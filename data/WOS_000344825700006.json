The complexity that has to be carefully treated in the design process is largely due to the multi-criteria and conflicting character of the functional and performance requirements. These requirements include high stiffness, large work-space, high manipulability, small inertia, low friction, high transparency, as well as cost constraints. The requirements are a basis for creating and assessing design concepts. Concept evaluation relies to a large extent on a systematic usage of kinematic, dynamic, stiffness, friction, and control models. The design process can benefit from a model-based and simulation-driven approach, where one starts from an abstract top-level model that is extended via stepwise refinements and design space exploration into a detailed and integrated systems model that can be physically realized. Such an approach is presented, put in context of the V-model, and evaluated through a test case where a haptic device, based on a Stewart platform, is designed and realized. It can be concluded, based on simulation and experimental results that the performance of this deterministically optimized haptic device satisfies the stated user requirements. Experiences from this case indicate that the methodology is capable of supporting effective and efficient development of high performing haptic devices. However, more test cases are needed to further validate the presented methodology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
