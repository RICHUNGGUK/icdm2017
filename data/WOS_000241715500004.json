The manifest feature directs the researches on various aspects of satellite networks, including protocol architecture investigations, routing protocol and reliable transmission control protocol design and enhancement, etc. This paper systematically quantifies the dynamical activities of regular low earth orbit (LEO) satellite network topologies. The number and length of network snapshots are formulated concisely. With this work, it compensates for the simplified topological assumptions in many LEO satellite network related researches. The thorough understanding of this basic feature not only provides for an accurate quantification of network behavior for researchers on satellite network community, but also could act as a guidance for future satellite constellation design and optimization.
