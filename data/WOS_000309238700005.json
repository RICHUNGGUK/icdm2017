However, many existing studies have little work in situations that have insufficient or no historical information regarding QoWS data. In this study, we propose a trusted QoWS metric approach, that is, Bayesian Approach with Maximum Entropy Principle. The key of our proposed approach is to extract QoWS prior distribution of Web service by using Maximum Entropy Principle and then to infer QoWS posterior distribution of Web service by using Bayesian Approach. On the basis of the obtained QoWS posterior distribution, trusted QoWS can be measured. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate our proposed approach. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach can obtain trusted QoWS effectively.
