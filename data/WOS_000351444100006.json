The overwhelming volume of remote sensing imagery requires automated methods or systems for feature discovery. Existing research focuses on automatic extraction of isolated or elementary features, such as buildings and roads. It is rather understudied to discover complex geospatial features, which is spatially composed of elementary features. From the e-Science perspective, service computing technologies have shown great promise for widespread automation of data analysis and computation. The discovery of complex features would benefit from service computing technologies by computing spatial relations and their fuzziness among elementary features using geoprocessing services. The discovery process can be automated using an ontology approach. The paper presents how ontologies for complex geospatial features, enriched with fuzzy sets of spatial relations, can automate the workflow generation. Spatial computation functions, fuzzy membership functions, and mathematical fuzzy logical operators, are provided as services, and plugged into workflows on demand to enjoy the benefits of service computing technologies. A prototype system demonstrates on-demand uncertainty-aware detection of complex geospatial features in a geoprocessing service environment.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy spatial relation ontology driven detection of complex geospatial features in a web service environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000351444100006"}
