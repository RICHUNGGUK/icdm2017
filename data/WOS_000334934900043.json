The geometries and frequencies of all the stationary points and the minimum energy path (MEP) are calculated at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ level. To obtain more reliable energy information, the high-level single-point energies are further refined at the MCG3/3 level. Possible reaction pathways including the addition-elimination and the OH-initiated oxidation pathways are considered. A complete description of the possible degradation mechanisms of E/Z-CF3CF=CFCF3 in the absence and presence of O-2/NO has been presented. The calculated results demonstrate that the most accessible products are CF3, CF(OH)=CFCF3, CF(O)CHFCF3, CF3C(O)F, and CHFCF3 via the dissociation reactions starting from the addition intermediates IM1E/IM1Z in the absence of O-2/NO. While in the atmosphere, IM1E/IM1Z can further react with O-2/NO to form the likely products CF3C(O)F and HO2. The calculated results are consistent with the experimental results.", "paper_title": "Mechanism of OH-initiated atmospheric oxidation of E/Z-CF3CF = CFCF3: a quantum mechanical study", "paper_id": "WOS:000334934900043"}
