P2P architectures will be very important for future distributed systems and applications. In such networks, peers are heterogeneous in providing the services and they do not have the same competence of reliability. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate whether a peer is trustworthy or not for file sharing and other services. In this paper, we propose an integrated fuzzy-based trustworthiness system for P2P communications in JXTA-overlay, which consists of two Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLC1 and FLC2). For FLC1, we use three input parameters: Number of Jobs (NJ), Number of Connections (NC) and Connection Lifetime (CL) and the output is Actual Behavioral Criterion (ABC). We use ABC and Reputation (R) as input linguistic parameters for FLC2 and the output is Peer Reliability (PR). We evaluate the proposed system by computer simulations. The simulation results has shown that the proposed system has a good behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
