The compressibility requires that particular attention should be paid to the boundary conditions to have an accurate control of wave reflections from the boundaries of the computational domain. To fulfill these requirements the boundary conditions are calculated by a decomposition into characteristic waves. We present a method to calculate such boundary conditions in curvilinear coordinates and we apply it to the solution of the MHD equations in cylindrical geometry. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
