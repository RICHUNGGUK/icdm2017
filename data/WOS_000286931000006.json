This instability is especially severe when absolute imaging is considered. With clinical measurements, accurate knowledge about the body shape is usually not available, and therefore an approximate model domain has to be used in the computational model. It has earlier been shown that large reconstruction artefacts result if the geometry of the model domain is incorrect. In this paper, we adapt the so-called approximation error approach to compensate for the modeling errors caused by inaccurately known body shape. This approach has previously been shown to be applicable to a variety of modeling errors, such as coarse discretization in the numerical approximation of the forward model and domain truncation. We evaluate the approach with a simulated example of thorax imaging, and also with experimental data from a laboratory setting, with absolute imaging considered in both cases. We show that the related modeling errors can be efficiently compensated for by the approximation error approach. We also show that recovery from simultaneous discretization related errors is feasible, allowing the use of computationally efficient reduced order models.", "paper_title": "Compensation of Modelling Errors Due to Unknown Domain Boundary in Electrical Impedance Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000286931000006"}
