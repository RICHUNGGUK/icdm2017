OSM road networks have high levels of detail and complex structures, but they also have large numbers of duplicated lines for the same road features, which leads to difficulties and low efficiency when extracting multilane roads using conventional methods based on the analysis and operations of line segments. To overcome these deficiencies, a polygon-based method is proposed that is based on shape analysis and Gestalt theory, which treats polygons surrounded by roads as operating elements. First, shape descriptors are calculated for each polygon in networks and are used for classification. Second, candidate multilane polygons are classified as seeds based on all the polygons used as shape descriptors by a support vector machine. Finally, based on the seed polygons, a region-growing method is proposed that connects and fills the multilane features according to Gestalt theory. An experiment using OSM data from different urban networks verified the validity of the proposed method. The method achieved good and effective extraction performance, regardless of the complexity and duplication of data sets. Thus, a comparative analysis with high-level roads extracted based on road type attributes and structural analysis was performed to demonstrate the differences between the constructed road levels and other hierarchies.", "paper_title": "Polygon-based approach for extracting multilane roads from OpenStreetMap urban road networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345272800004"}
