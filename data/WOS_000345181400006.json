This paper presents a new MAS specially designed to manage data from WSNs, which was tested in a residential home for the elderly. The proposed MAS architecture is based on virtual organizations, and incorporates social behaviors to improve the information fusion processes. The data that the system manages and analyzes correspond to the actual data of the activities of a resident. Data is collected as the information event counts detected by the sensors in a specific time interval, typically one day. We have designed a system that improves the quality of life of dependant people, especially elderly, by fusioning data obtained by multiple sensors and information of their daily activities. The high development of systems that extract and store information make essential to improve the mechanisms to deal with the avalanche of context data. In our case, the MAS approach results appropriated because each agent can represent an autonomous entity with different capabilities and offering different services but collaborating among them. Several tests have been performed to evaluate this platform and preliminary results and the conclusions are presented in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
