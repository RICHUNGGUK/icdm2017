The non-dimensional coefficients of thermal consolidation and thermal diffusivity are defined accordingly. An analytical solution is deduced by using the Laplace transform and the Gauss-Legendre method of Laplace transform inversion. The responses of saturated porous media subjected to cyclic thermal loading are studied. The evolution of temperature, pore pressure and displacement from instantaneous state to quasi-steady state, with elapsed time, are analysed. The characteristics of cyclic fluctuation and the attenuation of the field variables with increased depth are also analysed. The influences of the permeability of media on thermal responses are discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
