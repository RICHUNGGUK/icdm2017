The proposed scheme uses a closed-loop feedback control mechanism to constrain the average queuing delay by regulating traffic arrival rate implicitly through a movable queuing threshold. A discrete-time queuing model is developed to derive the relationship between average queuing delays and queuing thresholds based on a traffic model that models aggregated Internet traffic through superposition of N MMBP-2 arrival processes. The queuing threshold is adjusted dynamically with reference to the relationship derived in the analytical model and also feedback of average queuing delay measurement. Packets are dropped dynamically with respect to the changes of queuing threshold and the packet loss events serve as implicit congestion indicators. Matlab is used to perform queuing analysis and simulation. Statistical evaluation is performed to show the efficiency and accuracy of the analytical and simulation results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
