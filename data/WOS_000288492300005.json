However, most of these attempts were theoretical. It is also a challenge to understand the relationship between the structure and morphology of a road network and peoples' movement. We developed a new methodology to deal with this challenge in this study. The first attempt was to apply the ego network analysis (which is rooted in social science) to the formation of hierarchical road networks. Then, the ego network was improved to become weighted ego network by assigning a weight to each of the links in a network. A measure called weighted average centrality rank is developed to define the order of links in a complex network. The ego network and the weighted ego network are both evaluated with a notional network and two sets of real-life road networks. Traffic flow data were used as a benchmark for the evaluation of the two approaches. The results show that they both perform well. But the hierarchies formed by weighted ego network analysis are more consistent with the real-life traffic flow, and the improvement is clearly observable.", "paper_title": "Weighted ego network for forming hierarchical structure of road networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000288492300005"}
