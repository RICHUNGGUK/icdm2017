In this paper, we show that the anti-forcing number of every fullerene has at least four. We give a procedure to construct all fullerenes whose anti-forcing numbers achieve the lower bound four. Furthermore, we show that, for every even n >= 20 (n not equal 22, 26), there exists a fullerene with is vertices that has the anti-forcing number four, and the fullerene with 26 vertices has the anti-forcing number five.", "paper_title": "On the Anti-Forcing Number of Fullerene Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000365373800013"}
