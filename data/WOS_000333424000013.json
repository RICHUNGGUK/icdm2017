Classical optimisation assumes a well-posed problem with a stable unique solution. Most of important practical problems are ill posed due to an unstable or non-unique global optimum and are regularised to get a unique best-suited solution. Whilst regularisation theory exists largely for unstable unique solutions, its recommendations are often routinely applied to inverse optical problems with essentially non-unique solutions, e.g. computer stereo vision or image segmentation, typically formulated in terms of global energy minimisation. In these cases the recommended regularisation becomes purely heuristic and does not guarantee a unique solution. As a result, classical optimisation algorithms: dynamic programming (DP) and belief propagation (BP) - meet with difficulties. Our recent concurrent propagation (CP), leaning upon the P systems paradigm, extends DP and BP to always detect whether the problem is ill posed or not and store in the ill-posed case an entire space of solutions that yield the same global optimum. This suggests a radically new path to proper regularisation: select the best-suited unique solution by exploring statistical and structural features of this space. We propose a P systems based implementation of CP and set out as a case study an application of CP to the image matching problem in stereo vision.", "paper_title": "Regularising Ill-posed Discrete Optimisation: Quests with P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000333424000013"}
