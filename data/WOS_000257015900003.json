This work contributes to the area of information and knowledge structure to support manufacturing decisions. The structures of the manufacturing model have been defined to achieve suitable access to, and maintenance of, the manufacturing knowledge. Emphasis has been made on investigating a suitable manufacturing model structure in order to readily access manufacturing knowledge related to process planning activities. The aim of this research was to design a manufacturing knowledge model (MKM) and demonstrate its functionality through experimental software. This paper presents requirements for a new MKM, proposes its structure and describes its design.", "paper_title": "Design of a manufacturing knowledge model", "paper_id": "WOS:000257015900003"}
