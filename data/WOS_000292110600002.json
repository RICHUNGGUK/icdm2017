The approach is consistent with the process of biological evolution and development in higher animals and plants, and is justifiable from the perspective of learning theory. In experiments, the combination is synergistic, outperforming algorithms using only some of these mechanisms. It is able to solve GP problems that lie well beyond the scaling capabilities of standard GP. The solutions it finds are simple, succinct, and highly structured. We conclude this paper with a number of proposals for further extension of EDE systems.", "paper_title": "On Synergistic Interactions Between Evolution, Development and Layered Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000292110600002"}
