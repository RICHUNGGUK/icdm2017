In some specific domains, the assumption that visual similarity implies (partial) semantic similarity can be made. For instance, in medical imaging, two images of the same anatomic part in a given modality have a very similar appearance. In the proposed approach, a conceptual indexing phase extracts concepts from texts; a visual similarity between images is computed and then combined with conceptual text indexing. Annotation propagation driven by prior knowledge on the domain is finally performed. Domain knowledge used is a meta-thesaurus for both indexing and annotations propagation. The proposed approach has been applied on the imageCLEF medical image collection.", "paper_title": "Concept propagation based on visual similarity application to medical image annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200040"}
