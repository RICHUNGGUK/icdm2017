In this paper, we develop a general model with learning effects where the actual processing time of a job is not only a function of the total normal processing times of the jobs already processed, but also a function of the job's scheduled position. In particular, it is shown that some single machine scheduling problems and m-machine permutation flowshop problems are still polynomially solvable under the proposed model. These results are significant extensions of some of the existing results on learning effects in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
