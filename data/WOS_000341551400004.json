In this paper, we propose the usage of minimal critical subsystems of discrete-time Markov chains and Markov decision processes as counterexamples for violated omega-regular properties. Minimality can thereby be defined in terms of the number of states or transitions. This problem is known to be NP-complete for Markov decision processes. We show how to compute such subsystems using mixed integer linear programming and evaluate the practical applicability in a number of experiments. They show that our method yields substantially smaller counterexample than using existing techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
