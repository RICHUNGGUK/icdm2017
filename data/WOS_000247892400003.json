Consequently, this conventional scheme cannot cope with the continuous variation of system parameters and circumstance, though the gains can be changed manually with the aid of experts to prevent a serious situation such as inferior mass production. Hence, partially uncontrolled variation still remains on delivery thickness. This paper discusses an effective online algorithm which can adjust the gains of the existing control system by considering the effect of time varying variables. This algorithm improves the performance of the system without additional cost and guarantees the stability of the conventional system. Specifically, this paper reveals the major factors that cause the variation of strip and explores the relationship between AGC gains and the effects of those factors through the analysis of thickness signal which occupy different frequency bands. The proposed tuning algorithm is based on the above relationship and realized through ANFIS (Adaptive-Neuro-based Fuzzy Interface System) which is a very useful method because its fuzzy logics reflect the experiences of professionals about the uncertainty and the nonlinearity of the system. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown by several simulations which are carried out by using the field data of POSCO corporation (South Korea).", "paper_title": "Online gain tuning method of RoRR force AGC in hot strip MiRRs by using fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000247892400003"}
