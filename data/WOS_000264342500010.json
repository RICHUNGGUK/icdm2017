With MPT, the sender can send two compatible packets simultaneously to two distinct receivers and can double the throughput in the ideal case. We formalize the problem of finding a schedule to send out buffered packets in minimum time as finding a maximum matching problem in a graph. Since maximum matching algorithms are relatively complex and may not meet the timing requirements of real-time applications, we give a fast approximation algorithm that is capable of finding a matching at least 3/4 of the size of a maximum matching in O(vertical bar E vertical bar) time, where vertical bar E vertical bar is the number of edges in the graph. We also give analytical bounds for maximum allowable arrival rate, which measures the speedup of the downlink after enhanced with MPT, and our results show that the maximum arrival rate increases significantly even with a very small compatibility probability. We also use an approximate analytical model and simulations to study the average packet delay, and our results show that packet delay can be greatly reduced even with a very small compatibility probability.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Downlink Performance in Wireless Networks by Simultaneous Multiple Packet Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000264342500010"}
