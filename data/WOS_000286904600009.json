In this paper, an efficient and robust adaptive normal direction support vector regression (AND-SVR) is developed by combining the geometric algorithm for support vector machine (SVM) classification. AND-SVR finds a better shift direction for training samples based on the normal direction of output function in the feature space compared with RH-SVR. Numerical examples on several artificial and UCI benchmark datasets with comparisons show that the proposed AND-SVR derives good generalization performance.
