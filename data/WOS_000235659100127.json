Many science and engineering explorations rely on mature, efficient computational algorithms and implementations, practical and reliable numerical methods, and large-scale computation systems. Since scientific computation consumes many computer resources. And some function quality parameter such as error or max loop times, impact much on function executing. Applying Web services to scientific computation differs from other usage situation of Web services. This paper described the service template as the data structure to discover services, and discuss the algorithm of the similarity degree between ST and SO based on QOS of Web service.", "paper_title": "Discovery of web services applied to scientific computations based on QOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100127"}
