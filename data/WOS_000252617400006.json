For a hash function H : D -> R with vertical bar R vertical bar n, it has been believed that we can find an s-collision by hashing Q n(((s-1)/s)) times. We first show that this probability is at most I Is! for any s, which is very small for large s (for example, s = n(((s-1)/s)). Thus the above folklore is wrong for large s. We next show that if s is small, so that we can assume Q - s approximate to Q, then this probability is at least 1/s! - 112(s!)(2), which is very high for small s (for example, s is a constant). Thus the above folklore is true for small s. Moreover, we show that by hashing (s!)(1/s) x Q + s - 1(<= n) times, an s-collision is found with probability approximately 0.5 for any n and s such that (s!/n)(1/s) approximate to 0. Note that if s = 2, it coincides with the usual birthday paradox. Hence it is a generalization of the birthday paradox to multi-collisions.", "paper_title": "Birthday paradox for multi-collisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400006"}
