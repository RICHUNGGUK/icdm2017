A Lambda-type three-level atom is selected as the system model. Coherence preservation between a ground state and the excited state of such a system is defined as the control object. A control field is designed by means of constraining the constant coherence condition. For the singularities of the control field, we qualitatively analyze the breakdown time, i.e. the time of control diverging. We obtain the region in which the state stays to maintain coherence forever in the case that the three-level system is reduced to a two-level one. For other cases, we investigate how different parameters affect the breakdown time qualitatively. Numerical experiments are implemented on a three-level quantum system and the experimental results are analyzed.", "paper_title": "COHERENCE PRESERVATION IN A Lambda-TYPE THREE-LEVEL ATOM", "paper_id": "WOS:000292172500004"}
