Frequency hopping (FH) is an effective rendezvous method that does not rely on a predetermined control channel. Previous FH-based rendezvous designs mainly target unicast rendezvous, and do not intrinsically support multicast rendezvous, where a group of nodes need to rendezvous simultaneously. Furthermore, these designs do not account for fast primary user (PU) dynamics, leading to long time-to-rendezvous (TTR). In this paper, we exploit the uniform k-arbiter and Chinese Remainder Theorem quorum systems to develop three FH-based multicast rendezvous algorithms, which provide different tradeoffs between rendezvous efficiency (e. g., low TTR) and security (e. g., robustness to node compromise). Our rendezvous algorithms are tailored for asynchronous and spectrum-heterogeneous DSA systems. To account for fast PU dynamics, we develop an algorithm for adapting the proposed FH designs on the fly. This adaptation is done through efficient mechanisms for channel ordering and quorum selection. Our simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed rendezvous algorithms, their PU detection accuracy, and their robustness to insider attacks.", "paper_title": "Multicast Rendezvous in Fast-Varying DSA Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000357656200010"}
