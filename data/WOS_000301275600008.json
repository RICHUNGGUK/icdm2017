The present study centers on questions as to the most optimal implementation of the multimedia package in veterinary education. In a pretest-posttest crossover design, students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. Experimental conditions varied - next to a traditional lecture based introduction to equine obstetrics - from independent exploration of the FoalinMare DVD, to independent guided DVD usage, to guided classroom usage of the DVD. As dependent measures, student mastery of knowledge and skills, cognitive load and self-efficacy were measured. Results point at the significant superior impact of studying with the FoalinMare DVD on skills acquisition and higher levels of self-efficacy. In addition, experimental conditions that build on guided usage of the multimedia application, result in superior performance. Building on the cross-over design, the guided classroom usage boosts in a significant way the knowledge acquisition in the subsequent learning phase in the control condition. Building on these results, implications and directions for future research are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
