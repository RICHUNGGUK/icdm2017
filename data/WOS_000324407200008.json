In order to explore such systems, it is important to derive analytic expressions for parameters which characterize the system's state space. Two such parameters are the degree of genuine multipartite entanglement and the degree of mixedness of the system's state. We explore these two parameters for an N-qubit system whose density matrix has an X form. We derive the class of states that has the maximum amount of genuine multipartite entanglement for a given amount of mixedness. We compare our results with the existing results for the N = 2 case. The critical amount of mixedness above which no N-qubit X-state possesses genuine multipartite entanglement is derived. It is found that as N increases, states with higher mixedness can still be entangled.", "paper_title": "MAXIMIZING GENUINE MULTIPARTITE ENTANGLEMENT OF N MIXED QUBITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000324407200008"}
