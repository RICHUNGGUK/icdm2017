The main objective is to find minimum cost subgraphs that also satisfy user-specified QoS constraints, specifically with respect to rate and delay demands. We consider networks with multiple multicast sessions. Although earlier network coding algorithms in this area have demonstrated performance improvements in terms of QoS parameters, the proposed QoS network coding approach provides a framework that guarantees QoS constraints are actually met over the network.", "paper_title": "QoSNC: A Novel Approach to QoS-Based Network Coding for Fixed Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000275029500010"}
