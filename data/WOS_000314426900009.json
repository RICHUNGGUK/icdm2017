But this also put forward stricter requirements for the flight control system, which are the crucial issues of the whole UCAV system design. This paper proposes a novel UCAV flight controller parameters identification method, which is based on predator-prey particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. A series of comparative experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach in this paper, and a predator-prey PSO-based software platform for UCAV controller design is also developed.", "paper_title": "Parameters identification of UCAV flight control system based on predator-prey particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000314426900009"}
