Other scalar measures capable of capturing non-linear dependence exist. A common disadvantage of such measures, however, is that they cannot distinguish between negative and positive dependence, and typically the alternative hypothesis of the accompanying test of independence is simply \"dependence\". This paper discusses how a newly developed local dependence measure, the local Gaussian correlation, can be used to construct local and global tests of independence. A global measure of dependence is constructed by aggregating local Gaussian correlation on subsets of , and an accompanying test of independence is proposed. Choice of bandwidth is based on likelihood cross-validation. Properties of this measure and asymptotics of the corresponding estimate are discussed. A bootstrap version of the test is implemented and tried out on both real and simulated data. The performance of the proposed test is compared to the Brownian distance covariance test. Finally, when the hypothesis of independence is rejected, local independence tests are used to investigate the cause of the rejection.", "paper_title": "Recognizing and visualizing departures from independence in bivariate data using local Gaussian correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000339380000008"}
