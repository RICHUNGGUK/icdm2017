In this paper, we investigate the complexity of the quantified H-colouring problem (a restriction of the quantified constraint satisfaction problem to undirected graphs). We introduce this problem using a new two player colouring game. We prove that the quantified H-colouring problem is: 1. tractable, if H is bipartite; 2. NP-complete, if H is not bipartite and not connected; and, 3. Pspace-complete, if H is connected and has a unique cycle, which is of odd length. We conjecture that the last case extends to all non-bipartite connected graphs.", "paper_title": "Towards a trichotomy for quantified H-coloring", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100036"}
