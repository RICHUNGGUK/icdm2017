Correcting random errors of RS codes have been extensively studied in both academia and industry. However, for burst-error correction, the research is still quite limited due to its ultra high computation complexity. In this brief, starting from a recent theoretical work, a low-complexity reformulated inversionless burst-error correcting (RiBC) algorithm is developed for practical applications. Then, based on the proposed algorithm, a unified VLSI architecture that is capable of correcting burst errors, as well as random errors and erasures, is firstly presented for multi-mode decoding requirements. This new architecture is denoted as unified hybrid decoding (UHD) architecture. It will be shown that, being the first RS decoder owning enhanced burst-error correcting capability, it can achieve significantly improved error correcting capability than traditional hard-decision decoding (HDD) design.", "paper_title": "Unified Architecture for Reed-Solomon Decoder Combined With Burst-Error Correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000305181800021"}
