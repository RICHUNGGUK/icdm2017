An application is the result of the joint activities of a set of cooperating nodes. A given node can access a segment stored in the primary memory of a different node only by presenting a gate for that segment. A gate is a form of pointer protected cryptographically, which references a segment and specifies a set of access rights for this segment. Gates can be freely transmitted between nodes, thereby granting the corresponding access permissions. Two special node functionalities are considered, segment servers and application servers. Segment servers are used for inter-application communication and information gathering. An application server is used in each application to support key management and rekeying. The rekey mechanism takes advantage of key naming to cope with losses of rekey messages. The total memory requirements for key and gate storage result to be a negligible fraction of the overall memory resources of the generic network node. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
