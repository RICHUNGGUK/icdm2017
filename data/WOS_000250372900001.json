While spatial reasoning has been extensively studied at the algebraic level, modal logics for spatial reasoning have received less attention in the literature. In this paper we propose a new modal logic, called spatial propositional neighborhood logic (SpPNL for short) for spatial reasoning through directional relations. We study the expressive power of SpPNL, we show that it is able to express meaningful spatial statements, we prove a representation theorem for abstract spatial frames, and we devise a (non-terminating) sound and complete tableaux-based deduction system for it. Finally, we compare SpPNL with the well-known algebraic spatial reasoning system called rectangle algebra.", "paper_title": "A new modal logic for reasoning about space: spatial propositional neighborhood logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000250372900001"}
