In order to address this problem, we propose an integrated Pseudo-Associativity and Relaxed-Order approach to hardware Transactional Memory, called PARO-TM. It exploits the extra pseudo-associative space in the data cache to hold the new value of each transactional modification, and maintains the mappings between the old and new versions via an implicit pseudo-associative hash algorithm (i.e., by inverting the specific bit of the SET index). PARO-TM can branch out the speculative version from the old version upon each transactional modification on demand without a dedicated hardware component to hold the uncommitted data. This means that it is able to automatically access the proper version upon the transaction's commit or abort. Moreover, PARO-TM augments multi-version support in a chained directory to schedule conflicting transactions in a relaxed-order manner to further reduce their overheads. We compare PARO-TM with the state-of-the-art LogTM-SE, TCC, DynTM, and SUV-TM systems and find that PARO-TM consistently outperforms these four representative HTMs. This performance advantage of PARO-TM is far more pronounced under the high-contention and coarse-grained applications in the STAMP benchmark suite, for which PARO-TM is motivated and designed.", "paper_title": "An Integrated Pseudo-Associativity and Relaxed-Order Approach to Hardware Transactional Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000313911800019"}
