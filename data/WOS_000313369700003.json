The outage probability of the scheme over Rayleigh fading channels is deduced. In an unknown channel state information (CSI) scenario, adaptive transversal filters based on a spatio-temporal recursive least squares (ST-RLS) algorithm are adopted in the destination to realize receive diversity gain. Also, a joint 'Min-Sum' iterative decoding is effectively carried out in the destination. Such a decoding algorithm agrees with the bilayer Tanner graph that can be used to fully characterize two distinct structured LDPC codes employed by the source and relay. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the adopted filter in the coded cooperative MIMO scheme. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that the LDPC coded cooperative MIMO scheme can well combine cooperation diversity, multi-receive diversity, and channel coding gains, and clearly outperforms coded noncooperation schemes under the same conditions.", "paper_title": "An LDPC coded cooperative MIMO scheme over Rayleigh fading channels with unknown channel state information", "paper_id": "WOS:000313369700003"}
