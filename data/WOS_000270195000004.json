Unlike their best-effort counterparts, multimedia applications have quality of service (QoS) needs typically expressed in terms of the maximum allowed delay and/or the minimum required throughput. Therefore, prior to accepting a multimedia application, the network must assure the satisfaction of its QoS requirements. In this paper, we develop a mechanism that can be used to control the admissibility of multimedia applications into WLANs. To develop the proposed mechanism, we first derive an analytical approximation of the delay experienced by packets when travelled through these networks. The analytical approximation of the delay is then used to propose an admission control mechanism for the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) method used by the hybrid coordination function (HCF) of IEEE 802.11e. The proposed delay-based admission control mechanism is validated via simulations of voice traffic.", "paper_title": "A delay-based admission control mechanism for multimedia support in IEEE 802.11e wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000270195000004"}
