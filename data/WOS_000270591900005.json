The state delay is assumed to be time-varying and of an interval-like type, which means that both the lower and upper bounds of the time-varying delay are available. The parameter uncertainties are assumed to have a structured linear fractional form. Based on a novel fuzzy-basis-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with Finsler's lemma and an improved free-weighting matrix technique for delay-dependent criteria, a new sufficient condition for robust H-infinity performance analysis is first derived, and then, the filter synthesis is developed.-It is shown that by using a simple linearization technique incorporating a bounding inequality, a unified framework can be developed such that both the full-order and reduced-order filters can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are numerically efficient with commercially available software. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the advantages and less conservatism of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A New Design of Delay-Dependent Robust H-infinity Filtering for Discrete-Time T-S Fuzzy Systems With Time-Varying Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000270591900005"}
