Would the integration of social networking support into traditional forum-based VCoP benefit knowledge exchange in the community? If so, why? Based on social capital theory and transactive memory system research, this study suggests that social networking support will enhance knowledge exchange in VCoP. In a field study, this study found that social networking support intensifies dyadic knowledge exchange among friends and reduces the probability that dyads stop knowledge exchange. These findings empirically confirm the effect of social networking support integration in VCoP, offering an investment justification for practitioners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
