The model can identify basic activities (abstracted as operations) and precisely relate cost and reliability with each basic operation. A typical reuse mode is described from the perspectives of application and domain engineering. According to this scheme, six reuse modes are identified, and alternative industry reuse scenarios can be derived from these modes. A bi-objective 0-1 integer programming model is developed to help decision makers select reuse scenarios when they develop a SPL to minimize cost and maximize reliability while satisfying system requirements to a certain degree. This model is called the cost and reliability optimization under constraint satisfaction (CROS). To design the model efficiently, a three-phase algorithm for finding all efficient solutions is developed, where the first two phases can obtain an efficient solution, and the last phase can generate a nonsupported efficient solution. Two practical methods are presented to facilitate decision making on selecting from the entire range of efficient solutions in light of the decision-maker's preference for man-computer interaction. An application of the CROS model in a mail server system development is presented as a case study.", "paper_title": "AN OPTIMIZATION MODEL FOR REUSE SCENARIO SELECTION CONSIDERING RELIABILITY AND COST IN SOFTWARE PRODUCT LINE DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000294612300004"}
