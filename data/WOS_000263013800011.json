This paper proposes a novel approach based on this routing algorithm. Here, we try to improve the latency and energy consumption of the traditional algorithm using propagation of query and event agents within straight lines, instead of using purely random walk paths. As can be seen in our results, this method improves the delivery ratio of the queries which is a drawback of traditional rumor routing. Due to the reduction of final path length between source and destination. we introduce a second layer geographical routing. Moreover, a method is proposed to reduce the cost of localization equipments by using cheaper equipments like AoA antennas. In order to compare the performance measures with traditional algorithm. a simulation framework is developed and extensive simulations are performed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
