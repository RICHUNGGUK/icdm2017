The direct product of graphs G and H is the graph with vertex set V(G x H) = V(C) x V (H), where two vertices (u(1). v(1)) and (u(2). v(2)) are adjacent in G x H if u(1)u(2) is an element of E(G) and v(1)v(2) is an element of E(H). We prove that lambda(G x K(n)) = min{n(n - 1)lambda(G), (n-1)delta(G)} for every nontrivial graph G and n >= 3. We also prove that for almost every pair of graphs G and H with n vertices and edge probability p. G x H is k-connected, where k = O((n/logn)(2)). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
