The aim was to develop a prediction model with the capability of prospectively assessing whether the assistive technology would be suitable for persons with Dementia (and their carer), based on user characteristics, needs and perceptions. Such a prediction tool has the ability to empower a formal carer to assess, through a very limited amount of questions, whether the technology will be adopted and used.", "paper_title": "Development of a Technology Adoption and Usage Prediction Tool for Assistive Technology for People with Dementia", "paper_id": "WOS:000330852300006"}
