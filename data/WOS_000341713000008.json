Design/methodology/approach - The model is derived from a general setting. Its discretization is discussed in details by providing pseudo-codes and by performing their complexity analysis. The model is validated through several numerical experiments. Findings - CQ provides an efficient and accurate treatment of impedance boundary conditions. Originality/value - The paper suggests a new effective treatment of impedance boundary conditions.", "paper_title": "Efficient convolution based impedance boundary conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713000008"}
