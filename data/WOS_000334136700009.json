In the proposed MSCQPSO algorithm, the population is divided into multi-populations according to the computed fitness value. The SA and diversity-guided mutation strategy are introduced to enhance the global search ability. The quantum behavior theory is introduced into co-evolution theory to change the updating mode of the particles in order to guarantee the simplification and effectiveness. In order to prove the validity of the proposed MSCQPSO algorithm, the ten high-dimensional complex benchmark functions are selected in here. The experiment results show that the proposed MSCQPSO algorithm takes on the fast convergence, the high searching accuracy, the better robustness for solving the high-dimensional complex problems than the PSO algorithm, the CPSO algorithm and HPSO algorithm.
