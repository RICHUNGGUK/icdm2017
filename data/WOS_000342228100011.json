A completely nonlinear input-to-state stability (ISS)-based framework, drawing on ISS methods, with the aid of results from graph theory, matrix theory, and the ISS cyclic-small-gain theorem, is proposed for the coordination problem under directed topology, which can effectively tackle the technical challenges caused by locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics. Two coordination problems, i.e., flocking with a virtual leader and containment control, are considered. For both problems, it is assumed that only a portion of the agents can obtain the information from the leader(s). For the first problem, the proposed strategy is shown effective in driving a group of nonlinear dynamical agents reach the prespecified geometric pattern under the condition that at least one agent in each strongly connected component of the information-interconnection digraph with zero in-degree has access to the state information of the virtual leader; and the strategy proposed for the second problem can guarantee the nonlinear dynamical agents moving to the convex hull spanned by the positions of multiple leaders under the condition that for each agent there exists at least one leader that has a directed path to this agent.", "paper_title": "ISS Method for Coordination Control of Nonlinear Dynamical Agents Under Directed Topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000342228100011"}
