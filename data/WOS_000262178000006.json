Effective price prediction model can aid producers to prevent over production or production shortage of broilers in advance. This research proposes all adapted CBR approach for predicting broiler price. The results indicate that the proposed adapted CBR approach demonstrates superior prediction performance than tin-adapted CBR approach, CART. artificial neural nets and linear regression with at least 50% less of mean average error. This study finds that adjusting the price of the most similar case by considering the similarity distance to the case being predicted is a key to improve the prediction accuracy of the case-based broiler price estimation model.
