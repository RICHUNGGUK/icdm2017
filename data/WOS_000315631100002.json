Such models allow to make predictions for toxicologically relevant endpoints, which constitute the target outcomes of experiments. The task is often tackled by instance-based methods, which are all based on the notion of chemical (dis-)similarity. Our starting point is the observation by Raymond and Willett that the two families of chemical distance measures, fingerprint-based and maximum common subgraph-based measures, provide orthogonal information about chemical similarity. This paper presents a novel method for finding suitable combinations of them, called adapted transfer, which adapts a distance measure learned on another, related dataset to a given dataset. Adapted transfer thus combines distance learning and transfer learning in a novel manner. In our experiments, we visualize the performance of the methods by learning curves and present a quantitative comparison for 10 and 100% of the maximum training set size to show that transfer exploiting source datasets is effective with small training datasets. Additionally, we present an approach to select the source task in a data-driven manner. The relevant experiments include an example that shows that the selection of a meaningful source task is a critical factor for transfer learning.", "paper_title": "Adapted Transfer of Distance Measures for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships and Data-Driven Selection of Source Datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000315631100002"}
