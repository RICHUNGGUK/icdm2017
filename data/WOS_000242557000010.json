In this paper a new multiobjective location-routing model is proposed. Our model also includes some constraints, which were observed in the literature but were not incorporated into previous models. The aim of the proposed model is to answer the following questions: where to open treatment centers and with which technologies, where to open disposal centers, how to route different types of hazardous waste to which of the compatible treatment technologies, and how to route waste residues to disposal centers. The model has the objective of minimizing the total cost and the transportation risk. A large-scale implementation of the model in the Central Anatolian region of Turkey is presented.
