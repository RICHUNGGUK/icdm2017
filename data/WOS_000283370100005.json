With the coupling effects, which are considered as the uncertainties, the highly coupled nonlinear TRMS is pseudode-composed into a horizontal subsystem and a vertical subsystem (VS). The proposed FSFISC consists of a fuzzy-sliding controller and an FISC for the horizontal and the VSs, respectively. The reaching conditions and the stability of the TRMS with the proposed controller are guaranteed. Simulation results are included to indicate that TRMS with the presented FSFISC can greatly alleviate the chattering effect and remain robust to the external disturbances. In addition, the performance comparisons with the proportional-integral-differential (PID) approach using a modified real-value-type genetic algorithm are provided to show that the FSFISC has better performance in the aspects of error and control indexes.", "paper_title": "A Novel Fuzzy-Sliding and Fuzzy-Integral-Sliding Controller for the Twin-Rotor Multi-Input-Multi-Output System", "paper_id": "WOS:000283370100005"}
