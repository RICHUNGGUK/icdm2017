Although the user is central to the use of such environments, perceptual and cognitive processes are not well understood within the context of interactive visualization. Although cognitive psychology has provided a greater understanding of visual perception and cognition, a theoretical framework that links this knowledge with the interactive visualization process is needed. This article aims to fill this gap by introducing a visual information processing model that facilitates the understanding of how users interact with interactive visualization environments.", "paper_title": "A Visual Information Processing Model to Characterize Interactive Visualization Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000287699500003"}
