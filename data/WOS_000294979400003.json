The proposed algorithm can handle arbitrarily deforming bodies and their corresponding non-divergence free deformation velocity fields. The method is validated on a number of benchmark problems with stationary and moving boundaries. Results include flows of tumbling objects and single and multiple self-propelled swimmers.
