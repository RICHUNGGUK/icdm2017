In the HDABC, each solution to the problem is called a food source and represented by a discrete job permutation. First, the initial population with certain quality and diversity is generated from Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) based on Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristics. Second, the discrete operators and algorithm, such as insert, swap, path relinking and GRASP are applied to generate new solution for the employed bees, onlookers and scouts. Moreover, local search is applied to the best one. The presented algorithm is tested on scheduling problem benchmarks. Experimental results show its efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
