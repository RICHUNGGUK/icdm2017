Full search equivalent algorithms accelerate the pattern matching process and, in the meantime, yield exactly the same result as the full search. This paper proposes an analysis and comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms for full search equivalent pattern matching. Our intention is that the data sets and tests used in our evaluation will be a benchmark for testing future pattern matching algorithms, and that the analysis concerning state-of-the-art algorithms could inspire new fast algorithms. We also propose extensions of the evaluated algorithms and show that they outperform the original formulations.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of Full Search Equivalent Pattern Matching Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000297069900009"}
