The special algebraic structure of PH curves permits exact algorithms for the computation of key properties, such as arc length, elastic bending energy, and offset (parallel) curves. Single planar PH quintic segments are constructed as interpolants to first-order Hermite data (end points and derivatives), and this construction is then extended to open or closed C-2 PH quintic spline curves interpolating a sequence of points in the plane. The nonlinear nature of PH curves incurs a multiplicity of formal solutions to such interpolation problems, and a key aspect of the algorithms is to efficiently single out the unique \"good\" interpolant among them.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 952: PHquintic: A Library of Basic Functions for the Construction and Analysis of Planar Quintic Pythagorean-Hodograph Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000363733000006"}
