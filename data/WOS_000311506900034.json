Instead of focusing on setting proper parameters, in IMDE algorithm, all individuals are divided into the better part and the worse part according to their fitness. And then, the novel mutation and crossover operations have been developed to generate the new individuals. Finally, a set of famous benchmark functions have been used to test and evaluate the performance of the proposed IMDE. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is better than, or at least comparable to the self-adaptive DE (JDE), which is proven to be better than the standard DE algorithm. In further study, the IMDE algorithm has also been compared with several improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and Bee Swarm Optimization (BSO) algorithm. And the IMDE algorithm outperforms these algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
