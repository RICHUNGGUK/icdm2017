With the advanced capabilities of mobile, lightweight, and thin devices, Grid computing has, recently, migrated to pervasive and utility computing. To address these problems, we designed and implemented an agent-based lightweight Grid application toolkit, which is called MAGE (Mobile Agent-based Grid Environment). It consists of several hierarchical layers with dynamically controllable agents for archiving isolation of dependency among communication, message interpretation, and actual jobs. Because an agent represents a set-vice in MAGE, each element of application can be replaced with a new task without intervention of other tasks. In this paper, we will describe the design issues and advantages in using our system.", "paper_title": "Lightweight service-oriented grid application toolkit", "paper_id": "WOS:000249934900005"}
