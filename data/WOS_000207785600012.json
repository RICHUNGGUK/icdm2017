Starting with version 4.0 of the server release, Hyrax, has at its core, the Back-End Server (BES). The BES offers ease of programming, extensibility and reliability allowing added functionality especially related to high-performance data Grids, that goes beyond its original goal of distributed data access. We present the fundamentals of the BES server as a component based architecture, as well as our experiences using the BES to distribute data processing in Grid-oriented intensive parallel computational tasks.", "paper_title": "Developing service-oriented applications in a grid environment Experiences using the OPeNDAP back-end-server", "paper_id": "WOS:000207785600012"}
