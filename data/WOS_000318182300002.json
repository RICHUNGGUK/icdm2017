Then, we look back on the history of cognitive theory of music, i.e., various attempts to represent our mental understandings and to show music structures. Among which, we especially pay attention to the Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM) by Lehrdahl and Jackendoff, as the most promising candidate of cognitive/computational theory of music. We briefly overview the theory as well as its inherent problems, including the ambiguity of its preference rules. By our recent efforts, we have solved this ambiguity problem by assigning parametrized weights, and thus we could implement an automatic tree analyzer. After we introduce the system architecture, we show our application systems.", "paper_title": "Computational Reconstruction of Cognitive Music Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000318182300002"}
