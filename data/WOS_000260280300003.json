From a knowledge of a given number of terms of a sequence, these transforms reproduce the functions with a better accuracy than the Levin-like transforms. Though there exists a correlation between the approximative power of a rational approximant and its ability to predict the leading terms of a series, there are exceptions to this, especially in the case of divergent series. The new transforms can, in most cases, predict a number of extra terms not used in the construction of the approximants. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
