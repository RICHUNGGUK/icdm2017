We define input-unambiguous (IU) and input-deterministic (ID) transducers, and transducers with finite codomain (FC). IU transductions are characterized by nondeterministic bimachines and ID transductions can be represented as a composition of sequential functions and finite substitutions. FC transductions are recognizable and can be expressed as finite unions of subsequential functions. We place these families along with uniformly ambiguous (UA) and finitely ambiguous (FA) transductions in a hierarchy of ambiguity. Finally, we show that restricted nondeterministic bimachines characterize FA transductions. Perhaps the most important aspect of this work consists in defining nondeterministic bimachines and describing their power by linking them with weakly ambiguous finite transducers (IU and FA).", "paper_title": "On weakly ambiguous finite transducers", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454100015"}
