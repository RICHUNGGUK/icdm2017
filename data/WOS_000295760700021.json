The randomized approach has received much attention for its computational benefit when compared with the Hough transform. In this paper, a multiple-evidence-based sampling strategy is proposed to speed up the randomized approach. Next, an efficient refinement strategy is proposed to improve the accuracy. Based on different kinds of ten test images, experimental results demonstrate the computation-saving and accuracy effects when plugging the proposed strategies into three existing circle detection methods.
