The interference signal and the desired signal received by each destination node are assumed to be of comparable strength. Under each cooperation constraint, DMT upper and lower bounds are derived and shown to be tight, i.e., the lower bound meets the upper bound. A full characterization of the DMT of the channel is thus established. The upper bounds are evaluated using the capacity upper bounds and the lower bounds are obtained based on our proposed transmission schemes. The proposed transmission schemes only require partial channel state information at transmitter side (CSIT), making them suitable for practical applications. Specifically, for the transmission scheme designed under the full-duplex constraint, the partial CSIT is obtained by letting each destination represent the fading magnitude of each of its incoming links using 1 bit of information and feed back this information to the sources. In the half-duplex case, the proposed transmission scheme requires no more than 3 bits of feedback information to represent the fading magnitude of each link. Our DMT results show that source cooperation can notably improve the system diversity performance over the whole multiplexing gain region even under the half-duplex constraint.", "paper_title": "Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of Fading Interference Channels With Source Cooperation and Partial CSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000289836300015"}
