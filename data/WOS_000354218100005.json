We have observed that a lazier reaction (not sending COST messages until a condition is met) substantially decrements the number of messages sent and causes only a small variation in ENCCCs. This approach combines nicely with soft arc consistency maintenance during search. We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of this approach on several benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Adding laziness in BnB-ADOPT", "paper_id": "WOS:000354218100005"}
