The cepstrum is obtained by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the log-magnitude spectrum. In the present study, a number of spectral pre-processing steps are investigated prior to computing the cepstrum; the pre-processing steps include period-synchronous, period-asynchronous, harmonic-synchronous and harmonic-asynchronous spectral band-limitation analysis. The analysis is applied on both sustained vowels [a] and connected speech signals. The correlation between R1 (the amplitude of the first rahmonic) and perceptual ratings is examined for a corpus comprising 251 speakers. It is observed that the correlation between R1 and perceptual ratings increases when the spectrum is band-limited prior to computing the cepstrum. In addition, comparisons are made with a previously reported cepstral cue, cepstral peak prominence (CPP). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
