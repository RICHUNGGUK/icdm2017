We propose an insertion heuristic and generalized resource constraint propagation mechanisms. Our propositions are embedded in a branch-and-bound algorithm to provide an experimental evaluation on some benchmark instances. The results obtained conclude that our heuristic achieves the best solutions on the instances, especially when problems involve tightened time lags. The results also prove the interest of the constraint propagation generalization when time lags are considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
