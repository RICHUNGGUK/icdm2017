Only by changing the capacitor values can the center and cutoff frequencies of the complex filter be adjusted simultaneously to realize the reconfigurability. Meanwhile, a novel one-step method to obtain fast gain settling of AGCs is proposed. The chip is fabricated in 0.13-mu m CMOS technology, occupies 0.9 x 1.3 mm(2), and consumes 14.8 mW of power with a 1.2-V power supply. The measurement results show a reconfigurable bandwidth of 2 K to 3.5/5/10 MHz, a gain range of 10 to 58 dB, and a total harmonic distortion of 0.43% to 1.66%.", "paper_title": "A reconfigurable baseband circuit applied for WiMAX low-IF receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000343076200010"}
