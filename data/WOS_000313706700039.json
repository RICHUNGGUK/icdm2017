Phase compensation enables resonant control to achieve high tracking accuracy, wide stability range and fast error convergence rate. A simple and efficient phase compensation resonant control scheme is proposed for a single-phase PWM inverter. Experiment results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of phase compensation for resonant control.", "paper_title": "Phase Compensation Resonant Controller for PWM Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700039"}
