An error model is established by combining the input delay and parallel distributed compensation techniques so as to transform the sampling period of a sampler, a signal transmission delay, and data packet dropouts to the refreshing interval of a zero-order hold. The method introduces a new augmented Lyapunov Krasovskii functional to derive a sufficient condition to ensure a prescribed li tracking performance with less conservativeness than others. A fuzzy controller can easily he designed using the condition. A numerical example demonstrates the validity of the method.", "paper_title": "New Results on H-infinity Tracking Control Based on the T-S Fuzzy Model for Sampled-Data Networked Control System", "paper_id": "WOS:000365989300042"}
