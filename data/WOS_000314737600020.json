DBM process is as follows: First, performs the non-linear registration of a subject's structural MRI volume to a reference template. Second, computes scalar measures of the registration's deformation field. Third, performs across volume statistical group analysis of these scalar measures to detect effects. In this paper we use the scalar deformation measures for Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems for AD. Specifically this paper deals with feature extraction methods over five such scalar measures. We evaluate three supervised feature selection methods based on voxel site significance measures given by Pearson correlation, Bhattacharyya distance and Welch's t-test, respectively. The CAD system discriminating between healthy control subjects (HC) and AD patients consists of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on the DBM selected features. The paper reports experimental results on structural MRI data from the cross-sectional OASIS database. Average 10-fold cross-validation classification results are comparable or improve the state-of-the-art results of other approaches performing CAD from structural MRI data. Localization in the brain of the most discriminant deformation voxel sites is in agreement with findings reported in the literature.
