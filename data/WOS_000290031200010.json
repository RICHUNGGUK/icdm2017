Generalizing Mirsky-Newman, we show that a non-trivial disjoint family of Cartesian cosets with union Z(d) always contains two cosets that differ only by translation. Where Mirsky-Newman's proof (for d = 1) uses complex analysis, we employ Fourier techniques. Relaxing the Cartesian requirement, for d > 2 we provide examples where Z(d) occurs as the disjoint union of four cosets of distinct subgroups (with one not Cartesian). Whether one can do the same for d = 2 remains open.", "paper_title": "Tiling Lattices with Sublattices, I", "paper_id": "WOS:000290031200010"}
