In this paper, we examine an integrated architecture for supporting interoperability among heterogeneous home network middlewares and present a scenario-based user-oriented integrated architecture for home automation, which controls and interoperates information appliances by integrating heterogeneous home network middlewares with an ability of reflecting flexible properties of home network middlewares.", "paper_title": "A scenario-based user-oriented integrated architecture for supporting interoperability among heterogeneous home network middleware", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800073"}
