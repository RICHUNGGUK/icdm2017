We analyse a recently introduced construction of non-weakly regular bent functions and show conditions under which their dual is bent as well. This leads to the definition of the class of dual-bent functions containing the class of weakly regular bent functions as a proper subclass. We analyse self-duality for bent functions in odd characteristic, and characterize quadratic self-dual bent functions. We construct non-weakly regular bent functions with and without a bent dual, and bent functions with a dual bent function of a different algebraic degree.", "paper_title": "ON THE DUAL OF (NON)-WEAKLY REGULAR BENT FUNCTIONS AND SELF-DUAL BENT FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000326231000003"}
