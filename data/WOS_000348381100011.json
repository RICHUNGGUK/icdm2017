Specifically, we generalize the problem to general combinatorial classes and relax the requirement that the sizes of the compositions be equal. We extend the main explicit results to enumeration problems whose counting sequences are Riordan arrays. In this framework, we give an alternative method for computing asymptotics in the supercritical case, which avoids explicit diagonal extraction.", "paper_title": "Diagonal Asymptotics for Products of Combinatorial Classes", "paper_id": "WOS:000348381100011"}
