As sensors use battery, most works on WSNs focus on energy efficiency issues(e.g., local energy balancing problems) in statically deployed WSNs. Few works have paid attention to the global energy balancing problem for the scenario that mobile sensor nodes can move freely. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol called global energy balancing routing protocol (GEBRP) based on an active network framework and node relocation in mobile sensor networks. This protocol achieves global energy efficiency by repairing coverage holes and replacing invalid nodes dynamically. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the proposed GEBRP achieves superior performance over the existing scheme. In addition, we analyze the delay performance of GEBRP and study how the delay performance is affected by various system parameters.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Relocation routing for energy balancing in mobile sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356803200002"}
