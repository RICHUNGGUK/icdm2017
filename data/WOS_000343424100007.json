They are executed on quantum circuits, which consist of a cascade of quantum gates. However, synthesis of quantum circuits is not straightforward because of the complexity of quantum algorithms. Generally, quantum algorithms contain two parts: classical and quantum. Thus, synthesizing circuits for the two parts separately reduces overall synthesis complexity. In addition, many quantum algorithms use similar subroutines that can be implemented with similar circuit modules. Because of their frequent use, it is important to use automated scripts to generate such modules efficiently. These modules can then be subjected to further synthesis optimizations. This article proposes QLib, a quantum module library, which contains scripts to generate quantum modules of different sizes and specifications for well-known quantum algorithms. Thus, QLib can also serve as a suite of benchmarks for quantum logic and physical synthesis.", "paper_title": "QLib: Quantum Module Library", "paper_id": "WOS:000343424100007"}
