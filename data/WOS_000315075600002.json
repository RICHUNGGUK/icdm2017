After a discussion of an oft-ignored form/content dichotomy that offers an explicit understanding of what meaning is and is not, a specific approach, the Ontological Semantic Technology, is introduced and several aspects of meaning representation are addressed in its terms, including how the 1977 Tenerife fatal aircrash could have been prevented with its help.
