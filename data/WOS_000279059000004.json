We describe Hydra, a high-performance flash memory SSD architecture that translates the parallelism inherent in multiple flash memory chips into improved performance, by means of both bus-level and chip-level interleaving. Hydra has a prioritized structure of memory controllers, consisting of a single high-priority foreground unit, to deal with read requests, and multiple background units, all capable of autonomous execution of sequences of high-level flash memory operations. Hydra also employs an aggressive write buffering mechanism based on block mapping to ensure that multiple flash memory chips are used effectively, and also to expedite the processing of write requests. Performance evaluation of an FPGA implementation of the Hydra SSD architecture shows that its performance is more than 80 percent better than the best of the comparable HDDs and SSDs that we considered.", "paper_title": "Hydra: A Block-Mapped Parallel Flash Memory Solid-State Disk Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000279059000004"}
