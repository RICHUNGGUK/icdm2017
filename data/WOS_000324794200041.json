In this study, a novel wavelet cerebellar model articulation controller (WCMAC) is proposed, which incorporates the wavelet decomposition property with a cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC). This WCMAC is a generalization network; in some special cases, it can be reduced to a wavelet neural network, a neural network and a conventional CMAC. Then, an adaptive wavelet cerebellar model articulation control system (AWCCS) is proposed to synchronize a unified chaotic system. In this AWCCS, WCMAC is the main controller utilized to mimic a perfect controller and the parameters of WCMAC are online adjusted by the derived adaptive laws; and a compensation controller is designed to dispel the residual of the approximation error for achieving robust performance. The derived AWCCS is then applied to the chaotic system synchronization control. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control system is demonstrated through simulation results.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of unified chaotic system via adaptive wavelet cerebellar model articulation controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200041"}
