We compare the results obtained by the classical Gauss's method with those obtained by some higher-order iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations. The original problem of the determination of the preliminary orbits was posed by means of a nonlinear equation. We modify this equation in order to obtain a nonlinear system which describes the mentioned problem and we derive a new efficient iterative method for solving it. We also propose a new definition of optimal order of convergence for iterative methods for solving nonlinear systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
