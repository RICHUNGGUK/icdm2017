Several approaches have been proposed for classification tasks in the unsupervised scenario, where no labeled target data are available. Most of the attention has been dedicated to searching a new domain-invariant representation, leaving the definition of the prediction function to a second stage. Here we propose to learn both jointly. Specifically we learn the source subspace that best matches the target subspace while at the same time minimizing a regularized misclassification loss. We provide an alternating optimization technique based on stochastic sub-gradient descent to solve the learning problem and we demonstrate its performance on several domain adaptation tasks.
