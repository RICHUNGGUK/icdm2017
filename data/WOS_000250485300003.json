The dynamic nature of these environments implies a need for organizations to protect and monitor the flow of their valuable knowledge assets throughout the netchain if they hope to maintain their long-term competitive positions. In this paper, we propose an interorganizational knowledge-sharing security model that integrates the value chain reference model (VCOR), the federated enterprise reference architecture model (FERA), and multidimensional data warehouse technologies to allow for the proactive monitoring of shared knowledge assets across an SOA-based netchain. The proposed architecture is novel In that it supports dynamic policy revision through the automated detection of knowledge-sharing breaches within a netchain-a process whose viability is demonstrated using network flow theory and a series of simulations. Existing business intelligence infrastructures can be readily modified to support the proposed model, as multidimensional data warehousing has already been adopted in many organizations.", "paper_title": "An interorganizational knowledge-sharing security model with breach propagation detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000250485300003"}
