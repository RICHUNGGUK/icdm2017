In real life manufacturing systems, generation of nonconforming items and unexpected breakdown of production equipment are inevitable. For the purpose of addressing these practical issues, this paper studies a system that may produce defective items randomly and it is also subject to a random equipment failure. A no resumption inventory control policy is adopted when breakdown occurs. Under such a policy, the interrupted lot is aborted and malfunction machine is immediately under repair. A new lot will be started only when all on-hand inventory are depleted. Modeling and numerical analyses are used to establish the solution procedure for such a problem. As a result, the optimal manufacturing run time that minimizes the long-run average production-inventory cost is derived. A numerical example is provided to show how the solution procedure works as well as the usages of research results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
