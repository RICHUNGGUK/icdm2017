The relative reference modeling applies a pair of ring oscillators as relative references and estimates period of the internal ring oscillator. The period estimation is parameterized by a second-order polynomial. Accordingly, the oscillator compensates frequency variations in a frequency division fashion. A 1-20 MHz adjustable oscillator is implemented in a 90-nm CMOS technology with 0.04 mm(2) area. The fabricated chips are robust to variations of supply voltage from 0.9 to 1.1 V and temperature range from 0 degrees C to 75 degrees C. The low supply voltage and the small area make it suitable for low-cost and low-power systems.", "paper_title": "A Low Voltage All-Digital On-Chip Oscillator Using Relative Reference Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518900006"}
