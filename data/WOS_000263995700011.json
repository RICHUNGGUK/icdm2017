The transmission mode for each subcarrier is updated frame-by-frame to match the time-varying channel conditions, in order to take full advantage of the OFDM systems. The proposed cross-layer AMC design is also incorporated with STBC to further improve the system performance. Numerical results have demonstrated that retransmission at the data link layer alleviate rigorous error-control requirements at the physical layer and thereby allows higher data rate transmission. It is shown that this cross-layer design has achieved considerable spectral efficiency gain in comparison with traditional AMC without cross-layer design. Note that increasing the maximum number of retransmissions beyond one has little effect on spectrum efficiency and will cause longer system delay. This suggests that a desirable trade-off between spectral efficiency and delay in the STBC MIMO-OFDM system is achieved by a small number of retransmission. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
