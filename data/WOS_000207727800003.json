Traditional client-server based video streaming solutions incur expensive bandwidth provision cost on the server. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking is a new paradigm to build distributed network applications. Recently, several P2P streaming systems have been deployed to provide live and on-demand video streaming services on the Internet at low server cost. In this paper, we provide a survey on the existing P2P solutions for live and on-demand video streaming. Representative P2P streaming systems, including tree, multi-tree and mesh based systems are introduced. We describe the challenges and solutions of providing live and on-demand video streaming in P2P environment. Open research issues on P2P video streaming are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A survey on peer-to-peer video streaming systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000207727800003"}
