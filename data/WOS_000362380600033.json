In this paper, a new multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on decomposition (MPSO/D) is proposed. Firstly, the objective space of a multi-objective problem is decomposed into a set of sub-regions based on a set of direction vectors. Then MPSO/D makes each sub-region have a solution to maintain the diversity. Secondly, considering the convergence of solutions, MPSO/D uses the crowding distance to calculate the fitness values of the reserved solutions for selection operator, and uses the neighboring particles of a particle to determine the global best historical position (gbest) of the particle. The proposed algorithm has been compared with NSGAII, MOEA/D and NNIA on sixteen test sets. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms NSGAII, MOEA/D and NNIA in terms of convergence and diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
