We also show that independent link evaluation can be used to offset a reduction in the parent link sample space and that these results are better than what can be achieved through link-pair evaluation. These generalizations extend the capabilities of the genetic algorithm to a broader range of manufacturing scenarios.", "paper_title": "An efficient algorithm for placement sequence and feeder assignment problems with multiple placement-nozzles and independent link evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253601900015"}
