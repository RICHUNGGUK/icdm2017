The boundary value problem is reformulated as boundary integral equations of the first kind which is then converted into an equivalent variational problem with constraint. We introduce a Lagrangian multiplier to incorporate the constraint and apply the moving least-squares approximations to generate trial and test functions. In this boundary-type meshless method, boundary conditions can be implemented exactly and system matrices are symmetric. Unlike the domain-type method, this Galerkin scheme requires only a nodal structure on the bounding surface of a body for approximation of boundary unknowns. The convergence and abstract error estimates of this new approach are given. Numerical examples are also presented to show the efficiency of the method.
