A watchman route is represented by a ring of connected neuron weights that evolves in W, while obstacles are considered by approximation of the shortest path. The adaptation procedure considers a coverage of W by the ring in order to attract nodes toward uncovered parts of W. The proposed procedure is experimentally verified in a set of environments and several visibility ranges. Performance of the procedure is compared with the decoupled approach based on solutions of the art gallery problem and the consecutive traveling salesman problem. The experimental results show the suitability of the proposed procedure based on relatively simple supporting geometrical structures, enabling application of the SOM principles to watchman route problems in W.", "paper_title": "Approximate Solution of the Multiple Watchman Routes Problem with Restricted Visibility Range", "paper_id": "WOS:000283369400012"}
