Each classifier is initialized by a face and body couple or by a single face, if no reliable body is detected. Thus, the proposed method builds an ad hoc skin classifier for each person in the image, resulting in a classifier less dependent from changes in skin color due to tan levels, races, genders, and illumination conditions. The experimental results on a heterogeneous data set of labeled images show that our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and that this improvement is statistically significant.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Skin Classification Using Face and Body Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000361685100007"}
