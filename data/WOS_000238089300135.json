This paper focuses on the analysis of the effect of the PCM. The results of simulation show that the PCM can delay the decrease in temperature of the clothing. The experiment results are also shown in this paper. A reasonable agreement was found when comparing the results of the simulation with the experiment results.", "paper_title": "Computer simulation of multi-phase coupled heat and moisture transfer in clothing assembly with a phase change material in a cold environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300135"}
