Unknowns included in the proposed schemes are not only the values of the function but also those of its first and higher derivatives. Derivative terms in the schemes appear only on the upwind side of the stencil. One can calculate all the first derivatives exactly as one solves explicit schemes when the boundary conditions of the problem are non-periodic. When the proposed schemes are applied to periodic problems, only periodic bi-diagonal matrix inversions or periodic block-bi-diagonal matrix inversions are required. Resolution optimization is used to enhance the spectral representation of the first derivative, and this produces a scheme with the highest spectral accuracy among all known compact schemes. For non-periodic boundary conditions, boundary schemes constructed in virtue of the assistant scheme make the schemes not only possess stability for any selective length scale on every point in the computational domain but also satisfy the principle of optimal resolution. Also, an improved shock-capturing method is developed. Finally, both the effectiveness of the new hybrid method and the accuracy of the proposed schemes are verified by executing four benchmark test cases. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
