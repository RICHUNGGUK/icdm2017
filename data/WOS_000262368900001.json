This is an extension of recent work on the bond-free properties of a language. Using a new definition of bond-freeness, we show that we can increase the types of DNA bond shapes which are expressible. This is motivated by the types of bond shapes frequently found in DNA computing. We examine the algebraic properties of sets of DNA trajectories. In particular, we consider rotation of trajectories and weakening of the bonding conditions expressed by a set of DNA trajectories. We also consider decidability results for bond-freeness with respect to our definition.", "paper_title": "Characterizing DNA Bond Shapes Using Trajectories", "paper_id": "WOS:000262368900001"}
