In this paper we consider a simple extension with Booleans, natural numbers and a linear iterator. We show properties of this linear version of Godels's System T and study the class of functions that can be represented. Surprisingly, this linear calculus is extremely expressive: it is as powerful as System T.", "paper_title": "The power of linear functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241587300008"}
