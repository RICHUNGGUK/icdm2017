In this paper, we present a novel method, namely Cube2Video, to support navigating between cubic panoramas in a video-viewing mode. Our method circumvents the intrinsic challenge of cubic panoramas, i.e., the discontinuities between cube faces, in an efficient way. The proposed method extends the matching-triangulation-interpolation procedure with special considerations of the spherical domain. A triangle-to-triangle homography-based warping is developed to achieve physically plausible and visually pleasant interpolation results. The temporal smoothness of the synthesized video sequence is improved by means of a compensation transformation. As experimental results demonstrate, our method can synthesize pleasant video sequences in real time, thus mimicking walking or driving navigation.", "paper_title": "Cube2Video: Navigate Between Cubic Panoramas in Real-Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000327393900003"}
