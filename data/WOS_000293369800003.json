The paper focuses on the study of VLSI implementation of fuzzy logic hardware to result in small silicon area, high speed of operation and adaptability to different application domains. This paper reviews the circuit and architecture level designing of various components of the fuzzy processors, such as, fuzzifiers, defuzzifiers, inference and rule base. A comparative analysis of the performance of these components has been performed. It is observed that there is a scope for further improvement in terms of power consumption, speed of operation, area and redundancy in these fuzzy processors. Further, from the study it is seen that the design emphasis should be more on inference engine performance and defuzzification units, because of the complexity of computations handled by them. The optimization in these units results in a significant improvement in the overall performance of the system.", "paper_title": "VLSI Architecture of Fuzzy Logic Hardware Implementation: a Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000293369800003"}
