While the frequency-division duplexing (FDD) and time-division duplexing (TDD) are widely used in 4G mobile wireless networks, they have their inherent deficiencies of low spectrum efficiency because FDD and TDD are both based on the half-duplex transmission mode. To overcome these problems existing in 4G systems, in this article we propose novel wireless full-duplex transmission schemes in both the PHY and MAC layers for 5G mobile wireless networks to significantly increase the spectrum efficiency. In particular, we first develop the wireless full-duplex model for both bidirectional transmission and unidirectional transmission, respectively, taking into account self-interference mitigation. Then we analyze the traditional half-duplex FDD and TDD modes and show the superiority of the wireless full-duplex mode over the half-duplex FDD and TDD modes, respectively. Using our developed wireless full-duplex model, we develop and evaluate the efficient full-duplex power allocation scheme at the PHY layer. Corresponding to full-duplex transmission at the PHY layer, we also develop and analyze the full-duplex MAC protocol at the MAC layer to implement full-duplex transmission over the entire 5G mobile wireless network architecture. Through simulation experiments we show that our proposed schemes can significantly enhance spectrum efficiency for 5G mobile wireless networks.", "paper_title": "FULL-DUPLEX TRANSMISSION IN PHY AND MAC LAYERS FOR 5G MOBILE WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000364231500015"}
