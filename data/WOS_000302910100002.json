To produce good adaptive meshes, the a posteriori error estimates are discussed. The equivalent residual-type a posteriori error estimators of the H1-error of state and L2-error of control are given, which are suitable to carry out the adaptive multi-mesh finite element approximation. Some numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the efficiency of the a posteriori estimators.
