However, crowdsourcing is most often seen as the best option for tasks that do not require more of people than their uneducated intuition as a human being. This article describes our methods for identifying workers for crowdsourced tasks that are difficult for both machines and humans. It discusses the challenges we encountered in qualifying annotators and the steps we took to select the individuals most likely to do well at these tasks.", "paper_title": "Creating Experts From the Crowd: Techniques for Finding Workers for Difficult Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344720300023"}
