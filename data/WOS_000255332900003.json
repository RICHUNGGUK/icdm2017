In the considered process, the wastewater is treated in order to obtain an effluent having the substrate concentration within the standard limits established by law (below 20 mg/l). This goal is achieved by controlling the concentration of dissolved oxygen to a certain value. The predictive controller uses a neural network as internal model of the process and alters the dilution rate in order to fulfill the control objective. This control strategy offers various possibilities for the control law adjustment by means of the following parameters: the prediction horizon, the control horizon, the weights of the error and the command. The predictive control structure has been tested in three functioning regimes, considered essential due to the frequency of their occurrence in current practice.", "paper_title": "Predictive control of a wastewater treatment process", "paper_id": "WOS:000255332900003"}
