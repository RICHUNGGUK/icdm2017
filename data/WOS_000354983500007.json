Traditional algorithms and strategies don't apply to controlling the expanded network. Immunization algorithms originated from the complex system theory are feasible for large-scale systems based on a scale-free network model. This paper proposes the immunization strategy for complex systems which includes random and targeted immunizations to solve energy consumption issues and uses traffic to judge the energy savings from the node immunization. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, this paper provides a possibility for saving energy with optical transmission networks.", "paper_title": "Energy-saving Strategy Based on an Immunization Algorithm for Network Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000354983500007"}
