A three-dimensional capsule shaped tablet is studied using a Drucker-Prager cap constitutive model and a coupled thermomechanical analysis. Predictions of the model for the internal distribution of porosity and temperature are found to be in agreement with X-ray microtomography measurements of relative density and infrared camera measurements of surface temperatures of the ejected tablet. The fact that the model is calibrated using data from a cylindrical flat-faced tablet which can predict the compaction of a completely different shape proves the capability offered by finite element analysis In addition, this method demonstrates the role it can play in the optimization of tableting operations in the spirit of quality by design principles.
