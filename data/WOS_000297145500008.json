Fault-handling methods not requiring modification of the FPGA device architecture or user intervention to recover from faults are examined and evaluated against overhead-based and sustainability-based performance metrics such as additional resource requirements, throughput reduction, fault capacity, and fault coverage. This classification alongside these performance metrics forms a standard for confident comparisons.", "paper_title": "Progress in Autonomous Fault Recovery of Field Programmable Gate Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000297145500008"}
