The proposed FEID is composed of three steps: (1) region classification by a gradient-based region selection approach, (2) pre-interpolation by a 6-tap fixed coefficient Wiener filter, (3) data fusion by the linear minimum mean square-error estimation (LMMSE) technique. Specifically, three directional neighboring pixel sets are defined in three directions (45A degrees, 90A degrees, and 135A degrees) for every missing pixel. And each set produces an estimate of the pixel to be interpolated with a Wiener filter. With the information that gathered from the three directional neighboring pixel sets, a more robust estimate is obtained by fusing these directional estimates with the LMMSE technique. For fast implementation, we propose a gradient-based region selection approach that classifies a local region into two different classes, Region 1 and Region 2. The LMMSE-based data fusion method is used in Region 1; a fast deinterlacing algorithm is used in Region 2 to reduce the computational complexity. Compared with existing deinterlacing methods, the proposed method FEID improves the visual quality of the interpolated edges while maintaining a higher peak signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) level.", "paper_title": "Fusion-based edge-sensitive interpolation method for deinterlacing", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200011"}
