In order to comply with clock frequency and long term jitter specifications under severe supply noise, the power supply of the DCO is regulated by a low drop-out (LDO) regulator. The reference voltage for the LDO is generated by the bandgap reference generator with two bandgap cores to improve supply rejection. The proposed clock generating system implemented in a 130 nm CMOS process shows +/- 2.5 ns jitter under +/- 400 mV supply noise", "paper_title": "A Clock Generating System for USB 2.0 with a High-PSR Bandgap Reference Generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000303243700008"}
