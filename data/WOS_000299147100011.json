Imote2 is an advanced WSN platform, which supports Linux operating system. However, building Linux on Imote2 is not trivial. In this paper, we introduce a general approach in detail, including installing bootloader, communication between Imote2 and host PC, as well as loading kernel and file system. After it, some fundamental configurations on Imote2 and host PC are presented. We further provide test method by sending and receiving radio on Imote2. More development on Imote2 with Linux can benefit from our approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
