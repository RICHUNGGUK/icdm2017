The risk attitudes of the decision makers are also defined. Examples have been given to show the validity of this score function. Meanwhile, the definition of the intuitionistic normal fuzzy number and their operational laws and intuitionistic normal fuzzy weighted arithmetic averaging operator are proposed. As for the intuitionistic normal fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems in which criteria weights remain fixed and the criteria values of alternatives are in the form of intuitionistic normal fuzzy numbers. An intuitionistic normal fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach based on the relative score function is proposed. Finally, an example is provided to show the feasibility and validity of the approach.", "paper_title": "A score function based on relative entropy and its application in intuitionistic normal fuzzy multiple criteria decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000321326100006"}
