Based on geometries such as a plane or space, the proposed schemes can be used to fulfill the various requirements for security and achieve more efficient results. They allow a user to register with many servers once without remembering different passwords for each, and also allow a user to change the password freely and update it offline. In addition, the proposed schemes do not need to maintain a verification table and are also computationally efficient. Moreover, we propose a specific access right (AR) to verify the legitimate user who has different authorization levels on a server in a multi-server environment.", "paper_title": "Efficient password authentication schemes based on a geometric approach for a multi-server environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000285525700007"}
