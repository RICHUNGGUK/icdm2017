Two measures are presented for verification of projective reconstructions with each other. These measures are based on the equality of ratios between the x-, y- and z-coordinates of 3D reconstructed points which are obtained from the same corresponding points. This information is used for measuring the relative consistency of projective reconstructions obtained from the same image pair.", "paper_title": "Relative consistency of projective reconstructions obtained from the same image pair", "paper_id": "WOS:000240665500003"}
