In this type of classification, other criteria in addition to the criterion of annual dollar usage are taken into account, and then items, based on their priority, are divided into 3 classes with different ordering policies (OPs). In this paper, multiple criteria ABC inventory classification is first performed using the Hadi-Vencheh model (2010). Then suitable OPs are determined for items of classes A and C and Finally, we apply the Zafiropoulos and Dialynas (2005) approach to extract fuzzy rules from the policies of these two classes for determining the policies of items class B. To show applicability of the proposed model, it is then implemented in a soft-drink manufacturing factory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
