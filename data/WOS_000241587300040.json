Its type system is an annotated subsystem of Hofmann's polytime LFPL. To guide the design of the programming language and to enable the proof Of LOGSPACE-soundness, we introduce a realisability model over a variant of the Geometry of Interaction. This realisability model, which takes inspiration from Moller-Neergaard and Mairson's work on BC(epsilon)(-), provides a general framework for modelling space-restricted computation.", "paper_title": "Space-efficient computation by interaction - A type system for logarithmic space", "paper_id": "WOS:000241587300040"}
