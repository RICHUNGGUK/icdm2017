That is, all of the elements not in DB are represented, and DB itself is not explicitly stored. This method of representing data has certain properties that are relevant for privacy enhancing applications. The paper reviews the negative database (NDB) representation scheme for storing a negative image compactly, and proposes using a collection of NDBs to represent a single DB, that is, one NDB is assigned for each record in DB. This method has the advantage of producing negative databases that are hard to reverse in practice, i.e., from which it is hard to obtain DB. This result is obtained by adapting a technique for generating hard-to-solve 3-SAT formulas. Finally we suggest potential avenues of application.", "paper_title": "Protecting data privacy through hard-to-reverse negative databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000251612900005"}
