This problem has been studied extensively in many areas. Especially, for the case when , this problem is known as the minimization problem and has found its applications in variable selection problems and sparse least squares fitting for high dimensional data. Theoretical results show that the minimizers of the - problem have various attractive features due to the concavity and non-Lipschitzian property of the regularization function . In this paper, we show that the - minimization problem is strongly NP-hard for any and , including its smoothed version. On the other hand, we show that, by choosing parameters carefully, a minimizer, global or local, will have certain desired sparsity. We believe that these results provide new theoretical insights to the studies and applications of the concave regularized optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Complexity of unconstrained minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000330038300014"}
