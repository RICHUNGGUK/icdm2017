The feature extraction methods used in this work include three representative ways of extracting information from EEG signals: Hjorth features, wavelet transformation and symbolic representation. Feature selection was then used to evaluate the relevance of individual features from this set of methods. Stacked sequential learning uses a second-layer classifier to improve the classification by using previous and posterior first-layer predicted stages as additional features providing information to the model. Results show that both approaches enhance the sleep stage classification accuracy rate, thus leading to a closer approximation to the experts' opinion.", "paper_title": "COMBINATION OF HETEROGENEOUS EEG FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS AND STACKED SEQUENTIAL LEARNING FOR SLEEP STAGE CLASSIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000318523500005"}
