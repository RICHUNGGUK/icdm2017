Researchers and developers seeking to refine simulation tools or develop new ones would benefit greatly from being able to compare their simulation results. Summary: We present an approach to compare simulation results between several SBML capable simulators and provide a website for the community to share simulation results.", "paper_title": "Comparing simulation results of SBML capable simulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000258860700025"}
