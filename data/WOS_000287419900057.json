In this research systematic approach has been used for organization and production system inputs which named as 7Ms (Management, Manpower, Marketing, Method, Machine, Material, and Money). Linguistic values are used to assess the ratings and weights for 7Ms. These linguistic ratings can be expressed in trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, a hierarchy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on fuzzy-sets theory including FAHP and FTOPSIS are applied. The results obtained from AHP, FAHP; FTOPSIS were compared with each other. This research has been conducted on a manufacturing plant however the results can also be used for other types of organizations that are located in a competitive environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
