It has a similar structure and behavior to weak sound priority workflow nets. It is shown that all recursive functions are PN computable and, vice-versa, PN computable functions are recursive. This shows that the PN computers we have proposed have exactly the power of Turing machines. Complexity classes of PN computable functions are defined, and the relationship between them and similar complexity classes defined by counter machines is investigated. Finally, the close relationship between PN computers and weak sound (priority) workflow nets is investigated.", "paper_title": "Petri Net Computers and Workflow Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000350145900011"}
