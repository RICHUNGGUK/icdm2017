Distributed architectures can provide scalability to crowd simulations, but they require the use of efficient partitioning methods. Although convex hulls have been shown as very efficient structures for crowd partitioning, providing efficient workload balancing to large scale simulations is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose the integration of a workload balancing technique for crowd simulations within a partitioning method based on convex hulls. The region-based balancing technique reassigns agents to servers using a criterion of distance. The performance evaluation results show that this technique ensures the saturation avoidance of the servers in an homogeneous distributed system. This feature can increase the scalability of crowd simulations.", "paper_title": "Workload balancing in distributed crowd simulations: the partitioning method", "paper_id": "WOS:000296012700015"}
