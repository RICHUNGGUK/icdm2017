While a number of empirical models are employed operationally around the world, the effects of negative slopes on fire spread are ignored in all but one prediction system which may result in incorrect predictions. The general observation that large fires burning for some time over undulating topography can be approximated by assuming fire spread over flat ground is used to construct a quasi-empirical model framework for downslope rate of spread correction called kataburn. Kataburn is formulated for two alternative interpretations of slope spread-planar and linear-and can be applied to any empirical upslope spread correction model. Versions of kataburn derived using such models from Australia, the US and Canada are compared against experimental downslope data from the literature and found to better represent downslope spread than the existing operational downslope function.
