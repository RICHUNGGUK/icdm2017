It further examines if reviews are cited more frequently than are \"normal\" articles. All research questions are answered affirmatively: The absolute as well as the relative numbers of reviews in these three subfields are indeed increasing. In addition, reviews in these fields are cited more frequently than are normal articles: about 70% more often than are \"normal\" articles in Infectious Diseases and Oncology and about 50% more often in Tropical Medicine. The article discusses possible reasons for this increase and concludes that medical journals should strive to achieve an optimal balance between review papers and original articles.", "paper_title": "Increase in Numbers and Proportions of Review Articles in Tropical Medicine, Infectious Diseases, and Oncology", "paper_id": "WOS:000335580800016"}
