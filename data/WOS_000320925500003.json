By introducing a smoothing parameter, we formulate a sequence of KKT (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) systems of this problem and then transform it into a system of constrained nonlinear equations. Then, the first- and second-order gradients formulae of the cost functional and the constraints are derived. On this basis, a smoothing projected Newton-type algorithm is developed to solving this system of nonlinear equations. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, some numerical results are solved and presented.", "paper_title": "A smoothing approach for the optimal parameter selection problem with continuous inequality constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000320925500003"}
