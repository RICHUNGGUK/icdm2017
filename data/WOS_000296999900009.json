The mixed-hybrid method gives a simultaneous approximation to bending/twisting moments and deflection fields in the interior of each triangle and traces of displacement field and its normal derivative on sides of each triangle. Efficient parallel implementation procedures have been developed and the results of numerical experiments with time, speed-up comparisons on some aniso-/ortho-/isotropic plates of practical and research interest are given.
