In the transmitter, the size of the read-only memory that stores CSS signal samples for the chirp modulator is reduced by removing duplicate samples among subchirps. In the receiver, a matched filter is utilized to remove the other band noise caused by the band hopping property of CSS. A robust time synchronizer and chirp demodulator based on the matched filter are proposed. Low complexity architectures of the matched filter and biorthogonal decoder are also proposed. All of the proposed architectures are implemented in the field-programmable gate array chip and verified.", "paper_title": "Chirp Spread Spectrum Transceiver Design and Implementation for Real Time Locating System", "paper_id": "WOS:000360169000001"}
