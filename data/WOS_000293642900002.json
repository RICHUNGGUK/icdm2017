Instead of traditional mesh oriented methods such as finite element method (FEM) or finite difference method (FDM), this method requires only a scattered set of nodes in the domain. For this scheme, error estimates and stability analysis are studied. L(2) and L(infinity) error norms between the results and exact solution is used as a performance measure. Moreover the results of numerical experiments are presented, and are compared with the findings of Finite Element method, finite difference Crank-Nicolson (CN) scheme and analytical solution to confirm the good accuracy of the presented scheme.", "paper_title": "A meshless method for numerical solution of the coupled Schrodinger-KdV equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000293642900002"}
