In this paper, a hybrid two-stage voltage regulation scheme is proposed, where the first stage consists of a switching voltage regulator located off-chip, and the second stage consists of a tree structure of linear regulators located on the chip. This approach proves to be efficient, simple and less costly compared to other options that offer total on-chip integration of a switching regulators. The difficulties and limitations of on-chip switching regulator have been analyzed. For the tree structure of on-chip linear regulators two different architectures (cascaded and parallel) have been proposed. It is demonstrated that a cascaded tree of linear regulators is a better solution than a parallel tree structure from performance point of view.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Scheme for On-Chip Voltage Regulation in System-On-a-Chip (SOC)", "paper_id": "WOS:000294869500002"}
