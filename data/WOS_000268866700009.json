In this paper, we extend the LBP-TOP features to multi-resolution spatiotemporal space and use them for describing facial expressions. AdaBoost is utilized to learn the principal appearance and motion, for selecting the most important expression-related features for all the classes, or between every pair of expressions. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is applied to the selected features for final recognition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
