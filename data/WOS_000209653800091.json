The resulting proteomic profile can be used for early detection, diagnosis, and therapy planning. In this paper, we study the classification of a proteomic sample from the point of view of an inverse problem with a joint Bayesian solution, called inversion-classification. We propose a hierarchical physical forward model and present encouraging results from both simulation and clinical data.", "paper_title": "Classification of Proteomic MS Data as Bayesian Solution of an Inverse Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800091"}
