Due to their innovation, these worms are hard to be stopped by traditional security mechanisms. Therefore, instead of trying to prevent the intrusion of every such a thread, this paper proposes a new system architecture, named Virtual Machine based Intrusion Tolerance Network (VMITN), which will tolerate the new worm attack until administrators remove the Vulnerability lever-aged by the worm. The VMITN adopts a rough-set based recognition mechanism to detect zero day worms and a virtual machine based overlay network to mitigate attacks. We have implemented a concept proof prototype system and use NS-2 simulations to study the performance of the VMITN in a large scale network. The behavior of the famous Witty worm is simulated within the NS-2 module and the simulations result showed that our VMITN architecture can provide the reliability and survivability under severe worm attacks.
