So, in this paper, we want that the parameter K has little influence on the dimension reduction, that is to say, the parameter K can be widely chosen while not influence the effect of dimension reduction. Therefore, we propose a method of improved LLE, which uses new distance computing for weight of K nearest-neighbors points in LLE. Thus, even when the number K is little, the improved LLE can get good results of dimension reduction, while the traditional LLE needs a larger number of K to get the same results. When the number K of the nearest neighbors gets larger, test in this paper has proved that the improved LLE can still get correct results.", "paper_title": "Improved locally linear embedding through new distance computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000197"}
