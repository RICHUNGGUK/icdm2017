The scope of this review omits the fluid modelling aspect while focusing on other key components in the RBC-plasma model such as (1) describing the RBC deformation with shell-based and spring-based RBC models, (2) constitutive models for RBC aggregation based on bridging theory and depletion theory and (3) additional strategies required for completing the RBC-plasma flow model. These include topics such as modelling fluid-structure interaction with the immersed boundary method and boundary integral method, and updating the variations in multiphase fluid property through the employment of index field methods. Lastly, we summarily discuss the current state and aims of RBC modelling and suggest some research directions for the further development of this field of modelling.", "paper_title": "A review of numerical methods for red blood cell flow simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000343606800004"}
