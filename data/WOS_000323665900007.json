In this paper, we propose an interaction based requirements monitoring approach for Internetware. Firstly the Internetware requirements are transformed into an environment based Internetware specification in terms of expected interactions between the Internetware system and its environment. Then we monitor the running Internetware system, collect the Internetware system behaviors in terms of actual interactions between the Internetware system and its environment, and compare the Internetware system behaviors with its specification. Finally a monitoring report is given. As environment change is more predictable than requirement change, our approach could handle environment changes and Internetware system evolution by updating its environment. A framework of the interaction based requirements monitoring is presented. Furthermore, a corresponding monitor is designed. At last, a case study is carried on to illustrate the feasibility of our approach.", "paper_title": "Requirements monitoring for Internetware: an interaction based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000323665900007"}
