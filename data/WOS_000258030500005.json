In this paper, we consider the denoising of texture images using a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation and directional wavelet frames. In our model, a curvelet shrinkage is used for regularization of the diffusion process to preserve important features in the diffusion smoothing and a wave atom shrinkage is used as the reaction in order to preserve and enhance interesting oriented textures. We derive a digital reaction-diffusion filter that lives on graphs and show convergence of the corresponding iteration process. Experimental results and comparisons show very good performance of the proposed model for texture-preserving denoising.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear regularized reaction-diffusion filters for denoising of images with textures", "paper_id": "WOS:000258030500005"}
