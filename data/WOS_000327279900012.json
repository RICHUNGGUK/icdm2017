Different from widely used AGV-ACT systems, the ACT system studied in this paper uses three types of handling machines, which collaborate to transport containers. This study decomposes the container flow in the new ACT system into three queuing sub-networks. Then an iterative method is developed to analyze the operational efficiency of the ACT system. We analyze its transport efficiency by comparing with the widely used AGV-based systems. This study tries to help port operators better understand the relative merits of this new design and decide whether it is applicable in their terminals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
