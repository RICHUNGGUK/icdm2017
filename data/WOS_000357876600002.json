Although it may seem that the web of data is inherently multilingual, data usually contain labels, comments, descriptions, etc. that depend on the natural language used. When linked data appears in a multilingual setting, it is a challenge to publish and consume it. This paper presents a survey of patterns to publish Multilingual Linked Data and identifies some issues that should be taken into account. As a use case, the paper describes the patterns employed in the DBpedia Internationalization project.", "paper_title": "Multilingual linked data patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000357876600002"}
