Data were collected from the nursing records of 56 stroke patients in one unit, and intervention statements were mapped into NIC and ICNP. Of 147 unique nursing intervention statements extracted, 136 (92.52%) could be mapped into NIC and 99 (67.35%) statements could be completely mapped into ICNP. Using mapping methodology, this study validates that both NIC and ICNP would be useful for documenting nursing care in a Korean hospital, but it also identifies additional concepts that need to be represented in both of these standardized nursing languages. It is recommended that nurses be more careful in documenting their interventions and also that SNLs be developed further to more completely represent nursing practice.", "paper_title": "Mapping of nursing records into the NEC and the ICNP in a Korean oriental-medicine hospital", "paper_id": "WOS:000242190000005"}
