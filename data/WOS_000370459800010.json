A large number of approaches exist in the literature, most of which are based on statistical and machine learning techniques. For protecting the user privacy, the majority of the existing methods rely on discriminative traffic attributes at the network and transport layers, such as interaction schemes, packet sizes and inter arrival times. In this work, we propose a novel blind, quintuple centric approach by exploring traffic attributes at the application level without inspecting the payloads. The identification model is based on the analysis of the first application-layer messages in a flow (quintuple), based on their sizes, directions and positions in the flow. The underlying idea is that the first messages of a flow usually carry some application level signaling and data transfer units (command, request, response, etc.) that can be discriminative through their patterns of size and direction. A Gaussian mixture model is proposed to characterize the applications, based on a study of the common characteristics of application-level protocols. The blind classifier is based on Markov models with low complexity and reasonable computational requirements, where the training procedure consists of profiling the target applications separately. Promising results were obtained for some popular protocols including many peer-to-peer applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
