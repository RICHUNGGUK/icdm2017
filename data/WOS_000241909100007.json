To confirm address uniqueness in a new domain, mobile nodes must run duplicate address detection (DAD), which is a time-consuming process. The Proactive DAD approach uses topology information and layer-2 signals to predict the new network domains prior to or in parallel with layer-3 hand offs. Experimental results show that P-DAD can significantly reduce both hand-off latency and packet loss.", "paper_title": "Proactive DAD: A fast address-acquisition strategy for mobile IPv6 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241909100007"}
