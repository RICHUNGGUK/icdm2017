A practical phenomenon of nonsynchronous jumps between RNNs modes and desired mode-dependent filters is considered, and a nonstationary mode transition among the filters is used to model the nonsynchronous jumps to different degrees that are also mode dependent. The RONs are used to model a class of sector-like nonlinearities that occur in a probabilistic way according to a Bernoulli sequence. The time-varying delays are supposed to be mode dependent and unknown, but with known lower and upper bounds a priori. Sufficient conditions on the existence of the nonsynchronous filters are obtained such that the filtering error system is stochastically stable and achieves a prescribed energy-to-peak performance index. Further to the recent study on the class of nonsynchronous estimation problem, a monotonicity is observed in obtaining filtering performance index, while changing the degree of nonsynchronous jumps. A numerical example is presented to verify the theoretical findings.", "paper_title": "Energy-to-Peak State Estimation for Markov Jump RNNs With Time-Varying Delays via Nonsynchronous Filter With Nonstationary Mode Transitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000362358800011"}
