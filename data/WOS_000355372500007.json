The multi-type perturbation mechanism in ILS-MP probabilistically combines three types of perturbation strategies, namely tabu-based perturbation, construction-based perturbation, and random perturbation. Despite its simplicity, experimental results on a wide set of commonly used benchmark instances show that ILS-MP performs favourably in comparison with the current best approaches in the literature.
