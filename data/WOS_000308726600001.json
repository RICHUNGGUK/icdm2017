While such a progress variable is well defined for one-step reaction kinetics, this is typically not the case for complex chemical mechanisms. Consequently, several expressions for a progress variable have been utilized. In this paper a formal method for the generation of a reaction progress variable is proposed that is optimal with respect to a set of constraints. The potential of the method is demonstrated in applications to partially premixed and diffusion flames, and the extension to premixed combustion is discussed. It is shown that the proposed method can lead to significant improvements in the definition of an optimal progress variable over conventional formulations, essentially eliminating the expert knowledge previously required in identifying such quantities.
