The result is established symbolically, capitalizing on the complete axiomatization of the product of matrix logics provided by their meet-combination. Along the way preservation of the metatheorem of deduction is also proved. The computation of the interpolant in the resulting logic is proved to be polynomially reducible to the computation of the interpolants in the two given logics. Illustrations are provided for classical, intuitionistic and modal propositional logics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
