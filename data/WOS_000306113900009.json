First, some existence conditions of this type of observers are given. Then, a parametric design approach is proposed for proportional multiple-integral observers. Based on a general parametric solution to the generalised Sylvester-observer matrix equation, parameterisations for all the observer gains are given in terms of four parameter matrices. The proposed approach can offer all the degrees of design freedom and has great potential in applications. A numerical example is given to show the design procedure and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Proportional multiple-integral observer design for discrete-time descriptor linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000306113900009"}
