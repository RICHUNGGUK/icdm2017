We study the almost-sure model-checking problem for this model, that is, given a stochastic timed automaton A and a property phi, we want to decide whether A satisfies phi with probability 1. In this paper, we identify several classes of automata and of properties for which this can be decided. The proof relies on the construction of a finite abstraction, called the thick graph, that we interpret as a finite Markov chain, and for which we can decide the almost-sure model-checking problem. Correctness of the abstraction holds when automata are almost-surely fair, which we show, is the case for two large classes of systems, singleclock automata and so-called weak-reactive automata. Techniques employed in this article gather tools from real-time verification and probabilistic verification, as well as topological games played on timed automata.", "paper_title": "STOCHASTIC TIMED AUTOMATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000350399900013"}
