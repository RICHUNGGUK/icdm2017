We present a system called city kernel, designed to handle several subsystems, each addressing a specific sensor network and we describe an infrastructure for wide traffic control via a vision sensor network. This infrastructure consists of a network of smart cameras operating over an outdoor public lighting thanks to power line communication technology and equipped with a vehicle counting and classification algorithm. We discuss the deployment of this network on the city kernel and some related services exposed to urban actors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
