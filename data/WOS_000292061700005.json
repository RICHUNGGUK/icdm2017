His work mainly explored the development and application of Bayesian techniques to model clinical, public health, and bioinformatics questions. His contributions have led to improvements in our ability to model behavior that evolves in time, to explore systematic relationships among large sets of covariates, and to tease out the meaning of data on the role of genetic variation in the genesis of important diseases.", "paper_title": "Marco Ramoni: an appreciation of academic achievement", "paper_id": "WOS:000292061700005"}
