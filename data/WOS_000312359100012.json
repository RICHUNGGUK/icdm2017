A recursive algorithm to obtain a suboptimum predictor for WL ARMA systems is first given. Then this algorithm is used to develop another recursive algorithm which performs WL prediction for transfer function models. The suggested solutions become an alternative to the WL prediction based on a finite number of observations provided the size of the time series is sufficiently large. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
