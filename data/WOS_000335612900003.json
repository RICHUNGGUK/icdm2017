Barrier coverage, which requires much fewer sensors than full coverage, is broadly known as an appropriate model of coverage for such an application. However, previous works all focus on providing 1D barrier coverage on a thin belt region based on global network information. In this paper, we introduce the concept of 2D k-barrier, and investigate establishing 2D barriers on a square region only with sensors' local neighbor information. To provide 2D k-barrier coverage in the field, a distributed scheme is proposed. The scheme targets on providing low detection delay and low energy consumption. The barriers constructed in both horizontal and vertical directions guarantee the detection of any intruder whose crossing path can be in any of the two directions. Extensive performance evaluation based on NS2 simulator shows that the proposed scheme outperforms existing mechanism in terms of both detection delay and energy consumption. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
