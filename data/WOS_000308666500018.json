The controller is structurally simple and can be applied to a class of control systems that their control requires manipulation of two input variables. The benchmark problem of inverted pendulum is such example that its control requires availability of the angle as well as the displacement. We demonstrate that the lateral control of autonomous vehicles belongs to this class of systems and successfully apply the proposed controller to this problem. The parameters of the controller are encoded into real value chromosomes for genetic algorithm (GA) optimization. The neural network controller contains three neurons and six connection weights implying a small search space implying faster optimization time due to few controller parameters. The controller is also tested on two benchmark control problems of inverted pendulum and the ball-and-beam system. In particular, we apply the controller to lateral control of a prototype semi-autonomous vehicle. Simulation results suggest a good performance for all the tested systems. To demonstrate the robustness of the controller, we conduct Monte-Carlo evaluations when the system is subjected to random parameter uncertainty. Finally experimental studies on the lateral control of a prototype autonomous vehicle with different speed of operation are included. The simulation and experimental studies suggest the feasibility of this controller for numerous applications. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
