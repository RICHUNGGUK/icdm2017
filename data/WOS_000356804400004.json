It is a further development of the enhanced axisymmetric lattice Boltzmann method (AxLAB (R)). The turbulent flow is efficiently and naturally simulated through incorporation of the standard subgrid-scale (SGS) stress model into the axisymmetric lattice Boltzmann equation in a consistent manner with the lattice gas dynamics. The model is verified by applying it to three typical cases in engineering: (i) pipe flow through an abrupt axisymmetric constriction, (ii) axisymmetric separated and reattached flow and (iii) pulsatile flows in a stenotic vessel. The numerical results obtained using the present method are compared with experimental data and other available numerical solutions, indicating good agreements. The model is simple and is able to predict axisymmetric turbulent flows at good accuracy.", "paper_title": "Lattice Boltzmann method for axisymmetric turbulent flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000356804400004"}
