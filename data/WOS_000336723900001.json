In this work, we present the minimum and maximum values of the harmonic index for connected graphs with girth at least k (k >= 3), and characterize the corresponding extremal graphs. Using this result, we obtain several relations between the harmonic index and the girth of a graph.", "paper_title": "On The Harmonic Index and The Girth for Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000336723900001"}
