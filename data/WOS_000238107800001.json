The value-based process framework integrates the four component theories - dependency, utility, decision, and control, to the central theory W, and orients itself as a 7-step process guide to practice value-based software engineering. We also illustrate applying the process framework to a supply chain organization through a case study analysis.", "paper_title": "Value-based software process framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107800001"}
