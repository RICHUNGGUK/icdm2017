This is therefore a significant issue in the context of ensuring communication security over insecure channels. In this paper, we prove that there are no polynomial-size quantum circuits that can compute all Boolean functions (of which there are 2(2n) cases) in the standard quantum oracle model. Based on this, we propose the notion of data complexity under a quantum environment and suggest that it can be used as a condition for post-quantum computation. It is generally believed that NP-complete problems cannot be solved in polynomial time even with quantum computers. Therefore, a public key cryptosystem and signature scheme based on the difficulty of NP-complete problems and the notion of data complexity are presented here. Finally, we analyze the security of the proposed encryption and signature schemes.", "paper_title": "A public key cryptosystem based on data complexity under quantum environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000365129500007"}
