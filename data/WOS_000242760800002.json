This lack of information results from both the scanning process and the object complexity. The consequences are simply not acceptable in many application domains (e.g. visualization, finite element analysis or STL prototyping). This paper addresses the way these holes can be filled in while minimizing the curvature variation between the surrounding and inserted meshes. The curvature variation is simulated by the variation between external forces applied to the nodes of a linear mechanical model coupled to the meshes. The functional to be minimized is quadratic and a set of geometric constraints can be added to further shape the inserted mesh. In addition, a complete cleaning toolbox is proposed to remove degenerated and badly oriented triangles resulting from the scanning process. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
