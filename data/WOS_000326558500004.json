In this paper, two topology-aware multicast routing algorithms, Multicasting XYZ (MXYZ) and Alternative XYZ (AL + XYZ) algorithms in supporting of 3-D NoC are proposed. In essence, MXYZ is a simple dimension order multicast routing algorithm that targets 3-D NoC systems built upon regular topologies. To support multicast routing in irregular regions, AL + XYZ can be applied, where an alternative output channel is sought to forward/replicate the packets whenever the output channel determined by MXYZ is not available. To evaluate the performance of MXYZ and AL + XYZ, extensive experiments have been conducted by comparing MXYZ and AL + XYZ against a path-based multicast routing algorithm and an irregular region oriented multiple unicast routing algorithm, respectively. The experimental results confirm that the proposed MXYZ and AL + XYZ schemes, respectively, have lower latency and power consumption than the other two routing algorithms, meriting the two proposed algorithms to be more suitable for supporting multicasting in 3-D NoC systems. In addition, the hardware implementation cost of AL + XYZ is shown to be quite modest. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
