Numerical results are compared with experimental measurements obtained at ONERA to evaluate the performances of LES in this industrial context. The combination of complex geometries requiring unstructured meshes and high Reynolds number does not allow the resolution of boundary layers so that wall models must be employed. In this framework, the relative influence of subgrid-scale modelling and conjugate heat transfer in LESs of aerothermal flows is evaluated. After a general overview of the transverse jet simulation results, a LES coupled with a heat transfer solver in the walls is used to show that thermal boundary conditions at the wall have more influence on the results than subgrid scale models. Coupling fluid flow and heat transfer in solids simulations is the only method to specify their respective thermal boundary conditions.
