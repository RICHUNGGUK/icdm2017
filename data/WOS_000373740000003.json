We show that SSK can operate effectively in LOS conditions provided that the antennas are properly placed at TX and RX such that a high-rank LOS-MIMO channel is constructed. The operating conditions for LOS-SSK with parallel uniform linear arrays are established and two schemes, namely orthogonal SSK and bi-orthogonal SSK, are introduced. The bit error probabilities for both methods are derived and given in closed form. It is shown that LOS-SSK (more generally LOS-SM) is a promising technique and might especially be attractive in millimeter-wave communications which, due to its high frequency and small wavelength, inherently prefers LOS transmission and also enables packing of a large number of antennas in terminals.", "paper_title": "Space Shift Keying for LOS Communication at mmWave Frequencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000373740000003"}
