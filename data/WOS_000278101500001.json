In this paper, we study some basic properties of the regularization parameter in the AA model. We develop a method for automatically choosing the regularization parameter in the multiplicative noise removal process. In particular, we employ spatially varying regularization parameters in the AA model in order to restore more texture details of the denoised image. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that the spatially varying regularization parameters method can obtain better denoised images than the other tested multiplicative noise removal methods.", "paper_title": "Multiplicative Noise Removal with Spatially Varying Regularization Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101500001"}
