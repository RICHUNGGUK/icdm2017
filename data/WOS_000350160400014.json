It represents the scenario where the adversary may have correlated side information, e.g., a partial finger print or a DNA sequence of a relative of the legitimate user. We find the optimal exponent of the deception probability by proving both the achievability and the converse. Our proofs are based on a connection between the problem of deception with side information and the rate distortion problem with side information at both the encoder and the decoder.", "paper_title": "Deception With Side Information in Biometric Authentication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000350160400014"}
