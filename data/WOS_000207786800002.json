Three studies were conducted in which paired visitors' social interactions were video- and audio-recorded for analysis. Using conversation analysis, the data from the use of prototype 1 and prototype 2 were compared. It was found that audio delivery methods were consequential to the ways in which visitors structurally organized their social activity. Further, the availability of structural opportunities for social interaction between visitors has implications for the ways in which the learning process occurs in museum settings.", "paper_title": "Sotto Voce: Facilitating Social Learning in a Historic House", "paper_id": "WOS:000207786800002"}
