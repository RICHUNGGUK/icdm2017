This result demonstrates that low-cost commercially-available plasma-wave transistors whose cut-off frequency is far below THz frequencies can be employed in THz communication. Wireless communication over 50 cm is presented at 1.4 Gbps using a uni-travelling-carrier photodiode as a source. Transistor integration is detailed, as it is essential to avoid any deleterious signals that would prevent successful communication. We observed an improvement of the bit error rate with increasing input THz power, followed by a degradation at high input power. Such a degradation appears at lower powers if the photodiode bias is smaller. Higher-datarate communication is demonstrated using a frequency-multiplied source thanks to higher output power. Bit-error-rate-measurements at data rates up to 10 Gbps are performed for different input THz powers. As expected, bit error rates degrade as data rate increases. However, degraded communication is observed at some specific data rates. This effect is probably due to deleterious cavity effects and/or impedance mismatches. Using such a system, real-time uncompressed high-definition video signal is successfully and robustly transmitted.", "paper_title": "Wireless Communication at 310 GHz using GaAs High-Electron-Mobility Transistors for Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000335833600003"}
