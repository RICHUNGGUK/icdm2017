A project needs to be developed in minimum time by optimally choosing the proportion of effort allocated towards design activities. We first consider a local case, where the benefits of design activities are restricted within the project. Here the optimal policy follows a bang-bang structure: invest fully in design followed by investing fully in implementation. Next we consider two sequentially linked projects where design capital built in the first project can be reused by the downstream project. For the two project case, the design investment in the upstream project first increases and then decreases with the ability to utilize design capital accumulated in the first project for the second project. We also propose a coordination scheme that rewards the upstream project team so that design investment in this project is chosen in a globally optimal manner.", "paper_title": "Optimal software design reuse policies: A control theoretic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000351520100013"}
