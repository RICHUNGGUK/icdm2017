At the same time, existing technology is not being fully utilized because of non-technological issues that pertain to economics and the human dimension. Issues related to how insiders actually behave are critical to ensuring that the best technologies are meeting their intended purpose. In our research, we have investigated accepted models of perceptions of risk and characteristics unique to insider threat, and we have introduced ordinal scales to these models to measure insider perceptions of risk. We have also investigated decision theories, leading to a conclusion that prospect theory, developed by Tversky and Kahneman, may be used to describe the risk-taking behavior of insiders and can be accommodated in our model. Our results indicate that there is an inverse relationship between perceived risk and benefit by insiders and that their behavior cannot be explained well by the models that are based on the traditional methods of engineering risk analysis and expected utility. We discuss the results of validating that model with forty-two senior information security executives from a variety of organizations. We also discuss how the model may be used to identify characteristics of insiders' perceptions of risk and benefit, their risk-taking behavior and how to frame insider decisions. Finally, we recommend understanding risk of detection and creating a fair working environment to reduce the likelihood of committing criminal acts by insiders.", "paper_title": "Understanding insiders: An analysis of risk-taking behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000316020500002"}
