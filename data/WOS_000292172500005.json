In this paper, we give a general model for this kind of quantum secret sharing. Then we analyze the conditions that make it immune to all the present attacks. Finally, we give a feasible way to design secure quantum secret sharing schemes in the model.", "paper_title": "SECURITY OF A KIND OF QUANTUM SECRET SHARING WITH SINGLE PHOTONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292172500005"}
