In addition, a mobile node (MN) performs a binding update to the correspondent node depending on its mobility. Specifically, an on-link care-of address is chosen for the MN with low mobility, whereas a regional care-of address is selected for the MN with high mobility. This mobility-aware binding update can reduce the packet delivery overhead in an adaptive manner. We develop analytical models that consider both the binding update cost and the packet delivery cost when route optimization is supported. Numerical results demonstrate that the pointer forwarding scheme with mobility-aware binding update outperforms HMIPv6 and the existing pointer forwarding scheme in different situations.
