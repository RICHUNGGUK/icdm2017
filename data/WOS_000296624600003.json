We found that a malicious bidder can obtain the other bidders' bids with a probability of 0.854. Moreover, there will be a higher probability if some bidders collude to attack the other bidders' bids. To prevent such attacks, we propose an effective improvement by means of the hash function.", "paper_title": "CRYPTANALYSIS AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE SECURE QUANTUM SEALED-BID AUCTION WITH POSTCONFIRMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000296624600003"}
