In this paper we discuss intelligent techniques for the segmentation and classification of pigmented skin lesions in such dermatological images. A local thresholding algorithm is proposed for skin lesion separation and border, texture and color based features, are then extracted from the digital images. Extracted features are used to construct a classification module based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) for the recognition of malignant melanoma versus dysplastic nevus.", "paper_title": "Intelligent segmentation and classification of pigmented skin lesions in dermatological images", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100021"}
