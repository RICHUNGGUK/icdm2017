Fast congestion estimation provides an efficient means to adjust the placement and wire planning. A probabilistic model of interconnections enables designers to quickly predict routing congestion. We propose a powerful and fast estimation approach that allows wires to have bounded-length detours to bypass congestions. The method is more realistic and precise than the previous work. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on routing benchmarks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
