We estimate the probability of getting more than one codeword as output when the constituent codes are Reed-Solomon codes. We extend this list decoding algorithm for matrix-product codes with polynomial units, which are quasi-cyclic codes. Furthermore, it allows us to consider unique decoding for matrix-product codes with polynomial units.", "paper_title": "LIST DECODING OF MATRIX-PRODUCT CODES FROM NESTED CODES: AN APPLICATION TO QUASI-CYCLIC CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000307876400001"}
