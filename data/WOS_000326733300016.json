This work is motivated by the desire of our cardiology and cardiac surgical colleagues to minimize or eliminate the use of radiation in the interventional suite or operating room. The dynamic 3-D aortic model is constructed from a preoperative 4-D computed tomography dataset that is animated in synchrony with the real time electrocardiograph input of patient, and then preoperative planning is performed to determine the target position of the aortic valve prosthesis. The contours of the aortic root are extracted automatically from short axis US images in real-time for registering the 2-D intra-operative US image to the preoperative dynamic aortic model. The augmented MTS guides the interventionist during positioning and deployment of the aortic valve prosthesis to the target. The results of the aortic root segmentation algorithm demonstrate an error of 0.92+/-0.85 mm with a computational time of 36.13+/-6.26 ms. The navigation approach was validated in porcine studies, yielding fiducial localization errors, target registration errors, deployment distance, and tilting errors of 3.02+/-0.39 mm, 3.31+/-1.55 mm, 3.23+/-0.94 mm, and 5.85+/-3.06 degrees, respectively.", "paper_title": "Intra-Operative 2-D Ultrasound and Dynamic 3-D Aortic Model Registration for Magnetic Navigation of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation", "paper_id": "WOS:000326733300016"}
