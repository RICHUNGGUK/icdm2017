In this article, we discuss how a manufacturer determines the outsourcing quantity to be allocated to each type of outsourcer. There are two types of outsourcer: (1) an outsourcer that offers a lower outsourcing price but has inferior facilities which result in a higher deteriorating rate and (2) the other one that has advanced facilities causing a lower deteriorating rate but requires a higher outsourcing price. We adopt a real production data of an ice cream company in Taiwan and compare our results with the existing empirical method. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis shows that this study results in higher profits. The study provides managerial insights in the allocation of outsourcing items to different outsourcers with different qualities and costs.", "paper_title": "A model to outsource deteriorating items using two outsourcers with different deteriorating rates and costs", "paper_id": "WOS:000304463700007"}
