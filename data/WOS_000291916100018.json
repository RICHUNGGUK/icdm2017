In this context the use of functional data analysis (FDA) in image analysis is considered. In particular, attention is focussed on shape analysis, where the use of FDA in the functional approach (contour functions) shows its superiority over other approaches, such as the landmark based approach or the set theory approach, on two different problems (principal component analysis and discriminant analysis) in a well-known database of bone outlines. Furthermore, a problem that has hardly ever been considered in the literature is dealt with: multivariate functional discrimination. A discriminant function based on independent component analysis for indicating where the differences between groups are and what their level of discrimination is, is proposed. The classification results obtained with the methodology are very promising. Finally, an analysis of hippocampal differences in Alzheimer's disease is carried out. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
