First, the indirect field-oriented mechanism is implemented for the control of the SCIG system. Then, an AC/DC power converter and a DC/AC power inverter are developed to convert the electric power generated by a three-phase SCIG to power grid. Moreover, the dynamic model of the SCIG system and an ideal computed torque controller are developed for the control of the square of DC-link voltage. Furthermore, an intelligent hybrid WFNN controller and two WFNN controllers, which are computation intensive approaches, are proposed for the AC/DC power converter and the DC/AC power inverter, respectively, to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the SCIG system at different operating conditions. In the intelligent hybrid WFNN controller, to relax the requirement of the lumped uncertainty in the design of the ideal computed torque controller, a WFNN is designed as an uncertainty observer to adapt the lumped uncertainty online. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the SCIG system for grid-connected wind power applications are verified with experimental results.", "paper_title": "Squirrel-cage induction generator system using hybrid wavelet fuzzy neural network control for wind power applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000353356000013"}
