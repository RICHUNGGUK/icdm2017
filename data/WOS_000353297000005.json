In the current competitive and rapidly expanding market environment, shopping website providers must establish effective methods for measuring and improving service quality to increase customer satisfaction levels. In this study, four service quality dimensions of the e-core service quality scale (E-S-QUAL; efficiency, system availability, fulfillment, and privacy) were used to measure the service quality of shopping websites. Subsequently, the simultaneous importance-performance analysis (SIPA) method and analytical Kano model were integrated to analyze the market competition strategies adopted among members of the shopping website industry. Finally, suggestions are provided regarding potential management methods for the case companies.", "paper_title": "Measuring the Service Quality of E-Commerce and Competitive Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000353297000005"}
