These ligand-DNA complexes found different applications for sensing, nanomedicine, and DNA nanotechnology. Structural information on the aptamer-ligand complexes is, however, scarce, even though it would open-up the possibilities to design novel features in the complexes. In the present study we apply molecular docking simulations to probe the features of an experimentally documented L-argininamide aptamer complex. The docking simulations were performed using AutoDock 4.0 and YASARA Structure software, a well-suited program for following intermolecular interactions and structures of biomolecules, including DNA. We explored the binding features of a DNA aptamer to L-argininamide and to a series of arginine derivatives or arginine-like ligands. We find that the best docking results are obtained after an energy-minimization of the parent ligand-aptamer complexes. The calculated binding energies of all mono-substituted guanidine-containing ligands show a good correlation with the experimentally determined binding constants. The results provide valuable guidelines for the application of docking simulations for the prediction of aptamer-ligand structures, and for the design of novel features of ligand-aptamer complexes.", "paper_title": "Computational docking simulations of a DNA-aptamer for argininamide and related ligands", "paper_id": "WOS:000357465200005"}
