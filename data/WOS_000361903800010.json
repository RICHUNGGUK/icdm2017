The underlying idea of the method is that a significant change in the beam model parameters can be taken as a sign of damage occurrence in the structural system. In this way, damage detection can be associated to an identification problem. More concretely, a 2D Hopfield Neural Network uses information about the way the beam vibrates and the external forces that are applied to it to obtain time-evolving estimates of the beam parameters at the different beam points. The neural network organizes its input information based on the Euler-Bernoulli model for beam vibrations. Its performance is tested with vibration data generated by means of a different model, namely Timonshenko's, in order to produce more realistic simulation conditions.", "paper_title": "A 2D Hopfield Neural Network approach to mechanical beam damage detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000361903800010"}
