The concepts of indicator function and aliasing are introduced to study such designs. The minimum G-aberration criterion proposed by Deng and Tang (1999) [4] for two-level nonregular factorial designs is extended to the split-plot case. A method to construct the whole-plot and sub-plot parts is proposed for nonregular designs. Furthermore, the optimal split-plot schemes for 12-, 16-, 20- and 24-run two-level nonregular factorial designs are searched, and many such schemes are tabulated for practical use.
