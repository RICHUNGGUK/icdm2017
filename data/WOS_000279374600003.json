The empirical results from numerous earlier panel-based unit root tests which do not take structural breaks into account indicate that stock prices for all the countries we study here are non-stationary; but when we employ panel stationary test with structural breaks, we find the null hypothesis of I(0) stationarity in stock prices cannot be rejected for any of the G-7 stock markets. Our results indicate that the efficient market hypothesis does not hold in these G-7 stock markets. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
