To construct such snakes a straightforward, non-recursive method is developed based on special linear codes with minimum distance 4. An extension of this method is used for the construction of covers of Q(n) consisting of 2(m-1) vertex-disjoint snakes, for 2(m-1) < n <= 2(m). These covers turn out to have a symmetry group of order 2(m).", "paper_title": "Sets of disjoint snakes based on a Reed-Muller code and covering the hypercube", "paper_id": "WOS:000256775700001"}
