It builds on an earlier article that introduced the network perspective on organizational learning, and proposes some common traits of learning networks and tests them with the help of the tools of social-network analysis. We find support for the network perspective on organizational learning. There are some traits of the learning network that are common to very different companies, such as the fact that learning occurs mainly in clusters. Some other traits depend much on the organizational culture.", "paper_title": "Evidence for the network perspective on organizational learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000259455500010"}
