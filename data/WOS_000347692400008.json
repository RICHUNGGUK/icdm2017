Thus determining all possible sizes of a perfect -deletion-correcting code makes sense. When , -deletion-correcting codes are closely related to directed packings, constructions of which are based on the tools of design theory. Recently, Chee, Ge and Ling determined completely the spectrum of possible sizes for perfect -ary 1-deletion-correcting codes of length three for all , and perfect -ary 2-deletion-correcting codes of length four for all but values of . In this paper, we continue to investigate the spectrum problem for perfect . By constructing a considerable number of incomplete directed packings, we give an almost complete solution to the spectrum problem of sizes for perfect , leaving the existence of of size and of size in doubt.", "paper_title": "Spectrum of sizes for perfect 2-deletion-correcting codes of length 4", "paper_id": "WOS:000347692400008"}
