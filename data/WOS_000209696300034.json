In contrast to the existing solutions, HsF-MAC allows MANET nodes to re-calculate the backoff value used by their 1-hop neighbors and immediately detect the misbehaving ones. Moreover, the colluding behavior of two cheating nodes is also considered along with effective countermeasures. A reconciliation based reaction mechanism is finally designed. The simulation results, under different topologies and network conditions, have validated the effectiveness of HsF-MAC.", "paper_title": "Fast and Efficient Countermeasure for MAC Layer Misbehavior in MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300034"}
