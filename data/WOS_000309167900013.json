To this end, approaches for qualitative and semantic image description and qualitative distance sensor interpretation were developed. Experimentation was carried out on different robotic platforms showing useful applications.", "paper_title": "Qualitative distances and qualitative description of images for indoor scene description and recognition in robotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000309167900013"}
