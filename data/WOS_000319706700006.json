We compare them to the well known properties of Braess's paradox for Wardrop's model of games with static flows. We show that there are networks which do not admit Braess's paradox in Wardrop's model, but which admit it in the model with flow over time. Moreover, there is a topology that admits a much more severe Braess's ratio for this model. Further, despite its symmetry for games with static flow, we show that Braess's paradox is not symmetric for flows over time. We illustrate that there are network topologies which exhibit Braess's paradox, but for which the transpose does not. Finally, we conjecture a necessary and sufficient condition of existence of Braess's paradox in a network, and prove the condition of existence of the paradox either in the network or in its transpose.", "paper_title": "Braess's Paradox for Flows over Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000319706700006"}
