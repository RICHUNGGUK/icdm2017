Moreover, ELM implements a continuous map which can produce compact representations of the Q-table, and generalizations to increased space resolution and unknown situations. In this paper we evaluate empirically three strategies to formulate ELM learning to provide approximations to the Q-table, namely as classification, multi-variate regression and several independent regression problems.", "paper_title": "STATE-ACTION VALUE FUNCTION MODELED BY ELM IN REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR HOSE CONTROL PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000326630600010"}
