When the transmission rate becomes higher than the maximum count rate of the individual detectors (1/tau), security issues affect the scheme for sifting bits. Analytical calculations and numerical simulations of the Bennett-Brassard BB84 protocol are performed. We study Rogers et al.'s scheme (further information is available in [D. J. Rogers, J. C. Bienfang, A. Nakassis, H. Xu, and C. W. Clark, New J. Phys. 9, 319 (2007)]) in the presence of an active eavesdropper Eve who has the power to perform an intercept-resend attack. It is shown that Rogers et al.'s scheme is no longer guaranteed to be secure. More specifically, Eve can induce a basis-dependent detection efficiency at the receiver's end. Modified key sifting schemes that are basis-independent and thus secure in the presence of dead time and an active eavesdropper are then introduced. We analyze and compare these secure sifting schemes for this active Eve scenario, and calculate and simulate their key generation rate. It is shown that the maximum key generation rate is 1/(2 tau) for passive basis selection, and 1/tau for active basis selection. The security analysis for finite detector dead time is also extended to the decoy state BB84 protocol for one particular secure sifting scheme.", "paper_title": "SECURITY OF HIGH SPEED QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION WITH FINITE DETECTOR DEAD TIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000333068200002"}
