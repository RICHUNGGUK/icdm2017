Even thick capping layers fail to eliminate plastic deformation of tracks. This paper reports an economical method of evaluating the elasto-plastic material properties using penetration tests oil specimens contained in rigid test moulds, coupled with a finite element modelling based backcalculation approach. The material properties thus determined simulate the behaviour of capping layers under a track structure effectively as shown using full scale laboratory experiments. Sensitivity of the material parameters to the behaviour of the capping layer soil is also presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
