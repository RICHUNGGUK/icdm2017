Designing effective and economical measures is a nontrivial task due to the following: 1) the large number of system requirements; and 2) the uncertainty over how the system functionalities are going to be specified and to evolve. This paper explores a unified approach for addressing security and privacy of smart metering (SM) systems. In the process, we present a unified framework that entails the analysis and synthesis of security solutions associated with closely interrelated components of a typical SM system. Ultimately, the proposed framework can be used as a guideline for embedding cross-domain security and privacy solutions into SG communication systems.", "paper_title": "Toward Unified Security and Privacy Protection for Smart Meter Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337155400031"}
