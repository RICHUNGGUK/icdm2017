Consistency control in this environment must not only guarantee convergence of replicated data, but also attempt to preserve intentions of operations. Operational transformation (OT) is a well-established method for optimistic consistency control in this context and has drawn continuing research attention since 1989. However, counterexamples to previous works have often been identified despite the significant progress made on this topic over the past 15 years. This paper analyzes the root of correctness problems in OT and establishes a novel operational transformation framework for developing OT algorithms and proving their correctness.", "paper_title": "A new operational transformation framework for real-time group editors", "paper_id": "WOS:000243686900002"}
