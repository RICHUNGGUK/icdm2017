Hence, in the paper, process capability analysis is utilized to measure business performance. Moreover, the lifetime performance index C-L is used as a means of measuring business performance, where L is the lower specification limit. Since the lifetime of businesses generally follow a Pareto distribution, so in the technology of data transformation, this study constructs a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of C-L under the Pareto distribution with the right type II censored sample. The MLE of C-L is then utilized to develop a confidence interval in the condition of known L. Finally, we give two examples and the Monte Carlo simulation to assess the behavior of confidence interval for the lifetime performance index C-L under given confidence level. Moreover, the managers can then employ the confidence interval to determine whether the business performance adheres to the required level. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
