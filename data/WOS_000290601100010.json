KAdHoc not only has faster search time, but also higher success rates and lower overall traffic under conditions of high node density compared to Kademlia and Pastry. The success rates of KAdHoc are also higher when node velocity increases. We first group nodes which are physically close and then propose a new routing process and a new broadcast mechanism. We further improve KAdHoc by considering power status, to retain nodes with long uptimes and to delete nodes which are no longer reliable. Finally, mobility is considered in the KAdHoc scheme. Simulations confirm that the enhanced KAdHoc performs well in ad-hoc networks.", "paper_title": "ENHANCING THE LOOKUP PERFORMANCE AND POWER DETECTION OF KADEMLIA BY RANDOM LANDMARKING CLUSTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100010"}
