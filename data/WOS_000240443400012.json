The main idea is to 1) represent surfaces by unions of level curves, called facial curves, of the depth function and 2) compare shapes of surfaces implicitly using shapes of facial curves. The latter is performed using a differential geometric approach that computes geodesic lengths between closed curves on a shape manifold. These ideas are demonstrated using a nearest-neighbor classifier on two 3D face databases: Florida State University and Notre Dame, highlighting a good recognition performance.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional face recognition using shapes of facial curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000240443400012"}
