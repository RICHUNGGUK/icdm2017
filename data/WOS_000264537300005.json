It is shown via a mixture of analytic and computer techniques that there exist realisations of this graph in terms of two circular DNA molecules. These blueprints for the organisation of a cage structure with a noncrystallographic symmetry may assist in the design of containers made from DNA for applications in nanotechnology.
