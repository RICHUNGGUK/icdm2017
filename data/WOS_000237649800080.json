Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is a new software development paradigm where software is generated by a series of model transformations. By combing essential features of CBD and MDA, both the benefits of software reusability and development automation can be achieved in a single framework. In this paper, we propose a Component-based P Platform Independent Model (CB-PIM) and a UML profile for specifying component-based design in MDA framework. We suggest mapping rules to transform CB-PIM into Platform Specific Models (PSM). Once components are specified with our profile at the level of PIM, they can be automatically transformed into PSM and eventually source code implementation.", "paper_title": "Process and techniques to generate components in MDA/CB-PIM for automation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800080"}
