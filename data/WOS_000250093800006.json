By adjusting wirings among the cells, the DSN can generate spike-trains with various characteristics. In this paper we present a theorem that clarifies basic relations between change of wirings and change of characteristics of the spike-train. Also, in order to explore learning potential of the DSN, we propose a learning algorithm for generating spike-trains that are suited to an application example. We then show significances and basic roles of the presented theorem in the learning dynamics.", "paper_title": "Basic characteristics and learning potential of a digital spiking neuron", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800006"}
