Energy demand modeling method is the foundation of improving the energy efficiency of manufacturing; therefore, an energy demand modeling methodology for machining processes is proposed. In this method, machining processes are divided into a series of activities, and Therblig, as one of the basic concepts of Motion study, is introduced to represent the basic energy demand unit. Moreover, a mathematical model of energy demand of machining processes is established by linking the activity and Therblig with machining state. Finally, case studies are performed to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Therblig-based energy demand modeling methodology of machining process to support intelligent manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800006"}
