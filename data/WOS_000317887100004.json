The networked predictive control consists of the control prediction generator and network delay compensator. The control prediction generator provides a set of future control predictions to make the closed-loop system achieve the desired control performance and the network delay compensator eliminates the effects of the network transmission delay. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated in simulation as well as experiment study. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
