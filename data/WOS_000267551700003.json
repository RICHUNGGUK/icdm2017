A P System consists of a hierarchy of membranes, each of them containing a multiset of objects, a set of evolution rules, and possibly other membranes. Evolution rules are applied to the objects of the same membrane with maximal parallelism. In this paper we present an extension of P Systems, called P Systems with Endosomes (PE Systems), in which endosomes can be explicitly modeled. We show that PE Systems are universal even if only the simplest form of evolution rules is considered, and we give one application example.", "paper_title": "P Systems with Endosomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000267551700003"}
