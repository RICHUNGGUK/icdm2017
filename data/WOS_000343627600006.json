The objective is to make these regions compact in a distance-aware sense: minimize the maximum (normalized) average Manhattan distance between points from the same set C-i. Related location problems have received a considerable amount of attention; in particular, the problem of determining the \"optimal shape of a city\", i.e., allocating a single n(i) has been studied. We present an online strategy, based on an analysis of space-filling curves; for continuous shapes, we prove a factor of 1.8092, and 1.7848 for discrete point sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
