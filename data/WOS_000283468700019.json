In order to radically reduce asphalt fumes in the construction process, through self-designed test equipment, we added SBS (Styrene Butadiene Styrene), melamine and activated carbon which may have fumes suppression effect to the asphalt and experimented, obtained: (1) SBS which had fumes suppression effect, could be used as an additive to reduce asphalt fumes; (2) Melamine and activated carbon, which would produced a number of side effects, could not be used as an additive to reduce asphalt fume. At present the research of modified asphalt which produces lower fumes is basically still in a blank state, but the paper will fill the gaps in this aspect and provide a test device and method to study on modified asphalt with low fumes.", "paper_title": "A STUDY ON ADDICTIVES FOR FUME REDUCTION IN ASPHALT PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468700019"}
