This paper aims to address the task of human gait and activity analysis from image sequences by learning and recognition of sequential data under a general integrated framework. Human movements generally exhibit intrinsically nonlinear spatiotemporal characteristics in the high-dimensional ambient space. An attractive framework, which we explore here, is to: (1) Extract simple and reliable features from image sequences. (2) Find a low-dimensional feature representation embedded in high-dimensional image data. (3) Then characterize/classify the motions in this low-dimensional feature space. We examine two simple alternatives for step 1: silhouette and a distance transformed silhouette; and three quite different methods for step 3: Gaussian mixture models (GMM) based classification, a matching-based approach with the mean Hausdorff distance, and continuous hidden Markov models (HMM) based modelling and recognition. The core is step 2 where we choose to use LPP (locality preserving projections), an optimal linear approximation to a nonlinear spectral embedding technique (i.e., Laplacian eigenmap). In essence our aim is to see whether this core, together with simple approaches to steps I and 3, can solve problems across several types of human gait and activity. To see how well the proposed framework performs, we carry out extensive experiments in three related domains: human activity recognition, abnormal gait analysis, and gait-based human identification. The experimental results show that the proposed framework performs well across all three areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
