We model the PDM as the salience of relevance triangle, and express the PDM by using three properties derived from the salience of visual part. Performance analysis and experimental results show that our proposal can improve the quality of the shape reconstruction when the object contour has sharp protrusions.", "paper_title": "Perceptual Distortion Measure for Polygon-Based Shape Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000320214300047"}
