And the problems of robust stability analysis and robust controller designing of the new model are derived. The uncertainty is assumed to be norm-bound and appears in all the matrices of the state-space model. There are few studies concerned the robust analysis of the memristive neural networks, so these conditions are improvements and extensions of the existing results in the literature. The proposed methods are dependent on the size of the delay and are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results are demonstrated via some numerical examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
