However, it is difficult to accurately obtain the HCDD in real time for high-speed links with a massive amount of traffic data. In this paper, we propose a new sketch method to build a probabilistic traffic summary of a host's flows using a uniform Flajolet-Martin sketch combined with a small bitmap. To study its performance in comparison with previous sampling and sketch methods, we present a general model that encompasses all these methods. With this model, we compute the Cramer-Rao lower bounds and the variances of HCDD estimations. The theoretic analysis and numerical experimental results show that our sketch method is six times more accurate than state-of-the-art methods with the same memory usage.", "paper_title": "A New Sketch Method for Measuring Host Connection Degree Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000335386100005"}
