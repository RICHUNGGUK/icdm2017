It can be used with binary images from any source, and is developed for use with lacustrine, marine. Aeolian, and marine sediments. The macro code is freely available, and runs on open-source software. It has been specially designed to accommodate very small regions of interest relative to particle size, and to produce continuous downcore stratigraphies. The macro runs quickly, requires no user-interaction, is easily modifiable, saves 'raw data' for algorithm checking and further analyses, and can run in a mode that quantifies cracks and other disturbances on images. The macro allows for rapid analyses of relatively long sedimentary sequences, and provides relevant sedimentary interpretations of transport and depositional processes. Examples of output from two lacustrine sediment records and one marine record are shown. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
