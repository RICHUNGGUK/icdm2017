The DPV algorithm addresses the k-degree Anycast Topology Control problem where the main objective is to assign each sensor's transmission range such that each has at least k-vertex-disjoint paths to supernodes and the total power consumption is minimum. The resulting topologies are tolerant to k - 1 node failures in the worst case. We prove the correctness of our approach by showing that topologies generated by DPV are guaranteed to satisfy k-vertex supernode connectivity. Our simulations show that the DPV algorithm achieves up to 4-fold reduction in total transmission power required in the network and 2-fold reduction in maximum transmission power required in a node compared to existing solutions.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Fault-Tolerant Topology Control Algorithm for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351453000001"}
