We present a multi-TI ASL method (multi-TI integrated ASL) in which variable post-labeling delays and variable TRs are used to improve the estimation of arterial transit time (ATT) and CBF while shortening the scan time by 41% compared to the conventional methods. Variable bolus widths allow for T-1 and M-0 estimation from raw ASL data. Multi-TI integrated pseudo-continuous ASL images were collected at 7 TI times ranging 100-4300ms. Voxel-wise T-1 and M-0 maps were estimated, then CBF and ATT maps were created using the estimated T-1 tissue map. All maps were consistent with physiological values reported in the literature. Based on simulations and in vivo comparisons, this method demonstrates higher CBF and ATT estimation efficiency than other ATT acquisition methods and better fit to the perfusion model. It produces CBF maps with reduced sensitivity to errors from ATT and tissue T-1 variations. The estimated M-0, T-1, and ATT maps also have potential clinical utility. The method requires a single scan acquired within a clinically acceptable scan time (under 6 minutes) and with low sensitivity to motion.", "paper_title": "Multi-TI Arterial Spin Labeling MRI with Variable TR and Bolus Duration for Cerebral Blood Flow and Arterial Transit Time Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000355755700015"}
