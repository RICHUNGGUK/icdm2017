The first result shows that for a memoryless source with rate-distortion function R(D) and a bounded distortion measure, the rate-distortion point (R(D) + gamma, D + epsilon) can be achieved with constant decompression time per (separable) symbol and compression time per symbol proportional to(lambda(1)/epsilon)(lambda 2/gamma 2), where lambda(1) and lambda(2) are source dependent constants. The second result establishes that the same point can be achieved with constant decompression time and compression time per symbol proportional to (rho(1)/gamma)(rho 2/epsilon 2). These results imply, for any function g(n) that increases without bound arbitrarily slowly, the existence of a sequence of lossy compression schemes of blocklength n with O(ng(n)) compression complexity and O(n) decompression complexity that achieve the point (R(D), D) asymptotically with increasing blocklength. We also establish that if the reproduction alphabet is finite, then for any given R there exists a universal lossy compression scheme with O(ng(n)) compression complexity and O(n) decompression complexity that achieves the point (R, D(R)) asymptotically for any stationary ergodic source with distortion-rate function D(.).", "paper_title": "Achievable Complexity-Performance Tradeoffs in Lossy Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000314036400006"}
