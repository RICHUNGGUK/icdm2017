Both courses emphasise skills in model construction and analysis by testing rather than formal verification. The accessibility of the formalism is enhanced by the use of established notations (VDM-SL and VDM++). Motivation is improved by using credible examples drawn from industrial projects, and by using an industrial-strength tool set. We present examples from the courses and discuss student evaluation and examination performance. We stress the need for exercises and tests to support the development of abstraction skills.", "paper_title": "Practice-oriented courses in formal methods using VDM++", "paper_id": "WOS:000264810500003"}
