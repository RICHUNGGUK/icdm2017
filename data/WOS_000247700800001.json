It describes in detail the implementation of code to solve linear system of equations using Gaussian elimination in single precision with iterative refinement of the solution to the full double-precision accuracy. By utilizing this approach the algorithm achieves close to an order of magnitude higher performance on the Cell processor than the performance offered by the standard double-precision algorithm. The code is effectively an implementation of the high-performance LINPACK benchmark, as it meets all of the requirements concerning the problem being solved and the numerical properties of the solution.
