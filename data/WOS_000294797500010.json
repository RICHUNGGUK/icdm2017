A mechanical structure with 4 degrees of freedom is designed so that an implemented small-sized humanoid robot named ARSR is able to accomplish three types of walking motions. One experiment is presented to illustrate the proposed bipedal structure lets the ARSR move forward, turn left and turn right. Three ultrasonic sensors and one compass sensor are mounted on the ARSR to obtain the environment information and detect obstacles, respectively. Based on the information obtained from these sensors, a decision tree method is proposed to decide upon one behavior from three movements: walk forward, turn right left and turn right. An experiment is carried out to show how the robot can autonomously avoid obstacles to effectively arrive at its destination.", "paper_title": "A CRITICAL REVIEW AND IMPROVEMENT METHOD ON BIPED ROBOT", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500010"}
