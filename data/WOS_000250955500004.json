The aggregation operators are constructed from a set of desired values at certain points, or from empirically collected data. It establishes tight upper and lower bounds on Lipschitz aggregation operators with a number of different properties, as well as the optimal aggregation operator, cons istent with the given values. We consider conjunctive, disjunctive and idempotent n-ary aggregation operators; p-stable aggregation operators; various choices of the neutral ele ment and annihilator; diagonal, opposite diagonal and marginal sections; bipolar and double aggregation operators. In all cases we provide either explicit formulas or determ inistic numerical procedures to determine the bounds. The findings of this paperare useful for construction of aggregation operators with specified properties, especially using interpolation schemata.", "paper_title": "Pointwise construction of Lipschitz aggregation operators with specific properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000250955500004"}
