We first formulate it as a block design problem and derive the fundamental trade-offs between wake-up latency and the average duty cycle of a node. After the theoretical foundation is laid, we then devise a neighbor discovery and schedule bookkeeping protocol that can operate on the optimal wake-up schedule derived. To demonstrate the usefulness of asynchronous wake-up, we investigate the efficiency of neighbor discovery and the application of on-demand power management, which overlays a desirable communication schedule over the wake-up schedule mandated by the asynchronous wake-up mechanism. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous wake-up protocol has short discovery time which scales with the density of the network; it can accommodate various traffic characteristics and loads to achieve an energy savings that can be as high as 70 percent, while the packet delivery ratio is comparable to that without power management.", "paper_title": "Optimal block design for asynchronous wake-up schedules and its applications in multihop wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239058200009"}
