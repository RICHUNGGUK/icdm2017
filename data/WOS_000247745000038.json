Neural network coupled by such neurons exhibits complex dynamic behaviors. The network is also studied from the viewpoint of optimization. Chaos and hysteresis phenomena make the network have the characteristic of escaping from a local minimum of the energy function, so it can find a global minimum more easily as compared with others. The experimental results show that it has a higher average success rate of obtaining a global optimization solution. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
