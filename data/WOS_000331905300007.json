The causes of these problems include malicious behavior and imperfect business processes. The latter lead to the emergence of security vulnerabilities and loss of user funds which become more and more serious these years. We focus on the business process of e-commerce, and propose a formal model for constructing an e-commerce business process called an E-commerce Business Process Net. It integrates both data and control flows based on Petri nets. Rationality and transaction consistency are defined and validated to guarantee the transaction properties of an e-commerce business process. This paper offers a complete methodology for modeling and validating an e-commerce system with a third- party payment platform from the view point of a business process. Its use enables a designer to identify errors early in the design process and correct them before the deployment phase. In order to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of the methodology, we have modeled and validated a real-world e-commerce business process and discovered the problems that cause the violation of transaction properties.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Validating E-Commerce Business Process Based on Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000331905300007"}
