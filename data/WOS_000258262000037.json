The appearance of subgrid visual details is improved by incorporating a new bubble model based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) into an Eulerian grid-based simulation that handles background flows of large bodies of water and air. To overcome the difficulty in simulating small bubbles in the context of the multiphase flows on a coarse grid, we heuristically model the interphase properties of water and air by means of the interactions between bubble particles. As a result, we can animate lively motion of bubbly water with small scale details efficiently.", "paper_title": "Bubbles alive", "paper_id": "WOS:000258262000037"}
