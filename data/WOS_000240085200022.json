Relations between spatial entities are the most important kind of spatial information. Most current formalisms of spatial relations focus on one single aspect of space. This contrasts sharply with real world applications, where several aspects are usually involved together. This paper proposes a qualitative calculus that combines a simple directional relation model with the well-known topological RCC5 model. We show by construction that the consistency of atomic networks can be decided in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Combining topological and directional information: First results", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200022"}
