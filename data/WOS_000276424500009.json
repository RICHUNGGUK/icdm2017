Such procedures are generally based on the notion of simple point, the exclusive use of which may result in the appearance of \"topological artifacts.\" This limitation leads to consider a more general category of objects, the simple sets, which also enable topology-preserving image reduction. A study of two-dimensional simple sets in two-dimensional spaces has been proposed recently. This article is devoted to the study of two-dimensional simple sets in spaces of higher dimension (i.e., n-dimensional spaces, na parts per thousand yen3). In particular, several properties of minimal simple sets (i.e., which do not strictly include any other simple sets) are proposed, leading to a characterisation theorem. It is also proved that the removal of a two-dimensional simple set from an object can be performed by only considering the minimal ones, thus authorising the development of efficient thinning algorithms.", "paper_title": "On 2-dimensional Simple Sets in n-dimensional Cubic Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000276424500009"}
