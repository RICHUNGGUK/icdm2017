Each job has a positive processing time and due-date. Setup times are assumed to be identical for all batches. All batch sizes cannot exceed a common upper bound. As in many practical situations, jobs have to be subject to flexible precedence constraints. The aim of this paper is to find an optimal batch sequence. The sequence is to minimize the maximal completion time and maximize the minimum value of desirability of the fuzzy precedence. However, there usually exists no batch sequence optimizing both objectives at a time. Therefore, we seek some non-dominated batch sequences after the definition of non-dominated batch sequence. Based on an iterative Procedure HL proposed by Cheng et al., an efficient algorithm is presented to find some non-dominated batch sequences.", "paper_title": "BATCH SCHEDULING PROBLEM WITH DUE-DATE AND FUZZY PRECEDENCE RELATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000303851300013"}
