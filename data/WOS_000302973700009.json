We first select matched features by Bi-matching as seed points, then organize these seed points by adopting the Delaunay triangulation algorithm. Finally, triangle constraint is used to explore good matches. The experimental evaluation shows that our method is robust to most geometric and photometric transformations including rotation, scale change, blur, viewpoint change, JPEG compression and illumination change, and significantly improves both the number of correct matches and the matching score. And the application on estimating the fundamental matrix for a pair of images is also shown. Both the experiments and the application demonstrate the robust performance of our method.
