Topology Aggregation (TA) is defined as a set of techniques that abstract or summarize the state information about the network topology to be exchanged, processed, and maintained by network nodes for routing purposes. Due to scalability, aggregation techniques have been an integral part of some routing protocols. However, TA has not been studied extensively except in a rather limited context. With the continuing growth of the Internet, scalability issues of QoS routing have been gaining importance. Therefore, we survey the current TA techniques, provide methodology to classify, evaluate, and compare their complexities and efficiencies.", "paper_title": "Analysis of topology aggregation techniques for QoS routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000249658500001"}
