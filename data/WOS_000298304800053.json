Two important improvements are exploited to achieve this robustness. The first one is selecting an embedding region according to the stable characteristic of the audio energy. The second one is stretching the pseudo-random noise sequence to match the length of the embedding region before embedding and detection. Experimental results show that our method is highly robust to common audio signal processing attacks and synchronization attacks including PSM, cropping, trimming and jittering.", "paper_title": "Audio Watermarking Robust against Playback Speed Modification", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800053"}
