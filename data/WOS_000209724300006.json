In TransCom, clients store all data and software, including OS and application software, on Vdisks that correspond to disk images located on centralized servers, while computing tasks are carried out by the clients. Users can choose to boot any client for using the desired OS, including Windows, and access software and data services from Vdisks as usual without consideration of any other tasks, such as installation, maintenance, and management. By centralizing storage yet distributing computing tasks, TransCom can greatly reduce the potential system maintenance and management costs. We have implemented a multi-platform TransCom prototype that supports bothWindows and Linux services. The extensive evaluation based on both test-bed experiments and real-usage experiments has demonstrated that TransCom is a feasible, scalable, and efficient solution for successful real-world use.", "paper_title": "TransCom: A Virtual Disk-Based Cloud Computing Platform for Heterogeneous Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000209724300006"}
