In this paper, two networks of different baseline length, located in two different regions are analyzed. For both networks, GLONASS and GPS observations are processed respectively for 175 days since GLONASS recovered FOC. The RMS and STD of the coordinates minus those from the International GNSS Service weekly solutions are analyzed. The statistics over a long period empirically demonstrate that the averaged coordinate repeatabilities of GLONASS are slightly worse than that of GPS results. The estimated ZTDs of GLONASS is about 1-2 mm worse than GPS results. For both networks, the GLONASS coordinates show some systematic effect as a function of antenna + radome type, caused by the using of GPS derived PCC models. The systematic effect varied form several mm to 1 cm for different stations with different antenna + radome types, which indicates that GLONASS-specific PCC models are mandatory in GLONASS high precision positioning.", "paper_title": "Investigation of GLONASS performance in differential positioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000311503700005"}
