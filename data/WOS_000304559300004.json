Such systems are typically composed of tactile sensors that sense the physical characteristics of textures and tactile displays that present tactile stimuli to operators. One problem associated with tactile transmission systems is that when the system has a bottleneck, it is difficult to identify whether the tactile sensor, tactile display, or perceptual ability of the user is the cause because they have different performance criteria. To solve this problem, this study established an evaluation method that uses the discriminability index as an evaluation criterion. The method lets tactile sensors, displays, and human tactile perception be assessed in terms of the ability to transmit physical quantities; the same criterion is used for all three possible causes so that their abilities can be directly compared. The developed method was applied to a tactile-roughness transmission system (Okamoto et al. 2009), and its tactile sensor was identified as the bottleneck of the system.", "paper_title": "Discriminability-based evaluation of transmission capability of tactile transmission systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000304559300004"}
