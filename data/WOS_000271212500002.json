In recent years, several microarchitectures that employ checkpoints have been proposed, either extending the reorder buffer or entirely replacing it. This work presents an in-dept-study of checkpointing in checkpoint-based microarchitectures, from the desired content of a checkpoint, via implementation trade-offs, and to checkpoint allocation and release policies. A major contribution of the article is a novel adaptive checkpoint allocation policy that outperforms known policies. The adaptive policy controls checkpoint allocation according to dynamic events, such as second-level cache misses and rollback history. It achieves 6.8% and 2.2% speedup for the integer and floating point benchmarks, respectively, and does not require a branch confidence estimator. The results show that the proposed adaptive policy achieves most of the potential of an oracle policy whose performance improvement is 9.8% and 3.9% for the integer and floating point benchmarks, respectively. We exploit known techniques for saving leakage power by adapting and applying them to checkpoint-based microarchitectures. The proposed applications combine to reduce the leakage power of the register file to about one half of its original value.", "paper_title": "Checkpoint Allocation and Release", "paper_id": "WOS:000271212500002"}
