In this paper, we study the application of error entropy minimization to kernel adaptive filtering, a new and promising technique that implements the conventional linear adaptive filters in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and obtains the nonlinear adaptive filters in original input space. The kernel minimum error entropy (KMEE) algorithm is derived, which is essentially a generalized stochastic information gradient (SIG) algorithm in RKHS. The computational complexity of KMEE is just similar to the kernel affine projection algorithm (KAPA). We also utilize the quantization approach to constrain the network size growth, and develop the quantized KMEE (QKMEE) algorithm. Further, we analyze the mean square convergence of KMEE. The energy conservation relation is derived and a sufficient condition that ensures the mean square convergence is obtained. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated in nonlinear system identification and short-term chaotic time series prediction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
