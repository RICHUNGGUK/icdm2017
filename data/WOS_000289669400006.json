In USA, FIND initiative takes a clean-slate approach. In EU, EIF-FEL think tank concludes that both clean slate and evolutionary approach are needed. While in China, researchers and the country are enthusiastic on the promotion and immediate deployment of IPv6 due to the imminent problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. Since 2003, China launched a strategic programme called China Next Generation Internet (CNGI). China is expecting that Chinese industry is better positioned on future Internet technologies and services than it was for the first generation. Under the support of CNGI grant, China Education and Research Network (CERNET) started to build an IPv6-only network, i.e. CNGI-CERNET2. Currently it provides IPv6 access service for students and staff in many Chinese universities. In this article, we will introduce the CNGI programme, the architecture of CNGI-CERNET2, and some aspects of CNGI-CERNET2's deployment and operation, such as transition, security, charging and roaming service etc", "paper_title": "CNGI-CERNET2: an IPv6 Deployment in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000289669400006"}
