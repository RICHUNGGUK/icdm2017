It supports the data format of four major mass spectrometer vendors and mzML common data format. This program provides a process pipeline from the raw-format import to high-dimensional statistical analyses. The novel aspect is graphical user interface-based visualization to perform peak quantification, to interpolate missing values and to normalize peaks interactively based on quality control samples. Together with the software platform, the MRM standard library of 301 metabolites with 775 transitions is also available, which contributes to the reliable peak identification by using retention time and ion abundances.", "paper_title": "MRMPROBS suite for metabolomics using large-scale MRM assays", "paper_id": "WOS:000342746000020"}
