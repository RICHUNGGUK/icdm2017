The proposed circuit has ability to realize voltage, current, transconductance, and transresistance mode, and can the following advantageous features: (i) realization of low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, notch, and all-pass filter responses from the same configuration, (ii) employment of only grounded capacitors ideal for integrated circuit implementation, (iii) orthogonal controlling of omega (o) and Q for easily electronic tunability, and (iv) low active and passive sensitivity performance. Finally, to verify our architecture, we have designed this analog filter chip with TSMC 0.35-mu m 2P4M CMOS technology. This chip operates to 1 MHz and consumes 30.95 mW. The chip area of the analog filter is about 0.823 mm(2).", "paper_title": "Tunable mixed-mode OTA-C universal filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000262432600006"}
