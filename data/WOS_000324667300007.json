We present a Label Switching based Network-on-Chip (LS-NoC) motivated by throughput guarantees offered by bandwidth reservation. Label switching is a packet relaying technique in which individual packets carry route information in the form of labels. A centralized LS-NoC Management framework engineers traffic into Quality of Service (QoS) guaranteed routes. LS-NoC caters to the requirements of streaming applications where communication channels are fixed over the lifetime of the application. The proposed NoC framework inherently supports heterogeneous and ad hoc system-on-chips. The LS-NoC can be used in conjunction with conventional best effort NoC as a QoS guaranteed communication network or as a replacement to the conventional NoC. A multicast, broadcast capable label switched router for the LS-NoC has been designed. A 5 port, 256 bit data bus, 4 bit label router occupies 0.431 mm(2) in 130 nm and delivers peak bandwidth of 80 Gbits/s per link at 312.5 MHz. Bandwidth and latency guarantees of LS-NoC have been demonstrated on traffic from example streaming applications and on constant and variable bit rate traffic patterns. LS-NoC was found to have a competitive AreaxPower/Throughput figure of merit with state-of-the-art NoCs providing QoS. Circuit switching with link sharing abilities and support for asynchronous operation make LS-NoC a desirable choice for QoS servicing in chip multiprocessors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
