While most work on location-dependent query processing has been mainly oriented towards outdoor environments, this paper develops an approach for the continuous processing of location-dependent queries over indoor moving objects. A prototype for handling those queries has been developed as an extension for the open-source DBMS PostgreSQL. Several algorithms for the continuous processing of path searches and range queries applied to both static and moving objects are performed on top of a hierarchical and context-dependent data model. Experimental results have been conducted to report our findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
