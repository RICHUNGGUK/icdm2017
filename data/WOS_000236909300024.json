First, we consider the task of converting a one-way function f : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1}(m) into a harder one-way function f: {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1}(m), with n, m < poly(n), in a black-box way. The hardness is measured as the fraction of inputs any polynomial-size circuit must fail to invert. We show that to use a constant-depth circuit to amplify hardness beyond a polynomial factor, its size must exceed 2(poly)((n)), and to amplify hardness beyond a 2 degrees((n)) factor, its size must exceed 2(2o(n)). Moreover, for a constant-depth circuit to amplify hardness beyond an n(1+o(1)) factor in a security preserving way (with n = O(n)), it size must exceed 2(no(1)). Next, we show that if a constant-depth polynomial-size circuit can amplify hardness beyond a polynomial factor in a weakly black-box way, then it must basically embed a hard function in itself. In fact, one can derive from such an amplification procedure a highly parallel one-way function, which is computable by an NCO circuit (constant-depth polynomial-size circuit with bounded fan-in gates). Finally, we consider the task of constructing a pseudo-random generator G : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1}(m) from a strongly one-way function f : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1}(m) in a black-box way. We show that any such a construction realized alized by a constant-depth 2(no(1))-size circuit can only have a sublinear stretch (with m - n = o(n)).", "paper_title": "On the complexity of parallel hardness amplification for one-way functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000236909300024"}
