The proposed method is Combinatorial Discrete and Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automata (CDCARLA) which is able to explore and learn to improve control performance without the knowledge of the analytical system model. This paper demonstrates the full details of the CDCARLA technique and compares its performance with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as an efficient evolutionary optimization method. The proposed method has been applied to PID controller design. The simulation results show the superior efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF NOVEL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AUTOMATA APPROACH IN POWER SYSTEM REGULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000272249200020"}
