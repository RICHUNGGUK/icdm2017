However, searching for data by keyword retrieval techniques in information retrieval is not contented with some users' specific needs due to a large number of network resources and users on the Internet. Information extraction is an improvement method which extracts the important specific event or produces specific relations among information from documents. Information extraction can not only filter unnecessary information in any documents but also produce specific important messages and summaries that users are interested in. Business valuation is collecting, analysis, and applying to financial or non-financial integral information to appraise the business value. The evaluated results are used in the commerce pricing for the business decision and intangible assets. There are specific information and events about business valuation stored in the Intelligent financial statements, notes to financial statements, and financial news of Taiwan's companies at present and data is presented by the HTML and PDF files. Hence, we developed an information extraction system of Chinese financial data for business valuation from the domestic business financial statements, notes to financial statements, and financial news as the data sources. We extracted the correct financial data and their corresponding Business Valuation Model to achieve an automatic extraction in the financial data from these different heterogeneous data sources. Users can collect the relevant valid valuation information and learn valuation models concepts within a very short time to improve accuracy and efficiency in text processing quality.
