Many times, the measures are at micro/nano-scale, and based on images of the biological particles. This paper proposes a computational method to geometric measure of biological particles. The method has been applied to DNA microarray spot size estimation. Compared with existing algorithms for microarray spot size estimation, the proposed method is computational efficient and also provides confidence probability on the measure. The contributions of this paper include a generic computational method to geometric measure of biological particles and application to DNA microarray spot size estimation.", "paper_title": "A computational method to geometric measure of biological particles and application to DNA microarray spot size estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240032200002"}
