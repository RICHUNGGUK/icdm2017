This model helps physicians to improve their prognosis, diagnosis or treatment planning procedures. The aim of this paper is to use an Ant Colony-based classification system to extract a set of fuzzy rules for diagnosis of diabetes disease, named FCS-ANTMINER. We will review some recent methods and describe a new and efficient approach that leads us to considerable results for diabetes disease classification problem. FCS-ANTMINER has new characteristics that make it different from the existing methods that have utilized the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for classification tasks. The obtained classification accuracy is 84.24% which reveals that FCS-ANTMINER outperforms several famous and recent methods in classification accuracy for diabetes disease diagnosis.
