Three-dimensional ultrasound computer tomography promises high-quality images of the breast, but is currently limited by a time-consuming image reconstruction. In this work, we investigate the acceleration of the image reconstruction by GPUs and FPGAs. We compare the obtained performance results with a recent multi-core CPU. We show that both architectures are able to accelerate processing, whereas the GPU reaches the highest performance. Furthermore, we draw conclusions in terms of applicability of the accelerated reconstructions in future clinical application and highlight general principles for speed-up on GPUs and FPGAs.", "paper_title": "A comprehensive comparison of GPU- and FPGA-based acceleration of reflection image reconstruction for 3D ultrasound computer tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000331639800012"}
