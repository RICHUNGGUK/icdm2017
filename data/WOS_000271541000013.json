In this improved HHT, the auto-correlation function of the structural response is taken as a substitute of input to reduce noise effect. A band-pass filter scheme and an effective intrinsic mode function (IMF) selection principle are combined to overcome the modal perturbation problem. Based on these, a time-varying system identification procedure is developed. Its robustness and effectiveness are verified by both numerically simulated and laboratory measured vibration data on a scaled concrete-steel composite beam model. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
