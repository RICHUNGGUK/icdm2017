We present an approach to build a sparse kernel classifier by adding constraints to the number of support vectors and to the classifier function. The classifier is considered on Riemannian manifold. And the sparse greedy learning algorithm is used to solve the formulated problem. Experimental results over several classification benchmarks show that the proposed approach can reduce the training and runtime complexities of kernel classifier applied to large datasets without scarifying high classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Building a sparse kernel classifier on Riemannian manifold", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900018"}
