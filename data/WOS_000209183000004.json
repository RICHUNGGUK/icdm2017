A proposal for the implementation of ECA rules is then presented in which several implementation alternatives for different spatio-temporal rule types are considered. Through a series of experiments, these implementation alternatives are evaluated to determine which are most appropriate in each case. The article closes with a discussion of practical uses of these alternatives in earlier studies and a section of concluding remarks.", "paper_title": "How to Manage Spatio-temporal Events in Relational Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000209183000004"}
