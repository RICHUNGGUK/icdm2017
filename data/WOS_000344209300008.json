However, it is not clear how to causally encode a Gaussian sequence under rate constraints while achieving R-D optimality. This problem has significant implications in the design of rate control for video communication. To address this problem, we take distortion fluctuation into account and develop a new theory, called gamma rate theory, to quantify the trade-off between rate and distortion fluctuation. The gamma rate theory implies that, to evaluate the performance of causal rate controls in source coding, the traditional R-D metric needs to be replaced by a new GRD metric. The gamma rate theory identifies the trade-off between quality fluctuation and bandwidth, which is not known previously. To validate the gamma rate theory, we design a rate control algorithm for video coding; our experimental results demonstrate the utility of the gamma rate theory in video coding.
