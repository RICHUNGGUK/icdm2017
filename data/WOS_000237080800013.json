Sample comprises Intranet and Internet teams. The methodology is breakdown analysis. Research framework comprises user-user, user-tool and user-task. The tools include videoconferencing and data conferencing. Transcript coding and qualitative analysis were followed. Procedures include literature review, development of framework, sampling, tool setup and breakdown analysis. Five problem indicators of user-user included unclearness of participant's oral expression, disagreement, off-task, no answer and keep silence. Problem indicators of user-tool were incorrect configuration, unstable facilities and broadband, unfamiliarity with application and facilities. User-task problem indicators included uncompleted task, participant's lateness and ignorance of assigned task. Causes of problems included participant's familiarity, ignorance of task and lateness in meeting. There was no difference of problem indicators between Intranet and Internet connection. Implications included consideration of participant's familiarity, asynchronous communication is in need during inter-meeting and better planning and preparation of facilitator.", "paper_title": "Case study of breakdown analysis on identification of remote team communication problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800013"}
