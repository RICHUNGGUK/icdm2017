The QMOM was shown to be a particular case of a method based on generalized moments (QMoGeM). Then, a weighted-residual method (WRM) based on the generalized moments was derived (WRMoGeM). If it is closed by the Gauss-Christoffel quadrature, the resulting method (QWRMoGeM) was shown to be identical to the QMoGeM, giving the correct representation of QMOM as a WRM. The WRMoGeM formulation was used to derive a new method (DuQMoGeM) that employs two quadrature rules, one for discretizing the particulate system and other to accurately integrate the integrals in the equations for the generalized moments. A Galerkin version of this method was implemented and used to solve several examples with known analytical solutions. The DuQMoGeM solutions for breakage and aggregation problems were shown to be more accurate than the QMOM solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
