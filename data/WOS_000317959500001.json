Survivability is a crucial issue in OFDM-based flexible optical networks. In this paper, we present a survivable multipath provisioning scheme that provides flexible protection levels in OFDM-based flexible optical networks. We define the Static Survivable Multipath Routing and Spectrum Allocation (SM-RSA) problem, which aims to accommodate a given set of demands with minimum utilized spectrum. We show that the static SM-RSA problem is NP-hard and provide an integer linear programming formulation for it. Also, an efficient heuristic algorithm is given to solve the problem. Our simulation results show that the proposed multipath provisioning scheme achieves higher spectral efficiency than the traditional single-path provisioning scheme.", "paper_title": "Survivable Multipath Routing and Spectrum Allocation in OFDM-Based Flexible Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317959500001"}
