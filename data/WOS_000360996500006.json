To control the fault current, a series RLC branch is connected to the secondary side of an isolation series transformer. Based on this RLC branch, two current limiting modes are created. In the first mode, R and C are bypassed via a paralleled power electronic switch (insulated-gate bipolar transistor, IGBT) and L remains connected to the secondary side of the transformer as a DC reactor. In the second mode, the series reactor impedance is not enough to limit the fault current. In this case, the fault current can be controlled by selecting a proper on-off duration of the parallel IGBT, across the series damping resistor (R. and capacitor, which inserts high impedance into the line to limit the fault current. Then, by controlling the magnitude of the DC reactor current, the fault current is reduced and the voltage of the point of common coupling (PCC) is kept at an acceptable level. In addition, in the new SSFCL, the series RC branch, connected in parallel with the IGBT, serves as a snubber circuit for decreasing the transient recovery voltage (TRV) of the IGBT during on-off states. Therefore, the power quality indices can be improved. The measurement results of a built prototype are presented to support the simulation and theoretical studies. The proposed SSFCL can limit the fault current without any delay and successfully smooth the fault current waveform.", "paper_title": "Series transformer based diode-bridge-type solid state fault current limiter", "paper_id": "WOS:000360996500006"}
