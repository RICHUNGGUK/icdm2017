In this framework, we design a novel gradient-based discriminative learning method to learn the potential functions and separable filter banks. We learn MRFSepa models with 2-D and 3-D separable filter banks for the applications of gray-scale/color image denoising and color image demosaicing. By implementing MRFSepa model on graphics processing unit, we achieve real-time image denoising and fast image demosaicing with high-quality results.", "paper_title": "Separable Markov Random Field Model and Its Applications in Low Level Vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000312892000032"}
