We cast image annotation as an output-related multi-task learning framework, with the prediction of each tag's presence as one individual task. Evidently, these tasks are related via dependencies between tags. The proposed joint learning framework, which we call joint SVM, is superior to other related models in its impressive and flexible mechanisms in exploiting the dependencies between tags: first, a linear output kernel can be implicitly learned when we train a joint SVM; or, a pre-designed kernel can be explicitly applied by users when prior knowledge is available. Also, a practical merit of joint SVM is that it shares the same computational complexity as one single conventional SVM, although multiple tasks are solved simultaneously. Although derived from the perspective of multi-task learning, the proposed joint SVM is highly related to structured-output learning techniques, e.g. max-margin regression (Szedmak and Shawe-taylor [1]), structural SVM (Tsochantaridis [2]). According to our empirical results on several image-annotation benchmark databases, our joint training strategy of SVMs can yield substantial improvements, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, over training them independently. In particular, it compares favorably with many other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also develop a \"perceptron-like\" online learning scheme for joint SVM to enable it to scale up better to huge data in real-world practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
