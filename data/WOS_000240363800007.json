The interpretation of these profiles can help re-organize the web portal, e.g., by restructuring the site's content more efficiently, or even to build adaptive web portals, i.e., portals whose organization and presentation change depending on the specific visitor's needs. In this paper, we assume that the pages of the web portal have been prearranged in a number of different categories. We introduce a systematic approach to determine a hierarchy of user profiles from the history of users' accesses to the categories. First, we filter the access log by removing both occasional users and categories of poor interest. Then, we apply an Unsupervised Fuzzy Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (UFDHC) algorithm to cluster the users of the web portal into a hierarchy of fuzzy groups characterized by a set of common interests and each represented by a prototype, which defines the profile of the group typical member. To identify the profile a specific user belongs to, we propose a novel classification method which completely exploits the information contained in the hierarchy. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the UFDHC algorithm to access log data collected over a period of 15 days and use the classification method to associate a profile with the users defined by access log data collected during subsequent 60 days. Finally, we highlight the good characteristics of our system by comparing our results with the ones obtained by applying a profiling system based on a modified version of the fuzzy C-means.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical fuzzy clustering-based system to create user profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000240363800007"}
