We propose a method based on dense matching of parts-based graphical models. For landmark localization, we replace population averaged models by personalized models that are adapted to each test image at runtime. We do so by jointly leveraging weighted combinations of labeled training exemplars. We report results for localizing standard anatomical landmarks in clinical 3D CT volumes, using a database of 83 lung cancer patients. We compare our method against both (baseline) population averaged graphical models and against atlas-based deformable registration and show the method is in each case able to localize landmarks with significantly improved reliability and accuracy.", "paper_title": "Personalized Graphical Models for Anatomical Landmark Localization in Whole-Body Medical Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000348345400003"}
