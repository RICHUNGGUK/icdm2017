We have designed a method targeting the detection of both steganography and seam-carved forgery in JPEG images. We analyze the neighboring joint density of the DCT coefficients and reveal the difference between the untouched image and the modified version. In realistic detection, the untouched image and the modified version may not be obtained at the same time, and different JPEG images may have different neighboring joint density features. By exploring the self-calibration under different shift recompressions, we propose calibrated neighboring joint density-based approaches with a simple feature set to distinguish steganograms and tampered images from untouched ones. Our study shows that this approach has multiple promising applications in image forensics. Compared to the state-of-the-art steganalysis detectors, our approach delivers better or comparable detection performances with a much smaller feature set while detecting several JPEG-based steganographic systems including DCT-embedding-based adaptive steganography and Yet Another Steganographic Scheme (YASS). Our approach is also effective in detecting seam-carved forgery in JPEG images. By integrating calibrated neighboring density with spatial domain rich models that were originally designed for steganalysis, the hybrid approach obtains the best detection accuracy to discriminate seam-carved forgery from an untouched image. Our study also offers a promising manner to explore steganalysis and forgery detection together.", "paper_title": "Improved Approaches with Calibrated Neighboring Joint Density to Steganalysis and Seam-Carved Forgery Detection in JPEG Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000351446900012"}
