We prove a Priestley duality for finite RDP-algebras, and obtain an explicit description of coproducts of finite RDP-algebras. In this light, we give a combinatorial representation of free finitely generated RDP-algebras, which we exploit to construct normal forms, strongest deductive interpolants and most general unifiers.We prove that RDP-unification is unitary, and that the tautology problem for RDP-logic is coNP-complete.", "paper_title": "Finite RDP-algebras: duality, coproducts and logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000304832900004"}
