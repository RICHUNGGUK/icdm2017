This problem plays a decisive role in utilizing nurses efficiently, which is of paramount importance for OR suites to provide high-quality service at ever reduced cost. Due to significant uncertainty in surgery durations, designing schedules that achieve high nurse efficiency is complicated by the competing objective of ensuring on-time starts of surgeries. For trading off between the two performance criteria, we formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) model with explicit probability modeling of uncertainty. We are concerned about improving nurse efficiency in terms of overtime and idle time of nurses while mastering the risk of delay of surgeries. The MIP model is applied in a large size Chinese hospital, and the results are compared with the actual performance of the OR suite. The comparisons reveal that through examining the trade-off between the performance criteria, important nurse efficiency improvements can be achieved with good on-time start performance. Moreover, the applicability of the MIP model in various problem settings is also investigated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
