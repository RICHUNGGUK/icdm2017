The process starts by adding OWL axioms to BioPAX, a pathway interchange standard. The axioms are designed for mapping BioPAX- formatted Reactome interactions to \"molecular binding event\" interactions, which can be easily aligned with the HPRD data. Using an automated OWL reasoner, we find overlapping and non- overlapping molecular interactions between the two pathway datasets. The paper demonstrates the potential of semantic web and its enabling technologies in biological pathway data reasoning and integration. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
