The origin of such superthermal tail in the electron velocity distribution is generally believed due to the second order Fermi acceleration, i.e. the acceleration due to turbulence. In this paper, generation of superthermal electrons is studied by using a 1D PIC simulation code. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
