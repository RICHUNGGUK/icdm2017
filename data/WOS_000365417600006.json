We demonstrate how the Hyland-Tan double glueing construction produces such categories, either with or without units, when applied to any of a large family of degenerate models. This process explains as special cases a number of such models from the literature. In order to achieve this result, we develop a tensor calculus for compact closed categories with finite biproducts. We show how the combinatorial properties required for a fully complete model are obtained by this glueing construction adding to the structure already available from the original category.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTING FULLY COMPLETE MODELS OF MULTIPLICATIVE LINEAR LOGIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000365417600006"}
