However, these methods suffer to some degree from calibration difficulties that make them rather volatile in their implementation and thus render them suspicious to the users of more traditional Monte Carlo methods. In this survey, we study the various improvements and extensions brought on the original ABC algorithm in recent years.", "paper_title": "Approximate Bayesian computational methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000310232000002"}
