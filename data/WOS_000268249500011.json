In recent years many interpolation algorithms have been proposed for image magnification, but all of them have defects to some degree, such as jaggies and blurring. To solve these problems, we propose applying post-processing which consists of edge-aware level set diffusion and bilateral filtering. After the initial interpolation, the contours of the image are identified. Next, edge-aware level set diffusion is applied to these significant contours to remove the jaggies, followed by bilateral filtering at the same locations to reduce the blurring created by the initial interpolation and level set diffusion. These processes produce sharp contours without jaggies and preserve the details of the image. Results show that the overall RMS error of our method barely increases while the contour smoothness and sharpness are substantially improved.", "paper_title": "Edge-Aware Level Set Diffusion and Bilateral Filtering Reconstruction for Image Magnification", "paper_id": "WOS:000268249500011"}
