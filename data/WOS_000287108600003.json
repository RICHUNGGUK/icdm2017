A new Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem is formulated and solved in a decentralized way via appropriate algorithms implemented at the users (primal) and/or links (dual). For the dual algorithm, delay-independent and delay-dependent stability conditions are derived when propagation delays are taken into account. A system with voice and data traffic is considered as example and the properties of the congestion control algorithm are assessed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
