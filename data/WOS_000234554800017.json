The Single Expansion Ramp Nozzle (SERN) configuration studied here consists of flat ramp and a cowl with different combinations of ramp angle and cowl geometry. Using PARAS 3D, simulations are performed for a free stream Mach number of 6.5 that constitutes the external flow around the vehicle. Appropriate specific heats ratio has been simulated for the jet and free stream flow. External shock wave due to jet plume interaction with free stream flow, the internal barrel shock wave and the shear layer emanating from the cowl trailing edge and sidewalls are well captured. Wall static pressure distribution on the nozzle ramp for different nozzle expansion angles has been computed for both with and without side fence. Axial thrust and normal force have been evaluated by integrating the wall static pressure. Effect of cowl length variation and side fence on the SERN performance has also been studied and found to be quite significant. Based on this study, an optimum ramp angle at which the SERN generates maximum axial thrust is obtained. SERN angle of 20 degrees was found to be optimum when the flight axis coincides with nozzle axis.", "paper_title": "Numerical flow visualization of a single expansion ramp nozzle with hypersonic external flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000234554800017"}
