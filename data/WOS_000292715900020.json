Design/methodology/approach - Potential distributions and current flow paths in highly anisotropic composite materials were studied via numerical simulation and experimentally. Simplified composite panels with two plyes were analysed using a finite-element model; the predictions were then confirmed experimentally. Findings - The unexpected twisting equipotential surfaces and current flow patterns were found to be consistent with minimising of Joule heat release in the material. Numerical modelling suggests that the twisted profiles of the potential are highly sensitive to the anisotropic electrical conductivity. Originality/value - This paper discusses the reverse current flows witnessed in a two-layer anisotropic system. Such behaviour has never been predicted or observed experimentally before. The reported results will be of interest to anyone who is considering using anisotropic materials such as carbon fibre composites which might experience applied potential difference, such as lightning strikes.", "paper_title": "Transport properties and current flow patterns in homogeneous strongly anisotropic materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000292715900020"}
