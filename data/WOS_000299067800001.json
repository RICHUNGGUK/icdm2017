Analysis is carried out using a global three-dimensional modeling of the soil-micropiles-structure system. The soil behavior is described using the non-associated Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Both micropiles and the superstructure are modeled as 3D beam elements. Proper boundary conditions are used to ensure the wave transmission through the lateral boundaries of the soil mass. Analyses are first conducted for harmonic loading and then for a real earthquake record. They show that the inclination of micropiles leads to a good mobilization of their axial component and consequently to an important decrease in the shearing and bending loading. Since micropiles work mainly with the axial component, the use of inclined micropiles in seismic area presents an interesting alternative. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
