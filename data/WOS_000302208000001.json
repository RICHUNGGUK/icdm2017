In this paper, dynamic behaviour of bolted joints is modelled and their parameters are identified using experimentally measured data. A thin layer of virtual elasto-plastic material is used to model the joint contact interface. In identification of the thin layer parameters, nonlinear responses measured at constant force amplitudes are used. The identified model predictions at different load levels are compared with corresponding measured responses. Good agreement is achieved between the two sets indicating successful parameterisation and identification of the joint interface model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
