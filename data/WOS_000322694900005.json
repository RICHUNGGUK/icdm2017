In a 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge vehicle, such a defect remained hidden during more than 300 miles of test-driving, manifesting for the first time during the competition. With this incident as an example, the authors discuss formalisms and techniques available for safety analysis of cyber-physical systems.", "paper_title": "Verifying Cyber-Physical Interactions in Safety-Critical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000322694900005"}
