The constructed sequences have the property that, in a specified zone, the out-of-phase autocorrelation and cross-correlation values are all equal to -1. Due to this property, such sequences are suitable for quasi-synchronous code-division multiple access (QS-CDMA) systems.", "paper_title": "New Families of Binary Low Correlation Zone Sequences Based on Interleaved Quadratic Form Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078600042"}
