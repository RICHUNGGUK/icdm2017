Based on the bias of samples in the uniform design sampling (UDS) point set, the crossover operation in GA is redesigned. Using the concentrations of antibodies in artificial immune system (AIS), the chromosomes concentration in GA is defined and the clonal selection strategy is designed. In order to solve the maximum clique problem (MCP), an new immune GA (UIGA) is presented based on the clonal selection strategy and UDS. The simulation results show that the UIGA provides superior solution quality, convergence rate, and other various indices to those of the simple and good point GA when solving MCPs.", "paper_title": "An new immune genetic algorithm based on uniform design sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000303129200008"}
