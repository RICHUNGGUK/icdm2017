This paper documents the branch-and-cut framework integrated into GloMIQO 2. Cutting planes are derived from reformulation-linearization technique equations, convex multivariable terms, BB convexifications, and low- and high-dimensional edge-concave aggregations. Cuts are based on both individual equations and collections of nonlinear terms in MIQCQP. Novel contributions of this paper include: development of a corollary to Crama's [Concave extensions for nonlinear 0-1 maximization problems, Math. Program. 61 (1993), pp. 53-60] necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a cut dominating the termwise relaxation of a bilinear expression; algorithmic descriptions for deriving each class of cut; presentation of a branch-and-cut framework integrating the cuts. Computational results are presented along with comparison of the GloMIQO 2 performance to several state-of-the-art solvers.", "paper_title": "Dynamically generated cutting planes for mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programs and their incorporation into GloMIQO 2", "paper_id": "WOS:000345371800009"}
