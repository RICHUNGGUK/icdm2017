Instead of discarding data with missing values, the network can be trained from data with up to 60% of their class labels and 25% of attribute values missing, while able to make class prediction with over 90% accuracy for the benchmark datasets used. The proposed algorithm is compared to three variants of semi-supervised K-means learning on four real-world benchmark datasets and showed comparable performance and better generalisation.
