When the species of interest decay via unimolecular or pseudo-unimolecular steps, the evolution equations can be directly written in integral form by application of the convolution method (CM). The CM as presently developed is not applicable when the species of interest decay by one or more bimolecular processes. In this work the CM is extended by developing a completely general integral formulation. This approach allows obtaining approximate solutions to any desired degree of accuracy. Several examples of application are presented, including Henri-Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics.", "paper_title": "Extending the Convolution Method: A General Integral Formalism for Chemical Kinetics.
