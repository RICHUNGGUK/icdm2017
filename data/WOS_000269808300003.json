Currently, two theories exist to explain the psychological phenomenon of performance degradation under pressure: the distraction theory and the explicit-monitoring theory. However, neither provides a detailed mechanistic explanation of the exact processes involved. We propose such a detailed theory within the CLARION cognitive architecture that takes into account motivation and the interaction between explicit and implicit processes. We then use our theory to provide a plausible explanation of some existing data. The data are simulated using the theory within the CLARION cognitive architecture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
