A novel method to update sensitivity information is suggested to improve the computational efficiency in this brief note. Firstly, both the approximate insensitive terms and approximate linear terms in sensitivity information are identified, and then their values are temporarily kept constant for multiple multidisciplinary design optimization cycles. A practical engineering case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A method to improve computational efficiency for CSSO and BLISS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291254600005"}
