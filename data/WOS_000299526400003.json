This paper investigates the problem of survivable dynamic connection provisioning in general telecom backbone networks, that are mesh structured. We assume differentiated services where connections may have different availability requirements, so they may be provisioned differently with protection (if needed) based on their availability requirements and current network state. The problem of effectively provisioning differentiated-service requests, that has been widely investigated for connections routed at the physical layer, assumes peculiar features if we consider sub-wavelength requests at the logical layer that have to be protected (or more generically, whose availability target has to be guaranteed), but also have to be groomed for an efficient use of network resources. An integrated multilayer approach is necessary that considers requirements and grooming of connections at the logical layer as well as their routing and availability at the physical layer. Joint availability-guaranteed routing and traffic grooming may lead to a negative interaction, since the objective of the first problem (guaranteeing a given level of availability to the connections) clashes with the objective of the other problem (minimizing resource consumption). For a multilayer WDM mesh network, we propose new multilayer routing strategies that perform effective availability-guaranteed grooming of sub-wavelength connections. These strategies jointly considers connection availability satisfaction and resource optimization and are developed under two different practical hypotheses: guaranteed target, i.e., a connection is routed only if its availability target is satisfied, and best-effort target, a connection is always routed and, when the availability target cannot be guaranteed, the path with the best possible availability is provisioned. Numerical results are reported and discussed for the two approaches mentioned above. In both cases, the results show high effectiveness of our provisioning strategy.", "paper_title": "Multilayer Protection with Availability Guarantees in Optical WDM Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299526400003"}
