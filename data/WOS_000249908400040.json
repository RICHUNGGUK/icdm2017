The stable regions with respect to the delay parameters are also formulated. Based on these results, we investigate the stability issue of a class of delayed neural networks that can be transformed into linear time-variant systems, and then several new global asymptotical stability criteria are exploited. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
