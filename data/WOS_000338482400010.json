This paper presents an innovative visualization environment: Visual Information Retrieval Tool for Upfront Evaluation (VIRTUE), which eases and makes more effective the experimental evaluation process. Methods: VIRTUE supports and improves performance analysis and failure analysis. Performance analysis: VIRTUE offers interactive visualizations based on well-known IR metrics allowing us to explore system performances and to easily grasp the main problems of the system. Failure analysis: VIRTUE develops visual features and interaction, allowing researchers and developers to easily spot critical regions of a ranking and grasp possible causes of a failure. Results: VIRTUE was validated through a user study involving IR experts. The study reports on (a) the scientific relevance and innovation and (b) the comprehensibility and efficacy of the visualizations. Conclusion: VIRTUE eases the interaction with experimental results, supports users in the evaluation process and reduces the user effort. Practice: VIRTUE will be used by IR analysts to analyze and understand experimental results. Implications: VIRTUE improves the state-of-the-art in the evaluation practice and integrates visualization and IR research fields in an innovative way. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
