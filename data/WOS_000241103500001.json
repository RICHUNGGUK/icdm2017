This dream is generally considered infeasible, but some surprising developments in the US over the past three years have led to the funding of several short-term investigations into whether and how much the best current practices in Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, when combined, actually enable this dream. This paper very briefly describes one of these efforts, the Learning by Reading project at ISI, which has converted a high school textbook of Chemistry into very shallow logical form and is investigating which semantic features can plausibly be added to support the kinds of inference required for answering standard high school text questions.", "paper_title": "Learning by reading: An experiment in text analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500001"}
