The results show that a very small number of indicators may lead to a robust prediction of about 75% of the cases. We start with 12 indicators to build a few composite indicators by factor analysis. Following a discrete choice model, we arrive at 3 comparatively good predicative models. We conclude that these models have a surprisingly good predictive power and may help peers in their selection process.", "paper_title": "Definition of a Model Based on Bibliometric Indicators for Assessing Applicants to Academic Positions", "paper_id": "WOS:000335582300010"}
