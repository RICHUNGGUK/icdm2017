The delays are assumed to vary in intervals, and delay-dependent exponential stability conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. To reduce conservativeness, a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is designed to contain more complete state information, so that a derivation procedure with time-varying delays treated as uncertain parameters can be adopted. Usage of slack variables and inequalities are refrained as much as possible when bounds on the Lyapunov derivative are sought. The stability criteria are tested by two popular numerical examples, with less conservative results obtained in all the checked cases. Besides, a practical application of the derived conditions is illustrated.", "paper_title": "Exponential stability analysis of linear systems with multiple successive delay components", "paper_id": "WOS:000320356300010"}
