Due to the importance of sensor nodes in such applications, a certain level of protection needs to be provided to them. We study the self-protection problem for static wireless sensor networks in this paper. The self-protection problem focuses on using sensor nodes to provide protection to themselves instead of the target objects or certain target area so that the sensor nodes can resist the attacks targeting them directly. A wireless sensor network is p-self-protected if at any moment, for any wireless sensor (active or nonactive), there are at least p active sensors that can monitor it. The problem of finding the minimum p-self-protection is NP-complete, and no efficient self-protection algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we provide efficient centralized and distributed algorithms with a constant approximation ratio for the minimum p-self-protection problem in sensor networks with either a homogeneous or heterogeneous sensing radius. In addition, we design efficient distributed algorithms to not only achieve p-self-protection but also maintain the connectivity of all active sensors. Our simulation confirms the performances of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Efficient algorithms for the p-self-protection problem in static wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258642200010"}
