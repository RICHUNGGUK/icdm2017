A dominating set S is called minimal when there does not exist a node i is an element of S such that the set S - {i} is a dominating set. In this paper, we propose a new self-stabilizing algorithm for minimal dominating set. It has safe convergence property under synchronous daemon in the sense that starting from an arbitrary state, it quickly converges to a dominating set (a safe state) in two rounds, and then stabilizes in a minimal dominating set (the legitimate state) in O(n) rounds without breaking safety during the convergence interval, where n is the number of nodes. Space requirement at each node is O(log n) bits.", "paper_title": "Self-Stabilizing Algorithm for Minimal Dominating Set with Safe Convergence in an Arbitrary Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000367594300006"}
