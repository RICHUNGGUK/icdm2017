Specifically designed spatiotemporal indexing techniques are used in the mining of STCOPs. These include versions of two well-known spatiotemporal trajectory indexing techniques: the scalable and efficient trajectory index and Chebyshev polynomial indexing. We present a framework, STCOP-MINER, implementing a filter-and-refine STCOP mining algorithm, with the indexing techniques mentioned for efficiently performing data analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
