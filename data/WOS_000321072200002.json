This work presents a formal design methodology based on model checking that generates all the mediator designs that meet requirements specified by a user. The methodology allows the user to explore the designs in search of the mediator that offers the best theoretical performance. Markov models of various measures of performance are considered. Each measure may result in a different ranking of the mediator designs (from best to worst for example). From these rankings the user can select the design that at least theoretically best fits the purpose. The novelty of this work is the use of model checking and Markov analysis in a single formal framework to generate, explore, and select from a set of provably-correct mediators-while still in the design stage of development.", "paper_title": "A design methodology for verified web-service mediators", "paper_id": "WOS:000321072200002"}
