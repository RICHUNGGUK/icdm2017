First, the method embeds the corresponding domain ontology of search keyword to find web pages front the Internet. Next, consider the location of the keywords in the web pages, and relations between keywords and concepts in the domain ontology to find the features of the web pages. Then, the web pages were clustered based on the similarity values of mapping keywords concept-ontology level relations. Primary experimental results prove that our method is effective to find related web pages.", "paper_title": "WEB PAGES CLUSTER BASED ON THE RELATIONS OF MAPPING KEYWORDS TO ONTOLOGY CONCEPT HIERARCHY", "paper_id": "WOS:000278688700030"}
