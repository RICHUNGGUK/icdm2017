It shows that using a zero-forcing beamforming combined with a low complexity aircraft grouping strategy, the SDMA-based mechanism is able to improve the spectrum efficiency under signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) constraints.", "paper_title": "SDMA-Based Aeronautical Machine-to-Machine Communications under SINR Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000329714900001"}
