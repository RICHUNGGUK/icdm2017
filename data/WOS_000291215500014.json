In this research, three different recognition models were developed based on Continuous Hidden Markov Model (CHMM), and could distinguish left and right lane change intention from normal lane keeping intention. Subjects performed lane change maneuvers and lane keeping maneuvers with driving simulator which simulated highway scenes, parameters that highly correlated with lane change behavior were collected and analyzed. A series of testings and comparisons were done to obtain the optimal model structure and feature set. Results show that, taking the steering wheel angel, steering wheel angle velocity and lateral acceleration as the optimal observation signals, the accuracy can achieve up 95%, and it proved very effective in terms of early intention recognition.", "paper_title": "Driver Intention Recognition Method Using Continuous Hidden Markov Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000291215500014"}
