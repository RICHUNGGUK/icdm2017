RSFQ circuit technology is one of the strongest candidates for the next generation technology of digital circuits. For representing logic functions, we use a root-shared binary decision diagram (RSBDD) which is a directed acyclic graph constructed from binary decision diagrams. In the method, first we construct an RSBDD from given logic functions, and then reduce the number of nodes in the constructed RSBDD by variable re-ordering. Finally, we synthesize a dual-rail RSFQ circuit from the reduced RSBDD. We have implemented the method and have synthesized benchmark circuits. We have synthesized dual-rail circuits that consist of about 27% fewer logic elements than those synthesized by a Transduction-based method on average.", "paper_title": "Logic synthesis method for dual-rail RSFQ digital circuits using root-shared binary decision diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703300029"}
