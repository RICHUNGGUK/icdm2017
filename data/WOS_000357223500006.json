The conical magnetic bearing realizes the stable suspension and translational control in three directions, when rotor starts at being suspended, because the rotor is not always oriented at the equilibrium point, the initial air gaps in radial and axial direction are not uniform, especially for the conical magnetic bearing whose axial air gap is designed as cone-shape, the suspensions in the radial and axial directions are coupling, so the obvious vibrations are measured. But when the rotor is forced to locate at the equilibrium position by the magnetic force, the coupling and mutual disturbance between axial and radial direction are eliminated. The Lorehtz magnetic bearing can ensure the maximum tilting angle of rotor reaches 1.7; moreover, it make the magnetically suspended rotor realize continual tilting control based on the experimental results.
