It has been identified that abrupt changes in the human genome play a vital role in the progression and development of many complex diseases. In this study we propose two distinct hybrid algorithms that combine efficient sequential change-point detection procedures (the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure and the cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) procedure) with the Cross-Entropy method, which is an evolutionary stochastic optimization technique to estimate both the number of change-points and their corresponding locations in aCGH data. The proposed hybrid algorithms are applied to both artificially generated data and real aCGH experimental data to illustrate their usefulness. Our results show that the proposed methodologies are effective in detecting multiple change-points in biological sequences of continuous measurements.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Algorithms for Multiple Change-Point Detection in Biological Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000350427300004"}
