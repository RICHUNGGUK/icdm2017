This is an integration work. The MMALE method utilizes Moment of Fluid (MOF) capability with interface reconstruction for multi-material modeling of immiscible fluids. It is of the explicit time-marching Lagrange plus remap type. In the Lagrangian phase, the staggered compatible discretization for Lagrangian gas dynamics is used also with Tipton's pressure relaxation model for the closure of mixed cells. For the remapping phase, an improved second-order cell-intersection-based method for three-dimensional unstructured mesh is presented. It is conservative for remapping cell-centered variables such as density and internal energy. It is suitable for remapping between two meshes with different topology. By using this remapping method, the new material centroid position in the rezoned cells can be geometrically computed. This enables it to be combined with the MOF algorithm for constructing a second-order MMALE method. The MMALE method can be implemented on three-dimensional unstructured hexahedral meshes. Numerical results have proved the accuracy and robustness of the MMALE method. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
