Because of its inherent complexity, moving object detection still faces lots of challenges. In this paper, based on the existing research achievements, the methods of moving object detection in dynamic environment are studied deeply, a knowledge-based flexible edge matching algorithm is put forward. The effectiveness of the proposed matching algorithm in moving object detection is also demonstrated. The research results here can be provided as the reference for target detection and tracking and some other applications.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF FLEXIBLE EDGE MATCHING ALGORITHM IN THE FIELD OF MOVING OBJECT DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000341990500005"}
