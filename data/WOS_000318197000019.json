To reach the desired trade-off between delay and throughput, all potential trees should be explored to obtain a tree with the proper topology. Since the number of extractable tree topologies from a given network graph is enormous, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to explore the search space and find a good enough trade-off between per-node, as well as network-wide delay and throughput. In the proposed GA approach, we use the Pruefer code tree representation followed by novel genetic operators. First, for each individual tree topology, we obtain expressions analytically for per-node delay and throughput. Based on the required quality of service, the obtained expressions are invoked in the computation of fitness functions for the genetic approach. Using a proper fitness function, the proposed algorithm is able to find the intended trees while different constraints on delay and throughput of each node are imposed. Employing a GA approach leads to the exploration of this extremely wide search space in a reasonably short time, which results in overall scalability and accuracy of the proposed tree exploration algorithm.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithm approach for QoS-based tree topology construction in IEEE 802.16 mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000318197000019"}
