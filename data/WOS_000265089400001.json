To achieve atomicity, a service composition should satisfy the atomicity sphere, a structural criterion for the backend processes of involved services. Existing analysis techniques for the atomicity sphere generally assume complete knowledge of all involved backend processes. Such an assumption is invalid when some service providers do not release all details of their backend processes to service consumers outside the organizations. To address this problem, we propose a process algebraic framework to publish atomicity-equivalent public views from the backend processes. These public views extract relevant task properties and reveal only partial process details that service providers need to expose. Our framework enables the analysis of the atomicity sphere for service. compositions using these public views instead of their backend processes. This allows service consumers to choose suitable services such that their composition satisfies the atomicity sphere without disclosing the details of their backend processes. Based on the theoretical result, we present algorithms to construct atomicity-equivalent public views and to analyze the atomicity sphere for a service composition. Two case studies from the supply chain and insurance domains are given to evaluate our proposal and demonstrate the applicability of our approach.", "paper_title": "Atomicity Analysis of Service Composition across Organizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089400001"}
