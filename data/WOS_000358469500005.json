Advances in multi-core processors further complicate the endeavor by introducing hardware diversity and intra-node contention. As an attempt to quantify performance for partitioning refinement, we propose a model that predicts execution times of iterative mesh-based applications running on heterogeneous multi-core clusters. Apart from considering resource heterogeneity, the model takes into account hierarchical communication characteristics, overlap between computation and communication, as well as performance penalties due to intra-node contention. We present a detailed methodology on how to obtain key parameters from a real system and highlight potential pitfalls of conventional approaches in obtaining the parameters. Experiments were conducted using a synthetic application benchmark solving a partial differential equation. Evaluation shows a good agreement between actual time measurement and the performance model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
