Recently, considerable research has been conducted in order to potentially automate signal classification for assisting in disease diagnosis. However, the biosignal type (ECG, EEG, EMG or other) needs to be known prior to the classification process. If the given biosignal is of an unknown type, none of the existing methodologies can be utilized. In this paper, a blind biosignal classification model ((BSC)-S-2 Model) is proposed in order to identify the source biosignal type automatically, and thus ultimately benefit the diagnostic decision. The approach employs time series algorithms for constructing the model. It uses a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm with clustering to discover the similarity between two biosignals, and consequently classifies disease without prior knowledge of the source signal type. The empirical experiments presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as well as the scalability of the approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
