This works proposes a collaborative benchmarking framework to measure and compare the performance of different MBS simulation methods. The framework is made up of two main components: (a) an on-line repository of test problems with reference solutions and standardized procedures to measure computational efficiency and (b) a prototype implementation of a collaborative web-based application to collect, organize and share information about performance results in an intuitive and graphical form. The proposed benchmarking framework has been tested to evaluate the performance of a commercial MBS simulation software, and it proved to be an effective tool to collect and analyze information about the numerous factors which affect the computational efficiency of dynamic simulations of multibody systems.", "paper_title": "A collaborative benchmarking framework for multibody system dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000273979100001"}
