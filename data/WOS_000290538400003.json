With potential applications to these areas such as ultra wide bandwidth time hopping code division multiple access radio systems, multi-user and sonar systems, the design of quasi-synchronous time/frequency hopping code division multiple access systems by employing low hit zone hopping sequences has attracted wide attentions. In this paper, we present three construction methods for the low Hamming correlation zone frequency hopping sequences. The parameters of these sets of frequency hopping sequences with low hit zone are new and flexible. The constructed sequences are almost optimal and optimal respectively with respect to the Peng-Fan-Lee bounds. The simplicity of this technique makes it attractive for practical use.", "paper_title": "New designs of frequency hopping sequences with low hit zone", "paper_id": "WOS:000290538400003"}
