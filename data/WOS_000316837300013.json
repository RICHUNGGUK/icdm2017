A cutset X is called an R-g-cutset if every component of G - X has at least g 1 vertices. If G has at least one R-g-cutset, the g-extraconnectivity of G is then defined as the minimum cardinality over all R-g-cutsets of G. In this paper, we first show that the 2-extraconnectivity of an n-dimensional hypercube-like network is 3n - 5 for n >= 5. This improves on the previously best known result, which showed that the 2-extraconnectivity of an n-dimensional hypercube-like network is 3n 5 for n >= 8. We further demonstrate that the 3-extraconnectivity of an n-dimensional hypercube-like network is 4n - 9 for n >= 6. Based on the above results, the 2-extraconnectivity and 3-extraconnectivity of several interconnection networks, including hypercubes, twisted cubes, crossed cubes, Mobius cubes, locally twisted cubes, generalized twisted cubes, recursive circulants, and Mcubes, can be determined efficiently.
