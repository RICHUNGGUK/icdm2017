Although wrapper input cells can be enhanced with two memory elements to address this problem, this will incur a large test area overhead. This paper proposes a novel architecture for broadside two-pattern test of core-based SOCs without any loss in fault coverage and without increasing the size of the wrapper input cells. The proposed solution combines the dedicated bus-based test access mechanism and functional interconnects for test data transfer in order to provide full controllability of the wrapper input cells in the two consecutive clock cycles required by two-pattern testing. New algorithms for test access mechanism design and test scheduling are proposed and design trade-offs between test area and testing time are discussed using experimental results.", "paper_title": "DFT infrastructure for broadside two-pattern test of core-based SOCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235477000010"}
