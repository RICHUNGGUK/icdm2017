Using human-centred design, we first investigated the Tablet functions within learner wants and needs based on their reading experiences, analysed each function and its correlation to reading satisfaction, and obtained a basis for evaluation. We next employed the 10 functions demonstrating the highest importance to complete a prototyping design. Finally, based on the technology acceptance model, we employed experimental methods to verify the prototype using the post-test-only control group design. The results of the study indicate that for perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, reading and using attitudes, and behaviour intentions, the average scores for the improved Tablet were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those for the original version.", "paper_title": "Promoting in-depth reading experience and acceptance: design and assessment of Tablet reading interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000335849100006"}
