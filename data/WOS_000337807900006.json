A simple explanation of this phenomenon may be provided by using the concept of hidden entanglement (HE), which signals the presence of entanglement that may be recovered without the help of nonlocal operations. Here we discuss the link between HE and the (non-Markovian) flow of classical information between the system and the environment.", "paper_title": "Hidden entanglement, system-environment information flow and non-Markovianity", "paper_id": "WOS:000337807900006"}
