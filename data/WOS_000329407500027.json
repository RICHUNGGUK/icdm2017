A key property of this scheme is that the prior knowledge of the upper bound of the system uncertainties is not required. An adaptive RBF neural network controller is used to learn the unknown upper bound of model uncertainties and external disturbances. The adaptive RBF neural network is incorporated into the adaptive sliding mode control in the Lyapunov sense, and the stability of the proposed adaptive neural sliding mode control can be established. The dynamics and angular velocities of gyroscope can be identified in real time. Numerical simulations are investigated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive neural sliding mode control scheme, showing that the designed control system has better robust performance in its insensitivity to system nonlinearities; moreover, system parameters including angular velocity can be consistently estimated and tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically.", "paper_title": "Robust adaptive neural sliding mode control of MEMS triaxial gyroscope with angular velocity estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500027"}
