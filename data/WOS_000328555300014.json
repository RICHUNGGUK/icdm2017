The conventional branch-line coupler structure is adapted to multiband operation by shunting its four ports with multiband reactive networks. The performance of the proposed multiband couplers is theoretically analyzed and optimized through the even-odd mode circuit analysis. Dual-band (2.4-3.5 GHz), triple-band (1.5-2.4-4.2 GHz), and quad-band (1.5-2.4-3.5 GHz) microstrip branch-line couplers have been realized and tested to verify the design method. The good experimental results (input return loss greater than 15 dB and amplitude imbalance lower than 0.7 dB) show excellent agreement with theoretical and simulated ones, thus validating the proposed approach.
