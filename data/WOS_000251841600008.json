Wireless video sensor networks are gaining popularity due to numerous potential applications such as video surveillance, environmental and habitat monitoring, and so on. However, due to the limited battery available in wireless video sensor nodes, provisioning of QoS in such a network is a challenging, task. We provide a survey on the major issues related to QoS provisioning in wireless video sensor networks and possible solution approaches. A dynamic power management framework is proposed for a wireless video sensor node to improve energy saving performance so that the lifetime of the sensor node can be increased. This framework considers the video traffic arrival process in the sensor node, the sleep and wakeup processes in the camera and wireless transceiver electronics, the queue status, and the wireless channel condition. Performance analysis results show that the proposed mechanism can achieve considerable energy saving in a sensor node while providing a target level of QoS performance.", "paper_title": "QoS provisioning in wireless video sensor networks: A dynamic power management framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000251841600008"}
