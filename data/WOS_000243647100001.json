First, the nonlinear system is identified off-line by RBF-ARX model possessing linear ARX model structure and state-dependent Gaussian RBF neural network type coefficients. On the basis of the RBF-ARX model, a combination of a local linearization model and a polytopic uncertain linear parameter-varying (LPV) model are built to approximate the present and the future system's nonlinear behavior, respectively. Subsequently, based on the approximate models, a min-max robust MPC algorithm with input constraint is designed for the output-tracking control of the nonlinear system with unknown steady state. The closed-loop stability of the MPC strategy is guaranteed by the use of parameter-dependent Lyapunov function and the feasibility of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulation study to a NO(x) decomposition process illustrates the effectiveness of the modeling and robust MPC approaches proposed in this paper. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
