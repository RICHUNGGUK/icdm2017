A survey has been administrated to 805 prospective or novice secondary teachers attending TFA and PAS courses in Italy. The main result of the quantitative data analysis reveals how teachers still have little consideration for the potential of interactive and collaborative technology. The implications for teacher education and suggestions for teacher belief change and technology integration are discussed.", "paper_title": "Teachers training and technology integration in the classroom: future teachers still no \"social\"?", "paper_id": "WOS:000374584800003"}
