The numerical method is based on the transformation of the integro-differential equation into an integral equation, and then applying a collocation method to solve the latter. The collocation points are chosen as the Chebyshev nodes. Uniform convergence of the resulting method is then discussed. Numerical examples are presented and solved by the numerical techniques.", "paper_title": "A collocation method for solving singular integro-differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000281790600011"}
