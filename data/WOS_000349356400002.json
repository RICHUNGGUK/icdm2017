This paper presents an empirical study, towards a general and solid approach for fast detection of fire and flame in videos, with the applications in video surveillance and event retrieval. Our system consists of three cascaded steps: (1) candidate regions proposing by a background model, (2) fire region classifying with color-texture features and a dictionary of visual words, and (3) temporal verifying. The experimental evaluation and analysis are done for each step. We believe that it is a useful service to both academic research and real-world application. In addition, we release the software of the proposed system with the source code, as well as a public benchmark and data set, including 64 video clips covered both indoor and outdoor scenes under different conditions. We achieve an 82 % Recall with 93 % Precision on the data set, and greatly improve the performance by state-of-the-arts methods.", "paper_title": "Towards a solid solution of real-time fire and flame detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356400002"}
