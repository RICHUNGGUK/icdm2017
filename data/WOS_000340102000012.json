We concentrate on pure interpolation and build smooth polynomial interpolators by first extending the monomial (polynomial) basis and then minimizing a measure of roughness with respect to the extra parameters in the extended basis. Algebraic methods can help in choosing the extended basis. We get arbitrarily close to optimal smoothing for any dimension over an arbitrary region, giving simple models close to splines. We show in examples that smooth interpolators perform much better than straight polynomial fits and for small sample size, better than kriging-type methods, used, for example in computer experiments.", "paper_title": "Smooth supersaturated models", "paper_id": "WOS:000340102000012"}
