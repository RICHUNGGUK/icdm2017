It is shown that the general service availability problem is undecidable, i.e. there is no single algorithm to determine whether a given service in a given system is available at a given time. In restricted cases, it is shown that the problem is decidable, but is NP-complete. The problem of service availability is then extended to nondeterministic systems. Finally, it is shown that a number of important cases can be studied in a cohesive manner based on our proposed formalism.", "paper_title": "Service availability in concurrent systems - Part II: Analysis and case studies using HSIP", "paper_id": "WOS:000250049000003"}
