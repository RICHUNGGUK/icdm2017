A feedback controlled simulation model of an actual DVR in operation in the US is developed to perform case studies. Validity of this model is established by comparing the waveforms from the model with field measurements. issues relating to maximization of a DVR in the vicinity of power factor correction capacitors are analyzed. Some considerations regarding the placement of capacitors in the vicinity of a DVR are drawn based on the simulation models. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
