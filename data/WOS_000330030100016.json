But in the real world, face images are always affected by variations in illumination conditions and different facial expressions. So, the fuzzy two-dimensional local graph embedding analysis algorithm is proposed, in which the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor is implemented to achieve the distribution local information of original samples. Experimental results on the ORL, Yale face and on the PolyU palmprint databases show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy two-dimensional local graph embedding discriminant analysis (F2DLGEDA) with its application to face and palm biometrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100016"}
