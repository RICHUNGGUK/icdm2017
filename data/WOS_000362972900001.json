The visualization and quantification of nanoparticles (NPs) inside the organs of interest pose a significant challenge and therefore, novel image processing approaches are required for a better diagnosis. The purpose of this work was to develop a novel approach for better visualization and quantification of iron oxide NPs in three dimension (3D) high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images of an inflammatory model. The proposed procedure focuses on the extraction of NPs from the background surrounding it. It is applied on 2D and 3D images and is based on pre-processing and segmentation by automatic threshold to visualize the NPs inside the mouse calf using a control set of images of the same calf before injecting the NPs. The resulting visualization of the 3D distribution of iron oxide NPs inside the inflamed area of the calf has a potential in the advancement of NPs application in nanomedicine therapy and diagnosis.", "paper_title": "3D Visualization of iron oxide nanoparticles in MRI of inflammatory model", "paper_id": "WOS:000362972900001"}
