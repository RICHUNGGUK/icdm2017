Semantic annotations-we prefer the term descriptions-are expressed in a description language that combines object-oriented features, taxonomical inheritance and temporal aggregations. The descriptions that are produced from several types of content related to the same theater play are synchronized at several levels of granularity providing rich relationships between the narrative structure of the text of the play and the narrative structure of the digitized theater performances. Two applications for multimedia access and navigation are presented in this paper, namely Dual Players, a navigation application that allows to synchronously play acts and scenes of two recordings; and Synthesizer that produces a raw publication of a new audiovisual document on the basis of the recordings.", "paper_title": "Multimedia applications for playing with digitized theater performances", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200030"}
