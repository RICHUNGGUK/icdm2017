The design philosophy of many important hash functions, such as MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-2, originated from that of MD4. We propose an improved preimage attack on one-block MD4 with the time complexity 2(95) MD4 compression function operations, as compared to the 2(107) (1) complexity of the previous attack by Aoki et al. (SAC 2008). The attack is based on previous methods, but introduces new techniques. We also use the same techniques to improve the pseudo-preimage and preimage attacks on Extended MD4 with 2(25.2) and 2(12.6) improvement factor, as compared to previous attacks by Sasaki et al. (ACISP 2009). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Improved preimage attack on one-block MD4", "paper_id": "WOS:000301630700017"}
