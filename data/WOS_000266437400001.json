For this purpose, a large set of tone-reproduction operators is currently available. However, it is unclear which operator is most suitable for any given task. In addition, different tasks may place different requirements upon each operator. In this paper we evaluate several tone-reproduction operators using a paradigm that does not require the construction of a real high dynamic-range scene, nor does it require the availability of a high dynamic-range display device. The user study involves a task that relates to the evaluation of contrast, which is an important attribute that needs to be preserved under tone reproduction.", "paper_title": "Perceptual Evaluation of Tone-Reproduction Operators Using the Cornsweet-Craik-O'Brien Illusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000266437400001"}
