Many birdwatching assistant systems have been developed. However, most of them do not have any intelligence and cannot tolerate noises either. A bird identification system, BirdID is proposed and implemented. To identify birds, BirdID imitates bird experts to automatically direct birdwatchers to provide features. It also tries to list the most likely species after each feature is entered. In BirdID, entropy and fuzzy similarity are used to select most appropriate queried features and calculate similarity, respectively, which makes BirdID more intelligent and noise-tolerant. The experiments on a dataset with 106 species show that BirdID works well. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
