Several document analysis tasks require merging or splitting certain document elements to form others. The suitability of the commonly used precision and recall for such division/aggregation tasks is arguable, since their underlying assumption is that the granularity of the items at input is the same as at output. We propose a new pair of evaluation metrics that better suit document analysis' needs and show their application to several table tasks. In the process, we present a number of robust table location algorithms with which we draw a road-map for creating Hidden Markov Models for the task.", "paper_title": "Metrics for evaluating performance in document analysis: application to tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000287757000011"}
