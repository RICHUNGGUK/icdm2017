We propose Hose Rate Control (HRC), a novel scheme to control the speed at which peers offer chunks to other peers, ultimately controlling peer uplink capacity utilization. This is of critical importance for heterogeneous scenarios like the one faced in the Internet, where peer upload capacity is unknown and varies widely. HRC nicely adapts to the actual peer available upload bandwidth and system demand, so that Quality of Experience is greatly enhanced. To support our claims we present both simulations and actual experiments involving more than 1000 peers to assess performance in real scenarios. Results show that HRC consistently outperforms the Quality of Experience achieved by non-adaptive schemes. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
