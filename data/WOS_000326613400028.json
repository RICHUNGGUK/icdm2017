It is specialized and has a leading position in calculation of molecular properties with a large world-wide user community (over 2000 licenses issued). In this paper, we present a performance characterization and optimization of Dalton. We also propose a solution to avoid the master/worker design of Dalton to become a performance bottleneck for larger process numbers. With these improvements we obtain speedups of 4x, increasing the parallel efficiency of the code and being able to run in it in a much bigger number of cores. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
