For the plane slab, the proposed method relies upon the formulation of an eigenvalue problem associated to the Schur complement. This leads to highly accurate upper bounds for the eigenvalue. For the cylindrical configuration, a direct application of this formulation is possible, however, it cannot be rigourously justified. Therefore in this case the proposed method relies on a specialized technique based on a method proposed by Zimmermann and Mertins. It turns out that this technique is also applicable for finding accurate complementary bounds in the case of the plane slab. Convergence rates for both approaches are established.", "paper_title": "Eigenvalue enclosures and convergence for the linearized MHD operator", "paper_id": "WOS:000310992400002"}
