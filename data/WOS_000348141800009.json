The keys include supporting multi-modes of various coding schemes (e.g., VSF-OFCDM, OFDM, OFDMA), multiple-input multiple-output, relay networks, and so on. To balance loads among different communication interfaces is one of the most important issues that should be addressed for achieving efficient radio resource allocations. In a shared packet service, the 3GPP UMTS adopts the VSF-OFCDM interface to allocate orthogonal codes of an OVSF code tree in two-dimension (2D) spreading at the time and frequency domains. However, it easily leads to high packet loss rate and high bandwidth waste rate, because it does not consider interference and the adaptive modulation and coding scheme simultaneously. Conversely, although the LTE/LTE-advanced interface offers a high data rate, it suffers from unbalanced loads and moderate reward. This paper thus proposes an adaptive radio resource allocation for balancing loads between the UMTS and LTE/LTE-advanced interfaces according to various interference and mobility environments. In addition, an adaptive multi-code allocation is proposed for the UMTS to minimize the bandwidth waste rate while guaranteeing quality of service. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other approaches in fractional reward loss and system utilization.
