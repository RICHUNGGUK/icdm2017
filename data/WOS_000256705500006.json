One of the steps in mapping an application onto such a parallel platform involves scheduling the communication on the network-on-chip. This paper presents different scheduling strategies that minimize resource usage by exploiting all scheduling freedom offered by networks-on-chip. It also introduces a technique to take the dynamism in applications into account when scheduling the communication of an application on the network-on-chip while minimizing the resource usage. Our experiments show that resource-utilization is improved when compared to existing techniques. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
