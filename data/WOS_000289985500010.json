Therefore, the contribution of the paper is twofold. First, hierarchical stochastic metamodels based on moving least squares and spectral decomposition (by polynomial chaos expansion) are proposed in order to obtain a complete description of the random responses with respect to the deterministic and random input parameters. Then, these metamodels are incorporated into a novel multiobjective reliability-based formulation leaning on the concept of probabilistic nondominance. The whole procedure is applied to an analytical test case as well as to the design optimization of space truss structures, demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to provide accurate solutions at an affordable computational time.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical stochastic metamodels based on moving least squares and polynomial chaos expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000289985500010"}
