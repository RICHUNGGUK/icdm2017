Two specific scalings are studied: in the first, just the arrival rates are linearly scaled by (for large ), whereas in the second in addition the Markovian background process is sped up by a factor , for some . In both regimes (transient and stationary) tail probabilities decay essentially exponentially, where the associated decay rate corresponds to that of the probability that the sample mean of i.i.d. Poisson random variables attains an atypical value.", "paper_title": "Tail asymptotics of a Markov-modulated infinite-server queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000343932300003"}
