While the problem is notoriously hard (not even reasonably approximable) in the worst case, the average case (with respect to such distributions) often turns out to be \"easy\". Semi-random models mediate between these two extremes and are more suitable to imitate \"real-life\" instances than purely random models. In this work we consider semi-random variants of the planted k-colorability distribution. This continues a line of research pursued by Coja-Oghlan, and by Krivelevich and Vilenchik. Our aim is to study a more general semi-random framework than those suggested so far. On the one hand we show that previous algorithmic techniques extend to our more general semi-random setting: on the other hand we give a hardness result, proving that a closely related semi-random model is intractable. Thus we provide some indication about which properties of the input distribution make the k-colorability problem hard. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
