A concept of primary importance in both frameworks is that of constraint propagation. In this paper we study and compare the amount of propagation that can be achieved, using various methods, when translating a problem from one framework into another. Our results complement, extend, and tie together recent similar studies. We provide insight as to which translation is preferable, with respect to the strength of propagation in the original problem and the encodings.", "paper_title": "Propagation in CSP and SAT", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400011"}
