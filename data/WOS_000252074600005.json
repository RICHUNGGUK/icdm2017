Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence systems face the challenge of performing tasks that are typically human, highly subjective, and eventually social. The present paper introduces an architecture which is capable of evaluating aesthetic characteristics of artifacts and of creating artifacts that obey certain aesthetic properties. The development methodology and motivation, as well as the results achieved by the various components of the architecture, are described. The potential contributions of this type of systems in the context of digital art are also considered. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
