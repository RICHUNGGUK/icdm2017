The proposed video compression scheme determines the quantization strategy of each macroblock according to its perceptual impact on the human visual system (HVS). We also propose art oblivious multipurpose watermarking, algorithm for this VQ based video compression scheme. The robust and fragile watermarks are embedded into the compressed video stream for copyright protection and content authentication respectively. We embed the robust watermark based on the polarities of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients, which does not introduce any distortion to the original video. The fragile watermark is embedded in VQ indices by utilizing the codebook partition strategy. The proposed video compression and watermarking algorithms are simulated in detail. Both spatial and temporal attacks are performed to evaluate the robustness and fragility of the proposed multipurpose watermarking algorithm.", "paper_title": "A COMPRESSED DOMAIN MULTIPURPOSE VIDEO WATERMARKING ALGORITHM USING VECTOR QUANTIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700027"}
