Ludwig integral combining with stationary phase method is used to calculate the integral of induced currents. In addition, the computational efficiency is significantly improved using grouping of the MOM region and interpolation of critical points. Two numerical examples are calculated. Compared with the results calculated by other algorithms, such as MOM and conventional NURBS MOM-PO, the proposed method shows great capability to solve this particular problem precisely. The listed execution time consumed in different methods demonstrates the high efficiency of this approach. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
