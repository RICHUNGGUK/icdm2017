In particular, we propose a novel personalized approach for effectively handling unfair ratings of sellers provided to buyer agents from other buyers (called advisors). Our approach offers flexibility for buyers to weight their value for private and public knowledge about advisors. A personalized approach is proposed as well for buyers to model the trustworthiness of sellers, based on the advice provided. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively model trustworthiness for both advisors and sellers, even when there are large numbers of unfair ratings. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
