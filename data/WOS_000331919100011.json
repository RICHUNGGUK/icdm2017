The method is sixth-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time. The resulting matrix at each ADI computation step corresponds to a triple-tridiagonal system which can be effectively solved with a considerable saving in computing time. In practice, Richardson extrapolation is exploited to increase the temporal accuracy. The unconditional stability is proved by means of Fourier analysis for two dimensional convection diffusion problems with periodic boundary conditions. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, the present method preserves the higher order accuracy for convection-dominated problems.
