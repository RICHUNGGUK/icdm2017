In this paper, we estimate the benefits of using content-based image retrieval (CBIR) on article figures to augment traditional access to articles. Methods: We selected four high-impact (JCR) 2005. Figures were automatically extracted from the PDF article files, and manually classified on their content and number of sub-figure panels. We make a quantitative estimate by projecting from data from the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (Image-CLEF) campaigns, and qualitatively validate it through experiments using the Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) project. Results: Based on 2077 articles with 11,753 pages, 4493 figures, and 11,238 individual images, the predicted accuracy for article retrieval may reach 97.08%. Conclusions: Therefore, CBIR potentially has a high impact in medical literature search and retrieval.", "paper_title": "Content-based Image Retrieval for Scientific Literature Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000269435700011"}
