Our algorithms use a sparse-matrix representation of the blurring operation, which allows us to easily handle several different boundary conditions. We also include robust stopping rules for the iterations. The performance of our algorithms is illustrated with examples.", "paper_title": "Rotational image deblurring with sparse matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000342210300005"}
