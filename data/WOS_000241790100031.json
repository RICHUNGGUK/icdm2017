Based on the results of the acoustic research on Mandarin, a novel algorithm using fundamental frequency was proposed, adding the principle of frequency bands selection. Using this principle FO was encoded only in the selected frequency bands, which was confirmed effectively in acoustic simulation experiments with white noise or mixed speech environment. Compared with the traditional algorithm which only transmitted envelope cues, this novel strategy achieved remarkable improvement no matter adopting Mandarin vowels, words, sentences or mixed sentences. What's more, the amount of transmission in this algorithm decreased to 62.5% compared with similar algorithms which transmit fundamental frequency in full channels.", "paper_title": "A novel speech processing algorithm for cochlear implant based on selective fundamental frequency control", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100031"}
