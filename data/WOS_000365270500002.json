The user specifies a backbone 3R chain in five task configurations in the sketch mode of the solid modeler and executes the design system. Two RR constraints are computed, which constrain the 3R chain to a single degree-of-freedom six-bar linkage. There are six ways that these constraints can be added to the 3R serial chain to yield as many as 63 different linkages in case of planar six-bar linkages and 165 in case of spherical six-bar linkages. The performance of each candidate is analyzed, and those that meet the required task are presented to the designer for selection. The design algorithm is run iteratively with random variations applied to the task configurations within user-specified tolerance zones, to increase the number of candidate designs. The output is a solid model of the six-bar linkage. Examples are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy for both planar and spherical linkages.", "paper_title": "A Design System for Six-Bar Linkages Integrated With a Solid Modeler", "paper_id": "WOS:000365270500002"}
