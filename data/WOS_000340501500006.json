First, a bi-level decision model, together with its modeling approach, are developed to describe the gaming relationship between decision makers in a company (service provider) and its customers. Then, a practical solution approach to reaching solutions for the bi-level-modeled customer churn problem is developed. Finally, experiments and case studies are conducted to illustrate the bi-level decision model and the solution approach.", "paper_title": "A BI-LEVEL DECISION MODEL FOR CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340501500006"}
