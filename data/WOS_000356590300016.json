Due to destruction and noise incurred by complex topography and varied illumination in planetary images, a robust crater recognition approach is proposed based on dictionary learning with a low-rank error correction model in a sparse representation framework. In this approach, all the training images are learned as a compact and discriminative dictionary. A low-rank error correction term is introduced into the dictionary learning to deal with gross error and corruption. Experimental results on crater images show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance in both recognition accuracy and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Dictionary Learning with Low-Rank Error Model for Robust Crater Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000356590300016"}
