By extending the semantics of finite-state two-way automata (possibly with pebbles) from languages of words to languages of tiles, we obtain a complete characterization of the classes REG and MSO. In particular, we show that adding pebbles strictly increases the expressive power of two-way automata recognizing languages of tiles, but the hierarchy induced by the number of allowed pebbles collapses to level one.", "paper_title": "Two-way Automata and Regular Languages of Overlapping Tiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000367315300003"}
