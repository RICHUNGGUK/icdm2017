Machine learning (ML) methods, with several reported successful applications, have gained popularity for software cost estimation in recent years. Data preprocessing has been claimed by many researchers as a fundamental stage of ML methods; however, very few works have been focused on the effects of data preprocessing techniques. Objective: This study aims for an empirical assessment of the effectiveness of data preprocessing techniques on ML methods in the context of software cost estimation. Method: In this work, we first conduct a literature survey of the recent publications using data preprocessing techniques, followed by a systematic empirical study to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of individual data preprocessing techniques as well as their combinations. Results: Our results indicate that data preprocessing techniques may significantly influence the final prediction. They sometimes might have negative impacts on prediction performance of ML methods. Conclusion: In order to reduce prediction errors and improve efficiency, a careful selection is necessary according to the characteristics of machine learning methods, as well as the datasets used for software cost estimation.
