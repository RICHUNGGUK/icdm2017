In this paper, answering a problem posed by Castiglione and Vaglica [6], we prove that the class of L-convex polyominoes is tiling recognizable. To reach this goal, first we express the L-convexity constraint in terms of a set of independent properties, then we show that each class of convex polyominoes having one of these properties is tiling recognizable.
