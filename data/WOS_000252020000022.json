The reference facial point data are extracted from the pre-stored CT images; the floating facial point data are captured from range-scanning equipment. A modified soft-shape-context ICP including an adaptive dual AK-D tree for searching the closest point and a modified shape-context objective function is used to register the floating data to reference data to provide the geometric relationship for a medical assistant system and pre-operative training. The adaptive dual AK-D tree searches the closest-point pair and discards insignificant control coupling points by an adaptive distance threshold on the distance between the two returned closest neighbor points which are searched by using AK-D tree search algorithm in two different partition orders. In the objective function of ICP, we utilize the modified soft-shape-context information which is one kind of projection information to enhance the robustness of the objective function. Experiment results of using touch and non-touch capture equipment to capture floating point data are performed to show the superiority of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "A modified soft-shape-context ICP registration system of 3-D point data", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020000022"}
