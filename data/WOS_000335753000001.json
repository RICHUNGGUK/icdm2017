We find a two-distance set consisting of 416 points on the unit sphere which cannot be partitioned into 83 parts of smaller diameter. This also reduces the smallest dimension in which Borsuk's conjecture is known to be false. Other examples of two-distance sets with large Borsuk numbers are given.", "paper_title": "On Borsuk's Conjecture for Two-Distance Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000335753000001"}
