Traditional age-ordered associative load queues are complex, inefficient, and power hungry. In this paper, we introduce two new dependence checking schemes with different design tradeoffs, but both explicitly rely on timing information as a primary instrument to rule out dependence violation. Our timing-centric designs operate at a fraction of the energy cost of an associative LQ and achieve the same functionality with an insignificant performance impact on average. Studies with parallel benchmarks also show that they are equally effective and efficient in a chip-multiprocessor environment.", "paper_title": "Replacing Associative Load Queues: A Timing-Centric Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000263526500005"}
