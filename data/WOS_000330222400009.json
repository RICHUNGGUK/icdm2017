Ambiguous or incorrect diagnosis results lead to long debug times and even wrong repair actions, which significantly increase repair cost. We propose a smart diagnosis method based on multikernel support vector machines (MK-SVMs) and incremental learning. The MK-SVM method leverages a linear combination of single kernels to achieve accurate faulty-component classification based on the errors observed. The MK-SVMs thus generated can also be updated based on incremental learning, which allows the diagnosis system to quickly adapt to new error observations and provide even more accurate fault diagnosis. Two complex boards from industry, currently in volume production, are used to validate the proposed diagnosis approach in terms of diagnosis accuracy (success rate) and quantifiable improvements over previously proposed machine-learning methods based on several single-kernel SVMs and artificial neural networks.", "paper_title": "Board-Level Functional Fault Diagnosis Using Multikernel Support Vector Machines and Incremental Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000330222400009"}
