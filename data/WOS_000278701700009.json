Consistent with previous work by some of the authors, we use trace semantics to describe the effect of workflow computations, and we show how they can be used to describe the new features in the Taverna 2 model (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved", "paper_title": "A formal semantics for the Taverna 2 workflow model", "paper_id": "WOS:000278701700009"}
