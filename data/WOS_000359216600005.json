Recent approaches have shown that a general approach is possible by learning application-specific models from examples; however, learning models sophisticated enough to generate high-quality images is computationally expensive, and so specific per-application or per-dataset models are impractical. To solve this problem, we present an efficient semi-local approximation scheme to large-scale Gaussian processes. This allows efficient learning of task-specific image enhancements from example images without reducing quality. As such, our algorithm can be easily customized to specific applications and datasets, and we show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach across five domains: single-image super-resolution for scene, human face, and text images, and artifact removal in JPEG- and JPEG 2000-encoded images.", "paper_title": "Efficient Learning of Image Super-Resolution and Compression Artifact Removal with Semi-Local Gaussian Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000359216600005"}
