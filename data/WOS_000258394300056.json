A discrete sine transform is used alternately with a discrete cosine transform in order to greatly compact the energy of the signal when the correlation coefficients of the signal are in the range of -0.5 to 0.5. Therefore, the discrete sine transform is suggested to be used in conjunction with the discrete cosine transform in H.264/AVC. The alternative transform selecting the optimal transform between two transforms by using rate-distortion optimization shows a coding gain compared with H.264/AVC. The proposed method achieves a PSNR gain of up to 1.0 dB compared to JM 10.2 at relatively high bitrates.", "paper_title": "Alternative transform for residual blocks in H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300056"}
