Most visualization software achieves these goals by mapping properties of sampled intensity values and their derivatives to color and opacity. In this work, we propose to explicitly study the local frequency distribution of intensity values in broader neighborhoods centered around each voxel. We have found frequency distributions to contain meaningful and quantitative information that is relevant for many kinds of feature queries. Our approach allows users to enter predicate-based hypotheses about relational patterns in local distributions and render visualizations that show how neighborhoods match the predicates. Distributions are a familiar concept to nonexpert users, and we have built a simple graphical user interface for forming and testing queries interactively. The query framework readily applies to arbitrary spatial data sets and supports queries on time variant and multifield data. Users can directly query for classes of features previously inaccessible in general feature detection tools. Using several well-known data sets, we show new quantitative features that enhance our understanding of familiar visualization results.", "paper_title": "Distribution-Driven Visualization of Volume Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000267814500004"}
