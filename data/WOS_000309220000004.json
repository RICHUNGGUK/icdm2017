The proposed grouping-proof protocols recently have security and/or privacy omission and these schemes afford order-dependence by relaying message among tags through an RFID reader. In consequence, aiming at enhancing the robustness, improving scalability, reducing the computation costs on resource-constrained devices, and meanwhile combing Computational Intelligence (CI) with Secure Multiparty Communication (SMC), a Forward-Secure Grouping-Proof Protocol (FSGP) for multiple RFID tags based on Shamir's (n, n) secret sharing is proposed. In comparison with the previous grouping-proof protocols, FSGP has the characteristics of forward-security and order-independence addressing the scalability issue by avoiding relaying message. Our protocol provides security enhancement, performance improvement, and meanwhile controls the computation cost, which equilibrates both security and low cost requirements for RFID tags.", "paper_title": "A Forward-secure Grouping-proof Protocol for Multiple RFID Tags", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000004"}
