The proposed Netlist-Driven Evolutionary Refurbishment technique utilizes design-time information from the circuit netlist to constrain the search space of the algorithm by up to 98.1 percent in terms of the chromosome length representing reconfigurable logic elements. This facilitates refurbishment of relatively large-sized FPGA circuits as compared to previous works. Hence, the scalability issue associated with Evolvable Hardware-Based refurbishment is addressed and improved. Experiments are conducted with multiple circuits from the MCNC benchmark suite to validate the approach and assess its benefits and limitations. Successful refurbishment of the apex4 circuit having a total of 1,252 LUTs with 10 percent spares is achieved in as few as 633 generations on average when subjected to simulated randomly injected single stuck-at faults. Moreover, the use of design-time information about the circuit undergoing refurbishment is validated as means to increase the tractability of dynamic evolvable hardware techniques.", "paper_title": "Scalable FPGA Refurbishment Using Netlist-Driven Evolutionary Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000321221000005"}
