However, image defects, such as spotlight, uniformity, and Mura defects, can impair the quality of an LCD. This research examined human perceptions of region-Mura and used Response Time and subjective markdown price to indicate the various severity levels of region-Mura that appeared at different display locations. The results indicate that, within a specific Mura Level range, the Mura's location has a considerable impact on perceived quality (p < 0.001). Mura on the centers of LCDs have more impact than Mura on the corners of LCDs. Not all peripheral Mura were considered to be equal; participants chose different price markdown prices for LCDs with Mura in lower corners than they chose for LCDs with Mura in upper corners. These findings suggest that a manufacturer should establish a scraping threshold for LCDs based on information regarding Mura location to avoid the production waste from scrapping those LCDs, and should rotate the panel to position the most severe Mura in the lower part of the display to obtain a better perceived quality.
