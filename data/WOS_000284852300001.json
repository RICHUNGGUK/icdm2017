By using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and It's differential formula, several new sufficient conditions guaranteeing the global robust exponential stability are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and less conservativeness of our results.", "paper_title": "New Results on Robust Exponential Stability of Uncertain Stochastic Neural Networks with Mixed Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000284852300001"}
