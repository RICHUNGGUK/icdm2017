It is proved that in classical two-valued logic system, Lukasiewicz fuzzy logic system and the RO-fuzzy logic system, respectively, the concept of consistency degrees of theories defined by the divergence degrees of theories in [X.N. Zhou, G.J. Wang, Consistency degrees of theories in some systems of propositional fuzzy logic, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 152 (2005) 321-331; H.J. Zhou, G.J. Wang, A new theory index based on deduction theorems in several logic systems, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157(2006) 427-443] is reasonable and can accurately measure the consistency degrees of theories. The concept of the degree of entailment of a contradiction from a theory is generalized by replacing the contradiction with a general formula and then the generalized consistency degrees of theories w.r.t. general formulas in the above-mentioned logic systems is established.
