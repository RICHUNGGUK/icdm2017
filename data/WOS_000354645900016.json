Design/methodology/approach - A homogeneous human body model is built and a representative wireless inductive charging system is used for the exposure assessment. The numerical simulation relies on finite element method with formulations in terms of the magnetic vector potential. The electromagnetic fields in terms of magnetic flux density and electric field are computed in the human body and compared with the electromagnetic exposure limits. Findings - It has been found that the induced EMFs in the near-field exposure configuration greatly comply with the safety guidelines. Originality/value - This study could help the development of the wireless inductive charging system with meeting the safety standard of radiation protection.", "paper_title": "Electromagnetic fields in body by wireless inductive system", "paper_id": "WOS:000354645900016"}
