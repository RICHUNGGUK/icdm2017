In the work presented here, we introduce a new docking algorithm called PLANTS (Protein-Ligand ANT System), which is based on ant colony optimization. An artificial ant colony is employed to find a minimum energy conformation of the ligand in the protein's binding site. We present the effectiveness of PLANTS for several parameter settings as well as a direct comparison to a state-of-the-art program called GOLD, which is based on a genetic algorithm. Last but not least, results for a virtual screening on the protein target factor Xa are presented.", "paper_title": "PLANTS: Application of ant colony optimization to structure-based drug design", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100022"}
