The energy penalty caused by heterogeneous mixing can be eliminated by decreasing the temperature approach between hot and cold streams through indirect heat transfer before mixing, so that the mixing can remain as a means of direct heat transfer when synthesizing heat-integrated water networks. Based on the non-isothermal mixing rules, one can make full use of direct heat transfer by mixing to obtain a simpler network structure and avoid the possibility of an energy penalty caused by improper non-isothermal mixing.
