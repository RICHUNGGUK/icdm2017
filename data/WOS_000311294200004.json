Specifically, we show that the partition function is hard for the complexity class #RH Pi(1) under approximation-preserving reducibility. Thus, it is as hard to approximate the partition function as it is to find approximate solutions to a wide range of counting problems, including that of determining the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph. Our proof exploits the first-order phase transition of the \"random cluster\" model, which is a probability distribution on graphs that is closely related to the q-state Potts model.", "paper_title": "Approximating the Partition Function of the Ferromagnetic Potts Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000311294200004"}
