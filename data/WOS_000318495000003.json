The results obtained lead to a solution for fuzzy linear programming problems that does not require their conversion into crisp linear programming problems. We then study the ranges of values we can achieve so that when changes to the data of the problem are introduced, the fuzzy optimal solution remains invariant. Finally, we obtain the optimal value function with fuzzy coefficients in each case, and the results are described by means of numerical examples.", "paper_title": "The dual simplex method and sensitivity analysis for fuzzy linear programming with symmetric trapezoidal numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000318495000003"}
