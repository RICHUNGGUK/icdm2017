The numerical computations with the standard topographic density of 2.67 g/cm(3) show that the maximum and minimum of the separations are estimated to 5.47 m and -0.11 m on the Tibet plateau and in the Indian Ocean, respectively. These estimates do not consider possible topographic density variations, which result in topographic bias changes proportional to the topographic elevation squared. Assuming such density changes of 10% from the standard value, the separation may change up to 5 dm.", "paper_title": "Quasigeoid-to-geoid determination by EGM08", "paper_id": "WOS:000305461100002"}
