The decision to invest is a difficult one with serious adverse selection risk and surrounded with uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to propose a cardinality constrained Fuzzy Goal Programming (FGP) model to deal with such a complex scenario. A FGP model does not require any assumptions on the probability distribution, better fitting with the characteristics of the Venture Capital market. The developed model is illustrated through a numerical example which uses data taken from an Italian venture capital fund.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Goal Programming Model for Venture Capital Investment Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000361634300006"}
