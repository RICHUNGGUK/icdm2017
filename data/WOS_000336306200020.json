Four equilibrium structures, the three-membered ring (1), the four-membered ring (2), the \"classical\" silane (3), and the linear (4) structures, were located. Their energies are in the order of 4>3>1>2. To exploit the stability of HP=SiLiF, the insertions reaction of 2 and HP=Si into C-Cl have been investigated, respectively. The results show that the insertion of HP=Si is more favorable. To compare with the saturated silylenoid, the insertion reaction of H2SiLiF was also investigated. The calculations indicate that the insertion of HP=SiLiF (2) is more favorable. The unsaturated siylenoid HP=SiLiF has similar reaction characters to saturated silylenoid H2SiLiF and silylene HP=Si.", "paper_title": "Computational investigations on the electronic and structural properties of the unsaturated silylenoid HP=SiLiF", "paper_id": "WOS:000336306200020"}
