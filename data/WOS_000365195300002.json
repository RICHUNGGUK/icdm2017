However, we still lack knowledge on and need to identify antecedents and determinants of object-based beliefs in order to understand how the belief formation process works and how it can be influenced. Our research builds on and extends Markus and Silver's (2008) concepts of functional affordance and symbolic expression to examine how IT-related factors influence the formation of beliefs. To test our research model, we surveyed 183 users of a student information system. The proposed model was supported, offering evidence that values, meaning, and functional affordances provided by an IT system positively affect information quality and system quality.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Functional Affordances and Symbolic Expressions on the Formation of Beliefs", "paper_id": "WOS:000365195300002"}
