Our method consists of three steps. The topology singularity is first eliminated on the binary grids so that a topology correct mesh M-0 can be easily constructed. After that, the shape of M-0 is refined, and its connectivity is iteratively optimized into M-n. The shape refinement is governed by the duplex distance fields derived from the input binary volume model. However, the refined mesh surface lacks sharp edges. Therefore, we employ an error-controlled variational shape approximation algorithm to segment M-n into nearly planar patches and then recover sharp edges by applying a novel segmentation-enhanced bilateral filter to the surface. Using the technique presented in this paper, smooth regions and sharp edges can be automatically recovered from raw binary volume models without scalar field or Hermite data Compared to other related surface recovering methods on binary volume, our algorithm needs less heuristic coefficients.", "paper_title": "Extracting manifold and feature-enhanced mesh surfaces from binary volumes", "paper_id": "WOS:000258643000006"}
