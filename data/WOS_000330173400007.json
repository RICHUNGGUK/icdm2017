Based on the claims made in the chapter, the present paper seeks to evaluate the distinctly Kantian scope of the chapter from a rather unconventional viewpoint: while in sympathy with the author's doubts 'against' digital philosophy, we follow a different route. We turn our attention to the concept of construction as used in the book with the hope of raising some additional questions that might contribute to a better understanding of what is at stake in Floridi's experimental epistemological response to digital ontology.", "paper_title": "Rethinking Construction: On Luciano Floridi's 'Against Digital Ontology'", "paper_id": "WOS:000330173400007"}
