However emotions may be included in human's utterance even if emotion expressions are not in it. In this paper, we proposed an emotion estimation algorithm for conversation sentence. We gave the rules of emotion occurrence to 1616 sentence patterns. In addition, we developed a dictionary which consisted of emotional words and emotional idioms. The proposed method can estimate emotions in a sentence by matching the sentence pattern of emotion occurrence and the rule. Furthermore, we can get two or more emotions included in the sentence by calculating emotion parameter. We constructed the experiment system based on the proposed method for evaluation. We analyzed weblog data including 253 sentences by the system, and conducted the experiment to evaluate emotion estimation accuracy. As a result, we obtained the estimation accuracy of about 60%.", "paper_title": "Emotion estimation system based on emotion occurrence sentence pattern", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300113"}
