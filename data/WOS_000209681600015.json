In this letter, we consider the case of imperfect CSI with bounded errors and derive a capacity lower bound of the channel using IA. We show that this lower bound is within 1 bps/Hz of the capacity of the perfect CSI case up to a certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which we refer to it as the saturating SNR. Further, we introduce a new metric called modified DoF (mDoF) in order to characterize the multiplexing performance of IA with imperfect CSI at finite SNR. Simulation results for the 3-user case are provided to illustrate the region within which the actual capacity of IA falls.", "paper_title": "Capacity Analysis of Interference Alignment With Bounded CSI Uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681600015"}
