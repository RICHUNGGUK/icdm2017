A major factor for successful game development is the adequate control of the game's difficulty. This paper discusses justification for dynamic difficulty adaption for Parkour games. It presents an adaptive mechanism for difficulty adjustment in response to the player's run-time performance in the single player mode. The mechanism is based on game content generation techniques, considering constrains for mobile screens. Both the functionality of the game's objects and the player's psychological and behavioral inclinations are taken into consideration. Our preliminary experiment shows that game experiences are significantly enhanced with the adaption mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
