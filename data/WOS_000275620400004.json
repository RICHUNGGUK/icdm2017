While the new technologies have capabilities to provide end-to-end guaranteed quality of service (QoS), the lack of inter-operability between different technologies, administrative areas and control planes makes inter-domain peering and provisioning below the conventional Internet Protocol (IP) layer a challenge. In this survey, we analyze various multi-domain routing models for emerging Layer 2 and WDM switched networks which have been proposed till date, and based on that survey, we highlight some open issues and future challenges pertaining to scalability, reliability, multi-domain QoS, control plane interworking and dynamic peering.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Inter-Domain Peering and Provisioning Solutions for the Next Generation Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000275620400004"}
