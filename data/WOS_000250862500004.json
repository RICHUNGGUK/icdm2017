Such devices combine experimental simplicity with unsurpassed versatility in designing con. ning potentials. We will show how combining magnetic microtraps with optical lattices one can realize many possible quantum systems of interest in many fields ranging from solid state physics to condensed matter. We will also illustrate new possibilities in the quantum simulation of different physical systems.", "paper_title": "Magnetic microtraps for quantum control", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862500004"}
