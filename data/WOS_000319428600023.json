In particular, most information on CNV available so far was obtained in Caucasian and Yoruba populations, and little is known about CNV in Asian populations. This article presents a database that provides CNV regions tagged by single nucleotide polymorphisms in about 4700 Koreans, which were detected under strict quality control, manually curated and experimentally validated.", "paper_title": "KGVDB: a population-based genomic map of CNVs tagged by SNPs in Koreans", "paper_id": "WOS:000319428600023"}
