Studies show that serious games have a potential of creating learning environments to better reach the educational and training goals. The game design characteristics and game elements are need to be explored in detail for increasing the expected benefits of the gaming environments. In this study, the effect of competition, one of the design elements of game environments, on learning is analyzed experimentally. The study is conducted with 142 students. The results of this study show that when a competition environment is created in a serious game, motivation and post-test scores of learners improve significantly. The results of this study are expected to guide the serious game designers for improving the potential benefits of serious games. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
