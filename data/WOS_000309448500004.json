Existing air indexing schemes for data broadcast have focused on energy efficiency (reducing tuning time) only. On the other hand, existing broadcast scheduling schemes have aimed at reducing access latency through nonflat data broadcast to improve responsiveness only. Not much work has addressed the energy efficiency and responsiveness issues concurrently. In this paper, we propose a fast data access scheme concurrently supporting energy saving protocol that constructs the broadcast channels according to the access frequency of each type of message in order to improve energy efficiency in mobile devices (MDs). The pinwheel scheduling algorithm (PSA) presented in this paper is used to organize all types of messages in the broadcast channel in the most symmetrical distribution in order to reduce both the tuning and access time. The performance of the proposed mechanism is analyzed, and the improvement over existing methods is demonstrated numerically. The results show that the proposed mechanism is capable of improving both the tuning and access time due to the presence of skewness in the access distribution among the disseminated messages.
