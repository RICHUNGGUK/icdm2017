Many routing schemes, which use the constrained energy available at sensor nodes more efficiently, have been presented. A lot of these routing schemes try to find the optimal paths to optimize the energy utilization at a sensor node. We take the view that the network survivability is an important metric for measuring the network lifetime. For an energy-aware, routing scheme in WSNs, it is necessary to use the sub-optimal paths occasionally to increase the network survivability. In this paper, we present a new network lifetime definition and formulate the energy-aware routing problem with defined network lifetime. And then we propose an energy-aware routing scheme with the node relay willingness for WSNs, which considers routing packets not only through the sensor nodes with sufficient energy reserves, but also through the light-loaded nodes. Simulation results show that the network lifetime of the proposed algorithm is longer than that of the routing algorithm considering the energy reserves only.", "paper_title": "An energy-aware routing scheme with node relay willingness in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247493400007"}
