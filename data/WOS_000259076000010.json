Atanassov, Intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 20 (1986) 87-96], has been used in a wide range of applications, such as logic programming, medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, and decision making, etc. However, so far there has been little investigation of the clustering techniques of IFSs. In this paper, we define the concepts of association matrix and equivalent association matrix, and introduce some methods for calculating the association coefficients of IFSs. Then, we propose a clustering algorithm for IFSs. The algorithm uses the association coefficients of IFSs to construct an association matrix, and utilizes a procedure to transform it into an equivalent association matrix. The lambda-cutting matrix of the equivalent association matrix is used to cluster the given IFSs. Moreover, we extend the algorithm to cluster interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs), and finally, demonstrate the effectiveness of our clustering algorithm by experimental results.
