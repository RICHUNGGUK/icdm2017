ACK loss requires the source to retransmit the corresponding data packet. However, in underwater wireless sensor networks which prefer flooding-based routing protocols, the source node has redundant chances to receive the ACK segment since multiple copies of the ACK segment can arrive at the source node along multiple paths. Since existing RTO calculation algorithms do not consider inherent features of underlying routing protocols, spurious packet retransmissions are unavoidable. Hence, in this letter, we propose a new ACK loss-aware RTO calculation algorithm, which utilizes statistical ACK arrival times and ACK loss rate, in order to reduce such retransmissions.", "paper_title": "ACK Loss-Aware RTO Calculation Algorithm over Flooding-Based Routing Protocols for UWSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141300017"}
