Worldwide, the walls are usually broadly used as main bearing capacity vertical elements in prefabricated residential timber buildings. Designers or producers usually face the important dilemma of using the best sheathing board with regard to the height and location of a building. The presented research thus aims at comparing the results obtained through calculations made on test samples covered with either fibre-plaster or wood-based sheathing boards. Therefore, the presented conclusions, supported by the measured results, propose some important indications in behaviour of the timber-framed wall elements under a horizontal load covered with different sheathing boards and present some useful recommendations in designing of tall timber-framed buildings located on heavy windy or seismic area.
