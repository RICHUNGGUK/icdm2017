The technique can also be applied to RSA signatures and enables an existential forgery under a chosen-message attack. The potential of this attack remained untapped until a twitch in the technique made it effective against two very popular RSA signature standards, namely ISO/IEC 9796-1 and ISO/IEC 9796-2. Following these attacks, ISO/IEC 9796-1 was withdrawn and ISO/IEC 9796-2 amended. In this paper, we explain in detail Desmedt and Odlyzko's attack as well as its application to the cryptanalysis of ISO/IEC 9796-2.", "paper_title": "Index calculation attacks on RSA signature and encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000234209600004"}
