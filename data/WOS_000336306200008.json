Harmonic vibrational analysis has been performed to assure that the optimized geometries are stable. The optimized results suggest that the three-dimensional structures are observed for the most stable isomers of Be2Sin clusters when n>2. The calculated vertical ionization potential for the lowest-energy isomers are comparable to the experimental values of Sin+2. According to the averaged binding energy, fragmentation energy, second-order energy difference and HOMO-LUMO gaps calculations, we identify that the Be2Si2 and Be2Si5 clusters are more stable, and Be atoms doping enhance the chemical reactivity of the Sin host. The natural population and natural electron configuration analyses indicate that the Be atoms possess positive charge at n=1-5 but negative charge at n=6-11. The chemical hardness of Be2Sin clusters show three local maxima at n=2, 5, and 9, whereas three local minima are found for the corresponding chemical potential, meaning these clusters are more stable than their neighboring cluster sizes.", "paper_title": "Geometries, stabilities and electronic properties of beryllium-silicon Be2Sin clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000336306200008"}
