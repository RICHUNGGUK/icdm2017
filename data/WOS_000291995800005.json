This paper shows the difficulties encountered by traditional and state-of-the-art learning heuristics when these substructures are overlooked. It introduces a new algorithm, Foretell, to detect dense and tight substructures called clusters with local search. It also develops two ways to use clusters during global search: one supports variable-ordering heuristics and the other makes inferences adapted to them. Together they improve performance on both benchmark and real-world problems.", "paper_title": "Learning cluster-based structure to solve constraint satisfaction problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000291995800005"}
