Due to its fast propagation capability it has taken advantage of the FPGA internal carry logic for accurate time measurements. Furthermore, the implementation of the TDC has been performed in different clock regions and tested with different frequencies as well, achieving improvements of up to 50% for a pair of channels. Moreover, since the TDC is potentially going to be used in a trigger system for Positron Emission Tomography (PET), the algorithm for coincidence identification has been subjected to tests in order to estimate the impact on occupied resources and the execution time. This time has been optimized, resulting in speed improvements of up to 20% while preserving occupied resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
