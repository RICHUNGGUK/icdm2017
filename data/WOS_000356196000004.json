The new contribution comes from an applied point of view, in order to have stable and fast algorithms to simulate the fluorescence intensity from a stacking of thin layer films. The calculation of transmitted/reflected amplitudes is an important part of the direct and/or inverse problem. An analysis of the amplitude versus layer thickness is also given.
