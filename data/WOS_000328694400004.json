In higher education, the current trend of using external tools (e. g., \"Web 2.0\") along with the institutional virtual learning environments (what some authors call distributed learning environments-DLEs) makes such transformation even more difficult. This paper proposes GLUE!-PS, an open extensible system that allows nonexperts in ICT to deploy learning designs into multiple DLEs. GLUE!-PS does so while maintaining teachers' and institutions' preferences regarding authoring tools and learning platforms, and making DLE-based practice more likely to be sustainable. This paper presents initial evaluation data of a reference implementation of GLUE!-PS, through two workshops with university teachers and the usage of the system in a real university course. According to our evaluation, academic teaching staff from different disciplines was able to deploy their own collaborative designs using GLUE!-PS under tight time constraints. The evaluation also hints at challenges for everyday practice adoption (reliability problems inherent to such a multisystem approach, the need for runtime flexibility, or conceptual barriers on the use of CSCL approaches).", "paper_title": "Enabling Teachers to Deploy CSCL Designs across Distributed Learning Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000328694400004"}
