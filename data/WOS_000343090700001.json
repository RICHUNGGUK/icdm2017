Artifacts consist of data and lifecycles, accounting respectively for the relational structure of the artifacts' states and their possible evolutions over time. In this paper we put forward artifact-centric multi-agent systems, a novel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multi-agent systems operating on them. Differently from the usual process-based models of services, we give a semantics that explicitly accounts for the data structures on which artifact systems are defined. We study the model checking problem for artifact-centric multi-agent systems against specifications expressed in a quantified version of temporal-epistemic logic expressing the knowledge of the agents in the exchange. We begin by noting that the problem is undecidable in general. We identify a noteworthy class of systems that admit bisimilar, finite abstractions. It follows that we can verify these systems by investigating their finite abstractions; we also show that the corresponding model checking problem is EXPSPACE-complete. We then introduce artifact-centric programs, compact and declarative representations of the programs governing both the artifact system and the agents. We show that, while these in principle generate infinite-state systems, under natural conditions their verification problem can be solved on finite abstractions that can be effectively computed from the programs. We exemplify the theoretical results here pursued through a mainstream procurement scenario from the artifact systems literature.", "paper_title": "Verification of Agent-Based Artifact Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000343090700001"}
