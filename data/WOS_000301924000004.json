ERP adoption decisions, in the chemicals and allied products sectors, were examined between 1994 and 2005. Networks of strong ties and weak ties partners are investigated. Results show that neighbouring companies linked with strong ties can have an influence on organisations making such adoption decision. Past decisions made by major trading partners have a significant influence on the decision to adopt an ERP system for a given organisation. This reflects the complex nature of the knowledge required for such adoption.", "paper_title": "Differentiating weak ties and strong ties among external sources of influences for enterprise resource planning (ERP) adoption", "paper_id": "WOS:000301924000004"}
