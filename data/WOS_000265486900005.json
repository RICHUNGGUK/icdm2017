Although this problem can be solved optimally only by tackling its subproblems jointly, the exceeding complexity of such a task leads to a decomposition into two phases. The partitioning phase is based on a new graph-theoretic approach, which aims to obtain near optimality even if performed independently from the subsequent phase. For the scheduling phase, a new integer linear programming formulation and a heuristic approach are developed. Both take into account configuration prefetching and module reuse. The experimental results show that the proposed method compares favorably with existing solutions.", "paper_title": "Partitioning and Scheduling of Task Graphs on Partially Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000265486900005"}
