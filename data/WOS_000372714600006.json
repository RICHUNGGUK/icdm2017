Compared to previous similar proposals, this version comes with a denotational semantics which is a refinement of the standard presheaf semantics of dependent type theory. Further, this presheaf semantics is a refinement of the one used to interpret nominal sets with restrictions. The present calculus is a candidate for the core of a proof assistant with internalized parametricity.", "paper_title": "A Presheaf Model of Parametric Type Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000372714600006"}
