However, the flexibility of the CYPs' active site remains a huge challenge for accurate SUM prediction. Compared with other CYPs, the active site of CYP2A6 is relatively small and rigid. To address the impact of the flexibility of CYP2A6 active site residues on the SUM prediction for substrates, in this work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking were used-to predict the SUM of 96 CYP2A6 substrates. Substrate With known SUM were docked into the snapshot structures from MD simulations and the crystal structures of CYP2A6. Compared to the crystal structures, the protein structures obtained from MD simulations showed more accurate prediction for SOM. Our results indicated that the flexibility of the active site of CYP2A6 significantly affects the SUM prediction results. Further analysis for the 40 substrates with definite K-m values showed that the prediction accuracy for the low K-m substrates is comparable to that by ligand-based methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
