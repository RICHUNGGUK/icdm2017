It has been demonstrated that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many tumors, playing a role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. For this reason, it has being considered a potential target for cancer therapy. In this context, we have designed, synthesized and evaluated 1,4-dimethyl-carbazole derivatives, targeting the STAT3 protein. Moreover, MTT assay performed on A375 and HeLa, showed significant antiproliferative activity of some of synthesized compounds (3-5). The same compounds (3-5) considerably reduced STAT3 expression, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Our multidisciplinary approach shows that 1,4-dimethylcarbazoles are potential building blocks to develop more affinity ligands of STAT3.", "paper_title": "Identification of Lead Compounds as Inhibitors of STAT3: Design, Synthesis and Bioactivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000365319900004"}
