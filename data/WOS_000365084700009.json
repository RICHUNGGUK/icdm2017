A dynamic optimal distribution problem, including time-varying supply and demand, capacity constraints on the transportation lines, and convex flow cost functions of Legendre-type, is formalized and solved. The time-varying optimal flow is characterized in terms of the time-varying dual variables of a corresponding network optimization problem. A dynamic feedback controller is proposed that regulates the flows asymptotically to the optimal flows and achieves in addition a balancing of all storage levels.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Pricing Control for Constrained Distribution Networks With Storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000365084700009"}
