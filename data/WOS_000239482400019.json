Substitution of service is closely related with composition and important to robustness of service composition. In this paper, we use process algebra as formalism foundation modeling and specifying web services and reasoning on behavioral features of web services composition. We analyze some cases that have effects on design and implementation of composition. Upon that, and based on definition of composition, we study substitution. As to the problem of how to substitute a component web service, we present a relation. Any new selected web services can substitute old component service independent of context and take part in composition successfully in the case that they satisfy criteria of this relation.", "paper_title": "Analysis of web services composition and substitution via CCS", "paper_id": "WOS:000239482400019"}
