Traditionally, such systems are designed using a rigid-body design paradigm, which aims at designs with high stiffness. The alternative is to design a lightweight system and deal with the resulting flexibilities by over-actuation and over-sensing. This paper presents a data-based spatial feedforward method based on previous task trials, which aims at reducing the vibrations over the complete structure during motion. The proposed method is experimentally validated on an industrial prototype and compared to standard mass feedforward using rigid-body decoupling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
