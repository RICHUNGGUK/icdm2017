We developed a new driving technology and display setup that takes care of that problem. We divided the display into several independent parts or modules. Each module acts as an individual display and has its own display driver. With the use of the new ultra-thin chip package (UTCP), these driver chips can be embedded into the (flexible) display itself. This paper explains the setup of the fully modular display and describes the basic structure of the display drivers and its components. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
