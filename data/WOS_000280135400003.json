Both types of materials are uniformly integrated into one spectral simulator. Based on the modal warping technique, we employ a new constraint strategy which eliminates the accumulation of approximation errors at the boundary interfaces, thus naturally gluing different materials. We also utilize the GPU to accelerate the run-time computation when updating the geometry of the hybrid solid the most expensive step in this framework. This work provides a general-purpose solution of simulating hybrid objects in real-time, even for large-scale models.
