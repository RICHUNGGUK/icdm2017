Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes three kinds of learning object relation patterns and gives a specific definition of each pattern based on analysing the learners' usage data stored in the learning object repository. These relation patterns can be used to make effective recommendations to learners. Findings - LO usage data indicate the potential relation patterns between LOs. By using web-mining technology on the usage data, it is possible to discover valuable relation patterns. Originality/value - The authors propose a set of LO relation patterns and indicate how they are closely related to users' learning behaviour.", "paper_title": "eLORM: learning object relationship mining-based repository", "paper_id": "WOS:000256167400011"}
