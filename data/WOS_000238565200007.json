The solutions to these problems are required in real time as the demand fluctuates rapidly. The capacity allocation problem makes a large-scale integer programming problem too complex for practical applications. Using the Lagrangian relaxation technique and a suitably developed heuristic for multiplier adjustment, the computational complexity is reduced to such a degree that a real-time implementation of the algorithm is feasible. This article also develops efficient heuristics to aggregate demand. The proposed algorithm produces a near-optimal solution in pseudo-polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Solution of a certain class of network flow problems with cascaded demand aggregation and capacity allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238565200007"}
