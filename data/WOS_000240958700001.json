In the case of a solid with a C-1 boundary we can also extract surface orientation at these points, and when the solid has a C-2 boundary and a known reflectance map, curvature information can also be calculated.", "paper_title": "Surface properties from N-views of a strictly convex solid", "paper_id": "WOS:000240958700001"}
