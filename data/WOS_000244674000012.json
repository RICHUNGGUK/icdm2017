Compared to the previous researches, the proposed fully parameter extraction from Y-parameter has better accuracy and feasibility for both the simulation before prototype and the improvement of the design after the measurement. And the 4-port model of transformer provides the solution of the fully differential applications. The model agrees very well with measurements for a variety of transformer configuration up to its self-resonant frequency.", "paper_title": "A novel approach to parameter extraction for on-chip transformers", "paper_id": "WOS:000244674000012"}
