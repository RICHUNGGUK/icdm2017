Recent approaches involve wavelet decompositions in order to handle non-stationary time series in such context. A method, proposed by Renaud et al.,(11) estimates directly the prediction equation by direct regression of the process on the Haar non-decimated wavelet coefficients depending on its past values. In this paper, this method is studied and extended in various directions. The new variants are used first for stationary data and after for stationary data contaminated by a deterministic trend.", "paper_title": "Forecasting time series using wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000251390800003"}
