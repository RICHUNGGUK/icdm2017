In contrast to its popular applications in face segmentation and medical image analysis, we not only use this computer vision algorithm to locate an object that is known to exist in an analysed image, but-using an interest point typical of knives-also try to identify whether or not a knife exists in the image in question. We propose an entire detection scheme and examine its performance on a sample test set. The work presented in this paper aims to create a robust visual knife-detector to be used in security applications.", "paper_title": "Visual detection of knives in security applications using Active Appearance Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000356168600005"}
