The authors analysed the security of this protocol and devised an attack that is capable of extracting both the session key and password from an honest party. This attack was then implemented and experiments were performed to determine the time-scale required to successfully complete the attack.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of the Dragonfly key exchange protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000343925700001"}
