When the output of a phone recognizer is given, detection of a specific keyword is carried out through text matching with the phone sequences provided by the specified keyword using the proposed phone mismatch penalty matrices. The penalty matrices associated with substitution, insertion and deletion errors are estimated from the training data through deliberate error generation. The proposed approach has shown a significant improvement in a Korean continuous speech recognition task.", "paper_title": "Estimation of Phone Mismatch Penalty Matrices for Two-Stage Keyword Spotting", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342300038"}
