Although all peer-to-peer systems are intrinsically designed to operate in dynamic heterogeneous environments, wireless nodes pose a particular problem because of their high dynamicity. Traditional architectures fail to account for the intermittent connectivity and limited bandwidth of portable devices. In this paper we present a proxy based mobility support mechanism for integration of highly volatile wireless nodes. Our approach focuses oil third generation peer-to-peer network architectures and inherits properties from the JXTA-JXME protocols. We extend these concepts with route optimization techniques and evaluate the advantages of the new technique in providing an optimised route for message delivery whilst shielding the overlay from the disruptive behaviour of the wireless node. Our results show that the proposed model is able to provide better response times and lower message delivery latencies in both tree and mesh network topologies. The key advantage over existing mobility management solutions such as session initiation protocol and mobile I P is its ease of deployment into any access network which accommodates nodes with sufficient resources to act as proxies. In addition it is possible to use the proxies for content adaptation services, preservation of anonymity and provision of location based services. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
