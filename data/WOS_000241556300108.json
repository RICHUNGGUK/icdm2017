The purpose of our approach is to ease CT-fluoroscopy (CT-fluoro) based needle insertion for the Radiofrequency Liver Ablation procedure using high resolution contrasted preoperative data. In this case, low signal-to-noise ratio, absence of contrast and additional presence of needle in CT-fluoro makes it difficult to guarantee the solution of any deformable slice-to-volume registration algorithm. In this paper, we first propose a method for creating a set of ground truth (GT) simulation data based on a non-linear deformation of the CT-fluoro volume obtained from real patients. Second, we split the CT-fluoro image and apply intensity based rigid and affine registration to each section. We then propose a novel solution, which consists of intuitive visualization sequences of optimal sub-volumes of preinterventional data based on the registration results. Experiments on synthetic and real patient data and direct feedback of two interventionalists validate our alternative approach.", "paper_title": "A new registration/visualizat ion paradigm for CT-fluoroscopy guided RF liver ablation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300108"}
