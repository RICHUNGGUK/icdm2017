This paper tries to find the key service attributes of government websites using Kano's model, and figure out the difference between government websites and business websites. We adopt 30 attributes which affect user satisfaction of government websites in the questionnaire. This paper discovers that the users of government websites take accessibility as a one-dimensional quality, 18 website attributes such as online applications and inquires into application progress as attractive quality, four attributes such as privacy protection and information security as must-be quality, and seven attributes such as interaction with public sectors as indifferent quality. This survey also shows that information accuracy, real-time information, accessibility of requested information, and complete online application are the most important functions that government websites should be equipped with. The top attributes government websites should enhance are more online applications, more one-stop services, more online appointment services, and integration services for government and convenience stores. Compared with business websites that most attributes are one-dimensional and must-be qualities, the most service quality attributes of government websites are mainly attractive quality.", "paper_title": "A Study on Using the Kano Two-Dimensional Quality Model to Evaluate the Service Quality of Government Websites", "paper_id": "WOS:000334146400002"}
