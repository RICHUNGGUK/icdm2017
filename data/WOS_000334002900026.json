In the present paper, we propose a novel method for detecting traffic anomalies in a network by exacting and capturing their features in the transform domain. Here, we take in consideration network topology information and network-wide traffic jointly. We find that anomalous network-wide traffic usually exhibits distinct high-frequency nature. This motivates us to utilize transform domain analysis theory to characterize network-wide traffic to identify its abnormal components. Besides, we group all origin-destination flows in the network in accordance with common destination nodes. By combining network topology information and transform-domain analysis in the given time window, the specious traffic components can be found and identified. Simulation results show that our detection algorithm exhibits a fairly robust detection ability and provides the better detection performance than previous algorithms. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
