A new method employing a stroke-based and progressive strategy is proposed to generate schematic network maps. This method treats a stroke (which is a long line with segments concatenated together) as a basic unit for the implementation. The procedure is as follows: (a) strokes are formed from line segments, (b) the strokes are re-orientated along grid lines and/or diagonals, and (c) two endpoints and all intersection points on (sub-)strokes are projected onto re-oriented straight lines, and (d) spatial inconsistency is detected and resolved. A methodology for each of these steps is described. This new method has been tested with a set of real-life road network data and evaluated by fractal analysis and empirical study. Experimental results show that this new method is more effective than segment-based methods and is able to produce graphics with great simplicity and clarity. Based on the results obtained, the stroke-based schematization with four primary directions is recommended.", "paper_title": "A stroke-based method for automated generation of schematic network maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000283887300002"}
