We consider both the off-line and on-line cases. For the off-line case, i.e., when the longest common subsequence is given as a linear graph with n vertices, we first present a polynomial O(n(2)) time algorithm to compute its maximum nested loop. We then consider a slightly different problem-the Maximum Loop Chain problem and present an algorithm which runs in O(n(5)) time. For the on-line case, i.e., given m RNA sequences of lengths n, compute the longest common subsequence of them such that this subsequence either induces a maximum nested loop or the maximum number of matches, we present efficient algorithms using dynamic programming when m is small.", "paper_title": "RNA multiple structural alignment with longest common subsequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000243140800006"}
