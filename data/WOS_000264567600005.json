At each iteration of the proposed algorithm, by solving a reduced quadratic programming subproblem and a reduced system of linear equation without involving multiplier estimate, a feasible direction of descent is generated through a suitable combination of a descent direction and a feasible direction. To overcome the Maratos effect, a higher-order correction direction is obtained by solving another reduced system of linear equation whose coefficient matrix is the same as the previous one. The algorithm is proved to be globally convergent and superlinearly convergent under some mild conditions without the strict complementarity. Finally, some numerical results are reported.", "paper_title": "An Improved Active Set Feasible SQP Algorithm for the Solution of Inequality Constrained Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264567600005"}
