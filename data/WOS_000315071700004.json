A genetic algorithm-based wavelength selection (GAWLS) method is one of the methods used to select combinations of important variables from X-variables using regions as a unit of measurement. However, a partial least squares method is used as a regression method, and hence, a GAWLS method cannot handle nonlinear relationship between X and an objective variable, y. We therefore proposed a region selection method based on GAWLS and support vector regression (SVR), one of the nonlinear regression methods. The proposed method is named GAWLS-SVR. We applied GAWLS-SVR to simulation data and industrial polymer process data, and confirmed that predictive, easy-to-interpret, and appropriate models were constructed using the proposed method.
