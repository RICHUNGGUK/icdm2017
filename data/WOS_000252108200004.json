A sufficient condition on the number of cards for the transformation protocol to succeed was known. However, it has been an open problem to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition. This paper improves the transformation protocol and gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the resulting protocol to succeed.", "paper_title": "A revised transformation protocol for unconditionally secure secret key exchange", "paper_id": "WOS:000252108200004"}
