A graph is Meyniel if and only if it has no Meyniel obstruction as an induced subgraph. Here we give a O(n(2)) algorithm that, for any graph, finds either a clique and a coloring of the same size or a Meyniel obstruction. We also give a O(n(3)) algorithm that, for any graph, finds either a strong stable set recognizable in polynomial time or a Meyniel obstruction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
