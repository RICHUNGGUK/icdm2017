Such mixtures can be caused, e.g., by the presence of a semi-reflective medium (such as a window glass) across a photographed scene, due to slight movements of the medium (or of the sources) between snapshots. Classical separation approaches assume either a static mixture model or a fully convolutive mixture model, which are, respectively, either under- or over-parameterized for this problem. In this paper, we develop a specially parameterized scheme for approximate joint diagonalization of estimated spectrum matrices, aimed at estimating the succinct set of mixture parameters: the static (gain) coefficients and the shift values. The estimated parameters are, in turn, used for convenient frequency-domain separation. As we demonstrate using both synthetic mixtures and real-life photographs, the advantage of the ability to incorporate spatial shifts is twofold: Not only does it enable separation when such shifts are present, but it also warrants deliberate introduction of such shifts as a simple source of added diversity whenever the static mixing coefficients form a singular matrix-thereby enabling separation in otherwise inseparable scenes.", "paper_title": "Blind separation of superimposed shifted images using parameterized joint diagonalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272300008"}
