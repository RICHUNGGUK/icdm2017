This paper presents a fast and efficient asymmetric 3D-MVD coding scheme under specified bitrate constraints. To efficiently encode depth images, a texture image-assisted inter prediction strategy is proposed to determine whether to use a direct copy of the co-located block as the inter prediction so as to skip the normal encoding process. In addition, an adaptive weighted mode in-loop filter strategy is proposed to refine the reconstructed depth image quality. Both strategies help to significantly reduce the encoding time and improve the reconstructed depth image quality under the bitrate constraint. Experiment results showed that the proposed asymmetric 3D-MVD coding scheme does achieve better quality of the reconstructed depth videos and the rendered virtual views at a less encoding-time requirement when compared with the state-of-the-art scheme by Shao et al. and the traditional 5:1 bitrate allocation scheme.
