In this paper, we introduce an architecture for real-time video transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems using loss visibility side information. We quantify the perceptual importance of a packet through the packet loss visibility and use the loss visibility distribution to provide a notion of relative packet importance. To jointly achieve high video quality and low latency, we define the optimization objective function as the throughput weighted by the loss visibility of each packet, a proxy for the total perceptual value of successful packets per unit of time. We solve the problem of mapping video packets to MIMO subchannels and adapting per-stream rates to maximize the proposed objective. We show that the solution enables jointly reaping gains in terms of improved video quality and lower latency. Optimized packet-stream mapping enables transmission of more relevant packets over more reliable streams while unequal modulation opportunistically increases the transmission rate on the stronger streams to enable low latency delivery of high priority packets. Tested on H. 264-encoded video sequences, for a 4 x 4 MIMO system with three spatial streams, the proposed architecture achieves 8 dB power reduction for the same video quality and supports 2.4x higher throughput due to unequal modulation. Furthermore, the gains are achieved at the expense of few bits of cross-layer overhead rather than a complex cross-layer design.", "paper_title": "Loss Visibility Optimized Real-Time Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000361685400010"}
