Various well-known approaches to optimising the handover latency have been proposed in the literature: MIPv6, FMIPv6, HMIPv6 and F-HMIPv6. However, these approaches are inefficient in packet loss, out-of order problem, dependency of exact predictive information and a sudden disruption of the link. In this paper, we propose a seamless handover scheme with temporal reuse of Care of Addresses (CoAs) and Packet Buffering Point (PBP) in IPv6-Based mobile networks.", "paper_title": "A seamless handover scheme in IPv6-based mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000264628500007"}
