Privacy breach for network participants is a concern in such analysis efforts. This paper investigates structural and property changes via several privacy preserving methods (anonymization) for social network. The anonymized social network does not follow the power-law for node degree distribution as the original network does. The peak-hop for node connectivity increases at most 1 and the clustering coefficient of neighbor nodes shows 6.5 times increases after anonymization. Thus, we observe inconsistency of privacy preserving methods in social network analysis.", "paper_title": "Analyzing Network Privacy Preserving Methods: A Perspective of Social Network Characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784300033"}
