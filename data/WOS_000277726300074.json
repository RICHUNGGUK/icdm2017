As reported in the literature, the performance indices of these hybrid models have proved to be better than the individual components when used alone. Hybrid models are extremely useful for reservoir characterization in petroleum engineering, which requires high-accuracy predictions for efficient exploration and management of oil and gas resources. In this paper, we have utilized the capabilities of data mining and computational intelligence in the prediction of porosity and permeability, two important petroleum reservoir characteristics, based on the hybridization of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machines, and Functional Networks, using several real-life well-logs. Two hybrid models have been built. In both, Functional Networks were used to select the best of the predictor variables for training directly from input data by using its functional approximation capability with least square fitting algorithm. In the first model (FFS), the selected predictor variables were passed to Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System to handle uncertainties and extract inference rules, while Support Vector Machines made the final predictions. In the second, the selected predictor variables were passed to Support Vector Machines for training by transforming them to a higher dimensional space, and then to Type-2 Fuzzy Logic to handle uncertainties, extract inference rules and make final predictions. The simulation results show that the hybrid models perform better than the individual techniques when used alone for the same datasets with their higher correlation coefficients. In terms of execution time, the hybrid models took less time for both training and testing than the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic, but more time than Functional Networks and Support Vector Machines. This could be the price for having a better and more robust model. The hybrid models also performed better than a combination of two of the individual components, Type-2 Fuzzy Logic and Support Vector Machines, in terms of higher correlation coefficients as well as lower execution times. This is due to the effective role of Functional Networks, as a best-variable selector in the hybrid models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
