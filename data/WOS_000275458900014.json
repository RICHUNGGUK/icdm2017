The various rescuer forces attempt to do their best duties. One of the most important problems in multi agent system is communication among agents. Most of the various algorithms in multi agent system so far has share of duties, negotiation, learning and searching need to various forms of communication among agents. In the paper we attempt to rescue the most wounded using Reinforcement learning to be able to gain the shortest time.", "paper_title": "Designing of Rescue Multi Agent System Based on Soft Computing Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000275458900014"}
