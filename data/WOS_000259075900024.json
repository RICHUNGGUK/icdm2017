However, OLS can be shown to be a useful method under a much wider variety of models. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly we introduce a new diagnostic, similar to Cook's Distance, that is useful for detecting influential observations under an assumed single-index model. Secondly we show, via simulation, how trimming observations according to such diagnostics can greatly benefit the analysis even when no gross outliers are evident. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
