The number of break points as well as their locations, the orders and the parameters of each regime are assumed to be unknown. A selection criterion based on the minimum description length principle is proposed and a genetic algorithm is implemented for its optimization. Monte Carlo simulation results show the effectiveness of this criterion and an application to the Nile River data is considered.", "paper_title": "Structural changes estimation for strongly dependent processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324730900001"}
