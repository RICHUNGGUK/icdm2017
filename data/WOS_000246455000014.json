The authors developed the signal-processing on-demand architecture (SODA), a fully programmable architecture that supports SDR, by examining two widely differing protocols, W-CDMA and 802.11A. It meets power-performance requirements by separating control and data processing and by employing ultrawide SIMD execution.", "paper_title": "SODA: A high-performance DSP architecture for software-defined radio", "paper_id": "WOS:000246455000014"}
