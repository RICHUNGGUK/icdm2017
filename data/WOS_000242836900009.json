Secondly, taking the time serial factor into consideration, the Winter's Exponential Smoothing method is applied to predict the tendency of PCB sales and the influences of seasonal effects. Thirdly, applying historical data to proceed the training of Weighted Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network (WEFuNN) and then forecasts the future PCB sales by the WEFuNN. Finally, compare three kinds of performance measurements for each model. The experimental results reveal that the MAPE for WEFuNN model is 2.11% which is the best compared to others. In summary, the WEFuNN model can be applied practically as a sales forecasting tool in the PCB industry. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
