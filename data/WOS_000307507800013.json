Also known is the orthogonal projection U of the vertices of the image I center dot T of T under an unknown rotation I center dot about the origin. Under what circumstances can I center dot be determined from T and U?.", "paper_title": "Determining a Rotation of a Tetrahedron from a Projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000307507800013"}
