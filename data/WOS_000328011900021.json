A large number of security algorithms have been proposed to enhance security in various types of networks. Many of these solutions are either directly or indirectly based on Bloom filter (BF), a space- and time-efficient probabilistic data structure introduced by Burton Bloom in 1970. Obviously, Bloom filters and their variants are getting more and more consideration in network security area. This paper provides an up-to-date survey of the application of BFs and their variants to improve performance of the approaches proposed to address security problems with different types of networks.
