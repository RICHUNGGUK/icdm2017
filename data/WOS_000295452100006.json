In this article, a more general approach for integration of data in a hierarchical structure is proposed using a generalized tree structure called a complex tree. For this aim we define a set of criteria for integration. These criteria are completeness, precision, and optimality. A simple algorithm based on these criteria is presented and the advantages of the approach are discussed.", "paper_title": "A Method for Complex Hierarchical Data Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000295452100006"}
