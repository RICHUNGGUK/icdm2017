The approach relies on the equivalence between this problem and the classical max-clique: it solves different decision problems about the existence of cliques with a given size. The idea is rather simple but, according to the experiments and the comparison with the existing literature, appears as particularly promising and outperforms, both in quality and CPU time, the existing state of the art algorithms.
