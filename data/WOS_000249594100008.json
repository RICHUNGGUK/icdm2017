Design/methodology/approach - An empirical study is conducted in financial training centers in Taiwan and the collected survey data are used to test the relationships among the four dimensions expressed in the proposed structural equation model. Findings - The results show that HRM has a direct and significant impact on OL and EMC. HRM influences OP indirectly through OL and EMC. In addition, OL and KMC have direct and significant influences on OP. Research limitations/implications - Only data from Taiwan were collected. Therefore, the results may not be easily generalized to other areas or countries, but are useful for managers' reference, especially for those whose circumstances are similar to those in Taiwan. Practical implications - The conceptual structural equation model provides useful information for managers to enhance OP through the adoption of appropriate HRM, OL and KMC policies. Originality/value - The study demonstrates how HRM indirectly impacts OP and illustrates the paths of influence through either OL or KMC.", "paper_title": "The mediate effect of learning and knowledge on organizational performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000249594100008"}
