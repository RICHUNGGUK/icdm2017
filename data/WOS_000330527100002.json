During conceptual design process, knowledge derivate from different domains is required to achieve a creative design. However, most of the design models restrict their representation to a specific domain. Knowledge representation for multidisciplinary is still an incipient issue for engineering design researchers. Moreover, to increase the robustness of design resolutions is another problem obsessing designers. This article proposes an adapted Gero's Function-Behavior-State model (Requirement-Function-Behavior-Principle solutions) to aid creative design activities during conceptual design stage by introducing an integrated cross-domain knowledge representation methodology, to increase robustness by reusing existing cases knowledge through retrieval algorithm, and to realize effectiveness by putting forward a design synthesis methodology. Finally, a prototype system named knowledge-based innovative conceptual design system is developed to implement our approaches, and effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated with a detailed example related to the design of eye movement apparatus incorporated with oculomotor machine of vision prosthesis for acquired blindness, with an overall design procedure classified.", "paper_title": "Knowledge-based functional conceptual design: Model, representation, and implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330527100002"}
