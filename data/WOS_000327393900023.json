The defined three step-based retrieval processes and a well-selected combination of visual and textual techniques help the developed Multimedia Information Retrieval System to overcome the semantic gap in a given query. In the paper, five different late semantic fusion approaches are discussed and experimented in a realistic scenario for multimedia retrieval like the one provided by the publicly available ImageCLEF Wikipedia Collection.", "paper_title": "Multimedia Information Retrieval Based on Late Semantic Fusion Approaches: Experiments on a Wikipedia Image Collection", "paper_id": "WOS:000327393900023"}
