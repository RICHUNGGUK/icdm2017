One is the definition of an overflow probability, and the other is the definition of an achievability. We define the overflow probability as the probability of codeword length, not per symbol, is larger than eta(n) and we introduce the epsilon-achievability of variable-length codes that implies an existence of a code for the source under the condition that the overflow probability is smaller than or equal to epsilon. Then we show that the epsilon-achievability of variable-length codes is essentially equivalent to the epsilon-achievability of fixed-length codes for general sources. Moreover by using above results, we show the condition of epsilon-achievability for some restricted sources given epsilon.", "paper_title": "A note on the epsilon-overflow probability of lossless codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700040"}
