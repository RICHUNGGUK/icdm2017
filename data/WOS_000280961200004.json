It federates local file systems on compute nodes to maximize distributed file I/O bandwidth, and allows to store multiple file replicas in any location to avoid read access concentration of hot files. Data location aware process scheduling improves the file I/O performance of distributed data-intensive computing. This paper discusses the design and implementation of the Gfarm Grid file system, and reports the performance.", "paper_title": "Gfarm Grid File System", "paper_id": "WOS:000280961200004"}
