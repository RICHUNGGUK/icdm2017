The incoming vehicle may collide with the adjacent vehicles from the incoming position due to the inappropriate vehicular velocity and headway. An intelligent control strategy with consideration of the information of the incoming vehicle is proposed to reduce the collision of lane changing, and the effectiveness of the new design is verified by drawing the dynamic safety-collision region maps of the simulations. The effects of the strategy's coverage on lane changing collision are also studied with the finding that the expanding of the safety region of lane changing is limited by extending the coverage of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the strategy is extended to add pre-warning mechanism, and the effects of the pre-warning mechanism on lane changing collision are obtained by drawing the safety-collision region maps. It is concluded that the collision region of the lane changing shrinks with the adding of the pre-warning mechanism. The coverage of the extended strategy is also spread from one vehicle to more vehicles and we get the same result as the strategy without adding the pre-warning mechanism.", "paper_title": "Effect of intelligent control strategy on safety-collision region of lane changing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341241800007"}
