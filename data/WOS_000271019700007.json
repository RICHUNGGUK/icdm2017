It is well known that a convolutional code C over a finite group G has a minimal trellis representation that can be derived from code sequences. It is also well known that, for the case that G is a finite field, any polynomial encoder of C can be algebraically manipulated to yield a minimal polynomial encoder whose controller canonical realization is a minimal trellis. In this paper we seek to extend this result to the finite ring case G = Z(pr) by introducing a so-called \"p-encoder\". We show how to manipulate a polynomial encoding scheme of a noncatastrophic convolutional code over Z(pr) to produce a particular type of p-encoder (\"minimal p-encoder\") whose controller canonical realization is a minimal trellis with nonlinear features. The minimum number of trellis states is then expressed as p(r), where r is the sum of the row degrees of the minimal p-encoder. In particular, we show that any convolutional code over Z(pr) admits a delay-free p-encoder which implies the novel result that delay-freeness is not a property of the code but of the encoder, just as in the field case. We conjecture that a similar result holds with respect to catastrophicity, i.e., any catastrophic convolutional code over Z(pr) admits a noncatastrophic p-encoder.", "paper_title": "On Minimality of Convolutional Ring Encoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019700007"}
