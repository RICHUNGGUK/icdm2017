They believe that their corresponding 5-sweep LBFS interval graph recognition algorithm is also correct. Thanks to the LBFS structure theory established mainly by Corneil et al., we are able to present a 4-sweep LBFS algorithm which determines whether or not the input graph is a unit interval graph or an interval graph. Like the algorithm of Corneil et al., our algorithm does not involve any complicated data structure and can be executed in linear time.", "paper_title": "A Four-Sweep LBFS Recognition Algorithm for Interval Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342624900002"}
