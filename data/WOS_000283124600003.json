For this purpose, we propose a family of nonhomogeneous Gauss-Markov fields with Potts region labels model for images to be used in a Bayesian estimation framework. The joint posterior law of all the unknowns (the unknown image, its segmentation (hidden variable) and all the hyperparameters) is approximated by a separable probability law via the variational Bayes technique. This approximation gives the possibility to obtain practically implemented joint restoration and segmentation algorithm. We will present some preliminary results and comparison with a MCMC Gibbs sampling based algorithm. We may note that the prior models proposed in this work are particularly appropriate for the images of the scenes or objects that are composed of a finite set of homogeneous materials. This is the case of many images obtained in nondestructive testing (NDT) applications.", "paper_title": "Joint NDT Image Restoration and Segmentation Using Gauss-Markov-Potts Prior Models and Variational Bayesian Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283124600003"}
