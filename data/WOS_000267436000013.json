We revisit the approach to solve the sizing problem by Lagrangian relaxation, point out several misunderstandings in the previous; paper, and extend the approach to handle general convex delay functions in the GCS problems. We identify a class of proper GCS problems whose objective functions in the simplified dual problem are differentiable and transform the simultaneous sizing and clock-skew optimization problem into a proper GCS problem. We design an algorithm based on the method of feasible directions and min-cost network How to solve proper GCS problems. The algorithm will provide evidences for infeasible GCS problems according to a condition derived by us. Experimental results confirm the efficiency and the effectiveness of our algorithm when the Elmore delay model is used.", "paper_title": "Gate Sizing by Lagrangian Relaxation Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000267436000013"}
