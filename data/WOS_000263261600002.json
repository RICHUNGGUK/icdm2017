To ensure uninterrupted data flow, auto-aligning transmitter and receiver modules are necessary. We propose a new FSO node design that uses spherical surfaces covered with transmitter and receiver modules for maintaining optical links even when nodes are in relative motion. The spherical FSO node provides angular diversity in 3-dimensions, and hence provides an LOS at any orientation as long as there are no obstacles in between the communicating nodes. For proof-of-concept, we designed and tested an auto-configurable circuit, integrated with light sources and detectors placed on spherical surfaces. We demonstrated communication between a stationary and a mobile node using these initial prototypes of such FSO structures. We also performed the necessary theoretical analysis to demonstrate scalability of our FSO node designs to longer distances as well as feasibility of denser packaging of transceivers on such nodes.", "paper_title": "Free-space-optical mobile ad hoc networks: Auto-configurable building blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263261600002"}
