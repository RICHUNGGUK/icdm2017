Due to the large alternative space, most common rules for social choice cannot be directly applied to compute a winner. In this paper, we introduce a distributed protocol for collective decision-making in combinatorial domains, which enjoys the following desirable properties: (i) the final decision chosen is guaranteed to be a Smith member; (ii) it enables distributed decision-making and works under incomplete information settings, i.e., the agents are not required to reveal their preferences explicitly; (iii) it significantly reduces the amount of dominance testings (individual outcome comparisons) that each agent needs to conduct, as well as the number of pairwise comparisons; (iv) it is sufficiently general and does not restrict the choice of preference representation languages.", "paper_title": "A distributed social choice protocol for combinatorial domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000339822400005"}
