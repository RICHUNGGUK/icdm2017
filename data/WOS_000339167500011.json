The work presented offers an ideal business model for operators having both digital video broadcast and Internet Protocol (IP)-based media services. To that end, the DVB and peer-to-peer Internet technologies will be combined to provide sufficient resources for supporting high-bandwidth high-quality 3D multiview video. The motivations behind combining these technologies are outlined with an emphasis on their complementary characteristics. In addition, the overall design of the proposed architecture is presented focusing on the protocols that are exploited to achieve the interworking of the underlying technologies. Moreover, innovative key techniques for supporting both fixed and mobile users in an efficient manner are introduced.", "paper_title": "HYBRID BROADCAST AND BROADBAND NETWORKS CONVERGENCE FOR IMMERSIVE TV APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000339167500011"}
