However, there are alternative methods. '2Struc: The Secondary Structure Server' has been created as a single point of access for eight different secondary structure assignment methods. It has been designed to enable comparisons between methods for analyzing the secondary structure content for a single protein. It also includes a second functionality, 'Compare-the-Protein' to enable comparisons of the secondary structure features from any one method to be made within a collection of nuclear magnetic resonance models, or between the crystal structures of two different proteins.", "paper_title": "2Struc: the secondary structure server", "paper_id": "WOS:000282749700020"}
