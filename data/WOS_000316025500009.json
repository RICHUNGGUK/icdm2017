Optimization consists in finding a trade-off between mass and competing safety factors at hub and shaft contact zone as well as in shaft fillet. Developing an effective calculation method for fatigue strength of an interference fitted assembly using the finite element method is one of the main steps of the procedure. Meanwhile, coupling the finite elements model of interference fit with an optimization algorithm is not adequate considering the computing time and the significant number of calculations necessary to portrait the assembly behavior. Therefore, a sequential approximate multi-objective optimization algorithm (SAMOO) is presented. The method involves Design Of Experiments (DOE), interpolation with kriging functions, and multi-objective optimization. Preliminary study of parameter variance, and advanced post-processing of multi-objective optimization, provide engineers with valuable information for identifying an optimal design of interference fit assembly using fewer finite element calculations.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of interference fit assemblies subjected to fatigue loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000316025500009"}
