A quadratic eigenvalue solver of linear complexity and electromagnetic accuracy is developed in this paper to fulfill this task. Without sacrificing accuracy, the proposed eigenvalue solver has shown a clear advantage over state-of-the-art eigenvalue solvers in fast CPU time. It successfully solves a quadratic eigenvalue problem of over 2.5 million unknowns associated with a large-scale 3-D on-chip circuit embedded in inhomogeneous materials in 40 min on a single 3 GHz 8222SE AMD Opteron processor.", "paper_title": "A Quadratic Eigenvalue Solver of Linear Complexity for 3-D Electromagnetics-Based Analysis of Large-Scale Integrated Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000300513500005"}
