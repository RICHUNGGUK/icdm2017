The proposed GLRT employs a different hypotheses problem formulation and a different asymptotic covariance estimation method, which are proved to be more suitable for multi-antenna systems than those employed by the Dandawate-Giannakis algorithm. Moreover, we derive the asymptotic distributions of the proposed test statistics, and prove the constant false alarm rate property of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulations are conducted, showing that the proposed GLRT can achieve better detection performance than the Dandawate-Giannakis algorithm and its extension for multi-antenna cases.", "paper_title": "Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test For Cyclostationary Multi-Antenna Spectrum Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333200011"}
