Some of the vertical scaling solutions provide good implementation of signature based detection. Unfortunately these approaches treat network flows across different subnets and cannot apply anomaly-based classification if attacks originate from multiple machines at a lower speed, like the scenario of Peer-to-Peer Botnets. In this paper the authors build up on the progress of open source tools like Hadoop, Hive and Mahout to provide a scalable implementation of quasi-real-time intrusion detection system. The implementation is used to detect Peer-to-Peer Botnet attacks using machine learning approach. The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) Building a distributed framework using Hive for sniffing and processing network traces enabling extraction of dynamic network features; (2) Using the parallel processing power of Mahout to build Random Forest based Decision Tree model which is applied to the problem of Peer-to-Peer Botnet detection in quasi-real-time. The implementation setup and performance metrics are presented as initial observations and future extensions are proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
