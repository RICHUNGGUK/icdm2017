Within each cell, velocity and pressure are obtained from the Taylor expansion at its centre. The derivatives in the expansion are found by applying the Gauss theorem over the cell. The resultant integration over the faces of the cell is calculated from the value at the middle point of the face and its derivatives, which are further obtained from a higher order interpolation based on the values at the centres of two cells sharing this face. The terms LIP to second order in the velocity and the terms up to first order in pressure in the Taylor expansion are retained throughout the derivation. The test cases for channel flow, flow past a circular cylinder and flow in a collapsible channel have shown that the method is quite accurate and flexible.
