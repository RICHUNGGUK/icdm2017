In order to consider the combined effects of the rotation and the spacing between two cylinders on the now, numerical simulations are performed at a various range of absolute rotational speeds (|alpha| <= 2) for four different gap spacings of 3, 1.5. 0.7 and 0.2 at Reynolds number of 100 showing the typical two-dimensional vortex shedding, As |alpha| increases, the flow changes its condition from periodic to steady after a critical rotational speed, which depends on the gap spacing. In the cases of gap spacings of 3 and 0.2, the wake keeps the same pattern, until flow reaches the steady state, However, for the gap spacings of 1.5 and 0.7, the wake patterns change in the unsteady regimes. For the cases in which the flow is unsteady, the Strouhal number strongly depends on the gap. For a fixed gap spacing, the variation of the Strouhal number is significant when the wake pattern is changed according to the rotational speed. Regardless of the gap spacing, as |alpha| increases, the lift increases and the drag decreases. Quantitative information about the flow variables such as the pressure coefficient and wall vorticity distributions on the cylinders is highlighted. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
