The method involves two main steps: (1) computation of the free-field soil movements caused by the earthquake, and (2) the analysis of the response of the pile group based on the maximum free-field soil movements (considered as static movements) as well as a static loading at the pile head, which depends on the computed spectral acceleration of the structure being supported. The methodology takes into account the effects of group interaction and soil yielding at pile-soil interface. The applicability of this approach has been validated by a similar approach for single piles and then verified by both experimental centrifuge models of pile-supported structures and field measurements of Ohba-Ohashi Bridge in Japan. It is demonstrated that the proposed method yields reasonable estimates of the pile maximum moment, shear, and horizontal displacement for many practical cases despite of its simplicity. Limitations and reliability of the methodology are discussed and some practical conclusions on the performance of the proposed approach are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
