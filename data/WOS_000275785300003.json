In order to improve the performance of FCM algorithm, researchers have introduced a neighborhood attraction, which is dependent on the relative location and features of neighboring pixels. However, determination of degree of attraction is a challenging task which can considerably affect the segmentation results. This paper presents a study investigating the potential of genetic algorithms (GAs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to determine the optimum value of degree of attraction. The GAs are best at reaching a near optimal solution but have trouble finding an exact solution, while PSO's-group interactions enhances the search for an optimal solution. Therefore, significant improvements are expected using a hybrid method combining the strengths of PSO with GAs, simultaneously. In this context, a hybrid GAs/PSO (breeding swarms) method is employed for determination of optimum degree of attraction. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons performed on simulated and real brain MR images with different noise levels demonstrate unprecedented improvements in segmentation results compared to other FCM-based methods.
