We then describe interpretations of Soltys' linear algebra theory LAP over arbitrary integral domains, into each of our new theories. The result shows equivalences of standard theorems of linear algebra over Z2 and Z can be proved in the corresponding theory, but leaves open the interesting question of whether the theorems themselves can be proved.", "paper_title": "FORMAL THEORIES FOR LINEAR ALGEBRA", "paper_id": "WOS:000302505000025"}
