We show that if any parsimonious (many-one or metric many-one) complete function for NPMV (or NPMVg) is length-decreasing self-reducible, then any function in NPMV (or NPMVg) has a polynomial-time computable refinement. This result implies that there exists an NPMV (or NPMVg)-complete function which is not length-decreasing self-reducible unless P = NP.", "paper_title": "On the Length-Decreasing Self-Reducibility and the Many-One-Like Reducibilities for Partial Multivalued Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000320214300010"}
