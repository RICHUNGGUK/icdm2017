The purpose of this paper was to develop an improved constitutive law based on the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden's model: to replace the isotropic part with Gent constitutive law so as to model the noncollagenous matrix of the media due to its generality and capability to reproduce the Neo-Hookean model. This model is implemented into an in-house finite element program. A uniaxial tension test is considered to study the influence of material parameter [GRAPHICS] in Gent model and [GRAPHICS] which represents the angle between the collagen fibers and the circumferential direction. A simulation of an adventitial strip specimen under tension is performed to show the applicability of this constitutive law.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic hyperelastic behavior of soft biological tissues", "paper_id": "WOS:000347157000007"}
