The mathematical background in convex analysis of deterministic elastoplasticity is extended to the stochastic domain, and numerical algorithms are formulated and explored. Computationally these problems-in analogy to the deterministic closest point return map-lead to the stochastic minimisation of a convex energy functional on tensor product spaces. The material parameters describing the problem are modelled as tensor-valued random fields whose numerical representation can be achieved in different ways, such as sampling, or with functional approximations using the Karhunen-LoSve and polynomial chaos expansions. Various numerical solution strategies such as direct integration, stochastic Galerkin and collocation approaches are formulated, discussed, and compared on computational examples.", "paper_title": "Variational Theory and Computations in Stochastic Plasticity", "paper_id": "WOS:000356504400003"}
