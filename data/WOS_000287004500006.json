Video recordings synchronized with motion recordings were analyzed visually during seizures and divided, for each limb, into events corresponding to different classes of motor manifestations. For each classified event, features were extracted and a subset selection was automated using artificial neural networks. The best artificial neural network was simulated on whole recordings to generate a stereotypic evolution of motor manifestations that we called motorograms. It is shown that motorograms can point out seizure movements and emphasize epileptic patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
