It aims to discover a useful knowledge from large amount of data. Data mining become one of the most important tools used for solving most of today's problems that are related to different, sectors of our life. Different techniques have been developed for Mining data in statistics, machine learning, and other disciplines. These techniques need to be re-evaluated, and scalable algorithms should be developed for effective data mining. This paper will investigate the use of RULES-3 Inductive Learning Algorithm for data mining by comparing it, with three statistical, two Lazy, and six rule-based data. mining algorithms on eleven real life data sets in, terms of learning rate, accuracy and robustness to noisy and incomplete data.", "paper_title": "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF RULES-3 INDUCTION SYSTEM ON DATA MINING", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400002"}
