We propose a new approach based on iterative bootstrap bias correction of the maximum likelihood estimator to accurately approximate the MVUE. Viewing bootstrap iteration as a Markov process, we develop a computational algorithm for bias correction based on arbitrarily many bootstrap iterations. The algorithm, when applied parametrically to finite sample spaces, does not involve Monte Carlo simulation. For infinite sample spaces, a nonparametric version of the algorithm is combined with a preliminary round of Monte Carlo simulation to yield an approximate MVUE. Both algorithms are computationally more efficient and stable than conventional simulation-based bootstrap iterations. Examples are given of both finite and infinite sample spaces to illustrate the effectiveness of our new approach.", "paper_title": "Minimum variance unbiased estimation based on bootstrap iterations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238746900005"}
