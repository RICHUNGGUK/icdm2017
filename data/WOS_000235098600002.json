Heart rate and hematocrit, measured in the course of hemodialysis, are imposed as computer model inputs and the model computes the arterial pressure response after tuning model parameters representative of patient's cardiovascular reactivity. Computer model reproduced with good accuracy experimental data (arterial pressure, cardiac output and total peripherical resistance). Parameter identification over successive sessions of the same patients revealed satisfactory reliability, providing a physiological interpretative key to patient's hemodynamic behavior during hemodialysis.
