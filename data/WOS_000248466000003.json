In this paper, we present the Autonomic Service Architecture (ASA), a uniform framework for automated management of both Internet services and their underlying network resources. ASA ensures the delivery of services according to specific service level agreements (SLAB) between customers and service providers. As an illustrative example, ASA is applied to the management of DiffServ/MPLS networks, where we propose an autonomic bandwidth sharing scheme. With the proposed scheme, the bandwidth allocated for each SLA can be automatically adjusted according to the measured traffic load and under policy control for efficient resource utilization, while SLA compliance over the network is always guaranteed.
