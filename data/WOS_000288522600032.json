However, such FPGA systems require a long time to read and much memory to store the hardware context, when a hardware task is swapped out. A solution to this problem is to adjust the amount of read-back data in a hardware task to reduce the required memory size and reconfiguration time. Therefore, this investigation develops an adaptive frame length method for hardware context-switching with a context reading and writing (CRW) algorithm in dynamically partial self-reconfigurable (DPSR) FPGA systems. The proposed CRW algorithm requires less instruction to execute Readback and Writeback procedures. Therefore, the CRW algorithm is one means of reducing reconfiguration time. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces hardware reconfiguration time by 7.763%, memory size by 63.79% and resource overhead by 47.33%.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE FRAME LENGTH METHOD FOR HARDWARE CONTEXT-SWITCHING IN DYNAMIC PARTIAL SELF-RECONFIGURABLE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600032"}
