We first introduce some new operational rules of hesitant fuzzy sets based on the Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm, in which a family of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher operators is proposed for aggregating hesitant fuzzy information. Some basic properties of these proposed operators are given, and the relationships between them are shown in detail. We further discuss the interrelations between the proposed aggregation operators and the existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. Applying the proposed hesitant fuzzy operators, we develop a new technique for hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making problems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is illustrated by mean of a practical example.
