Spatial data describe information tied with locations on Earth, while spatial services allow to manipulate spatial data following a Service Oriented Architecture. This paper proposes to model SDIs as federations of autonomous communities following the enterprise language of the ITU-T and ISO/IEC 'Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing' (RM-ODP), and the recently approved Use of UML for ODP Systems Specifications' (UML4ODP). The enterprise language of the RM-ODP provides a conceptual foundation to address several aspects of SDIs not previously considered from a systems architecture point of view. The use of UML4ODP provides a modeling language to facilitate the exchange of knowledge about SDI, and it is an opportunity to try this recent standard for a class of large and complex systems.
