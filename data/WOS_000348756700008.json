Liu etal., 2013 [20]). In our approach, we compute the flux derivatives on the cell-nodes by the physical fluxes on the cell nodes and numerical fluxes on the cell centers. To acquire the numerical fluxes on the cell centers, we perform a weighted hybrid interpolation of an upwind interpolation and a central interpolation. Through systematic analysis and numerical tests, we show that our nonlinear compact scheme has high order, high resolution and low dissipation, and has the same ability to capture strong discontinuities as regular weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) schemes. It is a good choice for the simulation of multiscale problems with shock waves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
