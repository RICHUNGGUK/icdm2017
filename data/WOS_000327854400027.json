However the effective management of SLAs in cloud computing is essential for the service users to ensure that they achieve the desired outcomes from the formed service. In this paper, we introduce a SLA management framework that will enable service users to select the best available service provider on the basis of its reputation and then monitor the run time performance of the service provider to determine whether or not it will fulfill its promise defined in the SLA. Such analysis will assist the service user to make an informed decision about the continuation of service with the service provider.", "paper_title": "A framework for SLA management in cloud computing for informed decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000327854400027"}
