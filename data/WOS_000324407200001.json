It involves in a small-scale quantum computation network with three participants in three phases, i.e. initializing phase, signing phase and verifying phase. The signatory signs the encrypted message and then the receiver verifies the signature is valid with the aid of an arbitrator who plays a crucial role when a dispute arises. Analysis shows that the signature can neither be forged nor disavowed by the malicious attackers.", "paper_title": "AN ARBITRATED QUANTUM SIGNATURE SCHEME BASED ON HYPERCHAOTIC QUANTUM CRYPTOSYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000324407200001"}
