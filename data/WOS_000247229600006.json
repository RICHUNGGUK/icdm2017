With the purpose of producing high quality software, many approaches to apply structural testing criteria for the unit testing of procedural and object-oriented (00) programs have been proposed. Nevertheless, until now, few works have addressed the application of such criteria to test aspect-oriented programs. In this paper we define a family of control flow and data flow based testing criteria for aspect-oriented programs inspired by the implementation strategy adopted by AspectJ - an aspect-oriented extension of the Java language - and extending a previous work proposed for Java programs. We propose the derivation of a control and data flow model for aspect-oriented programs based upon the static analysis of the object code (the Java bytecode) resulted from the compilation/weaving process. Using this model, called aspect-oriented def-use graph (AODU) traditional and also aspect-oriented testing criteria are defined (called Control and Data Flow Structural Testing Criteria for Aspect-Oriented Programs - CDSTC-AOP). The main idea is that composition of aspect-oriented programs leads to new crosscutting interfaces in several modules of the system, which must be considered for coverage during structural testing. The implementation of a prototype tool - the JaBUTi/AJ tool - to support the proposed criteria and model is presented along with an example. Also, theoretical and practical questions regarding the CDSTC-AOP criteria are discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
