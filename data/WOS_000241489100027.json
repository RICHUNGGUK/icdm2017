The proposed technique is based on employing lightweight algorithms and low-bandwidth data communication between multiple network nodes to track the path of autonomous agents moving across the fields of view (FOV) of the sensors. Segmentation techniques are applied to find the agents within the FOV, and a color histogram is constructed using the hue values of the pixels corresponding to agents. This histogram is used as a means of identification within the network. As such, the algorithm is able to reliably track multicolored agents of irregular shapes and sizes and can resolve identities after collisions. The proposed algorithm has low computational requirements and its complexity scales linearly with the size of the network, so it is feasible in low-power, large-scale wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Color-based multiple agent tracking for wireless image sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100027"}
