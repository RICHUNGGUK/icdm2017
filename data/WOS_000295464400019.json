The delay signal is assumed to be uniformly bounded, differentiable and has a bounded derivative. The problem is first formulated in the framework of H(infinity) filtering by incorporating a priori knowledge of the fault into the design procedure. A hybrid controller, composed of a fault estimator and an impulsive controller, is constructed. Some delay-dependent sufficient conditions are derived on the existence of the hybrid controller by using the multiple Lyapunov functional approach. In addition, based on the cone complementarity algorithm, the solutions to the parameter matrices are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Fault estimator design for a class of switched systems with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000295464400019"}
