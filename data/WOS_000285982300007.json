Each GSM subsystem disturbs identification pilot, while speech coder uniquely changes the tempo-spectral characteristics of the proposed pilot signal. Speech coder identification algorithm identifies speech coder with the usage of robust linear frequency cepstral coefficient (LFCC) feature extraction procedure and fast artificial neural networks. First step of speech coder identification algorithm is the exact position detection of the identification pilot signal using normalized cross correlation approach. Next stage is time-domain windowing of the input signal to convolve each frame of the input speech signal and window spectrum. Consecutive step is a short-time Fast Fourier Transformation to produce the magnitude spectrum of each windowed frame. Further, a noise reduction with spectral subtraction based on spectral smoothing is carried out. In last steps we perform the frequency filtering and Discrete Cosine Transformation to receive 24 uncorrelated cepstral coefficients per frame as a result. Speech coder identification is completed with fast artificial neural network classification using the input feature vector of 24 LFCC coefficients, giving a result of identified speech coder. For GSM speech coder indirect identification evaluation, the standardized GSM ETSI bit-exact implementations were used. Furthermore, a set of custom tools was build. These tools were used to simulate and control various conditions in the GSM system. Final results show that proposed algorithm identifies the GSM-EFR speech coder with the accuracy of 98.85%, the GSM-FR speech coder with 98.71%, and the GSM-HR coder with 98.61%. These scores were achieved at various types of surrounding noises and even at very low SNR conditions.", "paper_title": "GSM Speech Coder Indirect Identification Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000285982300007"}
