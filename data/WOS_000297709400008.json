We model this as a labelling inference procedure and incorporate the part-based representation of the rear-ends of vehicle within a hidden random field based probabilistic model. Representing objects with parts inherently good for dealing with occlusions. In the proposed model, the part labels form a hidden layer in the graphical model. Our approaches can automatically find the latent parts without explicit indication during training. The experiment is performed on the database with real images with a promising result.", "paper_title": "Part-based on-road vehicle detection using hidden random field", "paper_id": "WOS:000297709400008"}
