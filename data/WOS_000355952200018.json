The multitude and diversity of such frameworks has made it increasingly important to identify their interrelationships and relative expressive power. Hypersequent and Display calculi are two widely-used proof frameworks employed to present analytic calculi for large classes of logics. In this article, we show how any hypersequent calculus can be used to construct a display calculus for the same logic. The display calculus we obtain preserves proof-theoretic properties of the original calculus including cut-elimination and the subformula property. Since the construction applies to any hypersequent calculus, this result shows that in terms of presenting logics the display calculus formalism subsumes the hypersequent calculus formalism.", "paper_title": "Embedding the hypersequent calculus in the display calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000355952200018"}
