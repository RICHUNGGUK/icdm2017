An efficient method for adjacent variable interchange is presented and this method is employed to implement a vertex reduction procedure for QMDDs using sifting. Experimental results are presented showing the effectiveness of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "QMDD minimization using sifting for variable reordering", "paper_id": "WOS:000250989800016"}
