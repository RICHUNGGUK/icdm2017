Our aim is to alleviate the shortcomings of the existing designs, such as excessive reliance on battery power and wireless networking, over-emphasized focus on specific use cases, and use of specialized technologies. In our opinion, these shortcomings prevent widespread commercialization and adoption of embedded smart cameras, especially in the context of visual-sensor networks. The proposed principles lead to a distinctively different design, which relies on commoditized, standardized and widely-available components, tools and knowledge. As an example of using these principles in practice, we present a smart camera, which is inexpensive, easy to build and support, capable of high-speed communication and enables rapid transfer of computer-vision algorithms to the embedded world.
