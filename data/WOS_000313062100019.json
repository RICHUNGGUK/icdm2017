Global exponential convergence of such a ZNN model is achieved theoretically in an error-free situation. This paper investigates the performance analysis of the perturbed ZNN model using a special type of activation functions (namely, power-sum activation functions) when solving the time-varying QP problems. Robustness analysis and simulation results demonstrate the superior characteristics of using power-sum activation functions in the context of large ZNN-implementation errors, compared with the case of using linear activation functions. Furthermore, the application to inverse kinematic control of a redundant robot arm also verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the ZNN model for time-varying QP problems solving.", "paper_title": "Superior robustness of power-sum activation functions in Zhang neural networks for time-varying quadratic programs perturbed with large implementation errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000313062100019"}
