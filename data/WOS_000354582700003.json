To improve detection accuracy in terms of feature extraction, HOG has been combined with multiple kinds of low-level features. However, it is still possible to exploit further discriminative information from the classical HOG feature. Inspired by the symmetrical characteristic of pedestrian appearance, we present a novel feature of gradient self-similarity (GSS) in this work. GSS is computed from HOG, and is applied to capturing the patterns of pairwise similarities of local gradient patches. Furthermore, a supervised feature selection approach is employed to remove the non-informative pairs. As a result, the selective GSS (SGSS) feature is built on a concise subset of pair comparisons. The experimental results demonstrate that improvement is achieved by incorporating HOG with GSS/SGSS. In addition, considering that HOG is a prerequisite for GSS/SGSS, it is intuitional to develop a two-level cascade of classifiers for obtaining improved detection performance. Specifically, the first level is a linear SVM with the multiscale HOG features to efficiently remove easy negatives. At the second stage, the already computed HOG features are reused to produce the corresponding GSS/SGSS features, and then the combined features are used to discriminate true positives from candidate image regions. Although simple, this model is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods on the well-known datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
