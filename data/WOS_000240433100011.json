This paper addresses the problem of inferring genetic regulatory networks from time-series gene-expression profiles. By adopting a probabilistic modeling framework compatible with the family of models represented by dynamic Bayesian networks and probabilistic Boolean networks, this paper proposes a network inference algorithm to recover not only the direct gene connectivity but also the regulating orientations. Results: Based on the minimum description length principle, a novel network inference algorithm is proposed that greatly shrinks the search space for graphical solutions and achieves a good trade-off between modeling complexity and data fitting. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves good performance in the case of synthetic networks. Compared with existing state-of-the-art results in the literature, the proposed algorithm exceptionally excels in efficiency, accuracy, robustness and scalability. Given a time-series clataset for Drosophila melanogaster, the paper proposes a genetic regulatory network involved in Drosophila's muscle development.
