In this paper, we present an interaction scenario where user play chess with an iCat robot and propose an affect recognition system that uses computational models to automatically extract visual features allowing the detection of the level of engagement with a social robot that acts as a game companion. Experimental results show that the multimodal integration of head direction information with facial expressions displayed by the user improves the recognition of the user's affective states.
