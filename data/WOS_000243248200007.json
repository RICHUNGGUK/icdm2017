A simple and efficient indexing of the cells of such a subdivision, called A3-coordinates, is introduced. These can be used to encode the 4 . 3(n) + 2 cells at the nth level of resolution of the octahedral aperture 3 hexagonal discrete global grid using n + 3 digits, each digit from the set {- 1, 0, 1}.
