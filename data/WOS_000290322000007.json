In this paper, forgetting factor and random sampling methods are proposed to improve the robustness and efficiency of covariance tracking. First, a distance function between covariance matrixes is weighted by using a forgetting factor based on a fuzzy membership function to overcome the disturbances from similar targets. Then a random sampling method is applied to reduce the computing time in covariance matching and to facilitate real-time object tracking. Experiment results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively mitigate the clutter and occlusion problems at a high computing speed.", "paper_title": "COVARIANCE TRACKING WITH FORGETTING FACTOR AND RANDOM SAMPLING", "paper_id": "WOS:000290322000007"}
