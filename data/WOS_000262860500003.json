The proposed approach is to link traceability requirements to feature data to take advantage of features as the kernel technology for CAD/CAM integration. The paper proposes a solution based on nc_functions that automates and integrates manufacturing traceability for STEP compliant CAD, CAM and CNC systems. The paper presents the new nc_functions and a prototype implementation.", "paper_title": "Manufacturing traceability automation using features and nc-functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000262860500003"}
