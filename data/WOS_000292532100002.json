The goal is to obtain simultaneously the best structure and material, minimizing structural compliance. An algorithmic strategy is presented in a suitable way for parallelization. In terms of parallel computing facilities, an IBM Cluster 1350 is used comprising 70 computing nodes each with two dual core processors, for a total of 280 cores. Scalability studies are performed with mechanical structures of low/moderate dimensions. Finally the applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated solving a grand challenge problem that is the simulation of trabecular bone adaptation. (C) 2010 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
