Although the theoretical bounds on the running time are hopeless for 1 + epsilon approximating k-clusters, we note that for dimensions 2 and 3, k-clustering is practical for small k (k <= 4) and simple enough shapes. For the purposes of this paper, k is a small fixed constant.", "paper_title": "ALMOST OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS TO k-CLUSTERING PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283861500003"}
