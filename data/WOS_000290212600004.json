Latent asynchrony refers to an application's tolerance for decoupling ancillary operations from its core computation, and is a property of HPC codes not fully explored by current HPC I/O systems. Decoupling operations such as buffering and staging, reorganization, and format conversion in space and in time from core codes can shorten I/O phases, preserving valuable MPP compute cycles. We describe in this paper DataTaps, IOgraphs, and Metabots, three tools which allow HPC developers to implement decoupled I/O operations. Using these tools, asynchrony can be exploited by data generators which overlap computation with communication, and by data consumers that perform data conversion and reorganization out-of-band and on-demand. In the context of a data-intensive fusion simulation, we show that exploiting latent asynchrony through decoupling of operations can provide significant performance benefits.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Latent I/O Asynchrony in Petascale Science Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000290212600004"}
