Not only those applications demanding stringent security levels but also many daily use consumer applications request the existence of high performance computational platforms in charge of recognizing the identity of an individual based on the analysis of his/her physiological or behavioural characteristics. The state of the art points out two main open problems in the implementation of such automatic applications: on the one hand, the needed improvement of the reliability level of the existing recognition systems in terms of accuracy, security and real-time performances: on the other hand, the cost reduction of those physical platforms in charge of the processing. This work addresses those limitations of current systems and aims at finding the proper system architecture to develop this kind of high-performance applications at low cost. Because of that, those existing solutions based on expensive multiprocessor systems like HPC (High Performance Computer), CPU (Graphics Processing Unit), or PC (Personal Computer) platforms need to be discarded, and instead of them embedded system solutions based on programmable logic devices are suggested in this work. The programmability performances of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) devices together with the inherent parallelism of hardware design provide the needed flexibility to develop made-to-measure coprocessors in charge of accelerating those time-critical computational tasks. To address the cost of the system, dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs are suggested in this work. The scheduling of the recognition application into a series of mutually exclusive tasks, and the reutilization of those functional resources available in the FPGA by multiplexing different coprocessors in the same area along the application execution time allows reducing the size of the device and therefore its cost at the expense of the reconfiguration overhead. The hardware-software co-design of an AFAS (automatic fingerprint-based authentication system) under two different run-time reconfigurable platforms is presented as the proof of concept of the suggested architecture. The outstanding results achieved in this work pave the way for the implementation of biometric applications by means of run-time reconfigurable FPGAs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
