Unlike previous quad mesh optimization/improvement methods based on local operations on a small group of elements, we adopt a global approach that does not introduce extra singularities and therefore preserves the original quad structure of the input mesh. Starting from a collection of quad patches extracted from an input quad mesh, two global operations, i.e. re-sampling and re-distribution, are performed to optimize the number and spacings of grid lines in each patch. Both operations are formulated as simple optimization problems with linear constraints. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
