This method can transfer a group of input-output data into a time-variant fuzzy system with variable coefficients. It is shown that solutions of time-variant fuzzy systems generalized by DFIML method are universal approximators to solutions of a class of non-autonomous systems. Also the analytical solutions of these time-variant fuzzy systems can be obtained. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the validity and potential of the developed techniques.
