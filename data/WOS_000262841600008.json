In most real-world cases, the electronic documents are simply stored in an enterprise document repository. Owing to the high computation accuracy and efficiency, personal computers have been gradually used to assist domain experts in document authentication tasks (e.g., decision making or process control). Regarding document authentication process management, previous studies focus more on authentication processes without branches and the characteristic of concurrent engineering (CE) is almost ignored in the document authentication issues. In most enterprise knowledge management environment, knowledge validation and authentication is carried out through a collaboration network. Concerning the enterprise operation requirements, this research develops a heuristic model for concurrent authentication process determination based on the existing document authentication history. This research also develops a web-based document authentication information management system and performance of the prototype system is also evaluated via a demonstration case. In summary, by application of the proposed approach, the document authentication process can be automatically determined to support efficient knowledge validation.", "paper_title": "A MODEL FOR DOCUMENT VALIDATION USING CONCURRENT AUTHENTICATION PROCESSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000262841600008"}
