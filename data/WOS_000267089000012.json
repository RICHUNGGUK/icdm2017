Using statistical shape theory, known external influences can be discriminated from true changes of the system. The external effects are modeled as a transformation group acting on the phase space, and variation of the trajectories not explained by the transformations is accounted for using principal component analysis. The approach suggested is highly adaptable to a wide range of situations and individual differences. The methodology presented is applied to detect abnormalities in electrocardiograms. Results based on measured data indicate that the model developed is resistant to the effects of respiration and body position changes, which are abundant in ambulatory conditions and cause significant morphological artifacts in the signal. The results also show that the detection of an artificially induced acute myocardial infarction is achieved with high performance. Due to its low computational complexity, the method developed can be implemented in real-time. The method developed also adapts to morphological changes caused by various heart conditions.
