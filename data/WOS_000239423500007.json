In this paper we analyze the current status of MDD regarding its applicability for the development of Real-Time Embedded Software. We discuss different modeling framework approaches used to specify the various models, and compare OMG/MDA-based approaches (MOF, UML Profiles and executable UML) with a generic MDD-based approach (GME). Finally, we identify the key challenges for future MDD research in order to successfully apply MDD within RTES Development. These challenges are mainly situated in the field of modeling and standardization of abstraction levels, model transformations and code generation, traceability, and integration of existing software within the MDD development process", "paper_title": "Key research challenges for successfully applying MDD within Real-Time Embedded Software development", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423500007"}
