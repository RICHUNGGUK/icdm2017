The methods and theory presented here share many of the desirable features associated with wavelet-based estimators: computational speed, spatial adaptivity, and the capability of detecting discontinuities and singularities with high resolution. Unlike traditional wavelet-based approaches, which impose an upper bound on the degree of smoothness to which they can adapt, the estimators studied here guarantee nonnegativity and do not require any a priori knowledge of the underlying signal's smoothness to guarantee near-optimal performance. At the heart of these methods lie multiscale decompositions based on free-knot, free-degree piecewise-polynomial functions and penalized likelihood estimation. The degrees as well as the locations of the polynomial pieces can be adapted to the observed data, resulting in near-minimax optimal convergence rates. For piecewise-analytic signals, in particular, the error of this estimator converges at nearly the parametric rate. These methods can be further refined in two dimensions, and it is demonstrated that platelet-based estimators in two dimensions exhibit similar near-optimal error convergence rates for images consisting of smooth surfaces separated by smooth boundaries.", "paper_title": "Multiscale Poisson intensity and density estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000249025100014"}
