Data taken from two separate experiments involving broiler and laying hen chickens were used to evaluate the algorithms. The effects of algorithm tuning parameters including thresholds for changes in weight and sequential number of stabilized readings, arithmetic moving average for meal tare values, and the sampling frequency of feed weight recordings were evaluated. Results suggest that a minimum sampling frequency of 0.5-1 Hz is recommended for discerning behavioural changes that include timing of feeding events and their duration. However, lower sampling frequencies are acceptable for determining hourly (or greater) feed consumption. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
