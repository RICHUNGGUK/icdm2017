It generates fuzzy rules directly from the input-output data acquired from sensors, and provides high accuracy and high reliability of the tool wear prediction over a wide range of cutting conditions. The experimental results show its effectiveness and satisfactory comparisons relative to other artificial intelligence methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
