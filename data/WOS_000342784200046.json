In this letter, an encoding algorithm for early termination of Coding Unit (CU) and Prediction Unit (PU) based on the texture direction is proposed for the HEVC intra prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides an average 40% total encoding time reduction with the negligible loss of rate-distortion.", "paper_title": "Texture Direction Based Optimization for Infra Prediction in HEVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200046"}
