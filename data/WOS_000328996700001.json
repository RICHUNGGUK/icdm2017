However, in the multicell system multiple M2M type devices at the edge of a cell may suffer from the strong interference that consists of the intercell interference from other cells and the intracell interference from other M2M devices in the local cell. In this paper, we study the relay beamforming strategy to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the multiple destination devices in multicell systems. We minimize the transmit power of the base stations (BSs) and relays to save the power of M2M devices, while guaranteeing the receive signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) of the destination devices. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose an iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the BS and relay beamforming weights with minimizing the BS and relay power under the receive SINR constraints in the perfect channel state information (CSI). Using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technology, the optimization problems for the BS and relay beamforming weights can be effectively solved. In addition, we also discuss the issue of imperfect CSI in practice. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our proposed iterative scheme can achieve near-optimal performance within a few iterations.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Relay Beamforming Based on Minimum Power for M2M Devices in Multicell Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000328996700001"}
