Results suggest that a protective parental style has the greatest impact on Generation Y's online ethical attitudes, while a strict discipline style has no significant influence. Peers are more influential, but not as influential as when there is agreement between parents and their children on a specific activity. Methodologically, the research highlights the necessity to measure family dyads and assess whether or not parents and their children's perceptions are the same. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
