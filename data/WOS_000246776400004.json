In this article the validity of this conjecture is explored for the class of leapfrog-fullerenes. It is shown that, given an arbitrary fullerene F, the corresponding leapfrog-fullerene Le( F) contains a Hamilton cycle if the number of vertices of F is congruent to 2 modulo 4 and contains a long cycle missing out only two adjacent vertices, and thus also a Hamilton path, if the number of vertices of F is divisible by 4.", "paper_title": "Hamilton cycles and paths in fullerenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000246776400004"}
