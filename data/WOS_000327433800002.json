The computation is fully managed by the GPU using a specialized task pool which facilitates synchronization and communication of processing units. We present two applications of the proposed approach: construction of the bounding volume hierarchies and collision detection based on divide-and-conquer ray tracing. The results indicate that using our approach we achieve high utilization of the GPU even for complex hierarchical problems which pose a challenge for massive parallelization.
