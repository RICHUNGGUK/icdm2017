It combines a straightforward multivariate generalization of a classical one and principal component analysis. This new procedure exhibits promising behavior on classical bench signals and the associated estimator is found to be near minimax in the one-dimensional sense, for Besov balls. The method is finally illustrated by an application to multichannel neural recordings. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
