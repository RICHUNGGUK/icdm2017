More recently, such procurement tools have become available to consumers and are increasingly 1 gaining in popularity. An empirical examination of more than 1400 bid invitations and over 1100 reverse auctions shows that these two types of platforms generate noteworthy consumer surpluses, with the number of bidders being by far the most relevant factor in the determination of surplus levels. Contrary to traditional auction environments like eBay, auction duration and starting prices turn out to be of little relevance for consumer surpluses, as correlation and regression analyses show. The analysis of procurement data further reveals that consumer-driven platforms are particularly suitable for purchases of crafts and services where they provide an efficient mechanism to bring together buyers and sellers and match supply and demand. An exemplary review of results from painting auctions indicates that the price level achieved by consumers in reverse e-procurement is below reference prices which can be obtained in traditional procurement channels.. Being an attractive alternative, reverse e-procurement platforms could bring about a paradigm shift towards buyer-centred e-purchasing.", "paper_title": "Reverse procurement and auctions for consumers - A new trend on the horizon of E-commerce.", "paper_id": "WOS:000235934600005"}
