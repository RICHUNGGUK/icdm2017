An interesting instance of the OTIS multicomputers is the OTIS-mesh. Pancyclicity is of great importance in the implementation of a variety of parallel algorithms in multicomputers. This paper addresses the Pancyclicity problem of OTIS-mesh. More precisely, we prove that if the factor graph G of an OTIS network is a 2-D or 3-D mesh with at least one even radix, OTIS-G can embed any cycle of length l, l is an element of {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, ... , vertical bar G vertical bar(2)}.
