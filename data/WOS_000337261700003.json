The advantage of this architecture over traditional weight-based ones is simpler hardware implementation without multipliers or digital-analog converters (DACs) as well as being suited to time-based computing. The name is derived due to similarity in the learning rule with an earlier architecture called tempotron. The DELTRON can remember more patterns than other delay-based networks by modifying a few delays to remember the most 'salient' or synchronous part of every spike pattern. We present simulations of memory capacity and classification ability of the DELTRON for different random spatio-temporal spike patterns. The memory capacity for noisy spike patterns and missing spikes is also shown. Finally, we present SPICE simulation results of the core circuits involved in a reconfigurable mixed signal implementation of this architecture. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
