Its platform-independent characteristic allows for wide usage during the design phase. However, application in platform-specific processes, such as coding, is less obvious because it requires usage of bespoke tools for that platform. In this paper we propose an approach to generate assertion code for OCL constraints for multiple platform specific languages, using a unified framework based on structural similarities of programming languages. We have succeeded in automating the process of assertion code generation for four different languages using our tool. To show effectiveness of our approach in terms of development effort, an experiment was carried out and summarised.", "paper_title": "Using Hierarchical Transformation to Generate Assertion Code from OCL Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125900023"}
