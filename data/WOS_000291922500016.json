Recognizing the intrinsic connection between the signal power at the intended receiver and the interference power at the unintended receiver, the original family of nonconvex optimization problems is converted into a new family of convex optimization problems. It is shown that, for such interference channels with each receiver implementing single-user detection, transmitter beamforming can achieve all boundary points of the achievable rate region.", "paper_title": "Multiuser MISO Interference Channels With Single-User Detection: Optimality of Beamforming and the Achievable Rate Region", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500016"}
