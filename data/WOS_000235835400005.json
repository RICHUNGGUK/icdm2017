We restricted our analysis in establishing rigourously that passage dynamics can be considered as linear dynamical systems under some limitations in introducing the concept of forced linear passage. Finally, we did some experiments to validate the theoretical results obtained from our analysis.", "paper_title": "Mathematical modeling of passage dynamic function", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835400005"}
