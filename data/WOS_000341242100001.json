The CMOS process, which gains an advantage over Emitter Coupled Logic (ECL) and GaAs in cost and portability, provides sufficient space for TDC development. This paper presents a review of CMOS TDCs classified by circuit topologies and performance. For each TDC structure, the principle exposition and performance analysis are given in detail. Moreover, a comparison among all kinds of TDCs mentioned in this paper is presented in tabular form. Finally, we discuss the obstacle to the development of TDC and the possible tendency for future work in summary.", "paper_title": "A REVIEW OF CMOS TIME-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000341242100001"}
