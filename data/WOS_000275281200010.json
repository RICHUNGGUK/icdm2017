For each of these families, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which given diagonal and opposite diagonal functions can be the diagonal and opposite diagonal sections of a semilinear copula belonging to that family. We focus particular attention on the family of orbital semilinear copulas, which are obtained by linear interpolation on segments connecting the diagonal and opposite diagonal of the unit square.", "paper_title": "ORBITAL SEMILINEAR COPULAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275281200010"}
