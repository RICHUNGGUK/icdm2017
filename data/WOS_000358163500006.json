We present P2Pedia, a social peer-to-peer wiki system, where users have their own local repository and can collaborate by creating, discovering, editing, and sharing pages with their peers but without synchronizing them. Multiple versions of each page can thus co-exist on each repository and across the network, which allows for multiple points of view. Browsing or searching the wiki thus yields multiple page versions; to help the user's page selection process, the system annotates search results with trust indicators based on the distribution of each version in the peer repositories and the topology of the social network. We describe an experimental study where the system was deployed for academic writing exercises, and we analyze the results to validate different aspects of this collaboration principle.
