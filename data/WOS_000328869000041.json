The family of these angular measures is non-parametric by nature. Nonetheless, any angular measure may be approached arbitrarily well by a mixture of Dirichlet distributions. The semi-parametric Dirichlet mixture model for angular measures is theoretically valid in arbitrary dimension, but the original parametrization is subject to a moment constraint making Bayesian inference very challenging in dimension greater than three. A new unconstrained parametrization is proposed. This allows for a natural prior specification as well as a simple implementation of a reversible-jump MCMC. Posterior consistency and ergodicity of the Markov chain are verified and the algorithm is tested up to dimension five. In this non identifiable setting, convergence monitoring is performed by integrating the sampled angular densities against Dirichlet test functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
