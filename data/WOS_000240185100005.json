Due to the high morphological complexity in Spanish, a relatively coarse grammatical categorization is tested in two sorts of texts (sentences from newspapers and a theatre play). The estimation of the type of discontinuity (falling or rising tones) at the boundary of intonation groups is assessed. The HMM approach is tested with: (a) modelling the observation probability with monograms, bigrams and full-window probability; (b) state duration modelling; (c) discriminative analysis of intermediate and final observation vectors and (d) penalization scheme in Viterbi decoding. The optimal configurations led to reductions of 3% or 5% in error detection. The estimation of the observation probability with monograms and bigrants leads to worse results than the ordinary full-window probability, although they provide better generalization. Nevertheless, the performance of the monograms and bigrams approximation can be enhanced if applied in combination with state duration constraints. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
