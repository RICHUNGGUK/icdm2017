Instead of minimizing the reconstruction error either based on L-2-norm or L-1-norm, the MaxEnt-PCA attempts to preserve as much as possible the uncertainty information of the data measured by entropy. The optimal solution of MaxEnt-PCA consists of the eigenvectors of a Laplacian probability matrix corresponding to the MaxEnt distribution. MaxEnt-PCA (1) is rotation invariant, (2) is free from any distribution assumption, and (3) is robust to outliers. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed linear method as compared to other related robust PCA methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
