Furthermore, they minimize the need for caregivers and help the chronically ill and elderly to survive an independent life. In this paper, we propose an outdoor monitoring environment and evaluate the capabilities of video sensor networks for healthcare monitoring in an outdoor setting. The results exhibit that their capabilities are limited. For this reason, we proposed several enhancements for reducing the traffic load on the network for better performance. RFID is a very mature technology that has already been used in many areas. The RFID-enhanced video sensor networks reduce the network traffic load. Moreover, the proximity of the healthcare professionals who are also moving in the surveillance area is also used for better balancing the network load. Finally, for assuring the reporting of the emergency events with low latencies, we propose an emergency frame based queuing mechanism and evaluated its performance through simulations.", "paper_title": "Wireless Healthcare Monitoring with RFID-Enhanced Video Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285609400001"}
