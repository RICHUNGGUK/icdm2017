One dimensional cellular automata, discrete wavelet transform and hash function are adopted in the proposed scheme. The stego images are allowed to be verified to determine whether they are tampered or not. Once the stego images are tampered, shared bits retrieved from these tampered areas cannot be used to reconstruct the secret image. Instead, those damaged areas in the secret image can be repaired by the hidden information. Experimental results exhibit that low computation cost, high tamper detection rate and advanced remedy ability against tampering and cropping attacks are achieved by the proposed scheme.
