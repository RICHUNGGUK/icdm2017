Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) is an emerging killer application which requires high data rate and stringent quality of services (QoS) in terms of delay and packet loss. In this paper, we propose a method to efficiently support high definition video flows in a mmWave-based WPAN with QoS guarantee, considering the characteristics of both the IPTV traffic and the mmWave communication technology. We first quantify the effective bandwidth of IPTV video sources using a simple, two-level Markov traffic model. Considering the overheads of the protocol stack in mmWave WPANs, we then quantify the minimum channel time needed for each IPTV flow. Since mmWave-based WPANs will deploy directional antennas to not only extend the transmission range, but also reduce the interference level to neighboring flows, we further propose an admission control scheme and scheduling algorithm to improve the network resource utilization by taking advantage of concurrent transmissions. Extensive simulations with NS-2 using real video traces have validated our analysis and demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed schemes, which will be an enabling technology for future mmWave-based WPANs supporting IPTV services.", "paper_title": "Resource Management and QoS Provisioning for IPTV over mmWave-based WPANs with Directional Antenna", "paper_id": "WOS:000263978900010"}
