Both the stability results that impulses act as perturbation and the stability results that impulses act as stabiliser are given. Some examples are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. It should be noted that it is the first time that the continuous time impulsive piecewise linear system is considered.", "paper_title": "Stability of impulsive piecewise linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000311084900011"}
