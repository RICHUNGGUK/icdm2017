The perspective of seven years' time and the disestablishment of the system provide an opportunity to study the system life cycle. We detail best practices for multi-level OIS design for long-term performance, based on a publication-mandatory metadata implementation standard using ISO-19115. These principles balance general users' requirements against the requirements of specific scientific applications, and maximize the system's capacity to deal with legacy and heterogeneous data sources, enhancing long-term sustainability and flexibility for diverse multi-level user groups. These findings are relevant to ongoing developments of networked Scientific Information Systems that are increasingly critical to support and sustain the long-term benefits of modeling and observatory science.
