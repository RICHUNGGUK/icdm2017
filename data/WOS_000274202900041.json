Solubility of butane, isobutene, carbon dioxide, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a), 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-142b), 1,1-difluoroethane (HFC-152a) and nitrogen in polystyrene is modeled by ANFIS and RBF NN in a wide range of pressure and temperature with high accuracy. The results obtained in this work indicate that ANFIS and RBF NN are effective methods for prediction of solubility of gases in polystyrene and have better accuracy and simplicity compared with the classical methods.
