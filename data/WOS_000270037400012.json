In this paper, the interests and limitations of technology scaling for subthreshold logic are investigated from 0.25 mu m to 32 nm nodes. Scaling to 90/65 nm nodes is shown to be highly desirable for medium-throughput applications (1-10 MHz) due to great dynamic energy reduction. However, this interest is limited at 45/32 nm nodes by high static energy due to degraded subthreshold swing and delay variability. Moreover, for low-throughput applications (10-100 kHz), this limitation is worsened by the increase of minimum supply voltage to achieve sufficient functional yield, which results in bad energy efficiency starting at 0.13 mu m node. Up-sizing the channel length is proposed as a straightforward circuit-level technique to efficiently mitigate these effects. At 32 nm node, this technique reduces energy per operation by 60% at medium throughput and by two orders of magnitude at low throughput.", "paper_title": "Interests and Limitations of Technology Scaling for Subthreshold Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000270037400012"}
