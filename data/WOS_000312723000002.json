The primary benefits of CES over EPON (CESoEPON) are the low cost and simplicity of deployment to support all types of legacy TDM applications across EPONs. Thus, the QoS-guarantee for highly delay-sensitive services on EPONs could be enhanced. This paper investigates a preemptive priority transmission technique that works on MAC and PHY layer of downstream EPONs. The proposed novel scheme effectively reduces the frame queuing delay as well as jitter, so as to enhance precise time synchronization in EPONs. Through simulation experiments, we show that the proposed scheme achieves superior and precise QoS control compared to existing non-preemptive priority methods. A feasible implementation of the proposed solution is also addressed. Finally, we present a general conclusion of the paper as well as address the pros and cons for practical deployment in future works.", "paper_title": "Deploying Circuit Emulation Services (CES) Over EPON Using Preemptive Priority Medium Access Controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000312723000002"}
