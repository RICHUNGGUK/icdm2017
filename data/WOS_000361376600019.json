In this method we embed the binary perceptual hash values into the compressed audio as a digital watermark so that authentication data is dispersed. An ECC is used to pre-process perceptual hash sequence to ensure that speech signal with watermarking can be extracted watermarking information (the perceptual hash values) after been attacked. The experimental result illustrate that this method embeds information without influencing on the content. It is robust to noise and can prevent from common attack. At the same time, this method ensures the hearing transparency of audio perceptual content, the high efficiency of watermark extraction and the efficiency and security of algorithm.", "paper_title": "Research on Security Transmission of Perceptual Hash Values Based on ECC and Digital Watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000361376600019"}
