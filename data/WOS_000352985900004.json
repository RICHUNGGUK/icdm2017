We show that, asymptotically as N -> infinity, stable configurations have four possible phases of the particle density depending on the external field, which is assumed to be a function of N. Moreover, we find these phases explicitly.", "paper_title": "Phase transitions in the one-dimensional coulomb medium", "paper_id": "WOS:000352985900004"}
