The connection is composed by concrete corbels, dowels and continuity bars passing through the column. The study was developed based on the experimental and numerical results. In the experimental analysis a full scale specimen was tested and for numerical study, a 3D computational model was created using a finite element analyze (FEA) software, called DIANA. The comparison of the results showed a satisfactory correlation between loading versus displacement curves.", "paper_title": "Study on the behavior of beam-column connection in precast concrete structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000358477700009"}
