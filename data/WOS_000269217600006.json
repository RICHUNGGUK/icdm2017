The success of service delivery in vehicular networks depends on the underlying communication system to enable the user devices to connect to a large number of communicating peers and even to the Internet. This poses many new research challenges, especially in the aspects of security, user privacy, and billing. In this article we first identify the key requirements of authentication, privacy preservation, and billing for service delivery in vehicular networks. We then review the existing industrial and academic efforts on service-oriented vehicular networks. We also point out two security challenges, minimizing vehicle-to-infrastructure authentication latency and distributed public key revocation, which are considered among the most challenging design objectives in service-oriented vehicular networks. A novel fast vehicle-to-infrastructure authentication based on a vehicle mobility prediction scheme and an infrastructure-based short-time certificate management scheme are then proposed to address these two challenges.", "paper_title": "SECURITY IN SERVICE-ORIENTED VEHICULAR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269217600006"}
