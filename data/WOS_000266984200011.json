However, the resource utilization may greatly suffer if the hierarchical architecture is not properly arranged. By considering the degree of each WDM node and the location effect, this paper proposes a systematic approach to construct the hierarchical topology in WDM networks so that resource utilization can be maximized. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed scheme is superior to that of another scheme.", "paper_title": "A connectivity-based approach for the construction of hierarchical WDM network topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000266984200011"}
