We study rings occurring as quotients of a natural O-F-order Lambda in D by two-sided ideals. We reduce the problem to studying the ideal structure of Lambda/q(s)Lambda, where q is a prime ideal in O-F, s >= 1. We study the case where q remains unramified in K, both when s = 1 and s > 1. This work is motivated by its applications to space-time coded modulation.", "paper_title": "QUOTIENTS OF ORDERS IN CYCLIC ALGEBRAS AND SPACE-TIME CODE", "paper_id": "WOS:000326231000004"}
