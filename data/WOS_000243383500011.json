If mismatches are allowed between the pattern and the database strings, no such structure with reasonable size is known. Some work can be saved using a trie and running times superior to the comparison with every string in the database can be achieved. We investigate a comparison-based model where matches and mismatches are defined between pairs of characters. When comparing two characters, let q be the probability of an error. Between any two strings we bound the number of errors by d, which we consider a function of n. We study the average-case complexity of the number of comparisons for searching in a trie in dependence of the parameters q and d. Our analysis yields the asymptotic behavior for memoryless sources with uniform probabilities. It turns out that there is a jump in the average-case complexity at certain thresholds for q and d. Our results can be applied for any comparison-based error model, for instance, Hamming distance, don't cares, or geometric character distances.", "paper_title": "Average-case analysis of approximate trie search", "paper_id": "WOS:000243383500011"}
