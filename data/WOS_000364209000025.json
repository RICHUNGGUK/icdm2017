This paper proposes a low-cost and efficient test and diagnosis scheme without extra design for test structure or special probe technologies. A test probe head with current technology is in use, contacting multiple TSVs simultaneously. We propose an efficient binary search-based algorithm to guide the probe card movement and diagnose the faulty TSVs. To evaluate the test efficiency, mathematical analyses are performed considering geometric, probabilistic, and electronic issues including process variations and different probe architectures. The analysis demonstrates that the test efficiency can be largely enhanced by choosing appropriate sizes of probe needles, and by adjusting iteration algorithms according to the distribution of faulty TSVs.", "paper_title": "A Low-Cost TSV Test and Diagnosis Scheme Based on Binary Search Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000025"}
