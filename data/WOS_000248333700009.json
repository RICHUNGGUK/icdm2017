Experimental tests were performed to study the in. uence of several process parameters, that is, compaction pressure, foaming time, temperature and amount of foamable precursor material, on the kinetics of foaming process. As the large number of experimental factors involved in metal foams manufacturing, an experimental approach based upon DOE techniques was employed to reduce the trials need for individuating the best process windows. Hence, in such operative ranges, further experimental tests were carried out to trace the full trends of foaming effi. ciency according to leading parameters, thereby laying the basis to support manufacturers on how to deal with the operative troubles and process settings.", "paper_title": "Metal foams for structural applications: design and manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000248333700009"}
