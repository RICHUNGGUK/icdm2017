Approximate string matching techniques for full text retrieval, e.g., edit distance and cosine similarity, can be adopted for unstructured text record similarity evaluation. However, these techniques do not show the best performance when applied directly, owing to the difference between unstructured text records and full text. In particular, the information are limited in text records of short length, and various information formats such as abbreviation and data missing greatly affect the record similarity evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic correlation-based similarity measure. Rather than simply conducting the matching of tokens between two records, our similarity evaluation enriches the information of records by considering correlations of tokens. The probabilistic correlation between tokens is defined as the probability of them appearing together in the same records. Then we compute weights of tokens and discover correlations of records based on the probabilistic correlations of tokens. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
