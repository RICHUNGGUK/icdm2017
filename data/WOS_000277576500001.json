The stochastic stability and the stochastic stabilization problems of this class of systems are revisited and new conditions are developed in the LMI setting to either check the stochastic stability or to design the state feedback controller that stochastically stabilizes the system under consideration. It is shown that all the addressed problems can be solved if the corresponding developed linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. Numerical examples are employed to show the usefulness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "STABILITY AND STABILIZABILITY OF DISCRETE-TIME SYSTEMS WITH UNKNOWN TRANSITION PROBABILITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500001"}
