The proposed steganalyzer models linear dependencies of image rows/columns in local neighborhoods using singular value decomposition transform and employs content independency provided by a Wiener filtering process. Experimental results show that the novel method has superior performance when compared with its counterparts in terms of spatial domain steganography. Experiments also demonstrate the reasonable ability of the method to detect discrete cosine transform-based steganography as well as the perturbation quantization method.", "paper_title": "SVD-Based Universal Spatial Domain Image Steganalysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000277777200013"}
