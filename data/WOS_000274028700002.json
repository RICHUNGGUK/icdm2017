We present a method for lattice-based spoken document retrieval based on a statistical n-gram modeling approach to information retrieval. In this statistical lattice-based retrieval (SLBR) method, a smoothed statistical model is estimated for each document from the expected counts of words given the information in a lattice, and the relevance of each document to a query is measured as a probability under such a model. We investigate the efficacy of our method under various parameter settings of the speech recognition and lattice processing engines, using the Fisher English Corpus of conversational telephone speech. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves better retrieval performance than using only the 1-best transcripts in statistical retrieval, outperforms a recently proposed lattice-based vector space retrieval method, and also compares favorably with a lattice-based retrieval method based on the Okapi BM25 model.", "paper_title": "Statistical Lattice-Based Spoken Document Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000274028700002"}
