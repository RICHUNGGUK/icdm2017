In hybrid storage systems, there exists a two-level cache hierarchy that regard dynamic random access memory (DRAM) as the first level cache and SSD as the second level cache for disk storage. However, this two-level cache hierarchy typically uses independent cache replacement policies for each level, which makes cache resource management inefficient and reduces system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive multi-level cache (AMC) replacement algorithm in hybrid storage systems. The AMC algorithm adaptively adjusts cache blocks between DRAM and SSD cache levels using an integrated solution. AMC uses combined selective promote and demote operations to dynamically determine the level in which the blocks are to be cached. In this manner, the AMC algorithm achieves multi-level cache exclusiveness and makes cache resource management more efficient. By using real-life storage traces, our evaluation shows the proposed algorithm improves hybrid multi-level cache performance and also increases the SSD lifetime compared with traditional multi-level cache replacement algorithms.
