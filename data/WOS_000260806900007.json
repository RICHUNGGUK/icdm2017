However, in order for the full potential of the Semantic Web to be achieved, the ability of reasoning over the available information is also essential. Rules can assist in this affair and various logics have been proposed for the Semantic Web domain. One of them is defeasible reasoning that deals with incomplete and conflicting information. However, despite its solid mathematical notation, it may be confusing to end users. To confront this downside, we proposed a representation schema for defeasible logic rule bases, which is based on directed graphs that feature distinct node and connection types. This paper presents DR-VisMo, a defeasible logic rule base editor and visualization system that implements this representation approach. The system also features a stratification algorithm for visualizing rule bases that deals with decisions, regarding the arrangement of the various elements in the graph. DR-VisMo is implemented as part of VDR-DEVICE, an environment for modeling and deploying defeasible logic rule bases on top of RDF ontologies.", "paper_title": "VISUAL MODELING OF DEFEASIBLE LOGIC RULES WITH DR-VisMo", "paper_id": "WOS:000260806900007"}
