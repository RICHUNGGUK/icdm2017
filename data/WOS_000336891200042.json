In the literature, the data hider and image provider must be specific parties who know the shared key with the receiver in traditional encrypted image-based reversible data hiding. In this paper, we propose an encrypted signal-based reversible data hiding (ESRDH) with public key cryptosystem, not only for images. The proposed scheme is secure based on Paillier homomorphic encryption. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed scheme has much payload and high signal quality.
