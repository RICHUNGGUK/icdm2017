We derive a Bell-like inequality that the efficiency of every classical solution for our problem has to obey, and demonstrate its violation by the quantum efficiency. This proves that no classical strategy can be more efficient than the quantum one.", "paper_title": "Entanglement-assisted orientation in space", "paper_id": "WOS:000238794900008"}
