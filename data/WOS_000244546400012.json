The same configuration data can be transferred in multicast fashion to configure many Processing Elements (PEs) by using a multicast bit-map provided in row and column directions of PE array. Evaluation results using practical applications show that a model reconfigurable system that incorporates this scheme can reduce configuration clock cycles by up to 73.1% compared with traditional configuration delivery scheme. Amount of required memory to store the configuration data at external memory is also reduced by omitting the duplicated configuration data.", "paper_title": "Data multicasting procedure for increasing configuration speed of coarse grain reconfigurable devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000244546400012"}
