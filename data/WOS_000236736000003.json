Due to the nature of such applications, storing the evolution of objects through time in order to answer historical queries (queries that refer to past states of the evolution) requires a very large specialized database, what is termed in this article a spatiotemporal archive. Efficient processing of historical queries on spatiotemporal archives requires equally sophisticated indexing schemes. Typical spatiotemporal indexing techniques represent the objects using minimum bounding regions (MBR) extended with a temporal dimension, which are then indexed using traditional multidimensional index structures. However, rough MBR approximations introduce excessive overlap between index nodes, which deteriorates query performance. This article introduces a robust indexing scheme for answering spatiotemporal queries more efficiently. A number of algorithms and heuristics are elaborated that can be used to preprocess a spatiotemporal archive in order to produce finer object approximations, which, in combination with a multiversion index structure, will greatly improve query performance in comparison to the straightforward approaches. The proposed techniques introduce a query efficiency vs. space tradeoff that can help tune a structure according to available resources. Empirical observations for estimating the necessary amount of additional storage space required for improving query performance by a given factor are also provided. Moreover, heuristics for applying the proposed ideas in an online setting are discussed. Finally, a thorough experimental evaluation is conducted to show the merits of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Indexing spatiotemporal archives", "paper_id": "WOS:000236736000003"}
