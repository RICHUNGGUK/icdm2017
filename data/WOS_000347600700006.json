In particular: (i) we propose a user-oriented view of the unfolding technique, which simply tells which information will be preserved in the final prefix and how to declare an event a cut-off in the algorithm, while hiding the technical parameters like the adequate order; (ii) the notion of the adequate order is generalised to a well-founded relation, and the requirement that it must refine subset of is replaced by a weaker one; and (iii) the order in which the unfolding algorithm selects the possible extensions of the prefix is entirely disentangled from the cut-off condition. We demonstrate the usefulness of the developed theory on some case studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
