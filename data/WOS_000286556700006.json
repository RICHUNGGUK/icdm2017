In this paper, an alternative control system is introduced to describe a dynamic system with fuzzy white noise. In order to find optimal ways to control such a system, fuzzy optimal control theory is further developed. Specifically, a linear quadratic model is formulated and solved as a fuzzy optimal control problem. The formulation and solution of this model provide an economic interpretation of a production planning model both in the finite horizon and in the infinite horizon. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
