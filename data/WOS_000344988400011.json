First responders must coordinate their responses, immediate casualties require assistance, and all affected citizens may need to access information and contact friends and relatives. Existing access and core infrastructure may be damaged or destroyed, so to support the required services, new infrastructure must be rapidly deployed and integrated with undamaged resources still in place. This new equipment should be flexible enough to interoperate with legacy systems and heterogeneous technologies. The ability to self-organize is essential in order to minimize any delays associated with manual configuration. Finally, it must be robust and reliable enough to support mission-critical applications. Wireless systems can be more easily reconfigured than wired solutions to adapt to the various changes in the operating environment that can occur in a disaster scenario. A cognitive radio is one that can observe its operating environment, make decisions and reconfigure in response to these observations, and learn from experience. This article examines the use of cognitive radio technologies for disaster response networks and shows that they are ideally suited to fulfill the unique requirements of these networks. Key enabling technologies for realizing real-world cognitive radio networks for disaster response are discussed and core challenges are examined.", "paper_title": "COGNITIVE RADIO FOR DISASTER RESPONSE NETWORKS: SURVEY, POTENTIAL, AND CHALLENGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000344988400011"}
