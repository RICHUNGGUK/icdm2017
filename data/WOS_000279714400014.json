In this work we propose the first generic construction of certificateless encryption, which can be proven secure against malicious-but-passive KGC attacks in the standard model. In order to encrypt a message of any length, we consider the KEM/DEM (key encapsulation mechanism/data encapsulation mechanism) framework in the certificateless setting, and propose a generic construction of certificateless key encapsulation mechanism (CL-KEM) secure against malicious-but-passive KGC attacks in the standard model. It is based on an identity-based KEM, a public key encryption and a message authentication code. The high efficiency of our construction is due to the efficient implementations of these underlying building blocks, and is comparable to Bentahar et al.'s CL-KEMs, which have only been proven secure under the random oracle model with no consideration of the malicious-but-passive KGC attack. We also introduce the notion of certificateless tag-based KEM (CL-TKEM), which is an extension of Abe et al.' s work to the certificateless setting. We show that an efficient CL-TKEM can be constructed by modifying our CL-KEM scheme. We also show that with a CL-TKEM and a data encapsulation mechanism secure under our proposed security model, an efficient certificateless hybrid encryption can be constructed by applying Abe et al.'s transformation in the certificateless setting.", "paper_title": "Generic Certificateless Encryption Secure Against Malicious-but-Passive KGC Attacks in the Standard Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000279714400014"}
