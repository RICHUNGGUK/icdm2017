The widely used Mander model of concentric loading is adapted here to eccentric loading by developing an auto-adjustable stress-strain curve based on the eccentricity of the axial load or the size of the compression zone to generate more accurate interaction diagrams. The prediction of the ultimate unconfined capacity is straight forward. On the other hand, the prediction of the actual ultimate capacity of confined concrete columns requires specialized nonlinear analysis. This nonlinear procedure is programmed using C-Sharp to build efficient software that can be used for design, analysis, extreme event evaluation and forensic engineering. The software is equipped with an elegant graphics interface that assimilates input data, detail drawings, capacity diagrams and demand point mapping in a single sheet. Options for preliminary design, section and reinforcement selection are seamlessly integrated as well. Improvements to KDOT Bridge Design Manual using this software with reference to AASKTO LRFD are made.", "paper_title": "Software for adaptable eccentric analysis of confined concrete circular columns", "paper_id": "WOS:000310406500001"}
