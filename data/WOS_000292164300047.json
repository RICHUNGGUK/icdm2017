However, high precision projection methods are either computationally expensive or not flexible enough to enable feedback from user interaction into the projection process. A built-in mechanism that dynamically adapts the projection based on direct user intervention would make the technique more useful for a larger range of applications and data sets. In this paper we propose the Piecewise Laplacian-based Projection (PLP), a novel multidimensional projection technique, that, due to the local nature of its formulation, enables a versatile mechanism to interact with projected data and to allow interactive changes to alter the projection map dynamically, a capability unique of this technique. We exploit the flexibility provided by PLP in two interactive projection-based applications, one designed to organize pictures visually and another to build music playlists. These applications illustrate the usefulness of PLP in handling high-dimensional data in a flexible and highly visual way. We also compare PLP with the currently most promising projections in terms of precision and speed, showing that it performs very well also according to these quality criteria.", "paper_title": "Piecewise Laplacian-based Projection for Interactive Data Exploration and Organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000292164300047"}
