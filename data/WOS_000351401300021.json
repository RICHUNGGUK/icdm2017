In addition, the home agent does not have to maintain any verification table for authenticating the mobile user. We give formal analyses to show that our proposed scheme satisfies the security requirements of user anonymity, mutual authentication, session-key security, and perfect forward secrecy. Besides, some possible attacks on the proposed scheme are discussed, such as the replay attack, the man-in-middle attack, the impersonation attack, and the insider attack.", "paper_title": "Provably Secure Anonymous Authentication Scheme for Roaming Service in Global Mobility Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351401300021"}
