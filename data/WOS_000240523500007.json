In this paper, an algorithm for generating T-ZCZ sequence set is presented. Moreover, in order to study the restrictions among the parameters such as the length of the sequence, the number of the sequences and the length of the T-ZCZ etc.. the corresponding theoretical bound is investigated and proved. Additionally, the performance of T-ZCZ sequence in MC-CDMA system is evaluated to confirm the capability of interference cancellation as well as system capacity improvement.", "paper_title": "Sequence set with three zero correlation zones and its application in MC-CDMA system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240523500007"}
