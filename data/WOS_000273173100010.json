The described method applies mathematical morphology for polar/radial-invariant image filtering and for circular segmentation using shortest paths from generalized grey-level distances. The proposed algorithm obtained good results on the NICE-I contest and showed a very robust behavior, especially when dealing with half-closed eyes, different skin colours/illumination or subjects wearing glasses.
