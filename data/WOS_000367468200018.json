The presented approach is based on a new representation of GPR signals by polynomials approximation. The coefficients of the polynomial (the feature vector) are neural network inputs for automatic classification of a special kind of geologic structure-a sinkhole. The analysis and results show that the classifier can effectively distinguish sinkholes from other geologic structures.", "paper_title": "NEURAL NETWORKS AS A TOOL FOR GEORADAR DATA PROCESSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000367468200018"}
