This process can be transformed mathematically into solving a linear system with a blurring matrix. Particularly, the blurring matrix is determined from not only a point spread function (PSF), which defines how each pixel is blurred, but also boundary conditions (BCs), which specify our assumptions on the data outside the domain of consideration. In this paper, we first propose shifting reflective BCs which preserve the continuity at the boundaries and, therefore, reduce ringing effects in the restored image. A Kronecker product approximation of the corresponding blurring matrix is then provided, regardless of symmetry requirement of the PSF. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our approximation in an SVD-based regularization method by several numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Image restoration with shifting reflective boundary conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000320077800005"}
