We briefly describe Theory-W, the WinWin negotiation model, available processes, and tool support. We then discuss how students can benefit from WinWin in their software engineering education. We explore different options for teaching the approach and present concrete examples and experiences from the different universities. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
