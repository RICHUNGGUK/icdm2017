It is shown that room acoustic parameters such as the clarity (C50) and the definition (D50) correlate well with the ASR results. When available, such room acoustic parameters can provide insight into reverberant speech ASR performance and potential improvement via dereverberation preprocessing. It is also shown that the application of a recent dereverberation method based on perceptual modelling can be used in the above context and achieve significant Phone Recognition (PR) improvement, especially under highly reverberant conditions.
