However, such method may not fit for the characteristics of MSASs where the agents are distributed and decide their activities autonomously. To solve such problem, this paper introduces the social force model for adjusting the sensing ranges of multiple sensing agents, which can make the agents adjust their sensing ranges autonomously according to their social forces to other agents and the sensing objects. Based on the social force model, the coverage and optimization models are presented for both point-type and area-type objects. The presented model can produce appropriate social forces among the sensing agents and objects in MSASs; thereby the system observability and lifetime can be improved.", "paper_title": "A SOCIAL FORCE MODEL FOR ADJUSTING SENSING RANGES IN MULTIPLE SENSING AGENT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000317083900005"}
