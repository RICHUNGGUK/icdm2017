In this paper, we survey existing technologies in federate migration for the purpose of balancing load, and focus on the selection of destination node for a federate to migrate to. Different from traditional methods, the proposed method takes into consideration not only the load of CPU & memory, but also communications among federates when selecting the destination node. Moreover, the procedure of migration is described and a prototype is implemented on the basis of Globus Toolkit 3.0 to validate its functionality and performance.", "paper_title": "Federate migration in grid-based virtual wargame collaborative environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300071"}
