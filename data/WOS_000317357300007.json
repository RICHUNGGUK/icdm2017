In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which cooperation offers better performance and the corresponding optimal power allocation during cooperation. Specifically, we first derive an expression of ergodic capacity and its upper bound for an AF cooperative communication system with n relay nodes. Secondly, we propose a novel quasi-optimal power allocation (QOPA) scheme to maximize the upper bound of the derived ergodic capacity. For the QOPA scheme, the cooperative mode is only adopted when the channel gain of source-to-destination is worse than that of relay-to-destination. Moreover, we analyze the performance of the system with QOPA scheme when the relay moves, which is based on the random direction model, in a single-relay wireless network. For a multi-relay AF network, we compare the ergodic capacity and symbol error rate, corresponding to the proposed QOPA and equal power allocation schemes, respectively. Extensive simulations were conducted to validate analytical results, showing that both ergodic capacity and symbol error rate of the system with QOPA scheme are better than those of the system with equal power allocation scheme in a multi-relay AF network.
