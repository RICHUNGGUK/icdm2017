Using patent citation as a proxy measure of disembodied knowledge flow, national knowledge network is developed. Structural equivalence measure is applied to comparing the knowledge network of Korea and Taiwan with that of USA. Static and dynamic compafison make it possible to benchmark disembodied knowledge flow structure efficiently and identify convergent and divergent industries between developing countries and USA. It is also a mesostudy that could be conducive to building a comprehensive analytical framework of national innovation system.", "paper_title": "On the benchmarking method of patent-based knowledge flow structure: Comparison of Korea and Taiwan with USA", "paper_id": "WOS:000242672200006"}
