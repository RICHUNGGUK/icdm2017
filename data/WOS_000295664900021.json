The use of the active lateral secondary suspension is to attenuate the vehicle body lateral vibration on straight track, while complementing tilt action during curving. Various control strategies are proposed to accommodate both tilt and active lateral suspension multiple design requirements, whilst considering the strong interaction between vehicle body roll and lateral modes. Compared with the commercial solutions for tilt control, the proposed integration strategy improves the tilting control performance both on curved and straight track as illustrated by simulation tests and control assessments based on given track profiles.
