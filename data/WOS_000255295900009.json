However, standard component models and tools are not suitable for this type of system, since they do not explicitly address real time, memory or cost constraints. This paper presents a new predictable component model for real-time systems (UM-RTCOM) together with a set of tools to support it. The environment allows new components to be developed which can then be assembled to build complete applications, including hardware interaction. The model includes support for real-time analysis at the component and application level. The analysis is achieved by combining component meta-information in the form of an abstract behaviour model and a method to measure worst-case execution times in the final platform. Additionally, we propose an implementation model based on RT-CORBA where the developer uses the UM-RTCOM components and a set of tools to map these elements to elements of the desired platform. In order to apply our proposals, we have used the model and tools in real applications specifically in the context of nuclear power plant simulators. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
