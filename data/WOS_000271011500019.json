The method combines pharmacophore perception and database screening with protein-ligand energetic terms computed by the Glide XP scoring function to rank the importance of pharmacophore features. We derive energy-optimized pharmacophore hypotheses for 30 pharmaceutically relevant crystal structures and screen a database to assess the enrichment of active compounds. The method is compared to three other approaches: (1) pharmacophore hypotheses derived from a systematic assessment of receptor-ligand contacts, (2) Glide SP docking, and (3) 2D ligand fingerprint similarity. The method developed here shows better enrichments than the other three methods and yields a greater diversity of actives than the contact-based pharmacophores or the 2D ligand similarity. Docking produces the most cases (28/30) with enrichments greater than 10.0 in the top I% of the database and on average produces the greatest diversity of active molecules. The combination of energy terms from a structure-based analysis with the speed of a ligand-based pharmacophore search.results in a method that leverages the strengths of both approaches to produce high enrichments with a g6od diversity of active molecules.", "paper_title": "Novel Method for Generating Structure-Based Pharmacophores Using Energetic Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000271011500019"}
