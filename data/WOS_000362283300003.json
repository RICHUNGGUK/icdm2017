Existing research has investigated how to assign workers to such team-based tasks to ensure the best outcome assuming the skills of individual workers to be known. In this work, we investigate how to estimate individual worker's skill based on the outcome of the team-based tasks they have undertaken. We consider two popular skill aggregation functions and estimate the skill of the workers, where skill is either a deterministic value or a probability distribution. We propose efficient solutions for worker skill estimation using continuous and discrete optimization techniques. We present comprehensive experiments and validate the scalability and effectiveness of our proposed solutions using multiple real-world datasets.", "paper_title": "Worker Skill Estimation in Team-Based Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000362283300003"}
