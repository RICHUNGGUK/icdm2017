Neonatal seizures are the most frequent manifestation of neonatal neurologic disorders. Multichannel EEG recordings allow topographic localization of seizure foci. Objectives: We want to objectively determine the spatial distribution of the seizure on the scalp, the location in time and order the dominant sources in the brain based on their strength. Methods: In this paper we combine a method based on higher order CP-decomposition with subsequent singular value decomposition (SVD). Results: We illustrate the abilities of the method on simulated as well as on real neonatal seizure EEG. Conclusions: The proposed method provides reliable time and spatial information about the seizure, gives a clear overview of what is going on in the EEG and allows easy interpretation.", "paper_title": "Time Varying Neonatal Seizure Localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000283707500012"}
