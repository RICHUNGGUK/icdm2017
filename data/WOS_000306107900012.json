The main contribution of this work is to improve the f(1)-f(2) heuristic algorithm which was proposed by Huang et al. [3]. The objective of the f(1)-f(2) heuristic algorithm is to get a satisfaction level (SL) value which is satisfied to the bi-objective values f(1), and f(2) for the personnel assignment problem. In this paper, PSORK algorithm searches the solution of BOPAP space thoroughly. The experimental results show that the solution quality of BOPAP based on the proposed method is far better than that of the f(1)-f(2) heuristic algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
