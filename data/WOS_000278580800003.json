This paper proposes an adaptive pixel interpolation technique for spatial error concealment in the block based coding system. For a missing pixel in a corrupted block, its value is derived from four neighborhoods of the block through interpolation using multiple prediction strategy. The weighting rules of these four neighborhood blocks are carefully designed with regard to three factors, the distance to the missing pixels within the given corrupted block, the percentage of uncorrupted pixels, and the similarity to the given corrupted block. The proposed method works effectively in consecutive block loss situation, which is common in real applications of video transmission. Experimental results show the proposed technique gains more accurate recovery of the missing pixels than the existing schemes.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Pixel Interpolation for Spatial Error Concealment", "paper_id": "WOS:000278580800003"}
