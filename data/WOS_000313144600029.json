These networks are characterized by low transmission rates, extended packet losses and limited power resources, factors that degrade the overall system performance. Especially in the cases of transmitting multimedia content, a considerable number of data packets are dropped, with a corresponding direct effect on the received image quality. For dealing with this loss of valuable information, various retransmission schemes have been proposed that act as quality of service modules. However, this approach increases energy consumption and inserts considerable time delays, due to the rise of the traffic load in the network. This article proposes a novel dual transmission scheme, targeting mainly the area of Multimedia WSNs (WMSN), that aims to decrease the overall traffic load introduced by the retransmission schemes, by performing image restoration for lost data packets, at the receiver side. The proposed novel dual scheme is based on: (a) the quad tree decomposition algorithm that is adopted for compressing the image data before transmission over the WSN, and (b) the fast image inpainting algorithm for restoring the effect of the missing data packets. The overall proposed scheme has been applied in multiple experimental studies that prove its efficacy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
