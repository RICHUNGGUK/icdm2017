Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected in a multiple case study of four manufacturing companies. Findings - Four PM activities and three ERP system lifecycle phases were described and analyzed. Eight propositions were generated from theory and the case analyses. Detailed demand specifications could have improved target setting and reporting possibilities, PM education and training seem to be important in both the implementation and the use phase and supply chain PM is highly affected in the use phase. Research limitations/implications - The paper is explorative. A required next step would be to test the generated propositions on a larger population. Practical implications - Propositions of what supply chain PM issues manufacturing companies should consider in the ERP system selection, implementation and use phases are presented. The results indicate that a lot of supply chain PM improvements can be realized within the use phase of an existing ERP system. Originality/value - No previous paper has focused upon how to consider supply chain PM when implementing ERP systems. This is needed because previous studies have identified ERP systems as obstacles for supply chain PM.", "paper_title": "Selection, implementation and use of ERP systems for supply chain performance management", "paper_id": "WOS:000285567500003"}
