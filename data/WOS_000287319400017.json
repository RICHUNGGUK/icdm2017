A catalogue of four circuit structures, each structure realizing nine oscillator circuits, is presented. Moreover, using the RC:CR transformation, additional nine oscillator circuits can be obtained from each structure. While each circuit requires five passive elements, some of the circuits enjoy one or more of the following attractive features: use of grounded capacitors, feasibility of absorbing the parasitic components of the CFOAs and orthogonal tuning of the frequency and the startup condition of oscillation.", "paper_title": "New two CFOA-based sinusoidal RC oscillators with buffered outlet", "paper_id": "WOS:000287319400017"}
