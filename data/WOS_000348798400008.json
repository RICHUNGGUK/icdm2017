In many applications, users have requirements that their MapReduce jobs should be completed before specific deadlines. Hence, in this paper, a novel scheduling algorithm based on the most effective sequence (SAMES) is proposed for deadline-constraint jobs in MapReduce. First, according to the characteristics of MapReduce, we propose a novel sequence-based execution strategy for MapReduce jobs and a new concept, the effective sequence (ES). Then, we design some efficient approaches for finding ESes and choose the most effective sequence (MES) for job execution. We also propose methods for MES-updates and exception handling. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of SAMES through experiments. The experimental results show that SAMES is an efficient scheduling algorithm for deadline-constraint jobs in MapReduce.", "paper_title": "SAMES: deadline-constraint scheduling in MapReduce", "paper_id": "WOS:000348798400008"}
