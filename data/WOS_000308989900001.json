A high quality video of a professional symphony orchestra was recorded high above the first rows of the audience area. The movement of the instrument bodies and the bow hands of the players were tracked with the video to resolve the time instants when the directions of the bow movements changed for individual players. The proposed tracking approach is evaluated extensively against several other methods. The temporal distributions of the bow direction changes were analysed from one longer and three shorter cases. The results indicate that one half of the bow strokes of a group of three players occur in an approximate 60 ms time-frame.", "paper_title": "Temporal Differences in String Bowing of Symphony Orchestra Players", "paper_id": "WOS:000308989900001"}
