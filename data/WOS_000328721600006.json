In this model, the intermediate component, inherited component, virtual component are defined in the specific maintenance management domain, and the transformation process from engineering BOM to maintenance BOM is discussed through feature recognition methods and rules. The proposed transformation model has been developed and deployed in an MRO system for a steel manufacturing enterprise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
