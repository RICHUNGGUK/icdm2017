Specifically, the objective is to determine the optimal due dates for agent A's jobs and the job sequence for both agents' jobs simultaneously to minimize the total cost associated with the due date assignment and weighted number of tardy jobs of agent A, while keeping the maximum of regular functions (associated with each B-job) or the number of tardy jobs of agent B below or at a fixed threshold. We prove that both problems are NP-hard in the strong sense and develop polynomial or pseudo-polynomial solutions for some important special cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
