Firstly, according to the discrete feature of Adalines, a method based on discrete stochastic technique is proposed, which derives some analytical formulas for the computation of Adalines' sensitivity. The method can theoretically solve some problems that are unsolvable by the existing methods based on continuous stochastic techniques, release some unpractical constraints, and make it available to theoretically analyze the approximation error of Adalines' sensitivity. Secondly, on the basis of the sensitivity of Adalines and the structural characteristics of Madalines, a new selection strategy depending on a type of dedication degree for computing Madalines' sensitivity is proposed, which is superior to current popular way of simply averaging in both precision and complexity. The proposed formulas and algorithm have the advantages of simplicity, low computational complexity, small approximation error, and high generality, as have been verified by a great amount of experimental simulations.", "paper_title": "Approximate computation of Madaline sensitivity based on discrete stochastic technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500002"}
