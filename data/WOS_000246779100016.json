Specifically, an ecosystem will be considered a system containing living and non-living entities whose interrelationships include those of predator-prey and competition. On interpreting that orbits are associated with ecosystems' direct and indirect paths, it is possible to present a much more conceptual design of ecological networks. Findings - An ecosystem's two most important relationships, those of predator-prey and competition, appear to be interconnected with the concepts of coverage, invariance and orbit, with multiple properties. Originality/value - There are many interesting analyses of ecological networks' indirect effects that develop the quantitative and qualitative theory of ecological networks. What is new in this study is that it is the first dealing with orbits in the field of ecosystems.", "paper_title": "A systemic theory of orbits in ecological networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000246779100016"}
