By using fourth-order Pade schemes for spatial derivatives, the present scheme is fourth-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time. The solution procedure consists of a number of tridiagonal matrix operations which make the computation cost effective. The method is unconditionally stable, and shows higher accuracy and better phase and amplitude error characteristics than the standard second-order ADI method [D.W. Peaceman, H.H.
