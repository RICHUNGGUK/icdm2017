A continuous-time nonlinear plant and a sampled-data three-layer fully connected feedforward neural-network-based controller are connected in a closed loop to perform the control task.. Stability conditions will be derived to guarantee the closed-loop system stability. Linear-matrix-inequality- and genetic-algorithm-based approaches will be employed to obtain the largest sampling period and the connection weights of the neural network subject to the considerations of the system stability and performance. An application example will be given to illustrate the design procedure and effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Design and stabilization of sampled-data neural-network-based control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240756700003"}
