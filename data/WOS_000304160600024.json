The design process, however requires a considerable amount of time and expertise. Strip layout design is a key step in progressive die design, therefore automating strip layout has a vital role in Computer Aided Progressive Die Design (CAPDD). In this paper, a mathematical model, based on set theory, is introduced to analyze the problem of strip layout. The model describes the mathematical nature of the strip layout problem and reveals the reason why researchers have always faced problems in optimizing strip layout automatically. Using the model presented, an algorithm is developed to optimize strip layout using the minimum number of stations and the torque equilibrium criteria. A prototype software is also developed to automate strip layout design based on the presented algorithm. The suitability of the model is then demonstrated through industrial examples.", "paper_title": "Automatic strip layout design in progressive dies", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600024"}
