Although the validity and usefulness of cognitive maps has been proven in many fields, and a considerable number of cognitive maps have been built during the last decade, cognitive map construction and use was just one-off event. In addition, the high degree of cognitive complexities in large cognitive maps makes it difficult for others to understand and exploit the pre-defined cognitive map in another similar domain problem. In this paper, an ontological semantic inference method, which combines the cognitive map and semantic influence, is proposed. This approach reuses a pre-defined cognitive map and provides an ontological semantic inference mechanism in decision making environments by reducing the degree of cognitive complexities in a large cognitive map.
