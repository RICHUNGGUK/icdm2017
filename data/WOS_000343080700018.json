In the interface \"Virtual Pottery,\" we use the metaphor of pottery creation in order to adopt the natural hand motions to 3D spatial sculpting. Users can create their own pottery pieces by changing the position of their hands in real time, and also generate 3D sound sculptures based on pre-existing rules of music composition. The interface of Virtual Pottery can be categorized by shape design and camera sensing type. This paper describes how we developed the two versions of Virtual Pottery and implemented the technical aspects of the interfaces. Additionally, we investigate the ways of translating hand motions into musical sound. The accuracy of the detection of hand motions is crucial for translating natural hand motions into virtual reality. According to the results of preliminary evaluations, the accuracy of both motion-capture tracking system and portable depth sensing camera is as high as the actual data. We carried out user studies, which took into account information about the two exhibitions along with the various ages of users. Overall, Virtual Pottery serves as a bridge between the virtual environment and traditional art practices, with the consequence that it can lead to the cultivation of the deep potential of virtual musical instruments and future art education programs.", "paper_title": "Virtual pottery: a virtual 3D audiovisual interface using natural hand motions", "paper_id": "WOS:000343080700018"}
