Most technological applications establish a user-friendly environment based on a graphical user interface. This work proposes experimental temperature-sensing modules based on the graphical user interface system. This system elucidates for students the principles, function and application of temperature sensor, and also learn how to use the graphical monitoring and control system. Students can design a graphical monitor program in advance to monitor and control the temperature sensor modules. Students learn, verify and acquire lectured concepts by performing sensor experiments in the laboratory. The most important part of the system is the implementation of the experimental module in laboratory sessions using the graphical user interface system. The purpose of this work is to emphasize that the graphical user interface can valuably support teaching and learning. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
