A typical 4DCBCT represents averaged patient images over one breathing cycle and the fourth dimension is actually breathing phase instead of time. In many clinical applications, it is desirable to obtain true 4DCBCT with the fourth dimension being time, i.e., each constituent CBCT image corresponds to an instantaneous projection. Theoretically it is impossible to reconstruct a CBCT image from a single projection. However, if all the constituent CBCT images of a 4DCBCT scan share a lot of redundant information, it might be possible to make a good reconstruction of these images by exploring their sparsity and coherence/redundancy. Though these CBCT images are not completely time resolved, they can exploit both local and global temporal coherence of the patient anatomy automatically and contain much more temporal variation information of the patient geometry than the conventional 4DCBCT. We propose in this work a computational model and algorithms for the reconstruction of this type of semi-time-resolved CBCT, called cine-CBCT, based on low rank approximation that can utilize the underlying temporal coherence both locally and globally, such as slow variation, periodicity or repetition, in those cine-CBCT images.", "paper_title": "Cine Cone Beam CT Reconstruction Using Low-Rank Matrix Factorization: Algorithm and a Proof-of-Principle Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000340237800001"}
