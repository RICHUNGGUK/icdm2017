Based on Harris KD et al. and Magee JC's electrophysiology experiments, a biology plausible spiking neuron model for theta phase precession was proposed. The model is both simple enough for constructing large scale network and realistic enough to match the biology context. The numerical results of our model were shown in this paper. The model can capture the main attributes of experimental result. The results of a simple neuron network were also showed in the paper, and were compared with single neuron result. The influence of network connections on theta phase precession was discussed. The relationship of phase shift with place shift in experiment was well repeated in our model. Such a model can mimic the biological phenomenon of theta phase precession, and preserve the main physiology factors underline theta phase precession.", "paper_title": "A spiking neuron model of theta phase precession", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600032"}
