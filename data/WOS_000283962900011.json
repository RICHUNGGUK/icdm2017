However, the traditional mesh simplification methods for graphical models can not satisfy the requirements of CAD mesh simplification. In this paper, we develop a feature suppression based CAD mesh model simplification framework. First, the CAD mesh model is segmented by an improved watershed segmentation algorithm, constructing the region-level representation required by feature recognition. Second, the form features needing to be suppressed are extracted using a feature recognition method with user defined feature facility based on the region-level representation, establishing the feature-level representation. Third, every recognized feature is suppressed using the most suitable one of the three methods, i.e. planar Delaunay triangulation, Poisson equation based method, and the method for blend features, thus simplifying the CAD mesh model. Our method provides an effective way to make CAD mesh model simplification meet the requirements of engineering applications. Several experimental results are presented to show the superiority and effectivity of our approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
