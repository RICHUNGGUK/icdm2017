With the development of augmented reality (AR) technology came an opportunity for collaborative and interactive scenario modelling of construction equipment operation. This paper presents a system for identifying the optimum scenario for equipment operation by intuitively operating the equipment in an AR environment. Augmented reality was coupled with transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) socket programming to form an interactive interface for multiple users. In this system, users can develop a construction scenario involving equipment operation and site conditions such as project progress and share the idea with other users in distant locations. The interactive modeler can test various situations to find the particular scenario that works the best under the surrounding spatial constraints. A case study involving construction of a real cable-stayed bridge shows that the system has strong potential for significant improvement in construction planning processes.
