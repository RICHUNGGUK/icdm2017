New capacity outer bounds are established for these channels. These outer bounds are all derived based on a novel unified framework. Using the derived outer bounds, some new capacity results are proved for the CIC and the CRC; a mixed interference regime is identified for the two-user CIC, where decoding interference at one receiver and treating interference as noise at the other one is sum-rate optimal. In addition, a noisy interference regime is derived for the one-sided CIC. Our new capacity theorems for the CIC contain the previously obtained results regarding the Gaussian channel as special cases. For the CRC, a full characterization of the capacity region for a class of more-capable channels is derived. Moreover, it is shown that the derived outer bounds are useful to study channels with one-sided receiver side information wherein one of the receivers has access to the nonintended message; capacity bounds are also discussed in details for such scenarios. Our results lead to new insights regarding the nature of information flow in the basic interference networks.", "paper_title": "On the Capacity Region of the Broadcast, the Interference, and the Cognitive Radio Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700026"}
