This algorithm is simple and automatable but has some limitations which reduce its range of application, e. g., (i) preference orderings should not include incomparabilities between alternative and/or omissions of some of them, and (ii) the fused ordering may sometimes not reflect the majority of the multi-agent preference orderings. The aim of this article is to present an enhanced version of the Yager's algorithm, which overcomes the above limitations. Some practical examples support the description of the new algorithm.
