After identifying the malicious nodes, mobile hosts can isolate these nodes. The proposed algorithm is distributed and does not need any communications between hosts. It only switches on the promiscuous listening mode in hosts. Through detailed simulations, the performance of data transmission is improved by the proposed algorithm. Even only when parts of hosts employ the algorithm intermittently, the improvement is obvious. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
