These T-preorders are called one-dimensional and are of great importance, because every T-preorder can be generated by combining one-dimensional T-preorders. In this article, the relation between fuzzy subsets generating the same T-preorder is given, and one-dimensional T-preorders are characterized in two different ways: They generate linear crisp orderings on X and they satisfy a Sincov-like functional equation. This last characterization is used to approximate a given T-preorder by a one-dimensional one by relating the issue to Saaty matrices used in the Analytical Hierarchical Process. Finally, strong complete T-preorders, important in decision-making problems, are also characterized.", "paper_title": "Generation and Characterization of Fuzzy T-preorders", "paper_id": "WOS:000354453300007"}
