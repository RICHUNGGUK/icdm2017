In this work, a method for evaluating the Green's function of a body using the finite element method is presented. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can be used to model realistic geometries, material properties and sources that cannot be treated analytically. The numerical results presented in this paper are compared with known analytical solutions of the Green's function for an infinite isotropic plate and also with experimental measurements of AE waves generated by known artificial AE sources (ball impact and pencil lead break).
