Assuring the trustworthiness of these networks can be achieved by selecting the most trusted paths, while prolonging the lifetime can be achieved by (1) reducing the number of relay nodes (MPR) propagating the topology control (TC) messages and (2) considering the residual energy levels of these relay nodes in the selection process. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm and a relay node selection algorithm based on the residual energy level and connectivity index of the nodes. This hybrid model is referred to as H-OLSR. The OLSR messages are adapted to handle the cluster heads election and the MPR nodes selection algorithms. These algorithms are designed to cope with selfish nodes that are getting benefits from others without cooperating with them. Hence, we propose an incentive compatible mechanism that motivates nodes to behave truthfully during the selection and election processes. Incentive retributions increase the reputation of the nodes. Since network services are granted according to nodes' accumulated reputation, the nodes should cooperate. Finally, based on nodes' reputation, the most trusted forwarding paths are determined. This reputation-based hybrid model is referred to as RH-OLSR. Simulation results show that the novel H-OLSR model based on energy and connectivity can efficiently prolong the network lifetime. while the RH-OLSR model improves the trustworthiness of the network through the selection of the most trusted paths based on nodes' reputations. These are the two different processes used to define the reputation-based clustering OLSR (RBC-OLSR) routing protocol. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
