After the wavelet transforming and obtaining slice plane, FWVR finish the volume rendering image with a wavelet-based X-ray rending method in the frequency domain. FWVR comprises and unifies the advantages of recently introduced Fourier domain volume rendering techniques and wavelet based volume rendering. For the algorithm is based on the CT imaging and wavelet transformation, the time complexity of this method is O(N-2 log N) which is reduced apparently. Experiment of medicine volume data shows that this method is efficient. Finally, the potential application of FWVR is introduced in network rendering for saving transmission time.", "paper_title": "Frequency domain volume rendering based on wavelet transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100096"}
