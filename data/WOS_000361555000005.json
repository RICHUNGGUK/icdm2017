The best algorithm is not known in advance and no single model format is superior for all datasets. Evaluating a number of candidate algorithms on large datasets to determine the most accurate model is however a computational burden. An alternative and more time efficient way is to select the optimal algorithm based on the nature of the dataset. In this meta-learning study, it is explored to what degree dataset characteristics can help identify which regression/estimation algorithm will best fit a given dataset. We chose to focus on comprehensible `white-box' techniques in particular (i.e. linear, spline, tree, linear tree or spline tree) as those are of particular interest in many real-life estimation settings. A large scale experiment with more than thousand so called datasetoids representing various real-life dependencies is conducted to discover possible relations. It is found that algorithm based characteristics such as sampling landmarks are major drivers for successfully selecting the most accurate algorithm. Further, it is found that data based characteristics such as the length, dimensionality and composition of the independent variables, or the asymmetry and dispersion of the dependent variable appear to contribute little once landmarks are included in the meta-model.", "paper_title": "Learning algorithm selection for comprehensible regression analysis using datasetoids", "paper_id": "WOS:000361555000005"}
