By using an inverted L-shaped feeding mechanism and a meandered shorting strip, a dual-band operation with wideband characteristic can be achieved. Here, the lower operating band is able to cover the LTE 700 and GSM 850/900 operations, while the higher operating band allows DCS 1800, PCS 1900, UMTS, and LTE 2300 operations. Furthermore, in order to increase the bandwidth of the higher operating band so that LTE 2500 operation can also be covered, an additional parasitic stub is attached to the feed line to excite a resonant frequency at around 2.72 GHz. Parametric studies via simulation are carried out, and prototype of the proposed antenna is also experimentally investigated to validate the simulated results. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
