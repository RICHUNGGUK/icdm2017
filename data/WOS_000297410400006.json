First we give several bijections between such generalized Stirling permutations and various families of increasing trees extending the known correspondences of [20, 21]. Then we consider several permutation statistics of interest for generalized Stirling permutations as the number of left-to-right minima, the number of left-to-right maxima, the number of blocks of specified sizes, the distance between occurrences of elements, and the number of inversions. For all these quantities we give a distributional study, where the established connections to increasing trees turn out to be very useful. To obtain the exact and limiting distribution results we use several techniques ranging from generating functions, connections to urn models, martingales and Stein's method.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Statistics for Generalized Stirling Permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000297410400006"}
