We first address a simpler problem for the case of a single flow. A TDM-based power-control strategy is adopted to achieve maximum end-to-end throughput by choosing an appropriate multihop route and spectrum combination for each single flow. Then, the simpler solution is extended to the multiflow case in which interflow interference and cumulative interference temperature must be considered. Considering the overhead of switching route and spectrum, the optimal waiting time before making a switch is derived. Our in-depth simulation study has shown that the proposed algorithms utilize spectrum more efficiently than other existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Joint Spectrum Allocation and Power Control for Multihop Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290668400010"}
