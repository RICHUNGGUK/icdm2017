An axisymmetric framework is established to solve the problem with solid-fluid coexistence and interaction. An Eulerian formulated expression considering temperature rises caused by both shock waves and plastic work is proposed in the incremental form. The viscosity effect of the solid material is accounted for in the stress update algorithm. The governing equations are solved by the improved CE/SE scheme. The hybrid particle level set method is adopted for tracking and capturing material interfaces. The ghost-fluid type boundary technique is used to give the natural boundary conditions. A more considerate solid-gas interaction technique which accords with the physical nature better is proposed. The code developed by us is validated by two benchmark tests. The numerical simulation of shaped charge jet is carried out and compared to the corresponding experimental results. The velocity and the surface temperature of the jet are in good agreement with the experimental data. It is proved that our computational method is feasible and reliable for predicting the shaped charge jet problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
