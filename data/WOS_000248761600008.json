The circuit is based on the gyrator-C approach with both transconductance stages realized by MOS transistors in common-source configuration. The circuit has minimal number of transistors, is suitable for low voltage operation, offers a wide inductive band, high quality factor and low power dissipation. Simulation results are provided for a 0.13 mu m CMOS process with 1.2 V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "Compact low voltage high-Q CMOS active inductor suitable for RF applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000248761600008"}
