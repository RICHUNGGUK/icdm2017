In this paper, we address the problem of UEP for single-layered video over packet erasure channels. By exploiting the different priorities of video packets inside a group of pictures (GOP) and making full use of the good characteristics of standardized Raptor codes at large block length, we propose an optimized UEP framework for single-layered video and develop an efficient algorithm to solve it. Simulation results show that significant gains can be obtained by our method in case of packet losses.", "paper_title": "Raptor Codes Based Unequal Protection for Compressed Video According to Packet Priority", "paper_id": "WOS:000327393900039"}
