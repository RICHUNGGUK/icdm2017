However, the contribution of the Web is largely confined to building a general virtual corpus or low quality specialised corpora. In this paper, we introduce a new technique called SPARTAN for constructing specialised corpora from the Web by systematically analysing website contents. Our evaluations show that the corpora constructed using our technique are independent of the search engines employed. In particular, SPARTAN-derived corpora outperform all corpora based on existing techniques for the task of term recognition.", "paper_title": "Constructing specialised corpora through analysing domain representativeness of websites", "paper_id": "WOS:000289850000006"}
