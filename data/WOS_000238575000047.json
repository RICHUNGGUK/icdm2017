Many criteria have been proposed and used in such a process. Each criterion measures some facets of classifiers. However, none is good enough for all cases. In this communication, we justify the use of discrimination measures for evaluating classifiers. The justification is mainly based on a hierarchical model for discrimination measures, which was introduced and used in the induction of decision trees.", "paper_title": "Discrimination-based criteria for the evaluation of classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000047"}
