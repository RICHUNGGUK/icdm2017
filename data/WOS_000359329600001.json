It is known that asymptotic equivalence between a non-stationary subdivision scheme and a convergent stationary scheme guarantees the convergence of the non-stationary scheme. We show that for non-stationary schemes reproducing constants, the condition of asymptotic equivalence can be relaxed to asymptotic similarity. This result applies to a wide class of non-stationary schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
