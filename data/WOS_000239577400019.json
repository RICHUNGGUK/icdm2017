This technique exploits the important information of the approximation coefficients of the transform coefficient vector, from which we obtain two crucial inequalities that can be used to reject those vectors for which it is impossible to be k nearest neighbors. The computational complexity for searching for k nearest neighbors can be largely reduced. Experimental results on texture classification verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Fast, k nearest neighbors search algorithm based on wavelet transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000239577400019"}
