This problem was shown to be undecidable by Ruohonen ( 1985) in general. Recently Blondel and Canterini ( Theory Comput. Syst. 36 ( 2003) 231 - 245) showed that this problem is undecidable for domain alphabets of size 105. Here we give a proof that the infinite Post Correspondence Problem is undecidable for instances where the morphisms have domains of 9 letters. The proof uses a recent result of Matiyasevich and Senizergues and a modification of a result of Claus.", "paper_title": "Undecidability of infinite post correspondence problem for instances of size 9", "paper_id": "WOS:000242275400003"}
