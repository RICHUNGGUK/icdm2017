According to the real-time laser scanning data, a hybrid path planner is proposed in this paper to integrate quick obstacle avoidance and global optimization effectively. For local cluttered and dynamic scenes, mobile robot can reliably avoid the unknown obstacles based on local steering angle and velocity control law. For large-scale indoor scene with prior structured information, grid point sequence can be used to represent the global workspace, and therefore a global path planner based on improved distance propagating method can generate a series of sub-goal-points to the target, which guides mobile robot's local path planning in a more optimal way. Experiment results in the cluttered indoor environments show the method's effectiveness and practicability.", "paper_title": "MOBILE ROBOT HYBRID PATH PLANNING IN AN OBSTACLE-CLUTTERED ENVIRONMENT BASED ON STEERING CONTROL AND IMPROVED DISTANCE PROPAGATING", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161100016"}
