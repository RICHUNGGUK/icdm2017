It is characterized by the assembly delay and by the segment aggregation needed to form an optical packet. These counter-balancing aspects depend on several environment variables, such as the TCP parameters, the access link speed, the optical packet size whose effects are studied in this paper. Performance evaluations are obtained by extensive simulations in terms of send rate of TCP flows, fairness, efficiency, and assembly delay. Some guidelines in the design of optical packets that take into account the results presented are given.", "paper_title": "TCP performance in optical packet-switched networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000236982500001"}
