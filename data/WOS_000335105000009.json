This paper presents a probabilistic fracture mechanics (PFM) approach to evaluate the reliability of cracked structures considering the uncertainty in crack geometry. The shape sensitivity analysis of the stress intensity factor (SIF) is performed efficiently using the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM). No remeshing is required as the size and orientation of a crack vary. Reliability is estimated using various probabilistic techniques. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and simplicity of the present method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
