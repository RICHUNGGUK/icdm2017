In addition to characteristics of academic problems, such as the need to reason about actions, real-life problems require detailed knowledge elicitation, engineering, and management. A systematic design process in which Knowledge and Requirements Engineering tools play a fundamental role is necessary in such applications. One of the main challenges in such design process, and consequently in the study of Knowledge Engineering in AI planning, has been the analysis of requirements and their subsequent transformation into an input-ready model for planners. itSIMPLE is a research project dedicated to the study of a project process to support the design phases of real-life planning models. In this paper, we give an overview of itSIMPLE focusing on the main translation processes among a minimal set of representations: from requirements represented in Unified Modeling Language (UML) to Petri Nets and from UML models to planning domain definition language for problem solving.", "paper_title": "itSIMPLE: towards an integrated design system for real planning applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000318629400007"}
