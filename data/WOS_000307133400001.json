Most publications on the stochastic vehicle routing problem focus on recourse policies which assume that the vehicles operate independently of each other. An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is developed for this problem. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that allowing split deliveries is sometimes beneficial, namely when expected demands lie between 51% and 70% of the vehicle capacity.", "paper_title": "The Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Demands and Split Deliveries", "paper_id": "WOS:000307133400001"}
