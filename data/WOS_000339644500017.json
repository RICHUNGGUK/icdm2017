For any integer D and any integer k, a graph of diameter D and of Wiener dimension k is constructed. An infinite family of non-vertex-transitive graphs with Wiener dimension 1 is presented and it is proved that a graph of dimension 1 is 2-connected. It is shown that the (5, 0)-nanotubical fullerene graph on 10k (k >= 3) vertices has Wiener dimension k. As a consequence the Wiener index of these fullerenes is obtained.", "paper_title": "Wiener Dimension: Fundamental Properties and (5,0)-Nanotubical Fullerenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000339644500017"}
