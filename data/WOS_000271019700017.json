In this paper, we focus on the two-user scenario where each block-tridiagonal matrix under consideration is a tridiagonal matrix. We derive closed-form expressions for the minimal eigenvalues of such a class of tridiagonal matrices in terms of the largest real solution of a trigonometric equation in [0, pi]. We also obtain lower bounds and upper bounds on the minimal eigenvalues which improve on previously known results in the literature.", "paper_title": "On Minimal Eigenvalues of a Class of Tridiagonal Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019700017"}
