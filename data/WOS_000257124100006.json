The proposed scheme consists of generalized minimum variance (GMV) controllers and a compensating controller. GMV controllers are based on the known nominal linear multiple models, while the compensating controller is based upon a recurrent neural network. The adaptation law of network weight is derived from Lyapunov stability theory. A suitable switching control strategy is applied to choose the best controller by the performance indices at every sampling instant. Simulations are discussed in order to illustrate the merits of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Multiple models switching control based on recurrent neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257124100006"}
