We study stress response mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by identifying genes that, according to very stringent criteria, have persistent co-expression under a variety of stress conditions. This is enabled through a fast clique search method applied to the intersection of several co-expression graphs calculated over the data of Gasch et al. This method exploits the topological characteristics of these graphs. Results: We observe cliques in the intersection graphs that are much larger than expected under a null model of changing gene identities for different stress conditions but maintaining the co-expression topology within each one. Persistent cliques are analyzed to identify enriched function as well as enriched regulation by a small number of TFs. These TFs, therefore, characterize a universal and persistent reaction to stress response. We further demonstrate that the vertices (genes) of many cliques in the intersection graphs are co-localized in the yeast genome, to a degree far beyond the random expectation. Co-localization can hypothetically contribute to a quick co-ordinated response. We propose the use of persistent cliques in further study of properties of co-regulation.", "paper_title": "Similarities and differences of gene expression in yeast stress conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000243992400029"}
