This problem is defined on an unweighted graph in which each edge has a label. The aim is to determine a Hamiltonian cycle with the least number of labels. We also define two variants of this problem by assigning weights to the edges and by considering the tour length either as an objective or as a constraint. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the three problems is developed, and computational results are reported on randomly generated instances and on modified instances from TSPLIB. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
