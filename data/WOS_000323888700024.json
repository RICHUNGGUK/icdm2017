This improves the n(O(n)) running time of the best previously known algorithms for CVP [R. Kannan, Math. Oper. Res., 12 (1987), pp. 415-440] and SIVP [D. Micciancio, Proceedings of the 19th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2008, pp. 84-93] and gives a deterministic and asymptotically faster alternative to the 2(O(n))-time (and space) randomized algorithm for SVP of Ajtai, Kumar, and Sivakumar [Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2001, pp. 266-275]. The core of our algorithm is a new method to solve the closest vector problem with preprocessing (CVPP) that uses the Voronoi cell of the lattice (described as intersection of half-spaces) as the result of the preprocessing function. A direct consequence of our results is a derandomization of the best current polynomial time approximation algorithms for SVP and CVP, achieving a 2(O(n log log n/log n)) approximation factor.", "paper_title": "A DETERMINISTIC SINGLE EXPONENTIAL TIME ALGORITHM FOR MOST LATTICE PROBLEMS BASED ON VORONOI CELL COMPUTATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000323888700024"}
