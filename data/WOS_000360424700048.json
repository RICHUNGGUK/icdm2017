However, as these data are often imperfect, new representation models are required in order to effectively handle imperfection in this context. This work presents a new approach, Frequent Correlated Trends, for representing uncertain and imprecise multivariate data series. Such a model can be applied to any domain where behaviors recur in similar-but not identical-shape. In particular, we have already used them to the task of identifying the performers of violin recordings with good results. The present paper describes the abstract model representation and a general learning algorithm, and discusses several potential applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
