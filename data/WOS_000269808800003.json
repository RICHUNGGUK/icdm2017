Integrated static and dynamic experiments were carried out on three precast PRC beam specimens. The static loading induced different levels of damage to the beams. At each damage level, impulsive loading was applied to the beams and the free vibration response was measured. The dynamic response data were processed using different methods including the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) curve fitting and the Hilbert transform techniques. A strong correlation is observed between the level of concrete damage (cracks) and the amount of nonlinear energy dissipation that can be modeled by means of quadratic damping. The nonlinear damping can be extracted from the free vibration response for each vibration mode. The proposed method is suited for quality control when manufacturing precast PRC members, and can be further extended for in situ detection of damage in concrete structures under ambient vibration.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Damping Identification in Precast Prestressed Reinforced Concrete Beams", "paper_id": "WOS:000269808800003"}
