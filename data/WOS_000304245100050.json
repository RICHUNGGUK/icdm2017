There are many different types of codes available for two-transmitter antennas, such as cyclotomic space-time block codes, the golden space-time block code, and rotation-based space-time block codes. In this paper, a more general space-time block code design scheme, which is called quadratic space-time block coding, is proposed for the two-transmitter antennas using quadratic field extension. The optimal design of the quadratic space-time block codes in terms of a diversity product criterion is also presented. It is shown that the optimal quadratic space-time block codes designed in this paper do not belong to the existing space-time block code family such as the cyclotomic, golden, and rotation-based space-time block codes. The simulation results demonstrate that the average codeword error rate of the optimal quadratic space-time block code attains about 0.5 dB signal to noise ratio gain over those of the optimal cyclotomic and golden space-time block codes.", "paper_title": "Space-Time Block Code Designs Based on Quadratic Field Extension for Two-Transmitter Antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000304245100050"}
