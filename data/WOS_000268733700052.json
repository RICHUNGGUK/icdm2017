Time delays of two layers are taken into account separately rather than as a whole with the idea of delay fractioning. Then we generalize the result to time-varying interval delay condition. Exploiting the known constant part of delay sufficiently to estimate the upper bounds, we can derive an improved stability for BAM NNs with time-varying interval delay. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the less conservatism and effectiveness of the proposed linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
