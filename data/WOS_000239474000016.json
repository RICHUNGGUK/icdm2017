This paper discusses the SDO Distribution Architecture (SDODA) that enables the use of the SDO concept in development of distributed SAAs. Specifically the architecture overcomes the apparent incompatibility between the two programming models considered and the SDO concept that prevented the transfer of SDOs between SAA hosts. To demonstrate the applicability of both the architecture and the SDO concept itself, two versions of a distributed (Java) SAA were developed using orthogonal distributed programming models, the Web services and the Java RMI models. This paper deals with the implementation of the SDODA and the SDO concept in a Web services environment. The successful use of the architecture demonstrated that the SDO concept can be used to simplify the implementation of application level mandatory access control in distributed SAAs.", "paper_title": "The role of the Self-Defending Object concept in developing distributed Security-Aware Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474000016"}
