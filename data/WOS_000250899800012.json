It is evident that computers that possess intelligence at a human level will have very important repercussions in our daily life. Inside the fields of AI it is necessary to highlight the decision-making, where AI supposes a great help. In this paper, we present a methodology in a decision-making problem where only linguistic information was available. The main purpose of this paper is to present a technique to obtain the weights and the utilities to resolve the multicriteria decision-making when the knowledge about it is linguistic. Thus we can have systems where the input of data in the computer can be of a determined type and the output can be of the same or a different type, making more intelligent computers. The aim of this paper is to present an evaluation model based on a multicriteria decision analysis that offers the \"assembly workshop manager\" the possibility of expressing its knowledge in a linguistic framework. In this paper the linguistic decision analysis is interpreted in a multicriteria decision-making context. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
