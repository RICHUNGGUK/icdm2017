In this paper we present models for categorizing a video into one of a number of predefined interactions or for detecting these interactions in a long video sequence. The models represent the interaction by a set of key temporal moments and the spatial structures they entail. For instance: two people approaching each other, then extending their hands before engaging in a \"handshaking\" interaction. Learning the model parameters requires only weak supervision in the form of an overall label for the interaction. Experimental results on the UT-Interaction and VIRAT datasets verify the efficacy of these structured models for human interactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
