In this paper, we propose a new semi-fragile digital watermarking technique based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real symmetric matrix generated by the pair Of four pixels. A signature bit for detecting malicious tampering of an image is generated using the dominant eigenvector. The dominant eigenvalue call reduce the sensitivity of quantization based watermarking. The experimental results show that this algorithm call resist high quality (70 or more) JPEG compression, and improve the detection performance of various malicious alterations.", "paper_title": "Semi-fragile image authentication using real symmetric matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000237907900016"}
