Different states of normal and pathological fingers are studied. We evaluated the impact of losing musculo-tendon unit strength capacities in terms of maximal output fingertip force and tendon tensions distribution. A biomechanical model for a static force analysis is developed through anatomical and kinematic studies. An optimisation approach is then used to determine tendon tension distribution when performing an isometric task. Furthermore, pathological fingers with common cases of injured flexors and extensors are analysed. The method of simulation for forefinger abnormities is described. Furthermore, the simulation results are interpreted.", "paper_title": "Analysis of tendinous actuation in balancing the maximal fingertip force for normal and abnormal forefinger system", "paper_id": "WOS:000305021200003"}
