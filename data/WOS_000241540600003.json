We show that, for any fixed kappa > 0, the combinatorial complexity of the union of n kappa-round, not necessarily convex, objects in R-3 (resp., in R-4) of constant description complexity is O(n(2+epsilon)) ( resp., O(n(3+epsilon))) for any epsilon > 0, where the constant of proportionality depends on e, kappa, and the algebraic complexity of the objects. The bound is almost tight in the worst case.", "paper_title": "On the union of kappa-round objects in three and four dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241540600003"}
