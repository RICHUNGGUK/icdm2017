The most important problem. in tracking systems is object motion tracking. In this paper, we present a new method that combines footstep prediction and particle filter to manage some problems inherent in manipulating a large View image space. We compare various methods and evaluate their capabilities.", "paper_title": "A PARTICLE FILTER APPROACH FOR MULTI-CAMERA TRACKING SYSTEMS IN A LARGE VIEW SPACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000278688700035"}
