These results suggest that LSF components processed rapidly via magnocellular pathways within the visual system might be very efficiently conveyed to the amygdala for the rapid recognition of fearful expressions, perhaps via a subcortical pathway that activates the pulvinar and superior colliculus, but which bypasses any finer visual analysis of HSF cues in the striate and temporal extrastriate cortex. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the statistical properties of LSF compared with HSF and intact faces. The statistical analysis shows that the LSF components in faces, which are typically extracted rapidly by the visual system, provide a better source of information than HSF components for the correct categorisation of fearful expressions in faces. These results support the idea that visual pathways from the magnocellular visual neurons might be optimal, at a computational level, for the rapid classification of fearful emotional expressions in human faces.", "paper_title": "The importance of low spatial frequency information for recognising fearful facial expressions", "paper_id": "WOS:000264530000005"}
