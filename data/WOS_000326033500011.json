In particular, we show that from O(s log(N)) nonadaptive linear measurements, an image can be reconstructed to within the best s-term approximation of its gradient up to a logarithmic factor, and this factor can be removed by taking slightly more measurements. Along the way, we prove a strengthened Sobolev inequality for functions lying in the null space of a suitably incoherent matrix.", "paper_title": "Stable Image Reconstruction Using Total Variation Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000326033500011"}
