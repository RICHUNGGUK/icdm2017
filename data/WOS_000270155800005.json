Two kinds of simultaneous intervals are provided based on the fiducial generalized pivotal quantities of the interest parameters. We prove that they both have asymptotically correct coverage. Simulation results and an example are also reported. It is concluded from calculational evidence that the second kind of simultaneous confidence intervals, which we provide, performs better than existing methods.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous confidence intervals for one-way layout based on generalized pivotal quantities", "paper_id": "WOS:000270155800005"}
