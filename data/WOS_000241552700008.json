In the usual implementation, a series of low-resolution images shifted by typically subpixel distances are acquired. The pixels of these low-resolution images are then interleaved and modeled as a blurred image of higher resolution and the same field-of-view. A high-resolution image is then obtained using a standard deconvolution algorithm. Although this approach has been applied in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), some controversy has surfaced regarding the validity and circumstances under which super-resolution may be applicable. We investigate the factors that limit the applicability of super-resolution MRI.", "paper_title": "Mathematical analysis of \"phase ramping\" for super-resolution magnetic resonance imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700008"}
