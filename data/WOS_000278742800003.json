The FORM is computationally efficient, but may not be accurate for nonlinear limit-state functions. An alternative system reliability analysis method is proposed based on saddlepoint approximation. Unlike the FORM that linearizes limit-state functions in a transformed random space, the proposed method linearizes the limited-state functions without any transformation. After the linearization, the joint probability density of limit-state functions is estimated by the multivariate saddlepoint approximation. Without the nonnormal-to-normal transformation, the present method is more accurate than the FORM when the transformation increases the nonlinearity of limit-state functions. As demonstrated in the two examples, the new method is also as efficient as the FORM.", "paper_title": "System reliability analysis with saddlepoint approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000278742800003"}
