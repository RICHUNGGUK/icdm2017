Many studies associated the gamma oscillations with oscillators around the 40 Hz frequency, yet recent studies have shown that gamma frequencies may be part of a broadband phenomenon ranging from 30 Hz up to 250 Hz. In this study we have examined the possibility that a simple model, based on available neurophysiological parameters, involving an increase in asynchronous (Poisson distributed) neural firing may be sufficient to generate the observed gamma power increases. Our simulation shows a roughly linear increase in gamma power as a function of the aggregated firing rate of the neural population, while the influence of the synchronization level within the neurons on the gamma power is limited. Our model supports the viewpoint that the broadband gamma response is mainly driven by the summed, asynchronous, activity of the neural population. We show that the time frequency spectrogram of the stimulus response can be reconstructed by combining two different phenomena the broadband gamma power increase due to local processing and the more spatially distributed event related desynchronization (ERD). Our model thus raises the possibility that the broadband gamma response is closely linked to the aggregate population firing rate of the recorded neurons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
