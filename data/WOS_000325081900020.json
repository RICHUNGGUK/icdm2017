One crucial difficulty of soft sensors is that predictive accuracy drops due to changes in state of chemical plants. The predictive accuracy of traditional soft sensor models decreases when sudden process changes occur. However, an online support vector regression (OSVR) model with the time variable can adapt to rapid changes among process variables. One crucial problem is finding appropriate hyperparameters and window size, which means the numbers of data for the model construction, and thus, we discussed three methods to select hyperparameters based on predictive accuracy and computation time. The window size of the proposed method was discussed through simulation data and real industrial data analyses and the proposed method achieved high predictive accuracy when time-varying changes in process characteristics occurred.
