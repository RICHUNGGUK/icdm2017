To reduce noise we re-projected tomographic images and searched for edges in the projection count profiles or their spatial derivatives. Edge location versus projection angle was fitted with cosine basis functions after rejecting outliers and including information about edges of previous sections. We processed 10 s duration FDG PET of the thorax, HMPAO brain, DAT brain and lung perfusion SPECT. Stable edges for all four types of scan were achieved but with different profiles. Edges were validated against edges of coregistered CT or MRI. The best root mean square (rms) accuracy was 8.2 mm (PET) and 5.2 mm (brain SPECT). Inter-scan variability (standard deviation) in the estimated-to-control edge distance for 17 PET scans was 0.4 mm, for 25 ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) reconstructed brain SPECT 1.0 mm and for 18 filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstructed brain SPECT 1.4 mm.
