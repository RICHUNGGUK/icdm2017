In this article we introduce an experimental framework which tries to mitigate the effects of both sources of unpredictability. At compile time, an extensive profiling helps us to detect system scenarios and bounds application dynamism. At the organization level, we incorporate a heterogeneous memory architecture composed by several configurable memories. A calibration process and a runtime control system adapt the platform to the current application needs. Our approach manages to reduce significantly the energy overhead associated to both variability and application dynamism (up to 60%, according to our simulations) without compromising the timing constraints existing in our target domain of dynamic periodic multimedia applications.", "paper_title": "Combining system scenarios and configurable memories to tolerate unpredictability", "paper_id": "WOS:000258205900013"}
