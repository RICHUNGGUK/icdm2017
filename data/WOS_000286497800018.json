This paper presents an approach for extracting the moving targets' UWB scattering center parameters based on the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) model and the state space approach. Firstly, the UWB GTD scattering model is transformed into state-space equations in order to estimate the range and range rate through the singular value decomposition. Secondly, the type parameter in the whole bandwidth is indicated dimension-reducedly by orthonormalized basis and estimated by traversal algorithm and minimum-norm algorithm. Finally, the intensity of scattering center is worked out based on the least square method. The paper provides the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for parameter estimation. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by computer simulation. The approach can estimate range, range rate, reflection intensity and type parameter simultaneously in order to improve the track of scattering centers and the target identification.", "paper_title": "A GTD model and state space approach based method for extracting the UWB scattering center of moving target", "paper_id": "WOS:000286497800018"}
