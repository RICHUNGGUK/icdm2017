The inversion is performed in order to realize the tracking of certain prescribed output trajectories in open-loop control. Simulation results illustrate the applicability of the design approach for the example of finite-time transitions between set-points for a tubular bioreactor.", "paper_title": "Model inversion of boundary controlled parabolic partial differential equations using summability methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000254747200004"}
