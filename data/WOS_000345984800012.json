However, such applications may endanger the users' privacy by revealing their locations and trajectories information. Most of existing solutions, which hide a user's location information with a coarse region, are under k-anonymity model. Yet, they may not be applicable in some participatory sensing applications that require precise location information. The goals are seemingly contradictory: to protect a user's location privacy while simultaneously providing precise location information for a high quality of service. In this paper, we propose a method to meet both goals. Through selecting a certain number of a user's partners, it can protect the user's location privacy while providing precise location information. The user's trajectory privacy can be protected by constructing several trajectories that are similar to the user's trajectory in an interval time T. Finally, we utilize a new metric, called slope ratio, to evaluate the partners' selection algorithm that we proposed. Then, we measure the privacy level that the location and trajectory privacy protection mechanism (LTPPM) can achieve. The analysis and simulation results show that LTPPM can protect the user's location and trajectory privacy effectively and also provide a high quality of service in participatory sensing.
