These applications generally consume large amount of network bandwidth and involve compute-intensive operations. Accelerating such operations with general purpose GPU has drawn a lot of attention from both academia and industry. However, GPU has not been applied to real-time stream processing due to its programming paradigm and unpredictable latency. In this paper, we study the problem of applying GPU to real-time processing and propose a holistic approach for building real-time stream processing system with GPU. Based on the proposed techniques, we build a GPU-accelerated SRTP reverse proxy that achieves more than 10Gbps overall throughput and guarantees low latency. Our work demonstrates that using GPU in high-speed real-time stream processing is both feasible and attractive. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
