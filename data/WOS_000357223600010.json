Demko and Hill [6] showed the existence of an allocation where every agent values his share at least V-n(alpha), which is a family of nonincreasing functions of alpha, defined as the maximum value assigned by an agent to a single good. A deterministic algorithm returning such an allocation in polynomial time was proposed in [15]. Interestingly, V-n(alpha) is tight for some values of alpha, i.e. it matches the highest possible utility of the least happy agent. However, this is not true for all values of alpha. We propose a family of functions W-n such that W-n(x) >= V-n (x) for all x, and W-n(x) > V-n(x) for values of x where V-n (x) is not tight. The functions W-n apply on a problem that generalizes the allocation of indivisible goods. It is to find a base in a matroid which is common to n agents. Our results are constructive, they are achieved by analyzing an extension of the algorithm of Markakis and Psomas. We also present an upper bound on the utility of the least happy agent.
