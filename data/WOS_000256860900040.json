To deal with illumination outliers, an enhanced TV-based quotient image (ETVQI) model is first adopted. Then for preprocessed images by ETVQI, a bank of Gabor filters is built to extract features at specified scales and orientations. Lastly, KPCA is introduced to extract final high-order and nonlinear features of extracted Gabor features. According to experiments on the CAS-PEAL face database, our model could outperform Gabor-based KPCA, TVQI and Gabor-based TVQI when they face most outliers (illumination, expression, masking etc.).", "paper_title": "Kernel TV-based Quotient Image employing Gabor analysis and its application to face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000256860900040"}
