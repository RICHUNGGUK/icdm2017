Low-power and reliable SRAM cell design, reliable dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) algorithm design, and voltage island partitioning and floorplanning for reliable system-on-a-chip (SOC) design are demonstrated as case studies of this new design methodology.", "paper_title": "Case study of reliability-aware and low-power design", "paper_id": "WOS:000257196500008"}
