Such a system not only plays an important role in the development of hybrid control theory, but also finds many applications in practical control designs for obtaining better control performances. This paper investigates the stability of switched dissipative Hamiltonian systems under arbitrary switching paths. Under a realistic assumption, it is shown that the Hamiltonian functions of all the subsystems can be used as the multiple-Lyapunov functions for the switched dissipative Hamiltonian system. Based on this and using the dissipative Hamiltonian structural properties, this paper then proves that the P-norm of the state of switched dissipative Hamiltonian system converges to zero with the time increasing, and presents two sufficient conditions for the asymptotical stability under arbitrary switching paths. Utilizing these new results, this paper also obtains two useful corollaries for the asymptotical stability of switched nonlinear time-invariant systems. Finally, two examples are studied by using the new results proposed in this paper, and some numerical simulations are carried out to support our new results.", "paper_title": "Study on the stability of switched dissipative Hamiltonian systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242000000003"}
