Furthermore, it is necessary to resort to high performance computing to effectively solve the large size problems. However, the direct coupling yields a linear system with a matrix which is partly dense and partly sparse and thus not adapted to high performance computing. To avoid this difficulty, we present a new iterative method constructed from a non overlapping domain decomposition technique. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
