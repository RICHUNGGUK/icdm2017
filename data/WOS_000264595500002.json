It deliberates component detection and contour tracing algorithms and uses the magnitude and phase information of Fourier descriptors to establish correspondences between the target objects detected in the reference and the inspected images, so the parameters for aligning the two images can be estimated accordingly. To enhance the computational efficiency, the proposed component detection and contour tracing algorithms use the run length encoding (RLE) and Blobs tables to represent the pixel information in the regions of interest. The Fourier descriptors derived from the component boundaries are used to match the target objects. Finally, the transformation parameters for aligning the inspected image with the reference image are estimated based on a novel phase-shifted technique. Experimental results show that the proposed FDBIA algorithm sustains similar accuracy as achieved by the commercial software Easyfind against various rotation and translation conditions. Also, the computational time consumed by the FDBIA algorithm is significantly shorter than that by Easyfind. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
