Such services could be provided through a hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure, However, P2P networks are usually Internet-scale distributed systems comprised of nodes with an undetermined trust level, thus making hierarchical solutions unrealistic. In this paper, we propose Chord-PKI, a distributed PKI architecture which is build upon the Chord overlay network, in order to provide security services for P2P applications. Our solution distributes the functionality of a PKI across the peers by using threshold cryptography and proactive updating. We analyze the security of the proposed infrastructure and through simulations we evaluate its performance for various scenarios of untrusted node distributions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
