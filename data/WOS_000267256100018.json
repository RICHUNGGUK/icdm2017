This paper analyses the volatility dynamics of the US business cycle by comparing the performance of various multivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. In particular, we propose two bivariate GARCH models to examine the evidence of volatility asymmetry and time-varying correlations concurrently, and then apply the proposed models to five sectors of Industrial Production of the United States. Our findings provide strong evidence of asymmetric conditional volatility in all sectors, and some support of time-varying correlations in various sectoral pairs. This has important policy implications for government to consider the effective countercyclical measures during recessions. (c) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
