The method updates the dynamic topological data structure according to two separate procedures: (i) tracking of the interface position, and (ii) MR analysis on each individual phase. High efficiency is achieved by employing a storage-and-operation-splitting pyramid data structure, in which any two adjacent blocks partially overlap while the overlapping parts share the same data in memory. The non-overlapping data are distributed into fine-grained data packages and stored within a memory pool. The proposed narrow-band technique for the level-set-based interface method also increases the computational and memory efficiency greatly by restricting all interface-relevant data and operations to a neighborhood of the interface. A broad set of test simulations is carried out to demonstrate the potential and performance of the MR-SIM approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
