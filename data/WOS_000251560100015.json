Fuzzy inequalities enable us to attain the optimal points that are better solutions than those resulting from the resolution of the similar problems with Ordinary Inequality constraints (denoted by x(OI) in this paper). We have presented an algorithm to generate such optimal solutions. Also two examples are given to illustrate the algorithm presented and some real application of this work. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
