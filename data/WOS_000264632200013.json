The partial CSIT takes the form of the channel matrix corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with a variance that is assumed to decay as a power of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is shown that under a long-term power constraint and in the regime of asymptotically high SNR, a large diversity gain over the channel can be achieved by using rarely a high power at the transmitter that compensates for bad channel realizations. Examples relating the diversity gain of the systems with the channel Doppler bandwidth are discussed.", "paper_title": "Diversity Gains of Power Control With Noisy CSIT in MIMO Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632200013"}
