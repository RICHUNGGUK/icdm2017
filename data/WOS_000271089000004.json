With rapidly developing technology, computers are now essential parts in our daily life, and the number of the aged people using computers is also increasing continuously. But user interfaces and contents for the aged people have not been developed actively yet. In this paper, we present a 3D sensory gate-ball game system which can be played by the aged people easily. This game system is based on 3D graphics and uses a realistic gate-ball stick and balls as interfaces, so it can improve both physical and mental health of the aged people. Because our game is a sensory game, it is easy to play at home without an outdoor playground. Finally, we made a survey about an experiment after users played the game and show results of the survey.", "paper_title": "Development of a sensory gate-ball game system for the aged people", "paper_id": "WOS:000271089000004"}
