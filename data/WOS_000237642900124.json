The platform provides an integration environment and changes paradigms between IDEAS, Smarteam (PDM software) and Conceptual Innovation Design System (CIDS). The platform is illustrated for sugarcane harvester design analysis as an example, and provides a collaborative intelligent environment for the design of products, aiming at integrating people, process and data in the product development.", "paper_title": "A collaborative design environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900124"}
