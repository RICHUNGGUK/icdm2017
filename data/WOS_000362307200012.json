To address this problem, this paper proposes a new image encryption concept to transform an original image into a visually meaningful encrypted one. As an example of the implementation of this concept, we introduce an image encryption system. Simulation results and security analysis demonstrate excellent encryption performance of the proposed concept and system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
