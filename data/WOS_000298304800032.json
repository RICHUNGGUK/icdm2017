However, if RSs are operated in every cell, the interference between cells increases and the throughput improvement effect with RSs is prone to be restricted. In this paper, we propose a scheme reducing the interference from other cells by using packet transmission control. This packet transmitting control technique is realized by the compound scheduling technique with the Proportional fair (PF) scheduling and the Maximum Carrier-to-Interference power Ratio (Max CIR) scheduling. The proposed scheme can improve the throughput around the cell boundary by controlling the timing of transmission of each cell with appropriate power and user assignment. The simulation results show that the proposed method can also improve the fairness of user throughput and system throughput considering the users of whole", "paper_title": "Multi-User Scheduling Method Considering Fairness and Mitigation of Multi-Cell Interference for Multi-Hop Cellular System", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800032"}
