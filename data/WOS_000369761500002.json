RNA-seq technology enables us to monitor the expression on genome-wide scale at single base pair resolution and offers the possibility of accurately measuring expression at the level of isoform. However, challenges remain because of non-uniform read sampling and the presence of various biases in RNA-seq data. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical Bayesian method to estimate isoform expression. While most of the existing methods treat gene expression as a by-product, we incorporate it into our model and explicitly describe its relationship with corresponding isoform expression using a Multinomial distribution. In this way, gene and isoform expression are included in a unified framework and it helps us achieve a better performance over other state-of-the-art algorithms for isoform expression estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using both simulated data with known ground truth and two real RNA-seq datasets from MAQC project.", "paper_title": "Estimation of isoform expression in RNA-seq data using a hierarchical Bayesian model", "paper_id": "WOS:000369761500002"}
