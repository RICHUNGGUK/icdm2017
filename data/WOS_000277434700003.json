MAPS introduces two new coordination strategies namely Blocking Escape Directions and Using Alternative Proposals, which help the predators waylay the possible escape directions of the prey in coordination. We compared our coordination strategies with the uncoordinated one against a prey controlled by Prey A*, and observed an impressive reduction in the number of moves to catch the prey.", "paper_title": "Multi-agent real-time pursuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000277434700003"}
