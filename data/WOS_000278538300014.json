On one hand, it is examined whether the system is capable of sensing real-time progressive local variations of temperature and/or conductivity in customized phantom setups; on the other hand, the focusing attributes of the system are explored for different positions and types of phantoms used for hyperthermia in conjunction with dielectric matching layers surrounding the areas of interest. The main module of the system is an ellipsoidal cavity, which provides the appropriate focusing of the electromagnetic energy on the area of interest. The system has been used for the past few years in experiments with different configuration setups including phantom, animal, and human volunteer measurements yielding promising outcome. The present results show that the system is able to detect local concentrated gradual temperature and conductivity variations expressed as an increase of the output radiometric voltage. Moreover, when contactless focused hyperthermia is performed, the results show significant temperature increase at specific phantom areas. In this case, the effect of the dielectric matching layers placed around the phantoms is critical, thus resulting in the enhancement of the energy penetration depth.", "paper_title": "Noninvasive Focused Monitoring and Irradiation of Head Tissue Phantoms at Microwave Frequencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000278538300014"}
