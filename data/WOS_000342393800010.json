The proposed architecture provides low-overhead error correction capabilities relying on the hardware implementation of the algorithm-based fault-tolerance method that is executed concurrently with matrix multiplication, providing efficient occupation of memory and power resources. The Resilient Adaptive Algebraic Architecture (RA(3)) is evaluated using three real-time industrial case studies from the telecom and multimedia application domains to present the design space exploration and the adaptation possibilities the architecture offers to hardware designers. RA(3) is compared in its performance and energy efficiency with standard high-performance architectures, namely a GPU and an out-of-order general-purpose processor. Finally, we present the results of fault injection campaigns in order to measure the architecture resilience to soft errors.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Parallelism Exploitation under Physical and Real-Time Constraints for Resilient Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342393800010"}
