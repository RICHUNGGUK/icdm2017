Recently, Liu et al. 1151 proposed a new certificateless signcryption scheme, and claimed that their scheme is provably secure without random oracles in a strengthened security model, where the malicious-but-passive KGC attack is considered. Unfortunately, by giving concrete attacks, we indicate that Liu et al. certificateless signcryption scheme is not secure in this strengthened security model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
