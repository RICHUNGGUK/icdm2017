Unlike Meyer-Muller's proposal and its Chua-Ling's variant, the one presented here is not reducible to Rabin-Williams' cryptosystem. This is formally proven under the assumption that computing half points on elliptic curves defined over the ring Z/nZ is hard when the factorization of n is unknown.", "paper_title": "A Non-Reducible Meyer-Muller's Like Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000305833000013"}
