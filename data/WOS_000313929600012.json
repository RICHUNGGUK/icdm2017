Association rule mining, a computational intelligence approach, is used to identify these factors and the UCI Cleveland dataset, a biological database, is considered along with the three rule generation algorithms - Apriori, Predictive Apriori and Tertius. Analyzing the information available on sick and healthy individuals and taking confidence as an indicator, females are seen to have less chance of coronary heart disease then males. Also, the attributes indicating healthy and sick conditions were identified. It is seen that factors such as chest pain being asymptomatic and the presence of exercise-induced angina indicate the likely existence of heart disease for both men and women. However, resting ECG being either normal or hyper and slope being flat are potential high risk factors for women only. For men, on the other hand, only a single rule expressing resting ECG being hyper was shown to be a significant factor. This means, for women, resting ECG status is a key distinct factor for heart disease prediction. Comparing the healthy status of men and women, slope being up, number of coloured vessels being zero, and old-peak being less than or equal to 0.56 indicate a healthy status for both genders.
