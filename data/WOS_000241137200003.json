The major functionality of the scheme entails space-time block encoder and joint transmit and receive eigen-beamformer (EBF) incorporating with block-ordered layered decoder (BOLD), and its operating principle is described in this paper. Within these functionalities, the joint EBFs will be utilized for decorrelating fading channels to cause an enhancement in the spatial diversity gain. Furthermore, to fortify the capability of layered successive interference cancellation (LSIC) in block-ordered layered decoding process, this paper will develop a simple ad-hoc transmit power discrimination scheme (TPDS) based on a particular power discrimination function (PDF). To confirm the superior behavior of the proposed JBSTBC scheme employing ad-hoc TPDS, computer simulations will be conducted under various channel conditions with the provision of detailed mathematical derivations for clarifying its functionality.", "paper_title": "Block-ordered layered detector for MIMO-STBC using joint eigen-beamformers and ad-hoc power discrimination scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137200003"}
