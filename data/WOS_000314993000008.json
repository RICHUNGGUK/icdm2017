It puts in perspective how process systems engineering (PSE) has contributed to the area and explores the current technical problems that PSE can contribute to. Fuel cells, solar cells, wind turbines, flow batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as their interactions with the smart grid are considered. PSE has contributed and will contribute to the design as well as optimal integration and operation of power generators, storage systems and power grids, through mathematical modeling, control and optimization.
