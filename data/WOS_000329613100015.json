The KFDA method is obtained by combining the advantages of fuzzy methods and a kernel trick. Based on the orthogonal-triangular decomposition of a matrix and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), two different variants, KFDA/QR and KFDA/SVD, of KFDA are obtained. In the proposed method, the membership degree is incorporated into the definition of between-class and within-class scatter matrices to get fuzzy between-class and within-class scatter matrices. The membership degree is obtained by combining the measures of features of samples data. In addition, the effects of employing different measures is investigated from a pure mathematical point of view, and the t-test statistical method is used for comparing the robustness of the learning algorithm. Experimental results on ORL and FERET face databases show that KFDA/QR and KFDA/SVD are more effective and feasible than Fuzzy Discriminant Analysis (FDA) and Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) in terms of the mean correct recognition rate.", "paper_title": "A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF KERNEL-BASED FUZZY DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000329613100015"}
