The time-varying consensus-gain is introduced to attenuate the measurement noise. By combining the tools of algebraic graph theory, matrix theory and stochastic analysis, consensus protocols for multi-agent systems with measurement noise and time delay are elaborately analysed. The example and simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results. Moreover, the simulations demonstrate that, the proper consensus-gain function in the consensus protocol is the necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of the multi-agent systems.", "paper_title": "Mean square average-consensus for multi-agent systems with measurement noise and time delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000320356300001"}
