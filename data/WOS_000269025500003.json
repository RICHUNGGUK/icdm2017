The method is based on the production of synthetic images with the spectral characteristics of the image pixels extracted from a signature multi-spectral image. The knowledge of the location of objects in the synthetic image provides a reference segmentation, which allows for a quantitative evaluation of the quality provided by a segmentation algorithm. The Hammoude metric and three external similarity indices (Rand, Corrected Rand, and Jaccard) were chosen to perform this evaluation, but other metrics can also be used. The proposed methodology can be used for any type of satellite image (or multi-spectral image), set of land cover types, and segmentation algorithms. A practical application was carried out to illustrate the value of the proposed method. A SPOT satellite image was used to extract the spectral signature of 8 land cover types. Three test images were produced using the 8 land cover classes and two different 5 class sub-sets. The segmentation results provided by a standard algorithm were compared with the reference or expected segmentation. The results clearly indicate that the quality of a segmentation obtained from a multi-spectral image not only depends on the geometric properties of the objects present in the image, but also on their spectral characteristics. The results suggest that a specific evaluation should be carried out for each particular experiment, as the segmentation results are very dependent on the choice of land cover types.
