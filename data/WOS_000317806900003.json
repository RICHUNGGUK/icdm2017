In this framework, the salient structures of the input images are fused in the gradient domain, then the final fused image is reconstructed by solving a Poisson equation which forces the gradients of the fused image to be close to the fused gradients. To fuse the structures in the gradient domain, an effective MRF-based fusion model is designed based on both the per-pixel fusion rule defined by the local saliency and also the smoothness constraints over the fusion weights, which is optimized by graph cut algorithm. This MRF-based fusion model enables the accurate estimation of region-based fusion weights for the salient objects or structures. We apply this method to the applications of multi-sensor image fusion, including infrared and visible image fusion, multi-focus image fusion and medical image fusion. Extensive experiments and comparisons show that the proposed fusion model is able to better fuse the multi-sensor images and produces high-quality fusion results compared with the other state-of-the-art methods.
