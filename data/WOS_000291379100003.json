Words coding the boundary of these polyominoes satisfy an equation whose solutions are in bijection with a subset of the solutions of equations of the form A B (A) over tilde (B) over tilde equivalent to X Y (X) over tilde (Y) over tilde. It turns out that the solutions are strongly related to local periodicity involving palindromes and conjugate words. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
