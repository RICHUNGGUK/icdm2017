New structures and new materials are implemented as possible solutions. This paper focuses on two kinds of new flash cells for high density and low power memory applications based on the vertical channel double gate structure. The proposed VD-NROM with dual-nitride-trapping-layer and vertical structure can achieve four-bit-per-cell storage capability. And the proposed VSAS-FG cell benefits the high programming efficiency, low power and high density capability, which can be realized without any additional mask and can achieve the self-alignment of the split-gate channel and the floating-gate. The two novel flash cell structures can be considered as potential candidates for different flash memory applications.", "paper_title": "Novel vertical channel double gate structures for high density and low power flash memory applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000256082600013"}
