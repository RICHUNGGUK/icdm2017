This dominance is despite the availability of powerful search and inference techniques for scheduling problems developed by the constraint programming community. In this paper, we introduce a simple hybrid algorithm for job-shop scheduling that leverages both the fast, broad search capabilities of modern tabu search algorithms and the scheduling-specific inference capabilities of constraint programming. The hybrid algorithm significantly improves the performance of a state-of-the-art tabu search algorithm for the job-shop problem and represents the first instance in which a constraint programming algorithm obtains performance competitive with the best local search algorithms. Furthermore, the variability in solution quality obtained by the hybrid is significantly lower than that of pure local search algorithms. Beyond performance demonstration, we perform a series of experiments that provide insights into the roles of the two component algorithms in the overall performance of the hybrid.", "paper_title": "Combining Constraint Programming and Local Search for Job-Shop Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000287841500001"}
