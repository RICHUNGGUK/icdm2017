The notion of expectation also makes sense for other notions of uncertainty. We introduce a propositional logic for reasoning about expectation, where the semantics depends on the underlying representation of uncertainty. We give sound and complete axiornatizations for the logic in the case that the underlying representation is (a) probability, (b) sets of probability measures, (c) belief functions, and (d) possibility measures. We show that this logic is more expressive than the corresponding logic for reasoning about likelihood in the case of sets of probability measures, but equi-expressive in the case of probability, belief, and possibility. Finally, we show that satistiability for these logics is NP-complete, no harder than satistiability for propositional logic.", "paper_title": "Characterizing and reasoning about probabilistic and non-probabilistic expectation", "paper_id": "WOS:000247980500005"}
