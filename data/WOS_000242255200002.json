In this paper, we emphasize that a family of upper approximations can retain more information than that of lower approximations. After describing the importance of redacts preserving upper approximations, we propose two measures based on upper approximations: one is a measure of specificity and the other is a classification power index. Finally, we give a numerical example. It shows that the attribute importance calculated by those measures are very different from those calculated by the quality of approximation based on lower approximations.", "paper_title": "Measures based on upper approximations of rough sets for analysis of attribute importance and interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255200002"}
