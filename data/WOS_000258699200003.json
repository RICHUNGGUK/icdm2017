These homological invariants are discrete entities defined in terms of the entanglement a state enjoys with respect to arbitrary groupings of the parties, and they may be thought of as reflecting entanglement in a qualitative way. We investigate basic properties of the invariants and link them with known results on the extraction of GHZ states.", "paper_title": "Homological invariants of stabilizer states", "paper_id": "WOS:000258699200003"}
