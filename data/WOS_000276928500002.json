This field study in the upstream oil and gas industry focused on challenges in the coordination of highly interdependent tasks if teams work remotely on an ongoing basis. Based on 78 semi-structured interviews and observations over a period of 12 months, we identified coordination requirements for primary team activities, as well as effects of changing media capabilities to overcome difficulties of ongoing distribution. Implications for media requirements in the support of ongoing distributed teams are discussed.", "paper_title": "Technology Effects in Distributed Team Coordination-High-Interdependency Tasks in Offshore Oil Production", "paper_id": "WOS:000276928500002"}
