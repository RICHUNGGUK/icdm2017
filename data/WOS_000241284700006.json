WP and AWP can be used to represent and query textual information under the Boolean model using the concept of attribute with values of type text, the concept of word, and word proximity constraints. Variations of WP and AWP are in use in most deployed digital libraries using the Boolean model, text extenders for relational database systems (e.g., Oracle 10g), search engines, and P2P systems for information retrieval and filtering.", "paper_title": "Logic and computational complexity for Boolean information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000241284700006"}
