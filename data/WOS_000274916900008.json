In this paper, we develop systematically these notions, including their mutual relationship. We will show that controlled frames are equivalent to standard frames and so this concept gives a generalized way to check the frame condition, while offering a numerical advantage in the sense of preconditioning. Next, we investigate weighted frames, in particular their relation to controlled frames. We consider the special case of semi-normalized weights, where the concepts of weighted frames and standard frames are interchangeable. We also make the connection with frame multipliers. Finally, we analyze weighted frames numerically. First, we investigate three possibilities for finding weights in order to tighten a given frame, i.e. decrease the frame bound ratio. Then, we examine Gabor frames and how well the canonical dual of a weighted frame is approximated by the inversely weighted dual frame.", "paper_title": "WEIGHTED AND CONTROLLED FRAMES: MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP AND FIRST NUMERICAL PROPERTIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000274916900008"}
