The main objective of this 3D reconstruction system is to offer a versatile and robust tool for the 3D analysis of spines in any healthcare centre with standard clinical setup using standard uncalibrated radiographic images. The novel system uses a self-calibration algorithm and a weak-perspective method to reconstruct the 3D coordinates of anatomical landmarks from bi-planar radiographic images of a patient's trunk. Additionally, a small planar object of known dimensions is proposed to warrant an accurately scaled model of the spine. In order to assess the validity of the 3D reconstructions yielded by the proposed system, a clinical study using 60 pairs of digitized X-rays of adolescents was conducted. The subject cohort in the study group was composed of 51 scoliotic and 9 non-scoliotic patients, with an average Cobb angle on the frontal plane of 25 degrees. For each case, a 3D reconstruction of the spine and pelvis was obtained with the previous system used at our hospital (which requires a positioning apparatus and a calibration jacket), and with the proposed method. Results show that 3D reconstructions obtained with the new system using uncalibrated X-ray images yield geometrically accurate models with insignificant differences for 2D and 3D clinical indexes commonly used in the evaluation of spinal deformities. This demonstrates the system to be a viable and accurate tool for clinical studies and biomechanical analysis purposes, with the added advantage of versatility to any clinical setup for routine follow-ups and surgical planning.", "paper_title": "A versatile 3D reconstruction system of the spine and pelvis for clinical assessment of spinal deformities", "paper_id": "WOS:000247211900009"}
