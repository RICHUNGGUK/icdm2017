Due to a strong link to the genetic basis of the disease, it is extremely difficult to cure. However, it can be controlled to prevent severe consequences, such as organ damage. Therefore, diabetes diagnosis and monitoring of its treatment is very important. In this paper, we have proposed a non-invasive diagnosis support system for DM. The system determines whether or not diabetes is present by determining the cardiac health of a patient using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. This analysis was based on nine nonlinear features namely: Approximate Entropy (ApEn), largest Lyapunov exponet (LLE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Clinically significant measures were used as input to classification algorithms, namely AdaBoost, decision tree (DT), fuzzy Sugeno classifier (FSC), k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and support vector machine (SVM). Ten-fold stratified cross-validation was used to select the best classifier. AdaBoost, with least squares (LS) as weak learner, performed better than the other classifiers, yielding an average accuracy of 90%, sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 88.7%.
