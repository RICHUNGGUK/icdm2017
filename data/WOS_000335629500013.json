The proposed methodology combines state-of-art data mining clustering techniques with a tuned sequence mining method to discover prominent customer behavior trajectories in data bases, which - when combined - represent the \"behavior process\" as it is followed by particular groups of customers. The framework is applied to a real-life case of an event organizer; it is shown how behavior trajectories can help to explain consumer decisions and to improve business processes that are influenced by customer actions.
