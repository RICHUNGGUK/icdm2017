Generally, only experts in the field meet these requirements. In this paper, we present OWLPath, a natural language-query editor guided by multilanguage OWL-formatted ontologies. This application allows nonexpert users to easily create SPARQL queries that can be issued over most existing ontology storage systems. Our approach is a fully fledged solution backed with a proof-of-concept implementation and the empirical results of two challenging use cases: one in the domain of e-finance and the other in e-tourism.", "paper_title": "OWLPath: An OWL Ontology-Guided Query Editor", "paper_id": "WOS:000284095400011"}
