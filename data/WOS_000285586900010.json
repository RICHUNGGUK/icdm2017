To meet the demands of aircraft instrument exhibition in an aviation virtual library, we present a modeling and simulation tool for cockpit instruments on component methods, achieving display functionality and providing a visual interaction platform in the aviation virtual library. For the rapid model construction and reuse of virtual library resources, we classify entities in the cockpit into several categories by their behavior, and design a template for each category to describe its attributes. This efficiently reduces the modeling cycle, and thus largely helps users to take advantage of the library resource.", "paper_title": "A component-based aircraft instrument rapid modeling tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000285586900010"}
