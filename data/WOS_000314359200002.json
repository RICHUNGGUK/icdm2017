A star forest is a graph that consists of node-disjoint star graphs. In the spanning star forest problem, given an unweighted graph G, the objective is to find a star forest that contains all vertices of G and has the maximum number of edges. This problem is the complement of the dominating set problem in the following sense: On a graph with n vertices, the size of the maximum spanning star forest is equal to n minus the size of the minimum dominating set. We present a 0.71-approximation algorithm for this problem, improving upon the approximation factor of 0.6 of Nguyen et al. (SIAM J. Comput. 38:946-962, 2008). We also present a 0.64-approximation algorithm for the problem on node-weighted graphs. Finally, we present improved hardness of approximation results for the weighted (both edge-weighted and node-weighted) versions of the problem. Our algorithms use a non-linear rounding scheme, which might be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "Improved Approximation Algorithms for the Spanning Star Forest Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000314359200002"}
