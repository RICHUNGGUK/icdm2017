The new scheme uses a semi-Lagrangian form of the Euler equations. The system of equations is discretized by discontinuous Galerldn (DG) method using the Taylor basis. The vertex velocities and the numerical fluxes through the cell interfaces are computed consistently by a nodal solver. The mesh moves with the fluid flow. The time marching is implemented by a class of the Runge-Kutta (RK) methods. A WENO reconstruction is used as a limiter for the RKDG method. The scheme is conservative for the mass, momentum and total energy, and obeys the geometrical conservation law. The scheme maintains high-order accuracy and has free parameters. Results of some numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of the scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
