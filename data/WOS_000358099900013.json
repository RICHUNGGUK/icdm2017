This estimation could be used as a reference to adjust the canopy spraying machine parameters with the aim of improving deposition and avoiding drift. Two sets of experiments were carried out, the first one using a single ultrasound sensor in a greenhouse to determine the signal behavior and adjust the algorithms. The second set of experiments were conducted in the orchard and vineyard, under real working conditions. Results show that the signal obtained is highly correlated with the growing season and it has similar values on both sides of the row, with an error of 14.1% in vineyards and 3.8% in apple trees and it is sensitive enough to detect hailstorm effects on the canopy.
