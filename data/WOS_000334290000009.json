In this paper, we propose a weighted dynamic information systems reduction method used to conduct the information reduction in a distributed network. In this method, we (1) weigh and combine all the local information reduction results; (2) regard the users' preferences as core attributes; and (3) design recursive algorithms according to the properties. Experimental results show that this method is effective.", "paper_title": "A Weighted Dynamic Information Systems Reduction Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000334290000009"}
