Its main features are simplicity and speed in practice. Theoretically, however, the best known upper bound on its running time (i.e., n (O(kd))) is, in general, exponential in the number of points (when kd=Omega(n/log n)). Recently Arthur and Vassilvitskii (Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, pp. 144-153, 2006) showed a super-polynomial worst-case analysis, improving the best known lower bound from Omega(n) to dimensions. In Arthur and Vassilvitskii (Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, pp. 144-153, 2006), they also conjectured the existence of super-polynomial lower bounds for any da parts per thousand yen2. Our contribution is twofold: we prove this conjecture and we improve the lower bound, by presenting a simple construction in the plane that leads to the exponential lower bound 2 (Omega(n)).", "paper_title": "k-means Requires Exponentially Many Iterations Even in the Plane", "paper_id": "WOS:000289521700002"}
