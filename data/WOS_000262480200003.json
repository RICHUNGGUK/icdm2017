Many methods exist to compute the surface of the visual hull from silhouettes, but few address the problem of ensuring good topological properties of the surface, such as manifoldness. This paper provides an efficient algorithm to compute such a surface in the form of a polyhedral mesh. It relies on a small number of geometric operations to compute a visual hull polyhedron in a single pass. Such simplicity enables the algorithm to combine the advantages of being fast, producing pixel-exact surfaces, and repeatably yield manifold and watertight polyhedra in general experimental conditions with real data, as verified with all data sets tested. The algorithm is fully described, its complexity analyzed, and the modeling results given.", "paper_title": "Efficient Polyhedral Modeling from Silhouettes", "paper_id": "WOS:000262480200003"}
