However, the nonlinear nature of this formulation makes its solution impractical, so we also outline a knot selection heuristic inspired by the Remes Exchange Algorithm, to produce good solutions to our formulation. This algorithm is intuitive and naturally accommodates local changes in smoothness. Results are presented for the algorithm demonstrating performance that is as good as, or better than, other current methods on established benchmark functions.", "paper_title": "SALSA - a spatially adaptive local smoothing algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000285414000004"}
