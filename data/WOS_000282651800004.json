In that paper a new upper bound for the corresponding pseudovariety of monoids was implicitly given. In this paper we show that it is decidable whether a given monoid belongs to the new upper bound. We also prove that this new upper bound is incomparable with the previous upper bound.", "paper_title": "New decidable upper bound of the second level in the Straubing-Therien concatenation hierarchy of star-free languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000282651800004"}
