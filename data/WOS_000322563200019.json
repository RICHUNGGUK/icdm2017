The corner stone of these approaches is the proper selection of time-buffers which are considered as exogenously defined constant. However, the majority of real-world manufacturing systems are characterized by the dynamic change of demand and by stochastic production times. This fact calls for a dynamic approach in supporting the decision making on time-buffer policies. To this end, we study a capacitated, single-product, three-operation, flow-shop manufacturing system. We propose a dynamic time-buffer control mechanism for short/medium-term PPC with adaptive response to demand changes and robustness to sudden disturbances in both internal and external shop environment. By integrating the control mechanism into the flow-shop system, we develop a system dynamics model to support the decision-making on time-buffer policies. Using the model, we study the effect of policies on shop performance by means of analysis of variance. Extensive numerical investigation reveals the insensitivity of time-buffer policies to key factors related to demand, demand due date and operational characteristics such as protective capacity and production times.
