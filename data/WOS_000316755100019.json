We build upon this work, presenting a modification to the algorithm developed by Franc and Sonnenburg [2]. We demonstrate empirically that our changes can reduce cutting plane training time by up to 40 percent, and discuss how changes in data sets and parameter settings affect the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Cutting Plane Training for Linear Support Vector Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000316755100019"}
