Method: The online program is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and consists of seven steps that patients work through progressively. An overall sample of 141 women suffering from BN used the program over a 6-month period. Patients were supported by three face-to-face evaluation interviews with a therapist, and a weekly e-mail contact. Data on general psychopathology and specific eating disorder symptoms were also collected at the evaluation interviews. Results: Initial results from the Swiss sample (N = 41) showed significant improvement of overall psychological health (p <.001) as measured by the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90R), and for all dimensions of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2). Conclusion: An online Self-Help program for BN can be used effectively to reduce eating disorder symptoms in Bulimic patients and user feedback showed that this approach contributed to increase patient involvement and service availability. Additional data from the other centers will further inform the efficacy and impact of this approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
