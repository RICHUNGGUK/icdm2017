It is cost effective to deploy single-radio sniffers that can monitor multiple nearby APs. To achieve this, a sniffer needs to switch among multiple channels since these APs often operate on orthogonal channels. In this paper, we formulate and solve two optimization problems on sniffer channel selection. Both problems require that each AP be monitored by at least one sniffer. In addition, one optimization problem requires minimizing the maximum number of channels that a sniffer listens to, and the other requires minimizing the total number of channels that the sniffers listen to. We prove that both optimization problems are NP-hard. For each problem, we propose three algorithms to solve it, one based on integer programming (IP), one based on LP-relaxation, and the third based on a greedy heuristic. We evaluate the performance of the various algorithms using two real-world datasets. Our results show that, for each problem, all the three algorithms are effective in achieving their optimization goals, and overall, the LP-based algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms.
