It is known that the maximum order of a connected triple-loop network of the form TL(n)(a, b, n - (a + b)) with given diameter d >= 2 is n(d) = 3d(2) + 3d + 1, which is achieved by TL(nd) = TL(nd)(1, 3d + 1, 3d(2) - 1). In this article, we study the routing and gossiping problems for such optimal triple-loop networks under the store-and-forward, all-port, and full-duplex model, and prove that they admit \"perfect\" gossiping and routing schemes which exhibit many interesting features. Using a group-theoretic approach we develop for TL(nd) a method for systematically producing such optimal gossiping and routing schemes. Moreover, we determine the minimum gossip time, the edge- and arc-forwarding indices, and the minimal edge- and arc-forwarding indices of TL(nd), and prove that our routing schemes are optimal with respect to these four indices simultaneously. As a key step towards these results, we prove that TL(nd) is a Frobenius graph on a Frobenius group with Frobenius kernel Z(nd) and that TL(nd) is arc-transitive with respect to this Frobenius group. In addition, we show that TL(nd) admits complete rotations. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
