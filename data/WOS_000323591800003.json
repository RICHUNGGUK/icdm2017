Such models formalize the unspecified agile processes that workers autonomously perform: because these models aren't defined a priori by experts but are rather inferred from real-life scenarios, they're guaranteed to respect true workflow executions. Moreover, knowledge workers can share, compare, and preserve such models to put in evidence their best practices and thus benefit the entire business.", "paper_title": "Mining Artful Processes from Knowledge Workers' Emails", "paper_id": "WOS:000323591800003"}
