However, the languages to describe the switching logic and the fuzzy subsystems are, in general, different, and this difference makes the system analysis and implementation hard. In this paper, we use differential Petri net (DPN) as a unified model to represent both the discrete logic and fuzzy dynamic processes. To exam the rationality of the representation, we prove the correctness of the representation for the discrete part and estimate the approximation accuracy of the representation for the dynamic part. Our work provides a way to analyze the switched fuzzy systems by checking the PN and to use the PN model for further system implementation. We demonstrate the benefits of our work via a case study.", "paper_title": "Petri Net Representation of Switched Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314724900002"}
