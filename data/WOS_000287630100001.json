We consider a payload bit-rate of 40 Gbit/s for an intensity modulation (IM), differential phase shift keying (DPSK), differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) and 4-channel multi-rate DQPSK payload signals with 2.5, 10, 20 and 80 Gb/s rates for comparison purposes. The label and payload signal performances are assessed by the eye-diagram opening factor (EOF) and bit-error rate (BER) as function of the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). Our proposed SAC label detection method offers flexible, robust and multi-bit-rate label performance for payload signal with different modulation formats. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
