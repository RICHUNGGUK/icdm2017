Up to equivalence, we obtain a parametrization of all self-dual binary codes of length 72 with automorphism of order four, which can be extremal. We use extensive computations in Magma and on a supercomputer to show that the automorphism group of an extremal self-dual binary code of length 72 does not have an element of order four.", "paper_title": "The Automorphism Group of a Self-Dual [72,36,16] Code Does Not Contain Z(4)", "paper_id": "WOS:000341980300018"}
