However, it suffers from heavy storage overhead and serious time complexity of index construction and query evaluation. We extend the retrieval syntax to support path query for partial structural information,. propose a variant of interconnection relationship, and present an efficient evaluation algorithm with the extended structural summaries. The experiments show that with the promise of meaningful answers, our approach offers great performance benefits of evaluating interconnection relationship at run time.", "paper_title": "Evaluating interconnection relationship for path-based XML retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200049"}
