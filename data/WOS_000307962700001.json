We require the systems to satisfy an architectural constraint which makes sure that the communication structure between the components is given by a tree. Only pairs of components have to be examined for the analysis, therefore the cost is polynomial in the size of the input. We shortly discuss a prototype algorithm which is based on our results and can be used for the investigation of deadlock-freedom of systems satisfying the architectural constraint.", "paper_title": "Deadlock-freedom in component systems with architectural constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000307962700001"}
