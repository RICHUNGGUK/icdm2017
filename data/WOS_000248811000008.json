The SEEK information technology infrastructure encompasses three integrated systems: (1) EcoGrid-an open architecture for data access; (2) a Semantic Mediation System based on domain-specific ontologies; and (3) an Analysis and Modeling System that supports semantically integrated analytical workflows. Multidisciplinary scientists and programmers from multiple institutions comprise the core development team. SEEK design and development are informed by three multidisciplinary teams of scientists organized in Working Groups. The Biodiversity and Ecological Analysis and Modeling Working Group informs development through evaluation of SEEK efficacy in addressing biodiversity and ecological questions. The Knowledge Representation Working Group provides knowledge representation requirements from the domain sciences and develops the corresponding knowledge representations (ontologies) to support the assembly of analytical workflows in the Analysis and Modeling System, and the intelligent data and service discovery in the EcoGrid. A Biological Classification and Nomenclature Working Group investigates solutions to mediating among multiple taxonomies for naming organisms. A multifaceted education, outreach and training program ensures that the SEEK research products, software, and information technology infrastructure optimally benefit the target communities.", "paper_title": "A knowledge environment for the biodiversity and ecological sciences", "paper_id": "WOS:000248811000008"}
