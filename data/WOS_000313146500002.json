Systems that permanently interact with users need to be adapted to changes in their interests. This paper proposes an algorithm that takes advantage of the preference information implicit in the actions of the user to dynamically adapt the user profile, in which user preferences are represented as fuzzy sets. The algorithm has been tested with real data extracted from the New York Times and has shown promising results. This paper presents the adaptation algorithm and discusses the influence of its basic parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
