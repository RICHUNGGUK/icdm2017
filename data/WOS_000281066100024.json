The electric potential Poisson equation contains EHD interface boundary conditions, which are implemented using the ghost fluid method (GFM). The GFM is also used to solve the pressure Poisson equation. The methods detailed here are integrated with state-of-the-art interface transport techniques and coupled to a robust, high order fully conservative finite difference Navier-Stokes solver. Test cases with exact or approximate analytic solutions are used to assess the robustness and accuracy of the EHD numerical scheme. The method is then applied to simulate a charged liquid kerosene jet.
