Design/methodology/approach - In order to do this Bateson's concepts of learning and network pathologies are applied to the medical topic of immune reaction. Findings - Cur-rent medical research does not take sufficiently into account that natural stimuli and therapeutic interventions might lead to a large-scale of changes. This is mainly due to the lack of related epistemological tools. Practical implications - This lack leads to a restricted validity of many medical findings. There is even some evidence that the cur-rent therapeutic approach might lead to a decline of human robustness. Originality/value - This paper shows how systemic concepts can contribute to a deeper understanding of the therapeutic processes.", "paper_title": "Human robustness and conscious purpose in contemporary medicine", "paper_id": "WOS:000250571200015"}
