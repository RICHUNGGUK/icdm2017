The experimental results presented in this article show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in protecting users' privacy without compromising the quality of the recommendations. In this sense, the proposed approach perturbs data in a much more efficient way than other well-known methods such as Gaussian Noise Addition (GNA). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
