We mathematically formulate this problem by taking into account the interference, the number of available radios the set of usable channels, and other resource constraints at nodes. We also consider the possible combining of several consecutive channels into one so that a network interface card (NIC) can use the channel with larger range of frequencies and thus improve the channel capacity. Furthermore, we consider several interference models and assume a general yet practical network model in which two nodes may still not communicate directly even if one is within the transmission range of the other. We designed efficient algorithm for throughput (or fairness) optimization by finding flow routing, scheduling of transmissions, and dynamic channel assignment and combining. We show that the performance, fairness and throughput, achieved by our method is within a constant factor of the optimum. Our model also can deal with the situation when each node will charge a certain amount for relaying data to a neighboring node and each flow has a budget constraint. Our extensive evaluation shows that our algorithm can effectively exploit the number of channels and radios. In addition, it shows that combining multiple channels and assigning them to a single user at some time slots indeed increases the maximum throughput of the system compared to assigning a single channel.", "paper_title": "Joint Throughput Optimization for Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266033300003"}
