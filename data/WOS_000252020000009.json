The method evaluates context candidates from a given program, in terms of reduction in cycles by exploiting parallel and pipeline execution of the reconfigurable processor. According to this evaluation measure, the method selects appropriate contexts for the dynamic reconfigurable processing unit. The proposed method is implemented on the framework of COINS project. For several example programs, the generated codes are evaluated by a software simulator in terms of execution cycles, and these results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Compiler for architecture with dynamic reconfigurable processing unit by use of automatic assignment method of sub-programs based on their quantitative evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020000009"}
