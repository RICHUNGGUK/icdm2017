We give a new interpretation to the diluted R rho R iterations that allows us to prove the global convergence under weaker assumptions. Thus, we propose a new algorithm which is globally convergent and suitable for practical implementation.", "paper_title": "GLOBAL CONVERGENCE OF DILUTED ITERATIONS IN MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD QUANTUM TOMOGRAPHY", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579800005"}
