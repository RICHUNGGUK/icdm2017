The instructor can choose or create different types of pedagogical scenarios, covering teaching requirements from undergraduate to graduate levels. Furthermore, eLab implementation and use do not require any commercial software. Its reliability has been proven during many practical classes in France and other countries. eLab is now a key component of the Bordeaux University e-Learning material in electrical engineering. In the field of analog integrated circuits design, eLab offers a unique measurement solution, which can be combined to traditional circuit simulation sessions.", "paper_title": "A Distance Measurement Platform Dedicated to Electrical Engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000207848500008"}
