Therefore, it is necessary to consider systems with single transmitters and multiple receivers in terms of efficiency. Current offerings only consider single device charging systems. A problem encountered is the efficiency of one receiver can be affected by another because of the mutual inductance between them. In this paper, an efficiency calculation method is presented for a wireless power transfer system with one to N-receivers. The mutual inductance between coils is implicitly calculated for different spatial positions and verified by practical experimentation. The effect of changing parameters, such as resonant frequency, coil size and distance between coils, on the efficiency has been studied. A clarification of the special performance of a wireless power transfer system at a specific point has been presented.", "paper_title": "An Approach to Calculate the Efficiency for an N-Receiver Wireless Power Transfer System", "paper_id": "WOS:000369851100013"}
