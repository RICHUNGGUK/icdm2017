Two basic aspects of network-aware applications, network-awareness and network adaptation, have been widely addressed in the literature. In this work, a solution for video on demand service that integrates wireless and wired networks by using the network-aware concepts is proposed to reduce the blocking probability and dropping probability of mobile requests. Fuzzy logic inference system is employed to select appropriate cache relay nodes to cache published video streams and distribute them to different peers through service oriented architecture (SOA). SIP-based control protocol and IMS standard are adopted in this work to ensure the possibility of heterogeneous communication and provide a framework for delivering real-time multimedia services over an IP-based network to ensure interoperability, roaming, and end-to-end session management. The experimental results demonstrate that effectiveness and practicability of the proposed work. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
