This paper examines how this change affects the publication and citation counts of highly cited computer scientists. Computer science is a field where proceedings are a major publication venue. The results show that most of the highly cited publications of the sampled researchers are journal publications, but these highly cited items receive more than 40% of their citations from proceedings papers. The paper also discusses issues related to double-counting, i.e., when a given work is published both in a proceedings and later on as a journal paper.", "paper_title": "Web of Science with the Conference Proceedings Citation Indexes: the case of computer science", "paper_id": "WOS:000277418400016"}
