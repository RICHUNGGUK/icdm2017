To this end, we compared performance with the isometric spacemouse with that with the isotonic flystick, assuming that the flystick induces more movement compatibility in continuous movement and thus results in better performance. In the study, 28 subjects performed an object rotation task on a holobench with the two devices. Additionally, rotation axis and rotation degree were varied. Results showed a notable advantage for the flystick with regard to handling time (the time from the beginning of the object's appearance until the end of rotation, determined by subjects). The data support the idea that the compatibility of motor movements with the resulting (i.e. anticipated) object movements is an important determinant of usability in VR environments.", "paper_title": "Anticipatory movement compatibility for virtual reality interaction devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000275160400006"}
