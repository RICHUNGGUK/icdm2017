The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved along with equations for the bulk and interfacial surfactant concentrations. A nonlinear equation of state is used to relate the surface tension to the interfacial surfactant concentration. The method is based on the use of a diffuse interface, which allows a simple implementation using standard finite difference or finite element techniques. Here, finite difference methods on a block-structured adaptive grid are used, and the resulting equations are solved using a nonlinear multigrid method. Results are presented for a drop in shear flow in both 20 and 3D, and the effect of solubility is discussed. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
