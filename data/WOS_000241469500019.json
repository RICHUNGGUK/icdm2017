Three problems are investigated. The first one is the determination of the load balancing parameters without any global knowledge. The second problem consists in estimating the cost and the benefit of a load exchange. The last one studies the convergence detection of the load balancing algorithm. For this last point we give an algorithm based on simulated annealing to reduce the convergence towards a load repartition in steps that can be done with discrete loads. Several simulations close this paper and illustrate the impact of the various methods and algorithms introduced.", "paper_title": "A practical approach of diffusion load balancing algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500019"}
