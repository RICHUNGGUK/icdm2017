Although, several domain-depended protocols have already been developed, efficient methodologies and technologies for facilitating the definition, deployment, reuse and maintenance of interaction protocols should be developed. This paper proposes a rule-based, reusable, analyzable and easily comprehensible by the user choreography definition methodology, called K-SWAN. Ohe proposed choreography scheme separates the definition of the agent shared interaction protocol from the private agent interaction strategy and enables agents to choose the appropriate protocol for the transaction, from a library of re-usable interaction protocols, and automatically combine it with their personal strategy, from a private library, by using SW technologies for both. Complying with K-SWAN methodology will let agents participate seamlessly in different interaction processes and/or modify their behavior with a minimal programming effort. Finally, this paper presents the integration of the K-SWAN methodology into EMERALD, a multi-agent knowledge-based framework based on SW standards, which maximizes reusability and interoperability of behavior between agents.", "paper_title": "Choreographing agent encounters in the Semantic Web using rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000341191800006"}
