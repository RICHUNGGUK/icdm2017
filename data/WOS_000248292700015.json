The passive perturbation in the normal direction is achieved by installing the hemisphere-like bulges on the delta wing along the projection of the vortices. The key purpose of this perturbation is to delay or suppress vortex breakdown over delta wings according to the self-induction mechanism theory. The design of bulge-like surface for delta wings offers a minimization of initial vorticity gradient and an elimination of linearly mutual induction within the vortex core. Three delta wings with swept angles of 60 degrees, 65 degrees and 70 degrees have been used. Dye flow visualization and force measurement in different water tunnels are performed at the water speed of U = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 m/s. In flow visualization, the results show contributions of bulges as perturbation to leading-edge vortices. The best outcome of perturbing the vortex core occurs in the case of the 65 degrees delta wing. The breakdown positions on the 65 degrees delta wing are delayed in almost the entire range of angles of attack, and that, the results are presented here.", "paper_title": "Controlled vortex breakdown on modified delta wings", "paper_id": "WOS:000248292700015"}
