Researchers have developed various algorithms to model the maneuvers on both highways and urban streets. However, the majority of these models was derived and validated using data such as vehicle trajectories, without many considerations of driver characteristics. In this study, an instrumented vehicle-based experiment was carefully designed to observe the drivers action under various urban lane-changing scenarios. The personal background data, and in-vehicle driver behavior and trajectory data were obtained from the experiment, and used to classify 40 drivers into four general groups according to the lane-changing maneuvers performed in an urban street environment. Additional comparisons and analysis were conducted to confirm the categorization results. The article concludes by providing recommendations related to the implementation of study findings into micro-simulators, such as using only four driver types in CORSIM instead of the existing 10 types, to better replicate driver behavior in urban street networks.", "paper_title": "Lane-Changing Behavior on Urban Streets: An \"In-Vehicle\" Field Experiment-Based Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000305962900004"}
