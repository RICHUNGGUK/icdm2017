Uncertain differential equation is a type of differential equation driven by the canonical process. This paper will give a concept of stability in p-th moment for uncertain differential equations. A sufficient and necessary condition for linear uncertain differential equation, and a sufficient condition with general uncertain differential equation being stable in p-th moment will be given.", "paper_title": "Stability in p-th moment for uncertain differential equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000331137600019"}
