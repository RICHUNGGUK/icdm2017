Recently, this problem has attracted a great deal of interest and several approaches have been proposed. Since Mobile Social Networks (MSNs) are increasingly popular type of Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), making accurate analysis of social network properties of these networks is essential for designing efficient routing protocols. In this paper, we introduce a new metric that detects the quality of friendships between nodes accurately. Utilizing this metric, we define the community of each node as the set of nodes having close friendship relations with this node either directly or indirectly. We also present Friendship-Based Routing in which periodically differentiated friendship relations are used in forwarding of messages. Extensive simulations on both real and synthetic traces show that the introduced algorithm is more efficient than the existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Friendship Relations for Efficient Routing in Mobile Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310382800007"}
