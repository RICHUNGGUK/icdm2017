A two-stage algorithm is developed to estimate the channel parameters. At first stage, we propose an algorithm based on the second order statistics to decorrelate the sensor signals. After decorrelation, we apply instantaneous demixing algorithm to separate the signals at the second stage. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and the performance of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Two-stage blind deconvolution for V-BLAST OFDM system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000179"}
