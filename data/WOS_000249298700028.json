For all known distance-regular graphs it is determined whether they are 3-chromatic. A start is made with the classification of 3-chromatic distance-regular graphs, and it is shown that such graphs, if not complete 3-partite, must have lambda <= 1.", "paper_title": "On 3-chromatic distance-regular graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000249298700028"}
