Different variations of this method are tested on a turbulent flow over a cylinder at Reynolds number of 10,000 and free-stream Mach number of 0.85. The artificial bulk viscosity model by Cook and Cabot, which is parameterized by the strain rate magnitude, is found to provide unnecessary bulk viscosity in turbulent regions away from shocks. While developed turbulent structures are found unaffected, this extra bulk viscosity is shown to significantly damp the sound field. An alternative formulation of the model which is parameterized by the rate of dilatation is proposed. This formulation is shown to avoid the unnecessary bulk viscosity and enhance the sound-prediction capability of the model. It was found that standard LES combined with artificial bulk viscosity is a promising approach for simulation of turbulent flows with shocks. The formulation of the model on curvilinear coordinates is presented in the appendix. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
