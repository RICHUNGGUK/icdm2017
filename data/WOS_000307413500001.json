By employing the tool of symbolic dynamics, we show that there exists a conjugate representation between general symbolic dynamical systems and usual symbolic dynamical systems through subshifts. For any one-dimensional cellular automaton, we demonstrate that there exists a subsystem such that it is a semi-conjugate representation of the cellular automaton through the shift.", "paper_title": "Notes on Symbolic Representations of Dynamical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000307413500001"}
