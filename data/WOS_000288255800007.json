While the prediction problem is known to be NP complete even in the simple setting of Dill's model with a 2D-lattice, a variety of bio-inspired algorithms for this problem have been proposed in the literature. Immunological algorithms are inspired by the kind of optimization that immune systems perform when identifying and promoting the replication of the most effective antibodies against given antigens. A quick, state-of-the-art survey of discrete models and immunological algorithms for protein structure prediction is presented in this paper, and the main design and performance features of an immunological algorithm for this problem are illustrated in a tutorial fashion.", "paper_title": "On discrete models and immunological algorithms for protein structure prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800007"}
