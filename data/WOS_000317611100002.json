Clique-width is a complexity measure for C-coloured graphs, for finite sets C. Rank-width is an equivalent complexity measure for undirected graphs and has good algorithmic and structural properties. It is in particular related to the vertex-minor relation. We discuss some possible extensions of the notion of rank-width to C-coloured graphs. There is not a unique natural notion of rank-width for C-coloured graphs. We define two notions of rank-width for them, both based on a coding of C-coloured graphs by -graphs--coloured graphs where each edge has exactly one colour from a field-and named respectively -rank-width and -bi-rank-width. The two notions are equivalent to clique-width. We then present a notion of vertex-minor for -graphs and prove that -graphs of bounded -rank-width are characterised by a list of -graphs to exclude as vertex-minors (this list is finite if is finite). An algorithm that decides in time O(n (3)) whether an -graph with n vertices has -rank-width (resp. -bi-rank-width) at most k, for fixed k and fixed finite field , is also given. Graph operations to check MSOL-definable properties on -graphs of bounded -rank-width (resp. -bi-rank-width) are presented. A specialisation of all these notions to graphs without edge colours is presented, which shows that our results generalise the ones in undirected graphs.", "paper_title": "The Rank-Width of Edge-Coloured Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000317611100002"}
