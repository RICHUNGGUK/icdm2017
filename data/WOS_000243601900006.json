In this paper, we focus on a typical situation of LBS which is to provide services for users in cars that move in a road network. To provide such kind of services, an integration method for representing transportation information with a road map is proposed. By using our integration method, since the transportation information of road networks is managed under the spatial index structure created for road networks, spatial queries on them can take advantages of the spatial index structure and achieve an efficient process. Moreover, we discuss path search, region search, nearest neighbor search and continuous nearest neighbor search in this paper, which are based on transportation networks with (or without) considering the static spatial objects outside the transportation networks. Using transportation information and the corresponding real road network, the paper offers evaluations by comparing our representation method and query method with those in related works. The results show a good performance of our methods.", "paper_title": "Search on transportation networks for location-based service", "paper_id": "WOS:000243601900006"}
