By characterizations for connectivity of covering approximation spaces, the author solves the problem: How can one know that an epidemic E spreads easily or not easily in a E-spread information system? Furthermore, the author gives an example to demonstrate the usefulness, which gives a further application of rough set theory in medical sciences of the above result by logical methods and mathematical methods.
