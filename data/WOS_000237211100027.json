It is widely believed that autonomicity is a principle that can reduce complexity, but there is also concern that autonomicity itself is complexity-producing. Autonomicity promotes all \"self-*\" attributes of a system and naturally distributes responsibilities and costs, but it can also bring the system close to a state of \"anarchy\" (modern Greek interpretation of \"autonomous\") if not properly handled. It appears that the overall system complexity may increase, but it is distributed and shared (hence, it is potentially easier to manage), in a similar way in which Integrated Circuits encapsulate the increased complexity and hide it from the bigger system. In addition to reducing complexity in the above sense, autonomicity can also help design truly adaptable, self-tuning and \"all-weather\" near-optimal systems, something not possible under traditional system design that are difficult to cope with the combined fine-tuning of a very large number of parameters.", "paper_title": "Panel 1 report: Autonomicity versus complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000237211100027"}
