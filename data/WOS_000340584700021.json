The proposed system presents two recognition algorithms to recognize a set of six specific static hand gestures, namely open, close, cut, paste, maximize, and minimize. The hand gesture image is passed through three stages: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In the first method, the hand contour is used as a feature that treats scaling and translation of problems (in some cases). However, the complex moment algorithm is used to describe the hand gesture and to treat the rotation problem in addition to scaling and translation. The back-propagation learning algorithm is employed in the multilayer neural network classifier. The second method proposed in this article achieves better recognition rate than the first method.", "paper_title": "Feature extraction and ML techniques for static gesture recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700021"}
