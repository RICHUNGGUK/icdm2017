The basic components are proposed to consist of forward/inverse model motor control pairs in an attention-control architecture, in which buffers are used to achieve sequencing by recurrence of virtual actions and attended states. How this model can apply to various reasoning paradigm will be described and first simulations presented using a virtual robot environment.", "paper_title": "A basis for cognitive machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100060"}
