A novel sort-free approach to path extension, as well as quantized metrics result in a high-throughput VLSI architecture with lower power and area consumption compared to state-of-the-art published systems. Functionality is confirmed via a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation on a Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA. Comparison of simulation and measurements are given, and FPGA utilization figures are provided. Finally, VLSI architectural tradeoffs are explored for a synthesized application-specific IC (ASIC) implementation in a 65-nm CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of a Sort-Free K-Best Sphere Decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000282843300011"}
