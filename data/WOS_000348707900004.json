To find optimal RNA pseudoknotted structure, we investigate the RNA pseudoknotted structure based on computational methods and models with minimum free energy (MFE). The contribution of this paper is to obtain an efficient algorithm for predicting RNA pseudoknotted structure with pseudoknots, and the algorithm takes O(n(3)) time and O(n(2)) space. The experimental test in PseudoBase and Rfam10.1 shows that the proposed algorithm is more effective and precise than other compared algorithms, and can predict arbitrary pseudoknots. Furthermore, we prove that there exists 1 + epsilon (epsilon > 0) polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) in searching maximum number of stackings. We also present a 2-approximation algorithm and analyse the approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Predicting scheme of RNA folding structure including pseudoknots", "paper_id": "WOS:000348707900004"}
