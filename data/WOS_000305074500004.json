We call such trees scaled attachment random recursive trees (sarrt). We prove that the typical depth Dn, the maximum depth (or height) Hn and the minimum depth Mn of a sarrt are asymptotically given by Dn similar to mu-1 log n, Hn similar to amax log n and Mn similar to amin log n where mu,amax and amin are constants depending only on the distribution of X0 whenever X0 has a density. In particular, this gives a new elementary proof for the height of uniform random recursive trees Hn similar to elog n that does not use branching random walks.(C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
