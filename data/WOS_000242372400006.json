A Distributed IDS (DIDS) consists of several IDS over a large network(s), all of which communicate with each other, or with a central server that facilitates advanced network monitoring. In a distributed environment, DIDS are implemented using co-operative intelligent agents distributed across the network(s). This paper evaluates three fuzzy rule-based classifiers to detect intrusions in a network. Results are then compared with other machine learning techniques like decision trees, support vector machines and linear genetic programming. Further, we modeled Distributed Soft Computing-based IDS (D-SCIDS) as a combination of different classifiers to model lightweight and more accurate (heavy weight) IDS. Empirical results clearly show that soft computing approach could play a major role for intrusion detection. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
