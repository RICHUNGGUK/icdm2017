The network considers two cascade-interconnected Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs), one recurrent and one static, that model the behaviour of a unknown dynamic system from input-output data. Each FIS's rule involves a linear system in a controllable canonical form. The training for the recurrent FIS is made by a gradient-based Real-Time Recurrent Learning Algorithm (RTRLA), while the training for the static FIS is based on a simple gradient method. The initial parameter conditions previous to training are obtained by extracting information from a static FISs trained with delayed input-output signals. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the identification of two non-linear dynamic systems is included.", "paper_title": "A new recurrent neurofuzzy network for identification of dynamic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000118"}
