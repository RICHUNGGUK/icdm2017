Subsequently, parameterized linear matrix inequality (PLMI)-based H-infinity stabilization conditions are derived by following the free-weighting matrix approach. To fully exploit the convexity of fuzzy weighting functions, the derived PLMIs are sequentially replaced by a finite set of LMIs by considering all possible conditions associated with fuzzy weighting functions.", "paper_title": "Relaxed H-infinity Stabilization Conditions for Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems With Interval Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000272319000016"}
