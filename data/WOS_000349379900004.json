In modeling noise to regularize the ill-posed decomposition problem, we exploit spatial invariance (isotropy) instead of temporal invariance (stationarity). The isotropy assumption is that the spatial cross-spectrum of noise is dependent on the distance between microphones and independent of the direction between them. We propose methods for spatial covariance matrix decomposition based on least squares and maximum likelihood estimation. The methods are validated on real-world data.", "paper_title": "Blind Suppression of Nonstationary Diffuse Acoustic Noise Based on Spatial Covariance Matrix Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000349379900004"}
