However, in some files each edge is counted once, whereas in others each edge is counted twice; so a systematical check on the DIMACS challenge is made to eliminate the inconsistencies. Besides, the experimental results of a previous paper by Blas et al. counted each violated edges twice and neglected the inconsistencies in the DIMACS challenge. So the correct experimental results of a previous paper by Blas et al. are also given.", "paper_title": "Comments on \"The 1993 DIMACS graph coloring challenge\" and \"Energy function-based approaches to graph coloring\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000236361500025"}
