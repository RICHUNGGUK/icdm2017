We present an analytical model that takes into account the number of nodes, the random packet arrival process, the extent of locality of traffic, and the back off and collision avoidance mechanisms of random access MAC. We model random access multihop wireless networks as open G/G/1 queuing networks and use the diffusion approximation in order to evaluate closed form expressions for the average end-to-end delay. The mean service time of nodes is evaluated and used to obtain the maximum achievable per-node throughput. The analytical results obtained here from the queuing network analysis are discussed with regard to similarities and differences from the well established information-theoretic results on throughput and delay scaling laws in ad hoc networks. We also investigate the extent of deviation of delay and throughput in a real world network from the analytical results presented in this paper. We conduct extensive simulations in order to verify the analytical results and also compare them against NS-2 simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
