Two random strings are independent if knowing one of them does not simplify the description of the other, i.e., the conditional complexity of each string (using the other as a condition) is close to its length. We may define independence of a k-tuple of strings in the same way. In this paper we address the following question: what is that maximal cardinality of a set of n-bit strings if any k elements of this set are independent (up to a certain constant)? Lower and upper bounds that match each other (with logarithmic precision) are provided.", "paper_title": "SETS OF K-INDEPENDENT STRINGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278498500005"}
