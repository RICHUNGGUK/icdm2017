We focus on the asymptotic stability of the numerical methods for linear delay differential-algebraic equations with multiple delays. It is shown that A-stable block boundary value methods satisfying a restrictive condition can preserve the asymptotic stability of the analytical solution. Numerical experiments further confirm the effectiveness and stability of the methods. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
