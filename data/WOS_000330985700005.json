Drawing on key concepts from the area of compressive sensing, we use an l(1)-based regularization approach to solve this, generally ill-posed, inverse scattering problem. As is common in compressive sensing, we exploit randomness, which in this context comes from choosing the antenna locations at random. With n antennas we obtain n(2) measurements of a vector x is an element of C-N representing the target locations and reflectivities on a discretized grid. It is common to assume that the scene x is sparse due to a limited number of targets. Under a natural condition on the mesh size of the grid, we show that an s-sparse scene can be recovered via l(1)-minimization with high probability if n(2) >= Cs log(2)(N). The reconstruction is stable under noise and when passing from sparse to approximately sparse vectors. Our theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Remote Sensing via l(1)-Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000330985700005"}
