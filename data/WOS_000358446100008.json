So it is difficult for users to find a piece of information they need amongst these huge amount of documentations. In order to support maintenance implementation process effectively, a task-oriented adaptive maintenance support (TOAMS) system is designed to provide an intelligent, adaptive electronic support for maintaining complex equipment according to user profiles and their work in hand. By building user model, task model, and product model, document model is configured by multiview and some pieces of semantic information are added into data modules. An agent based software application is being developed to support and allow a systematic utilization of the \"adaptive response\" by integrating it into the daily work of the technician. An application is presented to show the applicability of our method.", "paper_title": "Task-Oriented Adaptive Maintenance Support System", "paper_id": "WOS:000358446100008"}
