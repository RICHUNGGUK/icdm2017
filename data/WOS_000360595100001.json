A nonlinear wave model of the high-purity HIASC is further established to replace the complex first-principle model. Combined with the proposed wave model, a novel generic model control scheme (Wave-GMC) is carried out, which is compared with another generic model controller based on data-driven model (Data-GMC) and a multi-loop PID (M-PID) scheme. In both servo control and regulatory control, Wave-GMC exhibits the best performances. Detailed research results confirm the efficiency of the proposed wave model and the advantages of the proposed Wave-GMC control scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
