In this paper a classification scheme is presented which allows the hardware implementation of the fractal coder. High speed and low power consumption are the goal of the suggested design. The introduced method is based on binary classification of domain and range blocks. The proposed technique increases the processing speed and reduces the power consumption while the qualities of the reconstructed images are comparable with those of the available software techniques. In order to show the functionality of the proposed algorithm, the architecture was implemented on a FPGA chip. The application of the proposed hardware is shown in image compression. The resulted compression ratios, PSNR error, gate count, compression speed and power consumption are compared with the existing designs. Other applications of the proposed design are feasible in certain fields such as mass-volume database coding and also in video coder's block matching schemes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
