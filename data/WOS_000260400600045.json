However, if the minimum feasible clock period is reduced. then the number of registers tends to be increased. In this paper, we propose a gate-level register relocation method that reduces the number of registers while keeping the target clock period. In experiments. the proposed method reduces the number of registers in the practical time in most circuits.", "paper_title": "A Fast Gate-Level Register Relocation Method for Circuit Size Reduction in General-Synchronous Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400600045"}
