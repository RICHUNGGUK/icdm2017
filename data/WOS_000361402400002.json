In Keil and Pradhan (2013) [6], Keil and Pradhan gave a linear-time algorithm for finding a minimum outer-connected dominating set in a proper interval graph. In this paper, we generalize their result to find a minimum outer-connected dominating set in an interval graph in linear time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
