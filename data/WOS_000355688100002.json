First, we utilize a superconductor to create multi-quantum-dot entanglement; secondly, we use the input photon to transfer it into multi-photon entanglement. Moreover, the maximum probability for the swap of photon and quantum-dot qubits is close to unity for a single input Gaussian photon. More importantly, by mapping the multi-quantum-dot state into coherent states of oscillators, such as cavity modes, the multi-quantum-dot entanglement in our scheme can be protected from the decoherence induced by the noise. Thus, it is possible to generate more than eight spatially separated entangled photons in the realistic experimental conditions.", "paper_title": "Generation of multi-photon entanglement", "paper_id": "WOS:000355688100002"}
