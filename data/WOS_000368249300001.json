The automated optimal design of a real-life device able to generate a uniform magnetic field suitable to heat cells in a Petri dish is presented. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The inductor for tests has been designed using finite element analysis and evolutionary computing coupled to design of experiments technique in order to take into account sensitivity of solutions. Findings - The geometry of the inductor has been designed and a laboratory prototype has been built. Results of preliminary tests, using a previously synthesized and characterized magneto fluid, are presented. Originality/value - Design of experiment approach combined with evolutionary computing has been used to compute the solution sensitivity and approximate a 3D Pareto front. The designed inductor has been tested in an experimental set-up.", "paper_title": "Optimal inductor design for nanofluid heating characterisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000368249300001"}
