We additionally consider constraints on local stresses in the optimal structure. We discuss the choice of formulation of the problem and the stress constraints. The chosen formulation leads to a mathematical program with matrix inequality constraints, so-called nonlinear semidefinite program. We present an algorithm that can solve these problems. The algorithm is based on a generalized augmented Lagrangian method. A number of numerical examples demonstrate the effect of stress constraints in free material optimization.", "paper_title": "Free material optimization for stress constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000244689200004"}
