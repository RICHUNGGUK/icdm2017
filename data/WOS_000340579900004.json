Unlike the previously known quantum error-correcting codes that violate the quantum Hamming bound by exploiting maximally entangled pairs of qubits, our codes do not require local unitary operations on the entangled auxiliary qubits during encoding. The degenerate EAQECCs we present are constructed from classical error-correcting codes with poor minimum distances, which implies that, unlike the majority of known EAQECCs with large minimum distances, our EAQECCs take more advantage of degeneracy and rely less on the error correction capabilities of classical codes.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT-ASSISTED QUANTUM CODES ACHIEVING THE QUANTUM SINGLETON BOUND BUT VIOLATING THE QUANTUM HAMMING BOUND", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579900004"}
