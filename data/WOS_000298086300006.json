The paper discusses the required enabling architecture for distributed VHO decision making that is based on the principles of the IEEE 1900.4 standard and on the key media-independent signaling procedure related to the IEEE 802.21 standard. The proposed framework combines the lower-layer and higher layer intelligence in a unified and media-independent way, to drive handover decisions based on rich terminal and network context information. The paper provides a detailed description of the VHO framework and of the key interactions between its key functional blocks. Additionally, the paper includes a series of validation results corresponding to an implementation of the presented framework. Furthermore, the paper includes a discussion comparing the capabilities offered by the proposed framework with those proposed by other similar proposals, which shows the potential benefits and tradeoffs of the introduced concepts.
