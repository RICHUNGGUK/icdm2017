In this paper, we formally investigate the notion of W[t]-hardness under the linear fpt-reduction, and study the structural properties of the corresponding complexity classes. Additional complexity lower bounds on important computational problems are established. Some observations on structural properties of the standard parameterized hierarchy, the W-hierarchy, are also presented.", "paper_title": "On the computational hardness based on linear FPT-reductions", "paper_id": "WOS:000236792900009"}
