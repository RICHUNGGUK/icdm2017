We assume that the annotations refer to an ontology defined in OWL (Web Ontology Language). The intention is then to combine syntactic querying techniques on XML documents with OWL ontology reasoning to filter out semantically irrelevant answers. The solution presented in this paper is an extension of the declarative rule-based XML query and transformation language Xcerpt. The extension allows to interface an ontology reasoner from Xcerpt rules. This makes it possible to use Xcerpt to filter extracted XML data using ontological information. Additionally it allows to retrieve ontological information by sending semantic queries to a reasoner. The prototype implementation uses DIG (Description Logic interface) for communication with the OWL reasoner RacerPro, where the ontology queries are answered.", "paper_title": "XML querying using ontological information", "paper_id": "WOS:000241555100014"}
