Inf. Technol. Biomed., accepted], it still does not work very well in keeping the boundary integrity of a white blood cell. In this paper, the improved version of FCNN called IFCNN is proposed to tackle this issue. The distinctive characteristic of IFCNN is to incorporate the novel fuzzy status containing the useful information beyond a white blood cell into its state equation, resulting in enhancing the boundary integrity. Our theoretical analysis shows that IFCNN has the global stability and the experimental results demonstrate its obvious advantage over FCNN in keeping the boundary integrity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
