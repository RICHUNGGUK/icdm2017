Let occ be the number of occurrences of p in t, and sigma the size of the alphabet. We obtain the following results. A linear space index with query time O(m+sigma (j) log log n+occ). This significantly improves the previously best known linear space index by Lam et al. (in Proc. 18th ISAAC, pp. 846-857, [2007]), which requires query time Theta(jn) in the worst case. An index with query time O(m+j+occ) using space O (sigma(k2) n log(k) log n), where k is the maximum number of wildcards allowed in the pattern. This is the first non-trivial bound with this query time. A time-space trade-off, generalizing the index by Cole et al. (in Proc. 36th STOC, pp. 91-100, [2004]). We also show that these indexes can be generalized to allow variable length gaps in the pattern. Our results are obtained using a novel combination of well-known and new techniques, which could be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "String Indexing for Patterns with Wildcards", "paper_id": "WOS:000336928800002"}
