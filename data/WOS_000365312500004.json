The architecture of the imager is thoroughly described with emphasis on the characterization of the TDCs array. It is targeted for 3D image reconstruction. Several techniques as fast quenching/recharge circuit with tunable dead-time and time gated-operation are applied to reduce the noise and the power consumption. The chip was fabricated in a 0.18 mu m standard CMOS process and implements a double functionality: time-of-flight (ToF) estimation and photon counting. The imager features a programmable time resolution of the array of TDCs down to 145 ps. The measured accuracy of the minimum time bin is lower than +/- 1LSB DNL and +/- 1.7 LSB INL. The TDC jitter over the full dynamic range is less than 1 LSB.", "paper_title": "A CMOS Imager for Time-of-Flight and Photon Counting Based on Single Photon Avalanche Diodes and In-Pixel Time-to-Digital Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000365312500004"}
