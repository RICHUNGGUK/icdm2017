The methodology used in most of the evaluations assumes that the clustering algorithms work correctly. We propose an alternative methodology that does not make this often false assumption. We compared 7 internal cluster validity indices with both methodologies and concluded that the results obtained with the proposed methodology are more representative of the actual capabilities of the compared indices.
