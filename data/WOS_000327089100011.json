In particular, large network infrastructures are now widely recognized to play a fundamental role in the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, significantly affecting the environmental sustainability of new evolutions in network architectures as well as technological developments in communication devices. In this paper, a novel eco-sustainable routing and wavelength assignment algorithm, based on shortest path routing with an adaptive link weighting function relying on an extension of the OSPF-TE protocol to convey carbon footprint information, has been proposed to decrease the network ecological impact while balancing the traffic load and maintaining acceptable connection-blocking rate. The trade-off between load balancing and carbon footprint is also analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy within the context of a real world network.", "paper_title": "Eco-sustainable routing in optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327089100011"}
