Jerrum and Sinclair have shown that there is a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for the class of graphic matroids. On the other hand, the authors have previously shown, subject to a complexity-theoretic assumption, that there is no FPRAS for the class of binary matroids, which is a proper superset of the class of graphic matroids. In order to map out the region where approximation is feasible, we focus on the class of regular matroids, an important class of matroids which properly includes the class of graphic matroids and is properly included in the class of binary matroids. Using Seymour's decomposition theorem, we give an FPRAS for the class of regular matroids.", "paper_title": "A POLYNOMIAL-TIME ALGORITHM FOR ESTIMATING THE PARTITION FUNCTION OF THE FERROMAGNETIC ISING MODEL ON A REGULAR MATROID", "paper_id": "WOS:000323888700014"}
