In this method, an improved image segmentation technique derived from an image histogram was developed. The accuracy of the segmentation was compared with the Otsu, Rosin, and Canny-hysteresis techniques. It was shown that the proposed method is more robust and accurate in detecting edges, resulting in a sensitivity of consistently more than 17.1%, with a standard deviation of less than 0.087, and a figure of merit (FOM) greater than 0.787 for all images tested in this study.
