In contrast to recent studies that examine which types of visual information make visualizations memorable, we examine the effect of different visualizations on time and accuracy of recall of the displayed data, minutes and days after interaction with the visualizations. In particular, we describe the results of an evaluation comparing the memorability of two different visualizations of the same relational data: node-link diagrams and map-based visualization. We find significant differences in the accuracy of the tasks performed, and these differences persist days after the original exposure to the visualizations. Specifically, participants in the study recalled the data better when exposed to map-based visualizations as opposed to node-link diagrams. We discuss the scope of the study and its limitations, possible implications, and future directions.", "paper_title": "Map-based Visualizations Increase Recall Accuracy of Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000358328200047"}
