Regarding the first issue, we provide, under standard necessary conditions, two types of solutions for arbitrary small bound on the control and large (constant) delay. The first solution is based on the knowledge of a static stabilizing feedback in the zero-delay case and the second solution is of nested saturation type, which extends results of [2]. For the finite-gain L-p-stabilization issue, we assume that the system is neutrally stable. We show the existence of a linear feedback such that, for arbitrary small bound on the control and large (constant) delay, finite gain L-p-stability holds with respect to every L-p-norm, p is an element of [1, infinity]. Moreover, we provide upper bounds for the corresponding L-p-gains which are delay-independent.", "paper_title": "Stabilization and finite-gain stabilizability of delay linear systems subject to input saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000244619700020"}
