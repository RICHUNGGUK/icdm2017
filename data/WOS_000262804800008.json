There are clearly a new set of challenges emerging for teaching practitioners that will have implications upon not just what is learned but importantly upon lesson planning. This paper explores these changes to teaching through a consideration of an exploratory learning model which allows practitioners to rethink how they teach in 3D and immersive spaces where learning sequences and experiences are choreographed to support peer interactions and exchanges. The ELM extends from Kolb's experiential learning model to adapt the use of 3D applications, and provides examples from research and development projects to exemplify how the model works in practice. Teaching in these contexts provides less emphasis upon curriculum and more emphasis upon sequencing learning experiences, meta-reflection, peer assessment and group work. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
