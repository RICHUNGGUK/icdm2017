Existing priority-computing schemes cannot satisfy the dynamic requirements of supporting multiple services in future wireless communication systems, because the currently used factors, mainly user priority, are relatively simple and lack relevancy. To solve this problem and provide the desired complexity, dynamic behavior, and fairness features of 3G and beyond 3G mobile communication systems, this paper proposes a novel cross-layer dynamic integrated priority-computing scheme that computes the priority based on a variety of factors, including quality of service requirements, subscriber call types, waiting time, movement mode, and traffic load from the corresponding layers. It is observed from simulation results that the proposed dynamic integrated priority scheme provides enhanced performance.", "paper_title": "A Novel Cross-Layer Dynamic Integrated Priority-Computing Scheme for 3G+Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000301401500003"}
