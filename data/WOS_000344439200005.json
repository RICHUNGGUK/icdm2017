The adoption of a sound software architecture provides crucial aid in conveniently apportioning the relevant development concerns. This paper takes a software-centered interpretation of the ISO 42010 notion of architecture, enhancing it with a component model that attributes separate concerns to distinct design views. The component boundary becomes the border between functional and extrafunctional concerns. The latter are treated as decorations placed on the outside of components, satisfied by implementation artifacts separate from and composable with the implementation of the component internals. The approach was evaluated by industrial users from several domains, with remarkably positive results. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
