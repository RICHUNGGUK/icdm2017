It covers a plethora of potentially rich meme-inspired computing methodologies, frameworks and operational algorithms including simple hybrids, adaptive hybrids and memetic automaton. In this paper, a comprehensive multi-facet survey of recent research in memetic computation is presented.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Facet Survey on Memetic Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296011700002"}
