However, it remains a great challenge to construct an efficient overlay network for peer-to-peer video-on-demand systems owing to their inherent dynamicity caused by frequent VCR operations or joining/leaving operations. In this paper, we propose a ring based overlay network to handle this problem, called RINDY, in which each peer maintains a gossip-ring to explore appropriate data suppliers and several skip-rings with power law radius to assist the quick relocation of VCR operations. Our simulation results show that RINDY achieves better load balance in the control overhead than tree based overlay. As compared with the traditional client/server model, it saves more server bandwidth and achieves lower start-up latency when lots of users watch a same video simultaneously.", "paper_title": "RINDY: A ring based overlay network for peer-to-peer on-demand streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600106"}
