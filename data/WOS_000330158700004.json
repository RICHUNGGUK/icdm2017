This paper presents an intelligent system MoCCAS (a monolithic construction computer aided system), which is a comprehensive decision support tool for flexible construction site management in repetitive projects. MoCCAS aids the construction site manager in developing optimal and attainable execution scenarios by providing contextualized variants of construction strategies. The discussion is centered on the modeling procedures of repetitive processes with the special focus on the synchronization of resources and workflow continuity, which is crucial in scheduling and managing repetitive projects. The paper introduces an innovative conceptualization of the construction process and presents a dynamic three-dimensional construction process model in a temporal perspective. How the system synchronizes the work of resources combined into a balanced production sets and also supports the decision maker in creating what-if scenarios in designing execution strategies is discussed.
