Computer science and information science, as holistic fields, have, respectively, played important roles in computerization and informatization. Similarly, it is necessary for there to be a corresponding field for cyberization. Cybermatics is proposed as such a holistic field for the systematic study of cyber entities in cyberspace and cyber world, and their properties, functions, and conjugations with entities in conventional spaces/worlds. This paper sets out to explain the necessity and rationale for, and significance of, the proposed field of Cybermatics, what it is and what it encompasses, and how it is related to other fields and areas.", "paper_title": "Cybermatics: A Holistic Field for Systematic Study of Cyber-Enabled New Worlds", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200173"}
