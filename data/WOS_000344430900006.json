To better enable this, description of both needs and resources, using a common domain language is required. Using techniques from social network analysis (SNA) this paper describes a SENSUS-based methodology which generates domain ontology that can provide the breadth and depth of coverage required for automated need and resource matching systems. The mechanism described also enriches the semantic relationships in the generated ontology to form a network structure. This enables concept investigation to be undertaken from multiple perspectives, with fuzzy matching and enhanced reasoning through directional weight-specified relationships. The methodology was used to derive an ontology for engineering and tested against a traditionally derived and structured ontology. The methodology has the flexibility and utility to be of benefit in a wide range need and resource matching business applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
