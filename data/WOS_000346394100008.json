Digital watermarking offers a method for authentication and copyright protection. We propose a blind, still image, Genetic Programming (GP) based robust watermark scheme for copyright protection. In this scheme, pseudorandom sequence of real number is used as watermark. It is embedded into perceptually significant blocks of vertical and horizontal sub-band in wavelet domain to achieve robustness. GP is used to structure the watermark for improved imperceptibility by considering the Human Visual System (HVS) characteristics such as luminance sensitivity and self and neighbourhood contrast masking. We also present a GP function which determines the optimal watermark strength for selected coefficients irrespective of the block size. Watermark detection is performed using correlation. Our experiments show that in proposed scheme the watermark resists image processing attack, noise attack, geometric attack and cascading attack We compare our proposed technique with other two genetic perceptual model based techniques. Comparison results show that our multiblock based technique is approximately 5%, and 23% more robust, then the other two compared techniques.", "paper_title": "Multi Block based Image Watermarking in Wavelet Domain Using Genetic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000346394100008"}
