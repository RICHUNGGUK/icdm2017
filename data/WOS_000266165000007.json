The DFT minimization of the macrolactone ring reveals four low energy conformers, although MP2 predicted five stable structures. The model tested with DFT hybride functional (B3LYP/6-31+G(d, p)) exhibits the global minimum for one of the exo forms (C), experimentally observed in the solid state, but unexpectedly with the MP2 electron correlation method for the virtual endo form (W). Using the QST3 technique, several pathways were found for the conversion of the low energy conformers to the other low energy exo representatives, as well as within the endo analog subset. The potential energy relationships obtained for several exo forms suggest a high conformational mobility between three, experimentally observed, conformers. The high rotational barrier, however, excludes direct equilibrium with experimental EC-derived endo form S. The highest calculated transition state for the conversion of the most stable exo M interligand to the endo S form is approximately a 28 kcal/mol above the energy of the former. The two-step interconversion of the exo H conformer to the endo S requires at least 28 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, we found that the transition state energy of the H form to the virtual endo W has the acceptable value of about 9 kcal/mol and the next energy barrier for free interconversion of endo W to endo S is 13 kcal/mol.", "paper_title": "De(side chain) model of epothilone: bioconformer interconversions DFT study", "paper_id": "WOS:000266165000007"}
