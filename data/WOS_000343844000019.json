(2012) in Computers & Education. Learning retention, learning achievement, and learning satisfaction associated with two sets of course materials were compared in this quasi-experimental study. In total, 114 students from two classes at one private university in Taiwan participated in this 6-week teaching experiment. Analytical results indicate that learning achievement, learning satisfaction, and learning retention of the MAMCM group were better than those of the MCM group. Pedagogical implications and suggestions are given. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
