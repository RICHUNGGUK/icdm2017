The developed system consists of two main parts. Firstly, the localization of the region containing the optic disc is performed by means of a clustering algorithm. Then, in order to extract the optic disc, the fuzzy circular Hough transform is applied to the edges of the region. The optic disc might not be extracted since there are vessels in the inside of the optic disc. To avoid this, a crease extraction algorithm is applied to the retinal image. The vessels are extracted and the vessel edge points contained in the edge image are removed. The final system was tested by ophthalmologists. The localization of the region of interest is correct in 100% of the cases and the extraction of the optic disc is obtained in 98% of the cases.", "paper_title": "Localization and extraction of the optic disc using the fuzzy circular Hough transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000074"}
