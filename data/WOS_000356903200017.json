Graphical representations facilitate visualization of biological sequences and produce biologically useful numerical descriptors. In this paper, we propose a novel cylindrical representation by placing the 20 amino acid residue types in a circle and sequence positions along the z axis. This representation allows visualization of the composition and sequence order of amino acids at the same time. Ten numerical descriptors and one weighted numerical descriptor have been developed to quantitatively describe intrinsic properties of protein sequences on the basis of the cylindrical model. Their applications to similarity/dissimilarity analysis of nine ND5 proteins indicated that these numerical descriptors are more effective than several classical numerical matrices. Thus, the cylindrical representation obtained here provides a new useful tool for visualizing and charactering protein sequences.
