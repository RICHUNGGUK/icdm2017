In contrast, we show that packing a maximum number of independent (that is, disjoint and nonadjacent) triangles is polynomial-time solvable for many classes of structured graphs, including weakly chordal graphs, asteroidal triple-free graphs, polygon-circle graphs, and interval-filament graphs. These classes contain other well-known classes such as chordal graphs, cocomparability graphs, circle graphs, circular-arc graphs, and outerplanar graphs. Our results apply more generally to independent packings by members of any family of connected graphs.", "paper_title": "Independent packings in structured graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000233867100004"}
