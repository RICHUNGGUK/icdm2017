Acritical factor in the acceptance of WBANs is providing appropriate security and privacy protection of the wireless communication. This paper first describes a general health care platform and pinpoints the security challenges and requirements. Further it proposes and analyzes the CICADA-S protocol, a secure cross-layer protocol for WBANs. It is an extension of CICADA, which is a cross-layer protocol that handles both medium access and the routing of data in WBANs. The CICADA-S protocol is the first integrated solution that copes with threats that occur in this mobile medical monitoring scenario. It is shown that the integration of key management and secure, privacy preserving Communication techniques within the CICADA-S protocol has low impact on the power consumption and throughput.", "paper_title": "A Secure Low-Delay Protocol for Wireless Body Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000271139100004"}
