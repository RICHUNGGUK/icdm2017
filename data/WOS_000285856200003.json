The most significant differences are underlined and their impact is discussed further.When compared to uniform liquid distribution, the more complicated flow conditions in liquid source measurements are considered to have a significant effect on result analysis and should be paid more attention to. Modeling of mechanical dispersion of liquid using CFD is discussed. Finally, liquid source dispersion cases are simulated and the results are compared to the experimental liquid as well as tracer dispersion results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
