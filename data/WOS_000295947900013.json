Unlike text-based web documents, many of the large scientific datasets often contain binary encoded data that is hard to discover using popular search engines. In the atmospheric sciences, there has been a significant growth in public data hosting services. However, the ability to index and search has been limited by the metadata provided by the data host. We have developed an infrastructure - Atmospheric Data Discovery System (ADDS) - that provides an efficient data discovery environment for observational datasets in the atmospheric sciences. To support complex querying capabilities, we automatically extract and index fine-grained metadata. Datasets are indexed based on periodic crawling of popular sites and also of files requested by the users. Users are allowed to access subsets of a large dataset through our data customization feature. Our focus is the overall architecture, data subsetting scheme, and a performance evaluation of our system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
