A mechanical improvement scheme is proposed. An easy handle, powerful and computer aided software system including the closed-loop control algorithm is developed for solving the shortcomings that are existed in the manual operation. The modeling of underwater robot plays an important role in the closed-loop control design. The hydrodynamic derivatives are estimated by the experiment based on the decoupled motions in different directions. A new self-tuning PID algorithm is proposed for the controller design. The experimental results in different environment demonstrate the performance.", "paper_title": "MODELING, DESIGN AND EXPERIMENT OF IMPROVED SUPER-MINI UNDERWATER ROBOT", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600008"}
