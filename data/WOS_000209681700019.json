The key is how to multiplex as many possible machines of different periods onto a single channel. A novel tree structure is proposed to characterize the conditions of multiplexing. Then, a persistent resource-allocation algorithm is proposed, which allocates resource to machines based on the tree. Simulation results show that the number of channels needed by the proposed tree-based resource-allocation method is close to the theoretical lower bound.", "paper_title": "Tree-Based Resource Allocation for Periodic Cellular M2M Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700019"}
