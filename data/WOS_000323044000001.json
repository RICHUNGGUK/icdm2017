In this method, sensors use Turbo Product Code (TPC) to transmit decisions to the fusion center. TPC can reduce bit error probability if communication channel errors exist. Moreover, in this method, thresholds for the energy-based target localization are designed using a heuristic method. This design method to find thresholds is suitable for uniformly distributed sensors and normally distributed targets. Furthermore, to save sensor energy, a sensor selection method is also presented. Simulation results showed that if sensors used TPC instead of Hamming code to transmit decisions to the fusion center, localization performance could be improved. Furthermore, the sensor selection method used can substantially reduce energy consumption for our target localization method. At the same time, this target localization method with selected sensors also provides satisfactory localization performance.", "paper_title": "Target Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks for Industrial Control with Selected Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000323044000001"}
