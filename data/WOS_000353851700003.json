We first describe a polynomial time procedure which, given a visibly pushdown automaton that accepts only well-nested words, returns an equivalent visibly pushdown automaton that is trimmed. We then show how this procedure can be lifted to the setting of arbitrary VPA. Furthermore, we present a way of building, given a VPA, an equivalent VPA which is both deterministic and trimmed. Last, our trimming procedures can be applied to weighted VPA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Trimming visibly pushdown automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000353851700003"}
