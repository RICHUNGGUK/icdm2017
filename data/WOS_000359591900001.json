Nanoscale devices are able to be included with Internet. This new communication paradigm, referred to as Internet of Nanothings (IoNT), demands very short-range connections among nanoscale devices. IoNT raises many challenges to realize it. Current network protocols and techniques may not be directly applied to communicate with nanosensors. Due to the very limited capability of nanodevices, the devices must have simple communication and simple medium sharing mechanism in order to collect the data effectively from nanosensors. Moreover, nanosensors may be deployed at organs of the human body, and they may produce large data. In this process, the data transmission from nanosensors to gateway should be controlled from the energy efficiency point of view. In this paper, we propose a wireless nanosensor network (WNSN) at the nanoscale that would be useful for intrabody disease detection. The proposed conceptual network model is based on On-Off Keying (OOK) protocol and TDMA framework. The model assumes hexagonal cell-based nanosensors deployed in cylindrical shape 3D hexagonal pole. We also present in this paper the analysis of the data transmission efficiency, for the various combinations of transmission methods, exploiting hybrid, direct, and multi-hop methods.", "paper_title": "Design of Wireless Nanosensor Networks for Intrabody Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000359591900001"}
