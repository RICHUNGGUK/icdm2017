The bridge is modeled as a mass-spring system, which is a weakly damped and driven harmonic oscillator. Both the bridge and the pedestrians walking on the bridge are affected by the movement of each other. The crowd acts according to local behavioral rules. Each pedestrian is provided with a kinematic walking system. We extend a current mathematical model of crowd synchronization on footbridges to include human walking model and crowd simulation techniques. We run experiments to evaluate the influence of these extensions on synchronization.", "paper_title": "Visualization of crowd synchronization on footbridges", "paper_id": "WOS:000274300000011"}
