The designer traces regions of interest in an image and annotates the regions with style parameters. They can optionally specify a solution path, which provides a rough guide for laying out the maze's actual solution. The system uses novel extensions to well-known maze construction algorithms to build mazes that approximate the tone of the source image, express the desired style in each region, and conform to the user's solution path.", "paper_title": "Image-guided maze construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000248914000032"}
