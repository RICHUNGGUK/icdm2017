However, the deployment of such networks is hindered by the vulnerabilities that these networks are exposed to. Securing communications while exploiting the flexibilities offered by cognitive radios still remains a daunting challenge. In this survey, we put forward the security concerns and the vulnerabilities that threaten to plague the deployment of cognitive radio networks. We classify various types of vulnerabilities and provide an overview of the research challenges. We also discuss the various techniques that have been devised and analyze the research developments accomplished in this area. Finally, we discuss the open research challenges that must be addressed if cognitive radio networks were to become a commercially viable technology. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
