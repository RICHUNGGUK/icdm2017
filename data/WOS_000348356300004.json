With an appropriate grouping scheme, the proposed STF code is shown to obtain a similar diversity gain as that of the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, namely the full-dimensional sphere decoding, but with a low complexity. It seems as an intermediate decoding approach between the ML decoding and the zero-forcing (ZF) decoding. The present grouping design criterion for the PIC group decoding that provides full diversity with orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is also an intermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of codewords and the strongest ZF linear independence of column vectors of the equivalent frequency-selective channel matrix. Simulation results show that the proposed PIC group decoding scheme can well address the rate-performance-complexity tradeoff of the multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) wireless communication system.", "paper_title": "On high-rate full-diversity space-time-frequency code with partial interference cancelation group decoding for frequency-selective channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000348356300004"}
