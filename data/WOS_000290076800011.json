It first estimates the probability density function (pdf) of color components of an image frame. Two hill-climbing schemes, which employ two-dimensional pdf and one-dimensional pdf, respectively, are proposed for clustering. Next, a novel algorithm that utilizes the domain knowledge of sport playfields is developed to merge those clusters into four color classes: red, green, blue, and gray. Finally, a simple scheme fuses small regions into their adjacent large regions to obtain the segmentation result. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method effectively segments the playfield regions of various sport videos. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
