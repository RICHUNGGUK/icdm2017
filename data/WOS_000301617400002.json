The unsteadiness in the flow and temperature fields is caused by the continuously non-linearly stretching vertical slender cylinder. The governing boundary layer equations are transformed into a non-dimensional form by a group of non-similar transformations. The resulting system of coupled non-linear partial differential equations is solved by an implicit finite difference scheme in combination with the quasi-linearization technique. Numerical computations are performed to understand the physical situations of linear and non-linearly stretching surface for different values of parameters to display the velocity and temperature profiles graphically. The obtained results show that the buoyancy parameter). and the Prandtl number Pr enhance the skin friction coefficient and the local Nusselt number. It is also shown that the suction parameter A (>0) is to decrease the velocity and temperature profiles, but injection parameter A (<0) does the reverse. Results are compared with previously published work and are found to be in excellent agreement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
