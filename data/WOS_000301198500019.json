Identification of failure profile based on failure-time data collected in the production phase of a system can help pinpoint the bottleneck problems, and provide valuable information for system design evaluation and maintenance management. Major challenges of effective failure profile identification come from time-varying and limited failure-time data. In this paper, the failure profile is estimated by using the maximum likelihood method. In addition, statistical hypothesis testing procedures are proposed to inspect the existence of a dominating failure mode, and possible changes of failure profiles during a production period. The developed methods are illustrated with an automation system of a high throughput screening (HTS) process, and a production process for cylinder heads.", "paper_title": "Failure Profile Analysis of Complex Repairable Systems With Multiple Failure Modes", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198500019"}
