These fibers follow local load sharing with uniformly distributed threshold strengths of the fibers. We have studied the critical behavior of the model numerically using a finite size scaling method and the mean field critical behavior is established. The avalanche size distribution is also found to exhibit a mean field nature in the asymptotic limit.", "paper_title": "Fibers on a graph with local load sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000251548700001"}
