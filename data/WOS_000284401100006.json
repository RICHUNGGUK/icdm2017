This paper proposes a system which combines social web content and semantic web technology to process the emergent knowledge from the blogosphere. The proposed system regards blog postings as experiences of people on particular topics. By annotating postings in the selected domains with ontology vocabularies, the system collects experiences from various people into an ontology about people and experiences. The system processes this ontology with semantic rules to find the emergent knowledge. Users can access previously unavailable facts, concepts and trends which are emerging from social web content by using the proposed system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
