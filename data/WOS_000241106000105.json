On basis of constructing the attitude model of mass moment missile with three moving masses, the coupled influence to this system is described which is caused by the relative movement between the moving masses and the cartridge case. Then an attitude control law based on fuzzy logic is presented for the mass moment missile and the fuzzy rule tables corresponding to the moving mass position in respective axial are constituted. According to analysis of the relation between angular acceleration and searching condition, three moving mass positions are regulated in phase. Simulation results show that the system stabilization can be satisfied to realize efficiently attitude adjustment for missile.", "paper_title": "Research on attitude law of mass moment missile", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000105"}
