However, the ligand-based method often strongly depends on the training set selection, and the structure-based pharmacophore model is usually created based on apo structures or a single protein-ligand complex, which might miss some important information. In this study, multicomplex-based method has been suggested to generate a comprehensive pharmacophore map of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) based on a collection of 124 crystal structures of human CDK2-inhibitor complex. Our multicomplex-based comprehensive pharmacophore map contains almost all the chemical features important for CDK2-inhibitor interactions. A comparison with previously reported ligand-based pharmacophores; has revealed that the ligand-based models are just a subset of our comprehensive map. Furthermore, one most-frequent-feature pharmacophore model consisting of the most frequent pharmacophore features was constructed based on the statistical frequency information provided by the comprehensive map. Validations to the most-frequent-feature model show that it can not only successfully discriminate between known CDK2 inhibitors and the molecules of focused inactive dataset, but also is capable of correctly predicting the activities of a wide variety of CDK2 inhibitors in an external active dataset. Obviously, this investigation provides some new ideas about how to develop a multicomplex-based pharmacophore model that can be used in virtual screening to discover novel potential lead compounds.
