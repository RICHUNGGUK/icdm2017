An efficient web framework improves the quality of multi-tier systems and productivity in the development in distributed computing environments. We provide a framework approach with Java for 3-tiers (Client/Web, Business/EIS), which allows transporting, transforming, or integrating data through the systems using structured-information based on textual format of XML. In the framework for 3-tiers system development with Java, XML is used as a mediator for application data communication as well as a descriptor for configuration. The framework in this paper simplifies workflow and reduces time and effort to develop the systems. We analyze and compare workflows of the framework and productivities in terms of lines of code and effort (man-months) needed to develop a system with identical functions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
