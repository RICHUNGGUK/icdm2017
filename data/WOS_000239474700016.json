The running times of those algorithms are O(1.4173(n)) for chordal graphs, O(1.4956(n)) for circle graphs, and O(1.2303((1+root 1-2c)n)) for c-dense graphs.", "paper_title": "Exponential time algorithms for the minimum dominating set problem on some graph classes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474700016"}
