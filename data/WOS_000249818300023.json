Remarkably, there is no available bioinformatics tool specifically devoted to Marey map approach. Here, we developed such a tool called MareyMap based on GNU R and Tcl/Tk. MareyMap offers a user-friendly graphical interface and includes useful features, such as data cleaning process, sophisticated interpolation methods to estimate local rates, possibility of complex queries, various range of import export files. Moreover, MareyMap comes with ready-to-use maps for human, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis. MareyMap has been made so that it can be easily upgraded with new data and interpolation methods.
