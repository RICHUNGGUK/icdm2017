In this paper, an adaptive routing protocol is developed and analyzed which minimizes the energy cost per bit of information by using the channel information to choose the best strategy to route data. In this approach, the source node will switch between direct and relayed communication based on the quality of the link and will use the relay only if the channel quality is below a certain threshold. The mathematical model is then validated through simulations which shows that the adaptive routing strategy can improve energy efficiency significantly compared with existing methods.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Routing for Dynamic On-Body Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351091200018"}
