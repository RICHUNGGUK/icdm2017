The system does not rely on a priori knowledge of the scene structure and focuses on detecting special points, such as T-junctions and highly convex contours, to infer the depth relationships between objects in the scene. The system makes extensive use of the binary partition tree as hierarchical region-based image representation jointly with a new approach for candidate T-junction estimation. Since some regions may not involve T-junctions, occlusion is also detected by examining convex shapes on region boundaries. Combining T-junctions and convexity leads to a system which only relies on low level depth cues and does not rely on semantic information. However, it shows a similar or better performance with the state-of-the-art while not assuming any type of scene. As an extension of the automatic depth ordering system, a semi-automatic approach is also proposed. If the user provides the depth order for a subset of regions in the image, the system is able to easily integrate this user information to the final depth order for the complete image. For some applications, user interaction can naturally be integrated, improving the quality of the automatically generated depth map.", "paper_title": "Monocular Depth Ordering Using T-Junctions and Convexity Occlusion Cues", "paper_id": "WOS:000318476800019"}
