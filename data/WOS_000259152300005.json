Although most researches adopted a polling algorithm to achieve good bandwidth utilization in each transmission cycle, they could not make use of the idle period between cycles more effectively and reduce the redundant overhead of REPORT messages under heavy traffic load. Therefore, an adaptive DBA algorithm based on the statuses of all ONU REPORT messages to effectively eliminate the idle time is proposed. It is able to fully utilize the idle time between cycles as long as at least one ONU requests a long enough transmission window; or compensate for the idle time by transmitting all REPORT messages before data when no ONU request long enough. Besides, the proposed algorithm also includes a queue management scheme, which improves the efficiency further by decreasing the number of REPORT messages when the ONU queues are long. Event-driven simulations show that adaptive DBA can significantly improve network performance in terms of packet delay, average queue length and throughput, as compared with the well-known IPACT and DBA2 algorithms.", "paper_title": "Adaptive DBA: An algorithm for epon based on all ONU REPORT messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300005"}
