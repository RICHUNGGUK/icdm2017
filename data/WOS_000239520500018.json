In this paper, we present techniques that support the exploration of the quality properties of component-based architectures deployed on multiprocessor platforms. Special attention is paid to real-time properties and efficiency of resource use. The main steps of the process are (1) a simple way of modelling properties of software and hardware components, (2) from the component properties, a model of an execution architecture is composed and analyzed for system-level quality attributes, (3) for the composed system, selected execution scenarios are evaluated, (4) Pareto curves are used for making design trade-offs explicit. The process has been applied to several industrial systems. A Car Radio Navigation system is used to illustrate the-method. For this system, we consider architectural alternatives, show their specification, and present their trade-off with respect to cost, performance and robustness.", "paper_title": "A process for resolving performance trade-offs in component-based architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000239520500018"}
