This aggressive approach improves performance as it results in early identification of target addresses. However, unfortunately, such accesses, quite often, are unnecessary as there is no control flow instruction among those fetched. In this work, we introduce speculative BTB access to address this design inefficiency. Our technique relies on a simple power efficient structure, referred to as the BLC-filter, to identify cycles where there is no control flow instruction among those fetched, at least one cycle in advance. By identifying such cycles and eliminating unnecessary BTB accesses we reduce BTB power dissipation (and therefore power density). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
