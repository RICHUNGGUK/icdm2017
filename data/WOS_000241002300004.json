A so-called guided formation control scheme based on a guided path following approach is developed by combining guidance laws with synchronization algorithms and collision avoidance techniques. The result is collision-free formation assembly and path following, inspired by the helmsman behavior of human pilots. All regularly parametrized paths are rendered feasible, and geometric constraints of formation control problems are illustrated. Finally, a simulation is employed to display transient behavior.", "paper_title": "Kinematic aspects of guided formation control in 2D", "paper_id": "WOS:000241002300004"}
