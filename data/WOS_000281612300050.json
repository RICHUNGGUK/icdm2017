Based on Lyapunov synthesis, the proposed control mechanisms use the advantage of LS-SVM combined with on-line parameters estimation strategy in order to have an efficient approximation. Under the controller designed, we can ensure that the outputs of the system track the given bounded reference signals within a small neighborhood of zero, and guarantee semi-global uniform boundedness of all the closed loop signals. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
