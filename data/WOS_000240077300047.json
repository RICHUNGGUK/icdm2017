The selected-internal Steiner tree problem is to find a selected-internal Steiner tree with the minimum cost. In this paper, we show that the problem is MAX SNP-hard even when the costs of all edges in the input graph are restricted to either 1 or 2. We also present an approximation algorithm for the problem.", "paper_title": "MAX-SNP hardness and approximation of selected-internal steiner trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300047"}
