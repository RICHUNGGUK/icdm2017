By utilizing the Lyapunov functional method combined with the inequality techniques, a sufficient condition is given to ensure that the proposed network model is synchronized. In addition, when the external disturbances appear in the network, a criterion is obtained to guarantee the H-infinity synchronization of the network. Moreover, some adaptive strategies to tune the coupling strengths among network nodes are designed for reaching synchronization and H-infinity synchronization. Some criteria for synchronization and H-infinity synchronization are derived by using the designed adaptive laws. Numerical simulations are presented finally", "paper_title": "Synchronization and Adaptive Control of an Array of Linearly Coupled Reaction-Diffusion Neural Networks With Hybrid Coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000342226900009"}
