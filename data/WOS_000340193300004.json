Appropriate tools to edit volume properties are missing, which can make it necessary to use simulation results directly. Alternatively, high-level modifications that are rarely intuitive, e. g., the tweaking of noise function parameters, can be utilized. Our work introduces a solution to stylize single-scattering volumetric effects in static volumes. Hereby, an artistic and intuitive control of emission, scattering and extinction becomes possible, while ensuring a smooth and coherent appearance when changing the viewpoint. Our method is based on tomographic reconstruction, which we link to the volumetric rendering equation. It analyzes a number of target views provided by the artist and adapts the volume properties to match the appearance for the given perspectives. Additionally, we describe how we can optimize for the environmental lighting to match a desired scene appearance, while keeping volume properties constant. Finally, both techniques can be combined. We demonstrate several use cases of our approach and illustrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Property and Lighting Manipulations for Static Volume Stylization Using a Painting Metaphor", "paper_id": "WOS:000340193300004"}
