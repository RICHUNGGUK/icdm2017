The dynamic analysis in the paper employs results from the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side as introduced by Filippov, and some new conditions concerning global exponential stability are obtained. In addition, these conditions do not require the activation functions to be differentiable, the connection weight matrices to be symmetric and the delay functions to be differentiable, our results are mild and more general. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
