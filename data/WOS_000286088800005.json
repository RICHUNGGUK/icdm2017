Reports indicate that efficiency and availability are heavily dependant upon high reliability and maintainability. Recently, the concept of e-maintenance has been introduced to reduce the cost of maintenance. In e-maintenance systems, the intelligent fault detection system plays a crucial role for identifying failures. Data mining techniques are at the core of such intelligent systems and can greatly influence their performance. Applying these techniques to fault detection makes it possible to shorten shutdown maintenance and thus increase the capacity utilization rates of equipment. Therefore, this work proposes a support vector machines (SVM) based model which integrates a dimension reduction scheme to analyze the failures of turbines in thermal power facilities. Finally, a real case from a thermal power plant is provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SVM based model. Experimental results show that SVM outperforms linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and back-propagation neural networks (BPN) in classification performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
