In this paper, we propose a metadata extension that uses the scenarios as semantic aspect, describing the expected interaction sequence based on XML Schema. With such constraints, resource waste and further damages can be avoided by preventing the illegal interactions at runtime. This extension is more valid and user-friendly than the majority of the existing proposals, avoiding the potential inconsistency. A prototype has been developed to illustrate the applicability of the extended metadata. The experiments demonstrate that the prototype introduces an average overhead ratio of 6.4% in the inter-process interactions and only 0.27% in the remote interactions. The approach presented in this paper is suitable for the adaptive distributed systems and affords more guarantee of reliability. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
