A variables sampling plan to determine the acceptability of a lot of products based on the lifetime of the products is called reliability acceptance sampling plan (RASP). This work considers the determination of optimum RASP under cost constraint in the framework of hybrid censoring. Weibull lifetime models are considered for illustrations; however, the proposed methodology can be easily extended to any location-scale family of distributions. The proposed method is based on asymptotic results of the estimators of parameters of lifetime distribution. Hence, a Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted in order to show that the sampling plans meet the specified risks for finite sample size. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
