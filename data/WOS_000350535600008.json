A novel Dijkstra-like method generalizing Dijkstra's algorithm to this biobjective case is proposed. The algorithm runs in O(N(m+n log n)) time to solve one-to-one and one-to-all biobjective shortest path problems determining all extreme supported non-dominated points in the outcome space and one supported efficient path associated with each one of them. Here n is the number of nodes, m is the number of arcs and N is the number of extreme supported points in outcome space for the one-to-all biobjective shortest path problem. The memory space required by the algorithm is O(n+m) for the one-to-one problem and O(N+m) for the one-to-all problem. A computational experiment comparing the performance of the proposed methods and state-of-the-art methods is included. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
