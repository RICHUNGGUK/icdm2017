One of its current limitations is the computational complexity of the problems of interest. This research presents methods for mapping genetic linkage problems as Bayesian networks and then addresses novel techniques for making the problems more tractable. The result is a new tool for solving these problems called RC Link, which in many cases is orders of magnitude faster than existing tools. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
