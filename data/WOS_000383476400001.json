In this context, it is imperative for organizations to continuously monitor their performance and adjust when there is a need or an opportunity to do so. The cluster of technologies that delivers this monitoring capability is called business intelligence (BI), and over the years it has come to play a central role in business operations and governance. Unfortunately, there is a huge cognitive gap between a requirements view of a strategic initiative articulated in terms of business goals, processes, and performance on one hand, and an implementation view of BI monitoring articulated in terms of databases, networks, and computational processing. In this paper, we present a model-based performance management framework for managing strategic initiatives across their complete lifecycle of analysis, modeling, implementation, and evaluation to bridge this cognitive gap. We demonstrate its usefulness through a case study at a major teaching hospital, which is implementing a strategic initiative to reduce antibiotic-resistant infections.", "paper_title": "Model-Based Management of Strategic Initiatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000383476400001"}
