To overcome the shortcomings of FM in stand-alone Ansys, a collaborative computing system over multiple virtual machines (CCSMVM) is proposed to convert stand-alone Ansys into multi-machines. We present the architecture and workflow of CCSMVM, and then focus on key technologies of task construction and scheduling. A FEA application related to FPBS is developed to verify the prototype of CCSMVM integrated Ansys. The experiments show that: (1) the feasibility of key technologies has been verified since load balancing among virtual machines is achieved. (2) CCSMVM can complete the tasks in short completion time with high resource unitization. (3) Our task scheduling algorithm can complete the tasks in shorter time than other algorithms. It is concluded that CCSMVM can accelerate the execution of tasks by exchanging the running speed with resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
