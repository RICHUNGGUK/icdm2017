The method is developed for the conformal self-organizing map [10]. The constructed surface is both piecewise smooth and continuous. The mapping between the model surface and the sphere surface is one-to-one and onto. We show experiments in surface reconstruction and texture mapping.", "paper_title": "Smooth seamless surface construction based on conformal self-organizing map", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100113"}
