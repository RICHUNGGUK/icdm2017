We propose going one step beyond the classical wildland fire prediction by linking evolutionary optimization strategies to the traditional scheme with the aim of emulating an \"ideal\" fire propagation model as much as possible. In order to accelerate the fire prediction, this enhanced prediction scheme has been developed in a fashion on a Linux cluster using MPI. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the input parameters that we can fix to their typical values in order to reduce the search-space involved in the optimization process and, therefore, accelerates the whole prediction strategy.", "paper_title": "Between classical and ideal: enhancing wildland fire prediction using cluster computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240903400009"}
