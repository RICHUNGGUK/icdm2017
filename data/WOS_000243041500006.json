We try to convert these conceptual rules into real computational processes, and use them to guide a three-dimensional (3-D) mesh decomposition process in such a way that the significant components can be precisely identified and efficiently extracted from a given 3-D mesh. The proposed decomposition scheme not only identifies the parts' boundaries defined by the minima rule, but also labels each part with a quantitative degree of visual salience during the mesh decomposition process. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is indeed effective and powerful in decomposing a 3-D mesh into its significant components.", "paper_title": "Visual salience-guided mesh decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000243041500006"}
