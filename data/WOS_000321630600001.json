It is very important to know about the location of collected data. This kind of information can be obtained using localization technique in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Localization is a way to determine the location of sensor nodes. Localization of sensor nodes is an interesting research area, and many works have been done so far. It is highly desirable to design low-cost, scalable, and efficient localization mechanisms for WSNs. In this paper, we discuss sensor node architecture and its applications, different localization techniques, and few possible future research directions.", "paper_title": "Localization Techniques in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321630600001"}
