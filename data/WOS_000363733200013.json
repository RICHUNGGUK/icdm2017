However, most MOEAs based on Pareto-dominance handle many-objective problems (MaOPs) poorly due to a high proportion of incomparable and thus mutually nondominated solutions. Recently, a number of many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have been proposed to deal with this scalability issue. In this article, a survey of MaOEAs is reported. According to the key ideas used, MaOEAs are categorized into seven classes: relaxed dominance based, diversity-based, aggregation-based, indicator-based, reference set based, preference-based, and dimensionality reduction approaches. Several future research directions in this field are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000363733200013"}
