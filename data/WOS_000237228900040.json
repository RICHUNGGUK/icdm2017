Firstly, our algorithm samples primitive pairs within the models to construct a discrete binary search space for PSO, and in this way user can balance performance and detection quality. Besides a particle update process is added in every time step to handle the dynamic environments caused by deformations. Our algorithm is also very general that makes no assumptions about the input models and doesn't need to store additional data structures either. In the end, we give the precision and efficiency evaluation about the algorithm and find it might be a reasonable choice for complex deformable models in collision detection systems.", "paper_title": "An adaptive stochastic collision detection between deformable objects using particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900040"}
