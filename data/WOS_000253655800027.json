It is an under-constrained problem, which can be solved based on some constraint. Existing algorithms can be divided into two groups: physics-based algorithms and statistics-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a new hypothesis that the images generated under a same illumination have some similar features. Based on this hypothesis, a novel statistics-based color constancy algorithm is given and a new similarity function between images is also defined. The experimental results show that our algorithm is effective and it is more important that the dimension of the features in our algorithm is much lower than many former statistics-based algorithms.", "paper_title": "Color constancy based on image similarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000253655800027"}
