Many promises have been held, if one is to consider that Google is a living demonstration of AI. This paper presents a historical perspective on Machine Learning, describing how the emphasis was gradually shifted from logical to statistical induction, from induction to optimization, from the search of hypotheses to the search of representations. The paper concludes with a discussion about the new frontier of Machine Learning.", "paper_title": "A tour of machine learning: An AI perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000327552100003"}
