We give approximation algorithms for two variants of the MINIMUM CHAIN COMPLETION problem, where we are given a bipartite graph G(U, V, E), and the goal is find the minimum set of edges F that need to be added to G such that the bipartite graph G' = (U, V, E') (E' = E boolean OR F) is a chain graph.
