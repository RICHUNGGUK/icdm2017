However, these IT PPPs are extremely difficult to realize, especially considering the divergent interests of public-and private-side stake-holders. Our case study of an IT PPP reveals public-and private-side differences that initially impeded the establishment of a partnership; using institutional logics theory as meta-theoretical lens, we propose a model that explains how public and private parties managed to negotiate their mode of collaboration by balancing their competing institutional norms and practices which ultimately resulted in the convergence of the two divergent logics. Our paper contributes to theory and practice by (1) elucidating the theoretical foundations and role of institutional logics for IT project management that we found dominated by public and private norms and practices, (2) explaining why collaboration in IT PPPs is so difficult, and (3) how eventually an IT PPP can be established. We discuss theoretical and practical implications in the paper.", "paper_title": "The Interplay of Institutional Logics in IT Public-Private Partnerships", "paper_id": "WOS:000351748000002"}
