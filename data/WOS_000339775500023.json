Based on the standard Volume-Of-Fluid formulation, the method takes into account the wettability effects which may occur on the surface of immersed solid boundaries. A spatial shift between the no-slip and the wettability conditions is introduced to make the method stable, regardless of the simulation parameters. The penalized VOF model and the numerical choices are then validated by a series of tests on capillary-dominated flows, which represent the most challenging cases for VOF simulations.
