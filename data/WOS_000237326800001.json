We analyze the optimal buffer position in the clock path, and conclude the sufficient condition and heuristic condition for buffer insertion in clock net. During the routing process, this algorithm integrates buffer insertion and node merging together, and performs them in parallel. Compared with the method of buffer insertion after zero skew clock routing, our method improves the maximal clock delay by at least 48%. Compared with legitimate skew clock routing algorithm with no buffer, this algorithm further decreases the total wire length and gets reductions from 42 to 82% in maximal clock delay. The experimental results show that our algorithm is quick and effective.", "paper_title": "Legitimate skew clock routing with buffer insertion", "paper_id": "WOS:000237326800001"}
