This paper presents the results of the research for a solution for methodically evaluating the internal quality of a softswitch dedicated to developers and acquirers alike. The resulting solution is designed in form of a prioritized two-part evaluation grid containing measurements of internal quality attributes of software as defined by the technical report ISO/IEC 9126-3. The elaboration of such a grid had the basic objective of giving developers and acquirers of a softswitch the tool to evaluate its internal quality when being purchased or developed in order to assess its design and code prior to its installation. This document also presents the applied research methodology, the proposed solution and recommendations for its use.", "paper_title": "The applicability analysis of ISO/IEC 9126 series of standards in telecom sector: the example of softswitch category of software", "paper_id": "WOS:000251000900006"}
