After separating the propagation paths and diffuse components both on the transmitter (Tx) antenna and receiver (Rx) antenna positions, the propagation paths both on Tx and Rx positions were observed for clusters separately, while coupling the clusters between Tx and Rx position based on similar time of arrivals, and ray tracing by utilizing high temporal and spatial resolution. respectively. The relation between direction of departure and direction of arrival will then be investigated. For cluster properties, parameters of model characteristics are discussed and compared to other earlier works.", "paper_title": "Investigation of ultra-wideband propagation channel based on a cluster scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100026"}
