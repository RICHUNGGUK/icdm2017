The proposed system is composed of a creative subsystem which can use different evolutionary optimization methods, and a subsystem for evaluating layouts. In the presented work the subsystem for creation uses a particle swarm optimization method for the creation/modification of solution sets. Evaluation of solution quality is made using intelligent search of the shortest travel paths within the layout. This system has proved to be innovative since it proposes very good solutions which are oriented to the main task of the system and are not simplified because of human limitations.
