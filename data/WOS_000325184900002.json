To date, the majority of rescue robots used in the field are teleoperated. In order to minimize a robot operator's workload in time-critical disaster scenes, recent efforts have been made to equip these robots with some level of autonomy. This paper provides a detailed overview of developments in the exciting and challenging area of robotic control for USAR environments. In particular, we discuss the efforts that have been made in the literature towards: 1) developing low-level controllers for rescue robot autonomy in traversing uneven terrain and stairs, and perception-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms for developing 3D maps of USAR scenes, 2) task sharing of multiple tasks between operator and robot via semi-autonomous control, and 3) high-level control schemes that have been designed for multi-robot rescue teams.", "paper_title": "Robotic Urban Search and Rescue: A Survey from the Control Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000325184900002"}
