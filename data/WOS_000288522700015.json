According to recent analytical result, the lifetime of a route, which can reflect the route stability, depends on the length of the route and the lifetime of each link in the route. This paper presents a Greedy-based Backup Routing (GBR) protocol that considers both route length and link lifetime to achieve high route stability. In GBR, the primary path is constructed primarily based on a greedy forwarding mechanism, whereas the local-backup path for each link is established according to the link lifetime. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that GBR has excellent performance in terms of route lifetime, packet delivery ratio, and control overhead.
