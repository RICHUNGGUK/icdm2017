Performance comparison of the three methods is made on a set of seismic data recorded on Stromboli that includes three classes of signals: explosion-quakes, landslides, and microtremors. The unsupervised analysis of the signals is able to discover the nature of the seismic events. Our analysis shows that the SOM algorithm discriminates better than CCA and PCA on the data under examination.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear exploratory data analysis applied to seismic signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800011"}
