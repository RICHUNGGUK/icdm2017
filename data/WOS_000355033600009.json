Establishing an accurate model of the offshore environment can be a challenging task. The use of simple probabilistic models may lead to biased results in the stochastic structural analysis since the environmental impact to an existing offshore structure is associated with a wide range of inter-dependent factors. In this paper, the specification of long-term design loads for offshore structures considering multiple environmental factors is investigated where the dependency between several commonly used sea state parameters are instituted through a copula-based multivariate probabilistic model. Several copula functions, capable of modeling both linear and non-linear dependence structures, are considered. The developed multivariate model based on copula concept is compared with the available approaches in the literature using actual environmental data. The modeled sea state parameters are then utilized to characterize the sea load for the reliability analysis of a real jacket structure where the prediction of the long term load is derived in a discretized form. The applicability of this approach in a high dimensional multivariate problem is also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
