In this paper, a nonparametric Fisher criterion is proposed as the objective function to find the optimized kernel parameters. Unlike other criterions that rooted in the kernel feature space, the proposed criterion works in the low-dimensional subspace to measure the separability of different patterns. Experiments on 13 different benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method, in comparison with other criterions and the kernel space methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
