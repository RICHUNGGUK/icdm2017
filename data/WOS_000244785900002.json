This iterative deepening search works on the crucial chain in which the prey block is located. The algorithm starts using three order liberties of the chain as the basis of the position evaluation, the value is then adjusted by the presence of few liberty-surrounding opponent blocks. The algorithm solved most capturing problems in Kano's four volumes of graded Go problems. Moreover, it is fast enough to be used by Go programs in real time.", "paper_title": "A new heuristic search algorithm for capturing problems in Go", "paper_id": "WOS:000244785900002"}
