Previous approaches often required some type of user interaction to select features. Manual selection of corresponding features and subjective determination of the difference between objects are time consuming processes requiring a high level of expertise. The Curvature Map represents shape information for a point and its surrounding region and is robust with respect to grid resolution and mesh regularity. It can be used as a measure of local surface similarity. We use these curvature map properties to extract feature regions of an object. To make the selection of the feature region less subjective, we employ a min-cut/max-flow graph cut algorithm with vertex weights derived from the curvature map property. A multi-scale approach is used to minimize the dependence on user defined parameters. We show that by combining curvature maps and graph cuts in a multi-scale framework, we can extract meaningful features in a robust way.", "paper_title": "Feature detection using curvature maps and the min-cut/max-flow algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900043"}
