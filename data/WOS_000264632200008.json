These matrices are known to describe certain communication setups. In particular, we are interested in an uplink cellular channel which models mobile users experiencing a soft-handoff situation under joint multicell decoding. Considering rather general fading statistics we provide a closed-form expression for the per-cell sum-rate of this channel in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), when an intra-cell time-division multiple-access (TDMA) protocol is employed. Since the matrices of interest are tridiagonal, their eigenvectors can be considered as sequences with second-order linear recurrence. Therefore, the problem is reduced to the study of the exponential growth of products of two-by-two matrices. For the case where K users are simultaneously active in each cell, we obtain a series of lower and upper bound on the high-SNR power offset of the per-cell sum-rate, which are considerably tighter than previously known bounds.", "paper_title": "On Certain Large Random Hermitian Jacobi Matrices With Applications to Wireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632200008"}
