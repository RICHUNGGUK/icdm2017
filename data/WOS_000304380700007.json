That is, QCMA = QCMA(1). This holds under any gate set with which the Hadamard and arbitrary classical reversible transformations can be exactly implemented, e.g., {Hadamard, Toffoli, NOT}. The proof is quantumly nonrelativizing, and uses a simple but novel quantum technique that additively adjusts the success probability, which may be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "ACHIEVING PERFECT COMPLETENESS IN CLASSICAL-WITNESS QUANTUM MERLIN-ARTHUR PROOF SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000304380700007"}
