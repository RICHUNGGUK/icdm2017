Lots of work has been done to minimize the amount of advertised topology information. With the existing methods, however, the amount of advertised information linearly increases to the order of the number of link-state parameters. To solve this problem, using graph theory, we show how to convert multiple non-isomorphic topology-advertising subgraphs into an isomorphic graph. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
