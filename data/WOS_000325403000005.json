A model-driven framework structure developed using the ROSE methodology is employed to prescribe a repeatable approach for determining viable candidate solutions that complete and make rigorous a previous capability-based exploratory analysis performed by the Office of the Chief Engineer of the U. S. Navy. This novel and efficient approach to a long-standing problem concentrates on the relationships between models to provide a framework and factorization of an SoS architecture for portfolio selection and evaluation. The approach is demonstrated in a simplified, but end-to-end, case study derived from the original data link interoperability analysis. The abstract approach employed can be applied to a much wider class of problems than data link interoperability.", "paper_title": "A Relational Oriented Approach to System of Systems Assessment of Alternatives for Data Link Interoperability", "paper_id": "WOS:000325403000005"}
