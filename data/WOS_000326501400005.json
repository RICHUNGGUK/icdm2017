To address this, the balanced frame-level parallel scheduling algorithms are developed. The proposed approaches first determine the frame priority and then the thread priority assignment for scheduling. The concept of the algorithms lies in the analysis of coding complexity, temporal influence, and the required temporal burden to finish coding. To complete the scheduling with the dynamic GOP structure, a block-based abrupt and gradual scene change detection algorithm is also proposed to determine the GOP structure adaptively. The experiments show that the scheduling performance is close to the optimal. In addition, the concept of batch processing is incorporated so that the required buffer can be reduced.", "paper_title": "Balanced Parallel Scheduling for Video Encoding with Adaptive GOP Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000326501400005"}
