Many deadlock prevention policies characterize the deadlock behavior of the systems in terms of siphons and utilize this characterization to avoid deadlocks. This paper develops a novel methodology to find interesting siphons for deadlock control purposes in a class of Petri nets, i.e., a system of simple sequential processes with resources ((SPR)-P-3). Resource circuits in an (SPR)-P-3 are first detected, from which, in general, a small portion of emptiable minimal siphons can be derived. The remaining emptiable ones can be found by their composition. A polynomial-time algorithm for finding the set of elementary siphons is proposed, which avoids complete siphon enumeration. It is shown that a dependent siphon can always be controlled by properly supervising its elementary siphons. A computationally efficient deadlock control policy is accordingly developed. Experimental study shows the efficiency of the proposed siphon computation approach.", "paper_title": "On siphon computation for deadlock control in a class of Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000258183000014"}
