Solving a classification task using such an imbalanced data-set is difficult due to the bias of the training towards the majority classes. The aim of this paper is to improve the performance of fuzzy rule based classification systems on imbalanced domains, increasing the granularity of the fuzzy partitions on the boundary areas between the classes, in order to obtain a better separability. We propose the use of a hierarchical fuzzy rule based classification system, which is based on the refinement of a simple linguistic fuzzy model by means of the extension of the structure of the knowledge base in a hierarchical way and the use of a genetic rule selection process in order to get a compact and accurate model. The good performance of this approach is shown through an extensive experimental study carried out over a large collection of imbalanced data-sets. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
