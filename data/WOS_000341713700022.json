Many efforts have been exerted to calculating this kind of integrals. However, most of numerical methods turn out to be time-consuming as integrands become highly oscillatory and strongly singular. Therefore, efficient algorithms should be devised. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The paper separates the singularity from the whole integral and couple with the singularity and oscillation, respectively. A sinh transformation is applied for the finite part and complex integration method is used to calculate the tail. Findings - Numerical experiments show that the given method shares the property that the stronger the singularity and the higher the oscillation, the better the accuracy of the calculation. Originality/value - The sinh transformation is first proposed to calculate Pollaczek integrals. This efficient algorithm can be used to evaluate mutual impedances between conductors. Also, it provides a new aspect of the research on fast calculation of Pollaczek integrals and Sommerfeld integrals.", "paper_title": "High-order fast integration for earth-return impedance between underground and overhead conductors in Matlab", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713700022"}
