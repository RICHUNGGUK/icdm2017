The proposed method increases the information conveyed per bit of the shares to nearly 100 percent, and has the size of each share the same as that of the original secret image without any expansion. The smaller size of the shares makes their further processing, such as storage and distribution, more efficient.", "paper_title": "Recursive Information Hiding of Secrets by Random Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000322151800005"}
