Along with the widespread deployment of the third generation cellular networks, the fast-improving capabilities of the mobile devices, content and service providers are increasingly interested in supporting multicast communications over wireless networks and in particular over Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). Multicasting is a more efficient method of supporting group communication than unicasting or broadcasting, as it allows transmission and routing of packets to multiple destinations using fewer network resources. In this paper, the three above mentioned methods of supporting group communication are analyzed in terms of their performance. The critical parameters of primary interest for the evaluation of any method are the packet delivery cost and the scalability of the method.
