Previous work on realistic scenarios has been focused on unicast, however broadcast requirements are fundamentally different and cannot be derived from the unicast case. Therefore, the broadcast protocols must be adapted in order to still be efficient under realistic assumptions. In this paper, we study the well-known multipoint relay broadcast protocol (MPR), in which each node has to choose a set of I-hop neighbors to act as relays in order to cover the whole 2-hop neighborhood. We give experimental results showing that the original strategy used to select these multipoint relays does not suit a realistic model. On the basis of these results, we propose new selection strategies solely based on link quality. One of the key aspects of our solutions is that our strategies do not require any additional hardware and may be implemented at the application layer, which is particularly relevant to the context of ad hoc and sensor networks where energy savings are mandatory. We finally provide new experimental results that demonstrate the superiority of our strategies under realistic physical assumptions.", "paper_title": "Maximizing the delivery of MPR broadcasting under realistic physical layer assumptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000255955800013"}
