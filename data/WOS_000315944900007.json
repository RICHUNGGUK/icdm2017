The success of the proposed algorithm was tested in real environment and it was compared with one layer FIS. Results showed that the proposed algorithm is capable of guiding user to a right orientation and it presented better results than the one layer FIS.", "paper_title": "An Algorithm Based on Neuro-Fuzzy Controller Implemented in A Smart Clothing System For Obstacle Avoidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000315944900007"}
