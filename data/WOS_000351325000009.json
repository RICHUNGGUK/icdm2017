In this paper, a new high-fidelity reversible data hiding scheme is proposed using the prediction-error histogram modification technique. A multi-predictor sorting and selecting mechanism is proposed to select an optimum predictor from a set of predictors. Then a smaller prediction-error is obtained to embed the secret data using the prediction-error histogram modification technique. Since the multi-predictor sorting and selecting mechanism can utilize the advantage of multi-predictor and information of current predicted pixel to obtain a more accurate prediction value, our proposed scheme can introduce less image distortion at the same embedding payload. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the similar reversible data hiding schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
