In this paper, two new methods based on a cultural algorithm, namely the method of musical composition, for the solution of the MSA problem are introduced. The performance of the first and second versions were evaluated and analyzed on 26 and 12 different benchmark alignments, respectively. Test instances were taken from BAliBASE 3.0. Alignment accuracies are computed using the QSCORE program, which is a quality scoring program that compares two multiple sequence alignments. Numerical results on the tackled instances indicate that the performance levels of the proposed versions of the MMC are promising. In particular, the experimental results show that the second version found the best alignment reported in the specialized literature in 25 of the tested instances. Besides, for 50 of the tested instances, the second version achieved the second best alignment. Finally, the significance of the numerical results were analyzed according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which indicated that the second proposed version is statistically similar to some state-of-the-art techniques for the MSA problem.", "paper_title": "Adaptation of the method of musical composition for solving the multiple sequence alignment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000358131600003"}
