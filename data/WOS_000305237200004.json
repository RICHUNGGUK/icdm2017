The ad-hoc wireless network based on direct-sequence ultra-wideband (DS-UWB) techniques is seen as an effective means of establishing wireless communication links between aircrafts. In this paper, based on the theory of matched filter and error bits correction, a hybrid detection algorithm is proposed for realizing multiuser detection (MUD) when the DS-UWB technique is used in the ad-hoc wireless network. The matched filter is used to generate a candidate code set which may contain several error bits. The error bits are then recognized and corrected by an novel error-bit corrector, which consists of two steps: code mapping and clustering. In the former step, based on the modified optimum MUD decision function, a novel mapping function is presented that maps the output candidate codes into a feature space for differentiating the right and wrong codes. In the latter step, the codes are clustered into the right and wrong sets by using the K-means clustering approach. Additionally, in order to prevent some right codes being wrongly classified, a sign judgment method is proposed that reduces the bit error rate (BER) of the system. Compared with the traditional detection approaches, e. g., matched filter, minimum mean square error (MMSE) and decorrelation receiver (DEC), the proposed algorithm can considerably improve the BER performance of the system because of its high probability of recognizing wrong codes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can almost achieve the BER performance of the optimum MUD (OMD). Furthermore, compared with OMD, the proposed algorithm has lower computational complexity, and its BER performance is less sensitive to the number of users.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Multiuser Detection Algorithm for Outer Space DS-UWB Ad-hoc Network with Strong Narrowband Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000305237200004"}
