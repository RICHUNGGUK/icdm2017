They are difficult to detect on non-contrast CTC images due to low image contrast with surrounding objects. In this paper, we developed a novel computer-aided diagnosis system to detect a subset of renal lesions, exophytic lesions, by (1) exploiting efficient belief propagation to segment kidneys, (2) establishing an intrinsic manifold diffusion on kidney surface, (3) searching for potential lesion-caused protrusions with local maximum diffusion response, and (4) exploring novel shape descriptors, including multi-scale diffusion response, with machine learning to classify exophytic renal lesions. Experimental results on the validation dataset with 167 patients revealed that manifold diffusion significantly outperformed conventional shape features (p < 1e - 3) and resulted in 95% sensitivity with 15 false positives per patient for detecting exophytic renal lesions. Fivefold cross-validation also demonstrated that our method could stably detect exophytic renal lesions. These encouraging results demonstrated that manifold diffusion is a key means to enable accurate computer-aided diagnosis of renal lesions.
