In attempts to achieve greater levels of robustness, transparency and blindness of digital marking considerable research has been undertaken with most studies having proposed watermarking techniques with satisfactory resistance against most attacks. However, the complicated frameworks require large areas and high energy consumption requirement for hardware implementation. This paper presents an energy-efficient and robust watermarking algorithm based on Direct Sequence-Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA), which is a low complexity architecture for embedded systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking algorithm effectively reduces energy consumption and is able to survive various signal distortions.", "paper_title": "DS-CDMA-BASED WATERMARKING: A LOW-POWER, HIGH-SECURITY ALGORITHM FOR EMBEDDED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295904300020"}
