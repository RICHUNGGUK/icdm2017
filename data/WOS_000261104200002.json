A SUE assignment based on the Cross-Nested Logit (CNL) route choice model is presented. The CNL model can better represent route choice behavior compared to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, while keeping a closed form equation. The article uses a specific optimization formulation developed for the CNL model, and develops a path-based algorithm for the solution of the CNL-SUE problem based on adaptation of the disaggregate simplicial decomposition (DSD) method. The article illustrates the algorithmic implementation on a real size network and discusses the trade-offs between MNL-SUE and CNL-SUE assignment.", "paper_title": "A Path-Based Algorithm for the Cross-Nested Logit Stochastic User Equilibrium Traffic Assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000261104200002"}
