In recent years of rising big data trend, recognized shifts in E-commerce have taken place from internet-enable commerce (I-commerce), to mobile commerce (M-commerce), and now to ubiquitous commerce (U-commerce). As theses paradigm shifts imply that ubiquitous computing improves considerably companies' access to information by allowing them to acquire information at anytime, anywhere. Give this changes on data collection shifts due to ubiquitous computing, however, current A-CRM framework in literature seems not too matched to this change. There is only a handful studies published on CRM in ubiquitous computing environment fitting what big data age requires. Consequently, the objective of this study attempts to propose a conceptual framework of A-CRM. Built by conceptual framework approach, this framework provides valuable directions, definitions and guidelines to practitioners preparing the successful big data marketing in big data age.", "paper_title": "A Conceptual Framework of Analytical CRM in Big Data Age", "paper_id": "WOS:000357580500020"}
