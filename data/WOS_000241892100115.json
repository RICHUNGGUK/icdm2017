This paper proposes the design approach of the AES cryptographic system based on reconfigurable hardware, develops the method of key-sequence generation with the genetic algorithm that realizes different cipher key in every encryption round. The system has been implemented on Virtex-E FPGA. The result proves that the new design technology is feasible, and the security level of the AES is improved.", "paper_title": "Hardware implementation of AES based on genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100115"}
