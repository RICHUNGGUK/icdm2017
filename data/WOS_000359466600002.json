In this paper, we show that such a secure three-input function evaluation can be performed with a deck of real cards; specifically, the three players can learn only the output of the function using eight physical cards-four black and four red cards-with identical backs.", "paper_title": "Securely Computing Three-Input Functions with Eight Cards", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600002"}
