In this paper, we show that this \"interchange of limits\" is valid for Stochastic Fluid Networks with L,vy inputs. Furthermore, under additional assumptions, we extend the result to show that the interchange is valid for moments of the stationary distribution and for state-dependent routing. The results are obtained using monotonicity and sample-path arguments.", "paper_title": "Heavy traffic approximation for the stationary distribution of stochastic fluid networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298880800001"}
