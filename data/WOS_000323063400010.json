We discuss the main technologies of computational intelligence (namely, neural networks, fuzzy sets or granular computing, and evolutionary optimization), identify their focal points and stress an overall synergistic character, which ultimately gives rise to the highly symbiotic CI environment. Furthermore, the main advantages and limitations of the CI technologies are discussed. In the sequel, we present CI-oriented constructs in signal modeling, classification, and interpretation. Examples of the CI-based ECG signal processing problems are presented.", "paper_title": "Description, analysis, and classification of biomedical signals: a computational intelligence approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000323063400010"}
