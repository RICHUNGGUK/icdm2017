The problem was proposed and studied in the seminal paper of Nisan and Ronen on algorithmic mechanism design, where it was shown that the approximation ratio of mechanisms is between 2 and n. We improve the lower bound to 1 + root 2 for 3 or more machines.", "paper_title": "A Lower Bound for Scheduling Mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000269307700006"}
