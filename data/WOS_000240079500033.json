The registration quality is measured by the anatomical variability of the registered images. We propose in this paper a local anatomical structure descriptor, namely the Maximum Responded Gabor Wavelet (MRGW) for such a purpose. The effectiveness of the descriptor is demonstrated through a practical spatial normalization example-the variance of MRGW is successfully applied to tune the parameters of a nonlinear spatial normalization algorithm, which is integrated in one of the most popular software packages for medical image processing-the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM).", "paper_title": "3D Gabor wavelets for evaluating medical image registration algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500033"}
