Basically, two modelling approaches exist, i.e., true moving bed (TMB) and SNIB models. Both approaches show advantages and drawbacks. In this work, an attempt is made to develop a model which retains the simplicity of the original TNIB model and its modest computational load, while capturing the essential features of the cyclic steady state reproduced by the SNIB model.
