The integrated system model is showed covering the laser triangulation sensor, the geometry of the manipulator and the relative positions of the components during the measurement process. The method to calibrate the sensor and relate the positions of the sensor and the robot is explained in this work. The measurement process is carried out with the parameters calculated with this method and the nominal parameters of the robot. Finally. plane surfaces with holes and termination of tubes placed in different orientations will be measured; the accuracy of the integrated system (sensor and robot) will be presented as well.
