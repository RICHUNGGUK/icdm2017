In a first step the algorithm estimates a Signal and Frequency Dependent (SFD) noise model. In a second step, the image is denoised by a multiscale adaptation of the Non-local Bayes denoising method. We focus here on a careful analysis of the denoising step and present a detailed discussion of the influence of its parameters. Extensive commented tests of the blind denoising algorithm are presented, on real JPEG images and on scans of old photographs.", "paper_title": "The Noise Clinic: a Blind Image Denoising Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000360149400001"}
