This study deals with the problem of comparison of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. An axiomatic definition of divergence measures for IFSs is presented, which are particular cases of dissimilarities between IFSs. The relationships among IF-divergences, IF-dissimilarities, and IF-distances are studied. Finally, we propose a very general framework for comparison of IFSs, where depending on the conditions imposed on a particular function, we can realize measures of distance, dissimilarity, and divergence for IFSs. Some methods for building divergence measures for IFSs are also introduced, as well as some examples of IF-divergences. In particular, we have proved some results that can be used to generate measures of divergence for fuzzy sets as well as for intuitionistic fuzzy sets.", "paper_title": "Divergence Measures for Intuitionistic Fuzzy", "paper_id": "WOS:000352279600015"}
