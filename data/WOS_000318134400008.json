However, the adoption of simulation in state-of-the-art Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) methodologies is still incomplete at its best. In this paper we present a simulation-based approach to MAS engineering and discuss its integration within AOSE methodologies. Integration is first discussed in general by adopting standard method engineering techniques, then detailed by means of a case study that is, integrating simulation in SODA. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
