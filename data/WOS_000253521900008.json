Previously, many researchers put effort into e-learning systems with personalized learning mechanism to aid on-line learning. However, most systems focus on using learner's behaviors, interests, and habits to provide personalized e-learning services. These systems commonly neglect to consider if learner ability and the difficulty level of the recommended courseware are matched to each other. Frequently, unsuitable courseware causes learner's cognitive overload or disorientation during learning. To promote learning effectiveness, our previous study proposed a personalized e-learning system based on Item response theory (PEL-IRT), which can consider both course material difficulty and learner ability evaluated by learner's crisp feedback responses (i.e. completely understanding or not understanding answer) to provide personalized learning paths for individual learners. The PEL-IRT cannot estimate learner ability for personalized learning services according to learner's non-crisp responses (i.e. uncertain/fuzzy responses). The main problem is that learner's response is not usually belonging to completely understanding or not understanding case for the content of learned courseware. Therefore, this study developed a personalized intelligent tutoring system based on the proposed fuzzy item response theory (FIRT), which could be capable of recommending courseware with suitable difficulty levels for learners according to learner's uncertain/fuzzy feedback responses. The proposed FIRT can correctly estimate learner ability via the fuzzy inference mechanism and revise estimating function of learner ability while the learner responds to the difficulty level and comprehension percentage for the learned courseware. Moreover, a courseware modeling process developed in this study is based on a statistical technique to establish the difficulty parameters of courseware for the proposed personalized intelligent tutoring system. Experiment results indicate that applying the proposed FIRT to web-based learning can provide better learning services for individual learners than our previous study, thus helping learners to learn more effectively.
