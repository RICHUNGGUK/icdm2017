We provide three sets of simple general conditions characterizing problems admitting kernels of polynomial size. Our characterizations not only give generic explanations for the existence of many known polynomial kernels for problems like q-COLORING, ODD CYCLE TRANSVERSAL, CHORDAL DELETION, eta-TRANSVERSAL, Of LONG PATH, parameterized by the size of a vertex cover, but also imply new polynomial kernels for problems like F-MINOR-FREE DELETION, which is to delete at most k vertices to obtain a graph with no minor from a fixed finite set F. While our characterization captures many interesting problems, the kernelization complexity landscape of parameterizations by vertex cover is much more involved. We demonstrate this by several results about induced subgraph and minor containment testing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
