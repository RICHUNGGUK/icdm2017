The noteworthy feature of the present implementation of the ISLB method is that it is. able to achieve a sustained speed of 4.2 Tflop/s while using 504 processors on a Cray X1. The code is shown to achieve super-linear speedups on the Cray T3E-900. It is shown through detailed profiling that the computation and the communication scale well on the Cray X1, although the overall speedup is adversely affected by the cost of barrier synchronization.", "paper_title": "A detailed performance analysis of the interpolation supplemented lattice Boltzmann method on the Cray T3E and Cray X1", "paper_id": "WOS:000242290400011"}
