The objective is to minimize the total cost of working and backup resources, including transponders, regenerators, and shared infrastructure, for a given set of virtual optical networks, which can survive single link failures. We first provide the problem definition of SIC-VONM, and then formulate the problem as an integer linear program (ILP). We also develop a novel heuristic algorithm, together with a baseline algorithm and a lower bound for comparison. Numerical results show that our proposed heuristic achieves results that are very close to those of the ILP for small-scale problems and that our proposed heuristic can solve large-scale problems very well.", "paper_title": "Survivable Impairment-Constrained Virtual Optical Network Mapping in Flexible-Grid Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344989200007"}
