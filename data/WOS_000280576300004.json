Therefore, noise accumulation along lightpath can severely impair optical signal-to-noise ratio. Impairment aware routing and wavelength assignment algorithms (IA-RWA) can take into account these effects, improving the network performance. In this paper we describe a fast and high performance adaptive weight function to be used as the metric for the routing algorithm in optical networks constrained by physical impairments. The input information for this function are link availability, route length and two adjustable parameters. These two parameters provide information about the network impairments. An offline simulation must be run to adjust them prior to the online network operation. The main advantage of this approach is the use of simple network parameters during the routing process instead of a complex optical noise based formulation, which renders it a better performance in terms of both, time to find a route and blocking probability. In our simulations we considered three physical layer effects: ASE noise generation, Optical Amplifier gain and ASE saturation and OXC crosstalk. We performed a performance comparison between this new metric and other metrics previously described in the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
