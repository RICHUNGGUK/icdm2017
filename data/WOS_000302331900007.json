We give an. overview of the history of the competition, discussing how it has developed since its first edition in 1998. The 2011 competition was run in three main separate tracks: the deterministic (classical) track; the learning track; and the uncertainty track. Each track proposed its own distinct set of new challenges and the participants rose to these admirably, the results of each track showing promising progress in each area. The competition attracted a record number of participants this year, showing its continued and strong position as a major central pillar of the international planning research community.", "paper_title": "A Survey of the Seventh International Planning Competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000302331900007"}
