These facts may cause difficulties in using such techniques in some applications, such as numerical simulations. In this work we reformulate a previously developed technique for mesh generation from intensity images called Imesh. This reformulation makes Imesh more versatile due to an unified framework that allows an easy change of refinement metric, rendering it effective for constructing meshes for applications with varied requirements, such as numerical simulation and image modeling. Furthermore, a deeper study about the point insertion problem and the development of geometrical criterion for segmentation is also reported in this paper. Meshes with theoretical guarantee of quality can also be obtained for each individual image structure as a post-processing step, a characteristic not usually found in other methods. The tests demonstrate the flexibility and the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Generating Segmented Quality Meshes from Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000262315700002"}
