Although many approaches based on a monocular camera have been proposed, only a few works have concentrated on applying multicamera sensor fusion techniques to pose estimation. Higher accuracy and enhanced robustness toward sensor defects or failures are some of the advantages of these schemes. This paper presents a new Kalman-based sensor fusion approach for pose estimation that offers higher accuracy and precision, and is robust to camera motion and image occlusion, compared to its predecessors. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of this fusion method over currently employed vision-based pose estimation algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Robust Vision-Based Sensor Fusion Approach for Real-Time Pose Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330122700006"}
