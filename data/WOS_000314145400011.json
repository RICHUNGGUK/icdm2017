Many noise reduction algorithms require their parameters to be adjusted based on the noise level. Filter-based approaches of image noise estimation usually were more efficient but had difficulty on separating noise from images. Block-based approaches could provide more accurate results but usually required higher computation complexity. In this work, a design framework for combining the strengths of filter-based and block-based approaches is presented. Different homogeneity analyzers for identifying the homogeneous blocks are discussed and their performances are compared. Then, two well-known filters, the bilateral and the non-local mean, are reviewed and their parameter settings are investigated. A new bilateral filter with edge enhancement is proposed. A modified non-local mean filter with much less complexity is also present. Compared to the original non-local mean filter, the complexity is dramatically reduced by 75% and yet the image quality is maintained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
