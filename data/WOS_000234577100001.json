Specifically, we propose a new admission control scheme called EFGC, which is an extension of the well-known fractional guard channel scheme proposed for cellular networks supporting voice traffic. The main idea is to use two acceptance ratios, one for voice calls and the other for data calls in order to maintain the proportional service quality for voice and data traffic while guaranteeing a target handoff failure probability for voice calls. We describe two variations of the proposed scheme: EFGC-REST, a conservative approach which aims at preserving the proportional service quality by sacrificing the bandwidth utilization, and EFGC-UTIL, a greedy approach which achieves higher bandwidth utilization at the expense of increasing the handoff failure probability for voice calls. Extensive simulation results show that our schemes satisfy the hard constraints on handoff failure probability and service differentiation while maintaining a high bandwidth utilization.", "paper_title": "Call admission control for voice/data integration in broadband wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000234577100001"}
