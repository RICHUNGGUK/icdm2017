Due to the discreteness of rock masses, the Universal distinct element code (UDEC) has been adopted for the study of rock mass problems. In this paper, the calibration work of UDEC modelling oil P-wave propagation across single linearly and nonlinearly deformable fractures is conducted. Subsequently, numerical studies of P-wave propagation across multiple nonlinearly deformable fractures are carried out. The magnitude of transmission coefficient is calculated as a function of nondimensional fracture spacing for different numbers of fractures. The results reveals that under some circumstances, the magnitute of transmission coefficient not only increases with increasing number of fractures, but also is larger than 1. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
