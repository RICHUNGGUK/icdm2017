Healthcare professionals need to understand how available computer technologies can assist their practice. This article (1) clarifies the concept of tailoring among similar terms, including targeting, personalizing, and customizing, (2) gives an overview of current literature on the use of computerized tailoring, and (3) provides a model of computerized tailoring through three phases of preparation, adaptation, and integration. Research evidence suggests that health information can be precisely tailored to individuals when using computer technology, although the potential for using technology for tailoring health information has not been fully realized.", "paper_title": "Computerized Tailoring of Health Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000261554900006"}
