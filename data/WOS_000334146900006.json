The purpose is to develop suggested content-related guidelines for developing social responsible TE policy and to show the practical implementation guidance for implementation of the theoretical research. According to the authors' knowledge, this has not yet been researched in the field of tourism industry (TIN). Design/methodology/approach - The MER model of integral management has been upgraded by Mulej's Dialectical Systems Theory. The authors considered all relevant and only the essential aspects needed for a requisitely holistic approach towards developing the guidelines for innovating the TEs' policy/governance. Findings - Innovation of TEs' policy/governance is possible only with the requisitely holistic and dialectical approach. TEs that will be able to track the suggested guidelines of tourism policy/governance innovation towards holism, systemic thinking, social responsibility, and sustainable tourism are more likely to succeed. Therefore, the stimulating of competitiveness and innovation of the TIN can be achieved through enterprises' policy/governance innovation that the authors suggested. Practical implications - The TEs can establish socially (and otherwise) responsible enterprise policy/governance in accordance with the recommendations developed here. Originality/value - The given suggestions are not known in available literature. The paper exposes the need for holism and consistency of TEs' development potential and interdependently examines the overlaying areas of TEs' policy/governance, social responsibility, and holism/wholeness. The Dialectical Systems Theory systemic approach exposes the need to innovate enterprise policy/governance, if humankind is to survive.", "paper_title": "Holism and social responsibility for tourism enterprise governance", "paper_id": "WOS:000334146900006"}
