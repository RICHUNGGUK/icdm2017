A part of that high concentrated brine solution could be sprayed into the surrounding ambient air, a few metres above the solar and thermal salt recrystallization ponds to increase the global process efficiency. In this study, the dynamic model previously built of a hot brine spray system was explored in order to evaluate its behaviour. The influence on the spray system performance was studied by analysing the relevance of some operating, atmospheric conditions and spray nozzle characteristics. For the integration of this hot brine spray system model with the dynamic model of the thermal salt process, correlations were established for the total mass water evaporated in the spray system and for the temperature of sprayed brine that reaches the pond as function of seven independent variables.
