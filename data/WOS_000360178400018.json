The efficiency and optimality criterion depend on the environment and planning method adopted. In this paper, a general fast path planning framework is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicles navigation. Standard A* search is performed online on the roadmap, which consists of path segments that are pre-computed offline with the aid of a multi-resolution grid and terminate at somewhere along the boundary between adjacent cells. Fast marching method (FMM) was employed for two aspects of the roadmap pre-computation: the location of segment termination points is determined by FMM propagation from the center of a given cell at the highest resolution grid, and the actual segments are computed using FMM between all pairs of nodes belonging to a given cell at all resolutions. Environment dynamics are taken into account by replanning from scratch after modifying the costs associated with the path segments that intersect threat' or no-fly' zones. The altitude along the planned path is determined in a post-processing step by inspecting the elevation profile along the path and using Sparse A*searching method. The experimental results show that planning speed can be improved significantly with the proposed method, especially, fast online path planning can be achieved to adapt to environmental changes.
