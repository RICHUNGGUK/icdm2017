Usually the sensor locations are precomputed based on \"perfect\" sensor detection model, whereas sensors may not always provide reliable information, either due to operational tolerance levels or environmental factors. Therefore, it is very important to take into account this uncertainty in the deployment process. In this paper, we address the problem of sensor deployment in a mixed sensor network where the mobile and static nodes work collaboratively to perform deployment optimization task. We consider the Gaussian white noise in the environment and present a centralized algorithm (FABGM for short) which discoveres vacancies by using detection model based on false alarm and moves the mobile nodes according to the method based on bipartite graph matching in this study. In this algorithm, the management node of the WSNs collects the geographical information of all of the static and mobile sensors. Then, the management node executes the algorithm to get the best matches between mobile sensors and coverage holes. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty-Aware Sensor Deployment Strategy in Mixed Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327036800001"}
