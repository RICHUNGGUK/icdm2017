Traditional population balance modeling (PBM) is usually used to simulate spatially homogeneous dynamic processes, only obtaining the time evolution of PSD. In this paper, we presented an algorithm to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of PSD accounting for mutual coupling of particle population and hydrodynamics. The differentially-weighted Monte Carlo method for PBM is used to simulate coagulation behavior of particles in each grid that is considered to be spatially homogeneous, and the transport behavior of fluid and particles towards neighbor grids that are spatially inhomogeneous are described by general conservation equations of multiphase flows. The simulation strategy is based on the selection of a time step within which the fluid transport, the particle transport and the particle dynamics are uncoupled and then separately simulated. A limiting case of the coarse high-inertia particles whose motion is independent of surrounding fluid is chosen to validate the population balance-Monte Carlo (PBMC) method for the spatiotemporal evolution of PSD. The computational time is found to be less by a factor of 10 compared to the direct numerical simulation (DNS), yielding reasonably closer predictions of spatiotemporal particle size distributions.
