Due to this the abnormal posturing of the foot causes the babies to turn the ankle inward and walk along the outside edges of the foot. In medical science it is known as \"congenital talipes equino varus\" (CTEV). Computer modeling of prosthesis and orthosis is a perspective method for optimal design and gait is a terminology related to walking patterns of human subject. The present study aims to develop the virtual model of ankle foot orthosis through computer-aided design for non-surgical correction of this challenging clubfoot deformity. Study of gait cycle for normal healthy subject is discussed and by using 3D-modeling in CAD environment, an ankle foot orthosis for clubfoot treatment is generated. This realized the evolution of a non-surgical corrective procedure for the challenging clubfoot abnormalities in babies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
