It is a network-based mobility management protocol based on Mobile IPv6. There is significant interest from various standards bodies for its adoption in 4G networks as the key mobility management protocol. It is being seen as the protocol for achieving a common mobile core network, accommodating various access technologies such as WiMAX, 3GPP and 3GPP2 radio networks. One of the key aspects of the protocol is the support for inter-technology handoffs. The Proxy Mobile IPv6 network allows the mobile node to perform handoff between different access technologies and the network will ensure the terminal obtains the same address configuration as before. However there is no study on the required software function on the host for performing inter-technology handoffs and with the goal of session survivability across handoffs. This paper analyzes from the mobile node's perspective on the potential approaches for achieving this and without requiring any changes to the host. It explores the use of virtual interface support available in Linux as one of the approaches and demonstrates that it is a simple host configuration and does not require any host stack changes. It also provides the results from the inter-technology handoff experiments running with our Proxy Mobile IPv6 implementation.
