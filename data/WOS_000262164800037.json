On the other hand, Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) codes have been successfully applied in WCDMA for separating different channels with different transmission capacity. In this paper, novel OVSF-ZCZ Sequences originated from LS and GO sequences have been proposed for CDMA systems with different service requirements, The construction method is discussed and the performance of the system is evaluated.", "paper_title": "Construction and Performance Analysis of OVSF-ZCZ Codes Based on LS and GO Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800037"}
