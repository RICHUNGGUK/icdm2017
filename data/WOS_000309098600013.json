For the membership problem for such grammars, stated as \"Given a grammar G and a string a(n), determine whether a(n) is generated by G\", only a naive O(vertical bar G vertical bar . n(2))-time algorithm is known. This paper develops a new algorithm solving this problem, which is based upon fast multiplication of integers, works in time vertical bar G vertical bar . n log(3) n . 2(O(log)* (n)) and is applicable to context-free grammars augmented with Boolean operations, known as Boolean grammars. For unambiguous grammars, the running time of the algorithm is reduced to vertical bar G vertical bar . n log(2) n . 2(O(log)* (n)). The algorithm is based upon (a simplification of) the online integer multiplication algorithm by Fischer and Stockmeyer [M.J. Fischer, L.J.
