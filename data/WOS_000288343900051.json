Like barcode, it can be stuck to a product, animal, instrument and etc.; there are lots of applications being used practically in the real world. During communication, all tags and reader are shared with the same communication channel. The tag collision arbitration is a significant issue for reducing the communication overhead during tag identification. In this paper, we propose a fast tag identification algorithm named as Enhanced Anti-collision Algorithm (EAA). EAA uses counter and stack to reduce tag collisions efficiently. Compared to other existing methods, our method not only uses fewer timeslots but reduce the length of a timeslot for identifying tags. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
