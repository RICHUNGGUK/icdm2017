Assessed QoS reflects customer experiences about service and expectations in terms of costs, support of innovative features and return of investments. The adoption of a solution where voice and data are integrated into an IP-based network infrastructure leads users to a new degree of satisfaction having a bad impact on users' opinion in terms of Assessed QoS. In this paper, we present a practical case study of telecom convergence implemented into the university campus sites scattered throughout the metropolitan area of Catania. The QoS factors which have been considered in order to decide the adoption of a technical solution based on voice and data integration are also pointed out. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
