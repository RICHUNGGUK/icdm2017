We show that the weighted Min-Sum Disjoint Paths problem is FP-complete in general graphs, and the unweighted Min-Sum Disjoint Paths problem and the unweighted Min-Max Disjoint Paths problem cannot be approximated within Omega(m(1-epsilon)) for any constant epsilon > 0 even in planar graphs, assuming P not equal NP, where m is the number of edges in G. We give for the first time a simple bicriteria approximation algorithm for the unweighted Min-Max Edge-Disjoint Paths problem and the weighted Min-Sum Edge-Disjoint Paths problem, with guaranteed approximation ratio O(log k/ log log k) and O(1), respectively.", "paper_title": "COMPLEXITY AND APPROXIMATION RESULTS FOR THE MIN-SUM AND MIN-MAX DISJOINT PATHS PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000317083900002"}
