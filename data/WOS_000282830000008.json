The algorithm utilises relative threshold detection on the inner slopes of the arterial walls before the resolution is improved by solving the equation of a straight line between the samples around the threshold value. Further, correction distances added to compensate for the underestimation when using the inner slopes were found to be 304 mu m for the near wall and 415 mu m for the far wall. The measured mean diameters of ten consecutive images of 3-, 6- and 9-mm phantoms were 3,006 mu m (SD 4), 5,918 mu m (SD 1) and 8,936 mu m (SD 2), respectively. The mean differences between the images were 0.19, 0.04 and 0.37 mu m, respectively. In vivo, the intra- and inter-observer variabilities were -64 mu m (2SD 358) and -57 mu m (2SD 366), respectively.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of an algorithm for arterial lumen diameter measurements by means of ultrasound", "paper_id": "WOS:000282830000008"}
