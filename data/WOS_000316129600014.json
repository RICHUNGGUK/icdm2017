The present paper tackles the problem by a nonrelativistic approach based on conformal differential geometry applied to the solution of the dynamical problem of two entangled spin 1/2 particles. It is found that the quantum nonlocality may be understood on the basis of a conformal quantum geometrodynamics acting necessarily on the full \"configuration space\" of the entangled particles. At the end, the violation of the Bell inequalities is demonstrated without making recourse to the common nonlocality paradigm.", "paper_title": "SOLVING THE NONLOCALITY RIDDLE BY CONFORMAL QUANTUM GEOMETRODYNAMICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000316129600014"}
