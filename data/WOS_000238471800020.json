Compared with other smart card-based schemes, our scheme achieves more functionality. The important merits include: (1) a dictionary of verification tables is not required to authenticate users; (2) users can choose their password freely; (3) mutual authentication is provided between the user and the remote system; (4) the communication cost and the computational cost are very low; (5) users can update their password after the registration phase; (6) a session key agreed by the user and the remote system is generated in every session; and (7) the nonce-based scheme does not require a timestamp to solve the serious time synchronization problem.
