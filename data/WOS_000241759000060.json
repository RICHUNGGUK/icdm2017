The strategy combined with the normal maintenance could greatly improve the performance of the network system. The static-checking and policy of authentication mechanism ensure the running network without any error. The redundant equipments are independent but are capable of communication with each other when they work their actions. The model is independent of specific application environment, thus providing a general-purpose framework for fault diagnosis. An example is given to express the calculating method.", "paper_title": "The design of data-link equipment redundant strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000060"}
