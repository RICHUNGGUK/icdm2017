We discovered that the high-speed RFID data filtering technique is very similar to the high-speed packet classification technique which is used in highspeed routers and firewall systems. Actually, our filtering engine is designed based on existing packet classification algorithms, Bit-Parallelism and Aggregated Bit Vector (ABV). In addition, we also discovered that there are strong temporal relations and redundancy in the RFID data filtering operations. We incorporated two kinds of caches, tag and filter caches, to make use of this characteristic to improve the efficiency of the filtering engine. The performance of the proposed engine has been examined by implementing a prototype system and testing it. Compared to the basic sequential filter comparison approach, our engine shows much better performance, and it gets better as the number of filters increases.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of a high-speed RFID data filtering engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000043"}
