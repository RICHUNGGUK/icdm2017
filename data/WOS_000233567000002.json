The system is comprised of a low-noise preamplifier and an A/D converter (ADC) for quantizing the recorded nerve signal. The instrumentation amplifier utilizes CMOS transistors biased in the weak/moderate inversion region at a relatively high current for low thermal noise performance and achieves low flicker noise performance through chopper stabilization. The resulting measured equivalent input referred thermal noise is 6.6 nV/root Hz at a chopping frequency of 20 kHz. A two-stage design is implemented which achieves a measured amplification of 72.5 dB over a signal bandwidth of 4 kHz. For the ADC, a third order Sigma Delta-modulator employing a continuous-time (CT) loopfilter was implemented. Each of the integrators in the loop-filter are implemented a s G(m) - C elements. For a sampling frequency of 1.4 MHz, the measured SNDR for the ADC is 62 dB, whereas the dynamic range (DR) is 67 dB over a 4 kHz bandwidth, equivalent to a resolution of 10 bits. The system draws a current of 196 mu A from a 1.8 V supply thus consuming approximately 350 mu W excluding buffers and bias circuitry.", "paper_title": "An implantable CMOS front-end system for nerve-signal sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000233567000002"}
