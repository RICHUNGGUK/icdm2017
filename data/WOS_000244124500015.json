Most interactions mentioned in the free text of biomedical publications are not yet contained in structured databases. Results: We developed RelEx, an approach for relation extraction from free text. It is based on natural language preprocessing producing dependency parse trees and applying a small number of simple rules to these trees. We applied RelEx on a comprehensive set of one million MEDLINE abstracts dealing with gene and protein relations and extracted -150 000 relations with an estimated perfomance of both 80% precision and 80% recall. Availability: The used natural language preprocessing tools are free for use for academic research. Test sets and relation term lists are available from our website(http://www.bioifiImu.de/publications/RElEx/).", "paper_title": "RelEx - Relation extraction using dependency parse trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000244124500015"}
