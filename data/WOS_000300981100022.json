Adopting Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology, we devise two many-to-one cooperative schemes under convergecast for both static and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), respectively. We call them Convergimo Schemes. In static networks, our Convergimo scheme highly utilizes hierarchical cooperation MIMO transmission. This feature overcomes the bottleneck which hinders convergecast traffic from yielding ideal performance in traditional ad hoc network, by turning the originally interfering signals into interference-resistant ones. It helps to achieve an aggregate throughput up to Omega(n(1-epsilon)) for any epsilon > 0. In the mobile ad hoc case, our Convergimo scheme characterizes on joint transmission from multiple nodes to multiple receivers. With optimal network division where the number of nodes per cell is constantly bounded, the achievable per-node throughput can reach Theta(1) with the corresponding delay reduced to Theta(k). The gain comes from the strong and intelligent cooperation between nodes in our scheme, along with the maximum number of concurrent active cells and the shortest waiting time before transmission for each node within a cell. This increases the chances for each destination to receive the data it needs with minimum overhead on extra transmission. Moreover, our converge-based analysis well unifies and generalizes previous work since the results derived from convergecast in our schemes can also cover other traffic patterns. Last but not the least, our schemes are of interest not only from a theoretical perspective but also provide useful theoretical guidelines to future design of MIMO schemes in wireless networks.", "paper_title": "Throughput and Delay Analysis for Convergecast with MIMO in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300981100022"}
