However, due to the existence of decoherence time and the difficulty of importing ancillae qubits, we introduce a new method which can greatly reduce the operating time steps by making good use of relaxing qubits without new ancillae qubits. This concept presented in this paper can be generalized to the other quantum networks.", "paper_title": "Quantum network optimization based on the use of relaxing qubits", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300105"}
