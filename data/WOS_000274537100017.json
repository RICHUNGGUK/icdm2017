For a program with functions executable in parallel, this proposed method determines a behavioral partitioning which simultaneously minimizes the overall datapath area and the complexity of the controller while maximizing performance of a synthesized circuit by fully exploiting function-level parallelism of a behavioral description. This method is formulated as an integer programming problem. Experimental results demonstrate that this method leads to a shift of the explorable design space so that superior solutions which could not be explored by earlier work are included, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Partitioning of Behavioral Descriptions with Exploiting Function-Level Parallelism", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537100017"}
