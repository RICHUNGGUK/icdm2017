In this paper, we present a novel heuristic algorithm which uses performance-monitoring-counter information to compensate recursive power consumption when scheduling VMs. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed heuristic algorithm can provide quantitative error-bound for power measuring. Extensive experiments with various benchmars are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm, and the results show that the accuracy of VM power measurements can be significantly improved comparing with conventional VM scheduler.", "paper_title": "A Virtual Machine Scheduling Algorithm with Recursive Power Consumption Compensation Mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000359612800012"}
