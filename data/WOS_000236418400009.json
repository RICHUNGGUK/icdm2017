We consider the SDR gap (gamma) over bar gamma. We establish the uniqueness of the SDR solution and prove that gamma = (gamma) over bar if and only if gamma(r) := n(-1) max {x(T) VV(T) x : x is an element of {-1, 1}(n)} = 1 where V is an orthogonal matrix whose columns span the (r - dimensional) null space of D - Q and where D is the unique SDR solution. We also give a test for establishing whether gamma = (gamma) over bar that involves 2(r-1) function evaluations. In the case that gamma(r) < 1 we derive an upper bound on gamma which is tighter than <(gamma)over bar>. Thus we show that 'breaching' the SDR gap for the QIP problem is as difficult as the solution of a QIP with the rank of the cost function matrix equal to the dimension of the null space of D - Q. This reduced rank QIP problem has been recently shown to be solvable in polynomial time for fixed r.", "paper_title": "On the gap between the quadratic integer programming problem and its semidefinite relaxation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236418400009"}
