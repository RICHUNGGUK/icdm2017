Both advection and diffusion mechanisms are taken into account. The novel mathematical approach is based on the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) schemes. Diffusion processes are considered by comparing five numerical schemes: Upwind, Minmod, Van Leer, Superbee and MUSCL. The estimation of the infected surface shows that the Superbee scheme has the ability to limit the numerical diffusion and reduces the numerical dispersion. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
