In the crisp set theory, the previous operations lead to new partitions: every refinement of a partition is also a partition; the union of partitions of disjoint sets is a partition of the union set; the product of two partitions of two sets is a partition of the intersection of the partitioned sets. It has been proven that E-partitions extend the three previous properties when the intersection of fuzzy sets is defined by the minimum t-norm and the union by the maximum t-conorm. In this paper we consider any t-norm defining the intersection of fuzzy sets and we characterize those t-norms for which refinements, unions and products of c-partitions are c-partitions. We pay special attention to these characterizations in the case of continuous t-norms. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
