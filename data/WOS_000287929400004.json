This total variation model contains an L (tau) -data fidelity for any tau a[1,2]. The use of a spatial dependent regularization parameter improves the reconstruction of features in the image as well as an adequate smoothing for the homogeneous parts. The automated adaptation of this regularization parameter is made according to local statistical characteristics of the noise which contaminates the image. The corresponding multiscale vectorial total variation model is solved by Fenchel-duality and inexact semismooth Newton techniques. Numerical results are presented for the cases tau=1 and tau=2 which reconstruct images contaminated with salt-and-pepper noise and Gaussian noise, respectively.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Scale Vectorial L (tau) -TV Framework for Color Image Restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000287929400004"}
