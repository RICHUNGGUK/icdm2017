Today, data is of enormous sizes and is usually located oil distributed sites; the primary example being the Web. This created a need for performing clustering in distributed environments. Distributed clustering solves two problems: infeasibility of collecting data at a central site, due to either technical and/or privacy limitations, and intractability of traditional clustering algorithms oil huge data sets. In this paper we propose a distributed collaborative clustering approach for clustering Web documents in distributed environments. We adopt a peer-to-peer model, where the main objective is to allow nodes in a network to first form independent opinions of local document clusterings, then collaborate with peers to enhance the local clusterings. Information exchanged between peers is minimized through the use of cluster summaries in the form of keyphrases extracted from the Clusters. This summarized view of peer data enables nodes to request merging of remote data selectively to enhance local clusters. Initial clustering, as well as merging peer data with local clusters, utilizes a clustering method, called similarity histogram-based clustering, based oil keeping a tight similarity distribution within clusters. This approach achieves significant improvement in local clustering solutions without the cost of centralized clustering, while maintaining the initial local clustering structure. Results show that larger networks exhibit larger improvements, tip to 15%, improvement in clustering quality, albeit lower absolute clustering quality than smaller networks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
