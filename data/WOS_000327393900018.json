It consists of two processes: aesthetic features construction and temporal integration. First, our method combines both photo-based and motion-based visual clues to extract the aesthetic features for each frame in a video. We introduce new motion-based features built from optical flow and salient region extraction, and show their effectiveness to enhance the estimation of aesthetic values. Then, a temporal-order-aware framework that integrates the frame-based features is presented to further improve the evaluation accuracy by taking the time-varying properties into consideration. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can accomplish remarkable improvement for aesthetic quality assessment of videos.", "paper_title": "Video Aesthetic Quality Assessment by Temporal Integration of Photo-and Motion-Based Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000327393900018"}
