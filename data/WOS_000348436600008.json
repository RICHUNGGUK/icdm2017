We study some probabilistic and combinatorial aspects of the shuffle on S-n defined by removing and then randomly reinserting each of the n cards once, with the removal and reinsertion being performed according to the original left to right order of the cards. The novelty here in this nonstandard shuffle is that every card is removed and reinserted exactly once. The bias that remains turns out to be quite strong and possesses some surprising features.
