Using the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), a CMP system can achieve a balance between the performance and the energy-efficiency. In this paper, we propose a three-phase discrete DVFS algorithm for a CMP system dedicated to applications where the period of the applications' task graph is smaller than the deadline of tasks. In these applications, multiple task graphs are unrolled and then concatenated together to form a new task graph. The proposed DVFS algorithm is applied to the newly formed task graph to stretch tasks' execution time, lower operating frequencies of processors and achieve the system power efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the energy dissipation by 25% on average, compared to previous DVFS approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
