The algorithm is a combination of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm; in other words, it is a hybrid algorithm. The combination overcomes the deficiencies of the two algorithms when acting separately. The real distance between customers has been used on the basis of geographical information system (GIS) in order to make the result more suitable in real-life. The algorithm has tested on the examples of international standards. We made a comparison with the result of second nearest neighbor algorithm and genetic optimization algorithm. The test showed that the algorithm proposed in this paper has improved the results.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Optimization Algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem Based on Geographical Information System for Logistics Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968300034"}
