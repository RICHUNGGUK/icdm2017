In this work we introduce an information-based software framework useful to collaborate for inventive problems solving. This framework proposes the implementation of techniques from the Collective Intelligence (CI) research field in combination with the systematic methods provided by the TRIZ theory. Both approaches are centered in the human aspect of the innovation process, and are complementary. While CI focuses on the intelligent behavior that emerges in collaborative work, the TRIZ theory is centered in the individual capacity to solve problems systematically. The framework's objective is to improve the individual creativity provided by the TRIZ method and tools, with the value created by the collective contributions. This work aims to contribute formulating the basis to extend the research field of Computer Aided Innovation, to the next evolutionary step called \"Open CAI 2.0\". (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
