Neofytou, Revision of the characteristic-based scheme for incompressible flows, J. Comput. Phys. 222 (2007) 475484] has been further investigated. We have derived all the formulas for pressure and velocities from this revised CB method, which is based on the artificial compressibility method (ACM) [A.J. Chorin, A numerical solution for solving incompressible viscous flow problems, J. Comput. Phys. 2 (1967) 12]. Then we analyze the formulations of the original CB method [D. Drikakis, P.A. Govatsos, D.E. Papatonis, A characteristic based method for incompressible flows, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids 19 (1994) 667-685; E. Shapiro, D. Drikakis, Non-conservative and conservative formulations of characteristics numerical reconstructions for incompressible flows, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 66 (2006) 1466-1482; D. Drikakis, P.K. Smolarkiewicz, On spurious vortical structures, J. Comput. Phys. 172 (2001) 309-325; F. Mallinger, D. Drikakis, Instability in three-dimensional, unsteady stenotic flows, Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 23 (2002) 657-663; E. Shapiro, D. Drikakis, Artificial compressibility, characteristics-based schemes for variable density, incompressible, multi-species flows. Parts I. Derivation of different formulations and constant density limit, J. Comput. Phys. 210 (2005) 584-607; Y. Zhao, B. Zhang, A high-order characteristics upwind FV method for incompressible flow and heat transfer simulation on unstructured grids, Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 190 (5-7) (2000) 733-756] to investigate their consistency with the governing flow equations after convergence has been achieved. Furthermore we have implemented both formulations in an unstructured-grid finite volume solver [Y. Zhao, B. Zhang, A high-order characteristics upwind FV method for incompressible flow and heat transfer simulation on unstructured grids, Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 190 (5-7) (2000) 733-756]. Detailed numerical experiments show that both methods give almost identical solutions and convergence rates. Both can generate solutions which agree well with published results and experimental measurements. We thus conclude that both methods, being upwind schemes designed for the:ACM, have the same performances in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, even though the revised method is more complex with less stringent assumptions made, while the original CB method is simpler due to the use of extra simplifying assumptions.
