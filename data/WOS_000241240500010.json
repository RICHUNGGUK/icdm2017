This study uses the framework of TAM to explore the effect of intrinsic variables on technology beliefs and user behavior. Specifically, we examine the effect of cognitive absorption and playfulness on user beliefs including perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness within the context of mobile devices. Moreover, we manipulate the hedonic and utilitarian purpose of the mobile device to determine how the nature of the device influences user beliefs. Findings indicate that cognitive absorption and user playfulness significantly impact beliefs and that the hedonic or utilitarian orientation of the technology has implications for maximizing use.", "paper_title": "Mobile computing: a user study on hedonic/utilitarian mobile device usage", "paper_id": "WOS:000241240500010"}
