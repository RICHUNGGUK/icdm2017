First, since there exist packet dropouts when the information is transmitted through the band-limited channels, a novel compression compensation (C-C) method is proposed to ensure the integrity of transmission. Based on this method, a compound control strategy is established to deal with the data transmission synchronization problem under the band-limited channels. Then, a nonlinear switched system model with uncertainty is constructed, in which both the inter-sampler behavior and the packet dropouts behavior are considered. Furthermore, some more general stability results of the NLSCSs with band-limited channels are obtained by using a packet dropouts dependent Lyapunov functional method, and then the compound state feedback controller can be designed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
