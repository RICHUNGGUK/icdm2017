The damping characteristics and corresponding experiments on the double-tube hydraulic absorber are analyzed firstly, and its damping force model is also built. Then the working principle is introduced, and the structure and components of the physical shaking table are described, especially the hydraulic actuator, composed of servo valve controlled asymmetric cylinder with damping load, is analyzed. Considering parameter uncertainty, nonlinearity, asymmetry and time-variation of such hydraulic system, as well as repeatability of desired trajectory, an open-closed-loop ILC scheme is designed to solve the challenging control issue. The simulation and experiments are developed to verify the feasibility of working principle and the superiority of proposed control method. The hydraulically driven shaking table developed by discussed electro-hydraulic control technology has been applied in actual damping characteristic experiments for a serial of shock absorbers, and achieved satisfactory testing performance.
