The paper first presents a least wasted first strategy which evaluates the positions used by the rectangles. Then a random local search is introduced to improve the results and a least wasted first heuristic algorithm (LWF) is further developed to find a desirable solution. Twenty-one rectangular-packing instances are tested by the algorithm developed, the experimental results show that the presented algorithm can achieve an optimal solution within reasonable time and is fairly efficient for dealing the rectangular packing problem. LWF still performs well when it is extended to solve zero-waste and non-zero-waste strip packing instances. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
