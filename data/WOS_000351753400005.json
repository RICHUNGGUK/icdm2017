We focus on voice conversion (VC) attacks considered as one of the most challenging for modern recognition systems. To detect spoofing, most existing countermeasures assume explicit or implicit knowledge of a particular VC system and focus on designing discriminative features. In this paper, we explore back-end generative models for more generalized countermeasures. In particular, we model synthesis-channel subspace to perform speaker verification and antispoofing jointly in the i-vector space, which is a well-established technique for speaker modeling. It enables us to integrate speaker verification and antispoofing tasks into one system without any fusion techniques. To validate the proposed approach, we study vocoder-matched and vocoder-mismatched ASV and VC spoofing detection on the NIST 2006 speaker recognition evaluation data set. Promising results are obtained for standalone countermeasures as well as their combination with ASV systems using score fusion and joint approach.", "paper_title": "Joint Speaker Verification and Antispoofing in the i-Vector Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000351753400005"}
