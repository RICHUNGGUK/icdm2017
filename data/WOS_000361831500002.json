The method is based on the focused information criterion, and offers the possibility of fitting individual-tailored models. The focus of the research, that is, the purpose of the model, directs the selection. It is shown that using the focused information criterion leads to a graph with small mean squared error. The low mean squared error ensures accurate estimation using a graphical model; here estimation rather than explanation is the main objective. Two situations that commonly occur in practice are treated: a data-driven estimation of a graphical model and the improvement of an already pre-specified feasible model. The search algorithms are illustrated by means of data examples and are compared with existing methods in a simulation study.", "paper_title": "A focused information criterion for graphical models", "paper_id": "WOS:000361831500002"}
