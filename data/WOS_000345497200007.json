In this paper, we propose some improved (pseudo) preimage attacks on the Grostl hash function by using some techniques, such as subspace preimage attack and the guess-and-determine technique. We present the improved pseudo preimage attacks on 5-round Grost1-256 hash function and 8-round Grost1-512 hash function, and the complexities of these attacks are (2(239.90), 2(240.40)) (in time and memory) and (2(499.59), 2(499)), respectively. We also extend the pseudo preimage from 5 rounds to 6 rounds for Grost1-256 hash function, besides the biclique attack. Furthermore, we propose the pseudo second preimage attack on 6-round Grost1-256 hash function. The complexities of our 6-round (pseudo) preimage and second preimage attacks are (2(253.26), 2(253.67)) and (2(251.0), 2(252.0)), respectively. As far as we know, these are the best known preimage attacks on round-reduced Grostl hash function.", "paper_title": "Improved (Pseudo) Preimage Attack and Second Preimage Attack on Round-Reduced Grostl Hash Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000345497200007"}
