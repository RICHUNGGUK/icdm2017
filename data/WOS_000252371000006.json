The original publications on the AAPs had incomplete parts, making them insufficient to use on practical MANETs. Therefore, the first objective of the research was to complete the AAPs by filling in the missing gaps to make them operational. The missing procedures that were filled in have been developed based on the most logical procedures being accurate to the original protocol publications. The research in this paper finds applications in wireless networks that apply reduced addresses to achieve less memory usage, smaller overhead, and higher throughput (for example, the IPv6 low-power wireless personal address network (6LoWPAN)), but, as a result, possess a high address duplication probability. This research consists of two cases, where the first case deals with the message complexity analysis of the single-node joining case (SJC) and the second case deals with the complexity analysis of the MANET group merging case (GMC).", "paper_title": "Message complexity analysis of mobile ad hoc network address autoconfiguration protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000252371000006"}
