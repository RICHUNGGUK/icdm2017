Considering no movement for a network of gas sensors, this paper formulates the problem of odor plume detection and analytically finds the optimal spatial configuration of the sensors for plume detection, given a set of assumptions. This solution was analyzed and verified by simulations and finally experimentally validated in a reduced scale realistic environment using a set of Roomba-based mobile robots.", "paper_title": "Optimal spatial formation of swarm robotic gas sensors in odor plume finding", "paper_id": "WOS:000321760900001"}
