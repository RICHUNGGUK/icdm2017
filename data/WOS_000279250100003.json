For a particular set of basis functions B* = {AND, OR, NOT, XOR, MUX}, we give a canonical form representation for C-B*. so that the set of canonical form formulas consists of only NPN-representatives in C-B*..", "paper_title": "NPN-Representatives of a Set of Optimal Boolean Formulas", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250100003"}
