However, in a fuzzy environment, two other issues, i.e., consistency and reciprocity, are also arisen in such matrices with at least one fuzzy component. In this paper, a single-decision-making optimization model along with two group-decision-making optimization models are developed towards prioritization in fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. A comprehensive numerical analysis is performed to validate the proposed models. Finally, some conclusions are reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
