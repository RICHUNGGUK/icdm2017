Specifically, we consider a variant of J. Kleinberg's grid-based small-world model in which (1) the number of long-range edges of each node is not fixed, but is drawn from a power-law probability distribution with exponent parameter and constant mean, and (2) the long-range edges are considered to be bidirectional for the purposes of routing. This model is motivated by empirical observations indicating that several real networks have degrees that follow a power-law distribution. The measured power-law exponent for these networks is often in the range between 2 and 3. For the small-world model we consider, we show that when the standard greedy routing algorithm, in which a node forwards the message to its neighbor that is closest to the target in the grid, finishes in an expected number of steps, for any source-target pair. This is asymptotically smaller than the steps needed in Kleinberg's original model with the same average degree, and approaches as approaches 2. Further, we show that when or the expected number of steps is , while for it is . We complement these results with lower bounds that match the upper bounds within at most a factor.", "paper_title": "Greedy routing in small-world networks with power-law degrees", "paper_id": "WOS:000339719700001"}
