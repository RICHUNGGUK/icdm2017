Making such a digital library adaptive to any new ontology or to reorganize knowledge automatically is our main objective. The decomposition of the knowledge base into classes is a first step toward our main objective. In this paper, we will demonstrate an automated linking scheme for PubMed citations with GO terms using an improved version of extreme learning machine (ELM) type algorithms. ELM is an emergent technology, which has shown excellent performance in large data classification problems, with fast learning speeds.", "paper_title": "Classifying Lung Cancer Knowledge in PubMed According to GO Terms Using Extreme Learning Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000342345100004"}
