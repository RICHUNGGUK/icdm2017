Actions are described as series of successive human body poses. Action videos representation is based on fuzzy vector quantization, while action classification is performed by a novel classification algorithm, the so-called Sparsity-based Learning Machine (SbLM), involving two optimization steps. The first one determines a non-linear data mapping to a high-dimensional feature space determined by an I1-minimization process exploiting an overcomplete dictionary formed by the training samples. The second one, involves a training process in order to determine the optimal separating hyperplanes in the resulted high-dimensional feature space. The performance of the proposed human action recognition method is evaluated on two publicly available action recognition databases aiming at different application scenarios. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
