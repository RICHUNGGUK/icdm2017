The algorithm is capable of distinguishing between clusters and noisy background data and finds an arbitrary number of clusters of arbitrary shape. These properties render the approach particularly useful for visual scene segmentation into arbitrarily shaped homogeneous regions. We present several application examples, and in order to highlight the advantages and the weaknesses of our method, we systematically compare the results with those from standard methods such as the k-means and Ward's linkage clustering. The analysis demonstrates that not only the clustering ability of the proposed algorithm is more powerful than those of the two concurrent methods, the time complexity of the method is also more modest than that of its generally used strongest competitor.", "paper_title": "Hebbian Self-Organizing Integrate-and-Fire Networks for Data Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000272873400009"}
