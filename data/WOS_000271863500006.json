Both approaches represent human activities as time series of discrete observations. In the first approach, we extract a feature vector from each frame, based on the relative configuration of human body parts against a fence. In the second approach, we propose a novel concept called \"stable contact\", to decompose the continuous human activities into adjacent but disjoint time intervals called primitive intervals. We then define a primitive motion unit (PMU) on each primitive interval with three attributes, thus converting each continuous activity into a sequence of PMUs. With the time series representations, we utilize Hidden Markov Model (HMM) techniques for recognition, including decoding in the first approach and searching in the second approach. Experimental results, on a set of image sequences with mixed human actions including walking and climbing a fence, show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. We compare the two approaches and discuss their applicability in different scenarios.", "paper_title": "RECOGNIZING PERSONS CLIMBING FENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271863500006"}
