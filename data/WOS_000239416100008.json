Our experiments show that this attack is effective and scalable. By combining the flow separation method and frequency spectrum matching method, a passive attacker can get the traffic map of the mix network. We use a non-trivial network to show that the combined attack works. The experiments also show that multicast traffic can be dangerous for anonymity networks.", "paper_title": "Unmixing mix traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000239416100008"}
