In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms based on split Bregman iteration to solve sparse group lasso problems, including a synthesis prior form and an analysis prior form. These algorithms have low computational complexity and are suitable for large scale problems. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is also discussed. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are used for magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Split Bregman algorithms for sparse group Lasso with application to MRI reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000357298100013"}
