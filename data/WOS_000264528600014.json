However, the research considering users' preferences on context-aware computing is a relatively insufficient research field. Hence, this paper aims to propose an agent-based framework for providing the personalized services using context history on context-aware computing. Based on the proposed framework, we implement a prototype system to show the feasibility of the framework. Previous researches require that the users input their preference manually, but this research provides the personalized services extracting the relationship between users' profile and services under the same context automatically.
