Considering the fact that the two functions are usually complementary, it is necessary to integrate them more tightly so that performance of a manufacturing system can be improved greatly. In this paper, a new integration model and a modified genetic algorithm-based approach have been developed to facilitate the integration and optimization of the two functions. In the model, process planning and scheduling functions are carried out simultaneously. In order to improve the optimized performance of the modified genetic algorithm-based approach, more efficient genetic representations and operator schemes have been developed. Experimental studies have been conducted and the comparisons have been made between this approach and others to indicate the superiority and adaptability of this method. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is a promising and very effective method for the integration of process planning and scheduling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
