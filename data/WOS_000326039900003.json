The dual minimum distance and minimum weight of such codes are studied from a geometric point of view. In many cases we completely describe the minimum-weight codewords of their dual codes through a geometric characterization of the supports, and provide their number. Finally, we apply our results to describe Goppa codes of classical interest on such curves.", "paper_title": "On the dual minimum distance and minimum weight of codes from a quotient of the Hermitian curve", "paper_id": "WOS:000326039900003"}
