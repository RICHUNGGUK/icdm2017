For various classes of quantified Boolean formulas and various classes of Boolean functions, we investigate the problem of determining whether a model exists. Furthermore, we show for these classes the complexity of the model checking problem, which is to check whether a given set of Boolean functions is a model for a formula. For classes of Boolean functions, we establish some characterizations in terms of classes of quantified Boolean formulas that have such a model.", "paper_title": "Boolean functions as models for quantified Boolean formulas", "paper_id": "WOS:000246356000002"}
