In the proposed algorithm the face is normalized for geometry and luminance, and Fourier-Bessel (FB) descriptors are extracted from three locations in the eyes region (local analysis). The resulting representations are embedded in a dissimilarity space, where each image is represented by its distance to all the other images, and a Pseudo-Fisher discriminator is built. Using the FERET database, we submitted the system to a battery of tests under a wide variation of imaging conditions, including expression, age, and illumination variations. Results showed that the system outperformed previous state-of-the-art methods in most testing conditions. To deal with partial occlusions, we implemented an occluded region detector that resulted in low performance loss under up to 50% occlusion level. Finally, we automated the registration step by implementing face and eye detection algorithms. We also showed that the local-FB analysis outperforms the global-FB version of the system and an alternative polar frequency representation. In conclusion, the intermediate-scale local analysis approach used in the proposed system resulted in state-of-the-art face verification performance and high robustness to common problems such as expression, age, and illumination variations and to strong occlusions.
