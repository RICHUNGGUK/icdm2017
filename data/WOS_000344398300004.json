It has better scalability than the n-star graph and holds some good properties compared with the hypercube. This paper focuses on the design of the fault-tolerant routing algorithm for the (n, k)-star graph. We adopt the idea of collecting the limited global information used for routing on the n-star graph to the (n, k)-star graph. In the preliminary version of this paper, we built the probabilistic safety vector (PSV) with modified cycle patterns and developed the routing algorithm to decide the fault-free routing path with the help of PSV. Afterwards, we observed that the routing performance of PSV gets worse as the percentage of fault nodes increases, especially it exceeds 25%. In order to improve the routing performance with more faulty nodes, an adaptive method of threshold assignment for the PSV is also proposed. The performance is judged by the average length of routing paths. Compared with distance first search and safety level, PSV with dynamic threshold gets the best performance in the simulations.", "paper_title": "AN ADAPTIVE HEURISTIC ALGORITHM WITH THE PROBABILISTIC SAFETY VECTOR FOR FAULT-TOLERANT ROUTING ON THE (n, k)-STAR GRAPH", "paper_id": "WOS:000344398300004"}
