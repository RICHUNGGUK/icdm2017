The situation of backsourcing clearly has major implications for an organization in terms of monetary investments, IS infrastructure and changes in employee requirements during and after the process. The paper considers a detailed analysis of two case studies of backsourcing reported from JP Morgan Chase (USA) and Sainsbury (UK). A major contribution of the paper is to identify important strategies to be followed in backsourcing projects to ensure efficient knowledge re-integration.", "paper_title": "Considerations for Information Systems \"Backsourcing\": A Framework for Knowledge Re-integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000289568800005"}
