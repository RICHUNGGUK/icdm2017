It is assumed that facilitation has profound effects on decision making, but these effects are understudied and empirically unproven. By incorporating the three levels of facilitation, pre-task, combined pre-task and in-task, and combined pre-task, in-task, and post-task, in the design of a simulation-based interactive learning environment (ILE), this study provides an empirical, laboratory-experiment-based evaluation of the effectiveness of facilitation on performance in dynamic tasks. We develop and use a comprehensive model consisting of four evaluation criteria: task performance, structural knowledge, heuristics knowledge, and transfer learning. We find that the subjects provided with combined pre-task, in-task, and post-task facilitation performed the best, followed by those provided with combined pretask and in-task facilitation. Contrary to the hypothesis, subjects provided with pre-task facilitation performed poorly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
