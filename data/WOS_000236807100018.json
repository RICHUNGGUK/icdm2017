In this paper, we derive a multiscale model to represent natural images based on the scale-space representation: a model that has an inspiration in the human visual system. We first derive the one-dimensional case and then extend the results to two and three dimensions. The operators obtained for analysis and synthesis stages are derivatives of the Gaussian smoothing kernel, so that, for the two-dimensional case, we can represent them either in a rotated coordinate system or in terms of directional derivatives. The method to perform the rotation is efficient because it is implemented by means of the application of the so-called generalized binomial filters. Such a family of discrete sequences fulfills a number of properties that allows estimating the local orientation for several image structures. We also define the discrete counterpart in which the coordinate normalization of the continuous case is approximated as a subsampling of the discrete domain.", "paper_title": "The multiscale hermite transform for local orientation analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000236807100018"}
