When a user's private key is compromised, it is important for him/her to revoke his/her key. Up to now, little work has been published on key revocation in IBE systems. We propose a low-complexity key update technique to solve the revocation problem in an IBE system in which any revoked user is able to re-join the system without changing his or her identity or re-setup the system.
