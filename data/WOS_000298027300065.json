Many algorithms, methods and properties have been proposed to deal with microdata disclosure. One of the emerging concepts in microdata protection is k-anonymity, introduced by Samarati and Sweeney. k-Anonymity provides a simple and efficient approach to protect private individual information and is gaining increasing popularity, k-Anonymity requires that every record in the microdata table released be indistinguishably related to no fewer than k respondents. In this paper, we apply the concept of entropy to propose a distance metric to evaluate the amount of mutual information among records in microdata, and propose a method of constructing dependency tree to find the key attributes, which we then use to process approximate microaggregation. Further, we adopt this new microaggregation technique to study k-anonymity problem, and an efficient algorithm is developed. Experimental results show that the proposed microaggregation technique is efficient and effective in the terms of running time and information loss.
