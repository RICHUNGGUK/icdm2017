To a system R of equivalence relations we associate a graph G(R). We observe that if R is semirigid then the graph G(R) is 2-connected. We show that the converse holds if all the members of R are atoms of the lattice E of equivalence relations on A. We present a notion of graphical composition of semirigid systems and show that it preserves semirigidity.", "paper_title": "Semirigid Equivalence Relations on a Finite Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000270436400010"}
