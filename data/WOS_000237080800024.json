Since grid technologies are applied in network widely, resources can be shared more conveniently. We want to apply these technologies to our solution and build a grid application called Manufacturing Grid (MG). In our solution we adopt thoughts of peer-to-peer system to construct manufacturing grid architecture. Through creating classifications dynamically, presentation of resources is solved simply. Distributed hash table (DHT) is introduced to our solution for quickly locating requested resources. Then we present algorithms based on classifications and DHT to resolve the most important issues for resource sharing, resource publishing and searching. We also discussed the issue about fuzzy searching of resource caused by DHT. Finally, we build a prototype system to testify that our solution is feasible and efficient.", "paper_title": "A solution for resource sharing in manufacturing grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800024"}
