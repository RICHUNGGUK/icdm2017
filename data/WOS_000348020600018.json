As a case study we consider a real deployment and routing problem in RoRo-shipping. Computational results show that the rolling horizon heuristic yields good solutions to the integrated problem within reasonable time. It is also shown that significantly better solutions are obtained when speed optimization is integrated with the planning of shipping routes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
