A new multi-echo ultra-fast firing method increases the sonar acquisition rate, and provides crossed measurements without interference. A feature map is built on-line using Bayesian updating and classification rules. Three classifiers are implemented and analyzed: minimum risk (MR), maximum a posteriori (MAP), and minimum distance (MD). Experimental results of ultrasonic reflector recognition, using data collected in a specular indoor environment are presented in the paper.", "paper_title": "A fast firing binaural system for ultrasonic pattern recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000249900600002"}
