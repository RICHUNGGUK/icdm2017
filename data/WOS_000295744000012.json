In the past the castle exhibited a wide damage, and to prevent its ruination, restoration works were executed in the eighties of the last century. Using the finite element technique, a 3D numerical model of the castle has been built that has been used to identify the main sources of the damages and assess the effectiveness of the restoration works. The paper shows that advanced numerical analyses could offer significant information both for the understanding of the causes of existing damage and the minimum and adequate design of strengthening. The understanding of the structural behaviour can indeed reduce the extent of the remedial measures, offering efficient strengthening tools. (C) 2011 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
