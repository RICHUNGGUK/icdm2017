Let Y be a random k-dimensional subcomplex of Delta(n-1) obtained by starting with the full (k - 1)-dimensional skeleton of Delta(n-1) and then adding each k-simplex independently with probability p. Let H(k-1) (Y; R) denote the (k - 1)dimensional reduced homology group of Y with coefficients in a finite abelian group R. It is shown that for any fixed R and k >= 1 and for any function omega(n) that tends to infinity lim(n ->infinity) Pr[H(k-1) (Y;R) = 0] = {0 p = k log n - omega (n)/n 1 p = k log n + omega (n)/n (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
