In such systems, admission control plays an important role: the system has to employ a proper strategy to make admission control decisions and reserve resources for the coming requests thus to achieve greater profits without violating the QoS of the requests already admitted. In this paper, we introduce three essential admission control strategies with threshold on resource reservation and a newly proposed strategy with layered threshold. Through comprehensive theoretical analyses and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the strategy with layered threshold is more efficient and flexible than the existing strategies for Grid-based multimedia services systems.
