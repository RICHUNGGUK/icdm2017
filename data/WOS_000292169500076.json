This process reduces the number of features by removing irrelevant, noisy, and redundant data, thus resulting in acceptable classification accuracy. Feature selection is a preprocessing technique with great importance in the fields of data analysis and information retrieval processing, pattern classification, and data mining applications. This paper presents a novel optimization algorithm called catfish binary particle swarm optimization (CatfishBPSO), in which the so-called catfish effect is applied to improve the performance of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO). This effect is the result of the introduction of new particles into the search space (\"catfish particles\"), which replace particles with the worst fitness by the initialized at extreme points of the search space when the fitness of the global best particle has not improved for a number of consecutive iterations. In this study, the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to evaluate the quality of the solutions. CatfishBPSO was applied and compared to 10 classification problems taken from the literature. Experimental results show that CatfishBPSO simplifies the feature selection process effectively, and either obtains higher classification accuracy or uses fewer features than other feature selection methods.
