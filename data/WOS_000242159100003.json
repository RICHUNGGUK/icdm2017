The QNFN model is a four-layer structure. Layer 2 of the QNFN model contains quantum membership functions, which are multilevel activation functions. Each quantum membership function is composed of the sum of sigmoid functions shifted by quantum intervals. A self-constructing learning algorithm, which consists of the self-clustering algorithm (SCA) and the backpropagation algorithm, is also proposed. The proposed the SCA method is a fast, one-pass algorithm for a dynamic estimation of the number of clusters in an input data space. The backpropagation algorithm is used to tune the adjustable parameters. Simulation results were conducted to show the performance and applicability of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A self-organizing quantum neural fuzzy network and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000242159100003"}
