The hub number of G, denoted by h(G), is the minimum size of a hub set in G. The connected hub number of G, denoted by h(c)(G), is the minimum size of a connected hub set in G. In this paper, we prove that h(G) = h(c)(G) for co-comparability graphs G and characterize the case for which gamma(c)(G) = h(c)(G) in this class of graphs, where gamma(c)(G) denotes the connected domination number of G. We also show that h(G) can be computed in 0 (vertical bar V vertical bar) time for trapezoid graphs and in 0(vertical bar V vertical bar(3)) time for co-comparability graphs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
