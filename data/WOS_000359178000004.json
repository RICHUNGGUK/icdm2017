In this paper, we investigate how performance engineers can identify three different classes of externally-visible performance problems (global delays, partial delays, periodic delays) from concrete traces. We develop a simulation model based on a taxonomy of root causes in server performance degradation. Within an experimental setup, we obtain results through synthetic monitoring of a target Web service, and observe changes in Web performance over time through exploratory visual analysis and changepoint detection. We extend our analysis and apply our methods to real-user monitoring (RUM) data. In a use case study, we discuss how our underlying model can be applied to real performance data gathered from a multinational, high-traffic website in the financial sector. Finally, we interpret our findings and discuss various challenges and pitfalls.", "paper_title": "IDENTIFYING WEB PERFORMANCE DEGRADATIONS THROUGH SYNTHETIC AND REAL-USER MONITORING", "paper_id": "WOS:000359178000004"}
