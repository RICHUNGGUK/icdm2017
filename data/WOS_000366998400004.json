Thus, it's difficult to design a testbed system for network working under such circumstance. Different from traditional software simulation or vehicle-loaded methods, a remote network performance testbed system is proposed in this paper. The main idea of our proposed system is using the rotary motion to create such velocity-changing context. Then, we designed and realized a high speed rotary turntable platforms. Nodes can be deployed on the rotary platform, thus it can movement with the platform at a high speed (up to 168 km/h) during test. Shown by the experiments, the approach is simple, efficient and reliable. The reason of network packet loss in our testbed is also analyzed and tested in this research.", "paper_title": "A Remote Testbed System for Mobile Ad-hoc/Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000366998400004"}
