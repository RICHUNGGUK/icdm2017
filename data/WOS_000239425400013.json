We present a new technique for achieving drastic state space reductions that can be applied to a very wide range of concurrent systems, namely any system specified as a rewrite theory. Given a rewrite theory R = (Sigma, E, R) whose equational part (Sigma, E) specifies some state predicates P, we identify a subset S C R of rewrite rules that are P-invisible, so that rewriting with S does not change the truth value of the predicates P. We then use S to construct a reduced rewrite theory R/S in which all states reachable by S-transitions become identified. We show that if R/S satisfies reasonable executability assumptions, then it is in fact stuttering bisimilar to R and therefore both satisfy the same CTL_* X formulas. We can then use the typically much smaller R/S to verify such formulas. We show through several case studies that the reductions achievable this way can be huge in practice. Furthermore, we also present a generalization of our construction that instead uses a stuttering simulation and can be applied to an even broader class of systems.", "paper_title": "State space reduction of rewrite theories using invisible transitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425400013"}
