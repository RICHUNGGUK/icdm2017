With the homogeneous delivery capability of nodes, the global dynamic routing strategy proposed by Ling et al. [Phys. Rev. E 81, 016113 (2010)] adequately uses the dynamic information during the process and thus it can reach a quite high network capacity. In this paper, based on the global dynamic routing strategy, we proposed a heterogeneous delivery allocation strategy of nodes on scale-free networks with consideration of nodes degree. It is found that the network capacity as well as some other indexes reflecting transportation efficiency are further improved. Our work may be useful for the design of more efficient routing strategies in communication or transportation systems.", "paper_title": "Heterogeneous delivering capability promotes traffic efficiency in complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351730300010"}
