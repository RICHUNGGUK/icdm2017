These noisy components show autocorrelated and nonstationary properties that limit the efficacy of standard techniques (i.e. time filtering and general linear model). Herein we describe a novel approach based on the combination of singular spectrum analysis and adaptive filtering, which allows a greater noise reduction and yields better connectivity estimates between regions at rest, providing a new feasible procedure to analyze fMRI data.", "paper_title": "SINGULAR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS AND ADAPTIVE FILTERING ENHANCE THE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY ANALYSIS OF RESTING STATE fMRI DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000332040900006"}
