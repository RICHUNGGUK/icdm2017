MGF applies multi-scale analysis on image gradient information, which can discover underlying inherent structure in images and keep the details at most while removing varying lighting. The proposed approach provides state-of-the-art performance on Extended YaleB and PIE: Recognition rates of 99.11% achieved on PIE database and 99.38% achieved on YaleB which outperforms most existing approaches. Furthermore, the experimental results on noised Yale-B validate that MGF is more robust to image noise.", "paper_title": "MULTI-SCALE GRADIENT INVARIANT FOR FACE RECOGNITION UNDER VARYING ILLUMINATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000315523100003"}
