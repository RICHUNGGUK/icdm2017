Moreover, this problem is challenging due to the fact that the design matrix has a complicated structure. The identification of the active factors in supersaturated designs is investigated. The singular value decomposition (SVD), principal components analysis and regression analysis are used together in an SVD, principal regression method to reveal the hidden true linear model. Special cases are studied by using simulation data under idealized conditions. Simulations are used to investigate the performance of the method and also to compare the proposed method with other known methods from the literature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
