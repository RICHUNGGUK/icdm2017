By placing constraints on the design domain in terms of number and variable size of repeating patterns along any direction, the conceptual design for buildings is facilitated. To substantiate the potential future applications of this work, examples within the context of high-rise building design are presented. Successful development of such ideas can contribute to practical engineering solutions, especially during the building design process. Examples are given to illustrate the ideas developed both in two-dimensional and three-dimensional building configurations.", "paper_title": "Application of layout and topology optimization using pattern gradation for the conceptual design of buildings", "paper_id": "WOS:000287865600002"}
