The class of nonlinear systems is represented by a discrete-time state-space model involving repeated scalar nonlinearities that cover several types of frequently investigated nonlinearities as special cases. A number of stochastic variables, all of which are mutually independent but satisfy a certain probabilistic distribution in the interval [0, 1], are introduced to account for the packet dropout phenomena occurring in the channels from the original system to the networked sensors. The concept of average H-infinity index is first introduced to measure the overall performance of the sensor networks. Then, by utilising available measurement information from not only each individual sensor but also its neighbouring sensors according a given topology, stability analysis is carried out to obtain sufficient conditions for ensuring stochastic stability as well as the prescribed average H-infinity performance constraint. The solution of the parameters of the distributed filters is characterised in terms of the feasibility of a convex optimisation problem. Finally, a simulation study is conducted for a factory production line in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Distributed H-infinity filtering for repeated scalar nonlinear systems with random packet losses in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292760000007"}
