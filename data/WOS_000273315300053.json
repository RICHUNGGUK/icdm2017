We introduce the graph camera, a non-pinhole with rays that circumvent occluders to create a single layer image that shows simultaneously several regions of interest in a 3-D scene. The graph camera image exhibits good continuity and little redundancy. The graph camera model is literally a graph of tens of planar pinhole cameras. A fast projection operation allows rendering in feed-forward fashion, at interactive rates, which provides support for dynamic scenes. The graph camera is an infrastructure level tool with many applications. We explore the graph camera benefits in the contexts of virtual 3-D scene exploration and summarization, and in the context of real-world 3-D scene visualization. The graph camera allows integrating multiple video feeds seamlessly, which enables monitoring complex real-world spaces with a single image.", "paper_title": "The Graph Camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000273315300053"}
