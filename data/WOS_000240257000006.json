In TICC, a component interface describes both the behavior of a component, and the component's assumptions on the environment's behavior. Ticc can check the compatibility of such interfaces, and analyze their emergent behavior, via a symbolic implementation of game-theoretic algorithms.", "paper_title": "TICC: A tool for interface compatibility and composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240257000006"}
