Numerical experiments show that the amount of IFFTS in the proposed NN can be reduced to half, and its computational time can be reduced by 21.5% compared with a conventional NN. In comparison with the SLM, the proposed NN is effective to achieve high PAPR reduction and it has an advantage over the SLM under the equal computational condition.", "paper_title": "Complexity Suppression of Neural Networks for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signal", "paper_id": "WOS:000282245600017"}
