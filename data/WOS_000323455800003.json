We characterize the optimal secrecy DoF (SDoF) region and show that it can be achieved by a simple artificial noise alignment scheme. The proposed scheme sends the confidential messages superposed with the artificial noise over several time slots. Exploiting delayed CSI, the transmitter aligns the transmit signal in such a way that the useful message can be extracted at the intended receiver but is completely drowned by the artificial noise at the unintended receiver. The proposed scheme can be regarded as a nontrivial extension of Maddah-Ali Tse scheme and enables us to quantify the resource overhead, or equivalently the DoF loss, to be paid for the secure communications.", "paper_title": "Secrecy Degrees of Freedom of MIMO Broadcast Channels With Delayed CSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800003"}
