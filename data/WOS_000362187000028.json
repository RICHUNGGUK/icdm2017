This optimization scheme exploits intrinsic graph structures in order to describe geometric data relationships in the so-called ELM space. Kernel formulations of the approach operating in ELM spaces of arbitrary dimensions are also provided. It is shown that the application of the optimization scheme exploiting geometric data relationships in the original ELM space is equivalent to the application of the original S-ELM to a transformed ELM space. The experimental results show that the incorporation of geometric data relationships in S-ELM can lead to enhanced performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
