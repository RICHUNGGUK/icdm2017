The method involves two processes: interpolation-based hole-filling, which produces an initial repaired model, and postprocessing, which adjusts the shape of the initial repaired model to conform to that of the original model. In the interpolation-based hole-filling process, a surface interpolation algorithm based on the radial basis function creates a smooth implicit surface that fills the hole. Then, a regularized marching tetrahedral algorithm is used to triangulate the implicit surface. Finally, a stitching and regulating strategy is applied to the surface patch and its neighboring boundary polygon meshes to produce an initial repaired mesh model, which is a regular mesh model suitable for postprocessing. During postprocessing, a sharpness-dependent filtering algorithm is applied to the initial repaired model. This is an iterative procedure whereby each iteration step adjusts the face normal associated with each meshed polygon to recover the sharp features hidden in the repaired model. The experiment results demonstrate that the method is effective in repairing incomplete 3D mesh models.", "paper_title": "A sharpness-dependent filter for recovering sharp features in repaired 3D mesh models", "paper_id": "WOS:000250787500017"}
