In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous cartoon gesture recognition method with applications. Firstly, heterogeneous features with different dimensions are assigned to express cartoon and human-subject images according to their characteristics. Then for recognition, we simultaneously integrate shared structure learning (SSL) and graph-based transductive learning into a joint framework to learn reliable classifiers on heterogeneous features. Provided with the framework, the similarities between cartoon and human-subject gestures can be quantitatively evaluated in a cross-feature manner. Extensive experiments on self-defined datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. Finally, applications illustrate the usages in various aspects of 2D cartoon industry.
