However, existing manifold learning algorithms either neglect one of them or have limitation on describing them. In this paper, we proposed a new two-step framework that fusing the global and local information to unfold highly nonlinear data. It first learns the global structures via a new method-Distance Penalization Embedding and then refines the local structures by semi-supervised manifold learning algorithms. The effectiveness of the method has been verified by experimental results on both simulation and real world data sets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
