In this paper, we show that for such TIN-optimal interference channels, even if the message set is expanded to include an independent message from each transmitter to each receiver, operating the new channel as the original interference channel and treating interference as noise is still optimal for the sum capacity up to a constant gap. Furthermore, we extend the result to the sum-GDoF optimality of TIN in the general setting of X channels with arbitrary numbers of transmitters and receivers.", "paper_title": "On the Optimality of Treating Interference as Noise: General Message Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000356301600008"}
