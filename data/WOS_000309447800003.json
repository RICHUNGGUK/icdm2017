The governing equations for the three-dimensional flow are developed. Similarity transformations are invoked for the conversion of nonlinear partial differential equations into the coupled system of ordinary differential equations. Computations for the series solution are presented through implementation of homotopy analysis method. The salient features of the involved parameters have been pointed out.
