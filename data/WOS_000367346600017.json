On the way, we highlight the wealth of exotic beasts that hide amongst the extensive operational and structural similarities that the theory shares with more traditional arenas of categorical quantum mechanics, such as the category fdHilb. We conclude our journey by proving that fRel is local, but not without some unexpected twists.", "paper_title": "A Bestiary of Sets and Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000367346600017"}
