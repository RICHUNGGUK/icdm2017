The model checking algorithm is given. Furthermore, we present a probabilistic epistemic temporal logic, called mu PETL, which generalizes p-calculus by adding probabilistic knowledge modality'. Similar to mu-calculus, mu PETL is a succinct and expressive language. It is showed that temporal modalities such as \"always\", \"sometime\" and \"until\", and probabilistic knowledge modalities such as \"probabilistic knowledge\" and \"probabilistic common knowledge\" can be expressed in such a logic. PETL is proven to be a sublogic of mu PETL. The model checking technique for mu PETL is also studied.", "paper_title": "Model checking for epistemic and temporal properties of uncertain agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100008"}
