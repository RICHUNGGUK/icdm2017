In addition to the video of the real actor, his actions were applied to five virtual body shapes: a low- and high-resolution virtual counterpart, a cartoon-like character, a wooden mannequin, and a zombie-like character (Figures 1 and 2). In a point light condition, we also tested whether the absence of a body affected the perceived emotion of the movements. Participants were asked to rate the actions based on a list of 41 more complex emotions. We found that the perception of emotional actions is highly robust and to the most part independent of the character's body, so long as form is present. When motion alone is present, emotions were generally perceived as less intense than in the cases where form was present.", "paper_title": "Investigating the Role of Body Shape on the Perception of Emotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000271212000002"}
