Inherited LU factorization is a type of LU factorization which is very faster and simpler than the traditional LU factorization. In this case, we prove some theorems to introduce the conditions that the inherited LU factorization exists for the coefficient matrix of fuzzy linear system. The examples illustrate that the proposed method can be used in order to find the solution of a fuzzy linear system simply.", "paper_title": "Inherited LU factorization for solving fuzzy system of linear equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000313009200012"}
