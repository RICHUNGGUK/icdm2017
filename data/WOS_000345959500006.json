For an algebra, the family of all such fuzzy relations is a complete lattice; its structure and cut properties are investigated and fully described. These fuzzy weak congruences are applied in representation of complete and algebraic lattices. A wider class of lattices can be represented in such a fuzzy framework, than in classical algebra. We prove that there is a straightforward representation of any complete lattice, using it as a co-domain. In a more general case, it is proved that several subdirect powers of lattices are also representable by fuzzy weak congruences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
