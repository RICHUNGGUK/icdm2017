In an attempt to establish metal binding effect in biological systems, we have considered the various forms of zinc (II) complexes of 4-MeIm. The computations were performed at the B3LYP and PW91P86 levels with 6-311++G(d,P) standard basis set. Calculated EFG tensors were used to determine N-14 and H-2 nuclear quadrupole coupling constant, chi and asymmetry parameter, eta. The results show that Zn2+ has a strong effect on the NQR parameters (chi. eta) of proximal nitrogen in contrast with the remote nitrogen. In addition, EFG tensors at the Zn nuclear site were calculated for Zn-4-MeIm complexes and estimated the chi and eta values of Zn-67. The influence of the bulk solvent was investigated at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level using the polarizable continuum model. Finally, we predicted (chi = 1.95 MHz, eta = 0.84) for proximal nitrogen, (chi = 2.38 MHz, eta = 0.07) for remote nitrogen and (chi = 1.28 MHz, eta = 0.22) for Zn in superoxide dismutase.
