Previously, the alternating group graph was shown to be pancyclic, i.e., containing cycles of all possible lengths. In this article, we further show that the alternating group graph remains pancyclic, even if there are up to 2n - 6 edge faults, where n >= 3 is the dimension of the alternating group graph. The result is optimal with respect to the number of edge faults tolerated. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
