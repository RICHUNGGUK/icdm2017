By expanding the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a new research model, known as the mobile services acceptance model (MSAM), is proposed. Based on the research model, seven research hypotheses are presented. The proposed research model and research hypotheses were empirically tested using data collected from a survey of users of a mobile service, extended Mobile Student Information Systems (eMSIS), at a Norwegian university. The findings indicate that the fitness of the research model is good. Support was also found for the seven research hypotheses. Among the factors, the personal initiatives and characteristics has the strongest influence on the intention to use eMSIS.", "paper_title": "Adoption of mobile information services: An empirical study", "paper_id": "WOS:000333531200001"}
