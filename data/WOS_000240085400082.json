Here, we apply a novel ensemble decision approach to extract the relevant SNPs for alcoholism using sib-pair IBD profiles of pedigrees. The results indicate that ensemble decision tree is a promising algorithm for mining genetic markers for complex genetic diseases.", "paper_title": "Analysis of sib-pair IBD profiles using ensemble decision tree approach: Application to alcoholism", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400082"}
