Some designs were specifically made for people with disabilities such as injured-vertebra, apoplexy or poliomyelitis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Motor Neuron Disease, (MIND). In this paper, we proposed an eye-movement tracking system. Based on Electro-Oculography (EOG) technology we detected the signal with different directions in eye-movements and then analyzed to understand what they represented about (e.g. horizontal direction or vertical direction). We converted the analog signal to digital signal and then used as the control signals for Human-Computer Interface (HCI). In order to make the system \"robust\", several applications with EOG-based HCI had been designed. Our preliminary results revealed more than 90% accuracy rate for examining the eye-movement that may become a new useful human-machine user interface in the near future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
