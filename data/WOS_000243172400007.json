For such human-in-the-loop systems, this paper implements a hierarchical supervision system to guarantee that remote human-issued commands meet required specifications. In the presented scheme, Petri nets are applied to model, design, and verify both the local controller and the remote supervisor. Then, the agent technology is adopted to implement the supervisor as an intelligent agent for an online supervision of the remote control system. Hence, undesired resource conflicts and deadlock states can be avoided. An application to a flexible manufacturing system controlled over the Internet is provided to illustrate the developed approach. Implementation results show that by applying the presented hierarchical scheme, the supervisor has a more compact model with fewer states. Moreover, fewer request/response transmissions are consumed so that the effects of time delays and packet losses across the Internet could be moderated.", "paper_title": "Implementation of a remote hierarchical supervision system using Petri nets and agent technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000243172400007"}
