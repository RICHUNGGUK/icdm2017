This work infers that the representation of performance matrices of a matching network like sensitivity and harmonic rejection; in terms of input reflection coefficient (S (11)) is more convenient than the transfer functions. Expression of S (11) of widely used L-, pi- and T-networks have been derived as a function of inductor quality factor (Q (L) ), capacitor quality factor (Q (C) ) and transformation ratio. This formulation shows that the matching performance degrades severely due to component non-idealities. To circumvent this degradation, a modified set of design equations have been proposed for the L-network and the same has been extended for pi- and T-network. Simulation results show that network synthesized on the basis of proposed set of equations nullify the effect of non-idealities by 70-80% in L-network and 10-20% in pi-network but minor improvement in T-network.", "paper_title": "Parasitic aware impedance matching techniques for RF amplifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000298604100008"}
