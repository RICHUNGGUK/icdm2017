The general high-order floating immittances can also be obtained from the proposed general high-order grounded immittances with some circuit modifications. The proposed immittance structures are designed based on an analytical synthesis method. General nth-order grounded immittance function required 2n + 1 CCs, 2n + 1 grounded resistors and n grounded capacitors. General nth-order floating immittance function required 2n + 2 CCs, 2n + 1 resistors and n grounded capacitors. General high-order voltage-mode and current-mode filters can be easily obtained from the proposed grounded immittances. The voltage-mode third-order allpass, highpass and lowpass filters using the proposed grounded impedances as basic building blocks and a voltage-mode third-order highpass filter using the proposed floating impedance as basic building block are simulated to verify the synthesis method.", "paper_title": "General high-order grounded and floating immittance structures using current conveyors", "paper_id": "WOS:000302812400012"}
