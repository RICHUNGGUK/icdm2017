The device is based on the principle of continuously variable transmission. A detailed analytical study of the device has been performed, and the behavior and stability of the overall system have been studied. Bond graph modeling has been used to conceive the device. The advantage of using this device is that many control strategies are possible for the control of a space vehicle.", "paper_title": "Attitude control of a free-flying space robot using a novel torque generation device", "paper_id": "WOS:000243072100003"}
