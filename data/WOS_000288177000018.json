Therefore a fine-search scheme is proposed to refine these rough results and attempt to completely detect the real copies accurately. This scheme first employs a local affine-invariant descriptor based on polar-mapping and discrete Fourier transform. Then a spatial dependent matching method is proposed combining nearest neighbor distance ratio with the spatial relationships among the local features. Experimental results demonstrate that the employed descriptor is more robust, distinctive and suitable for copy detection in comparison with the SIFT descriptor. And the spatial dependent matching is able to improve the recall and precision, and lower the false positives and ambiguities.", "paper_title": "Fine-search for image copy detection based on local affine-invariant descriptor and spatial dependent matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000288177000018"}
