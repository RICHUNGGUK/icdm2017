Both operate under the logic of inclusion in the context of education, the first aiming at school inclusion and the other at digital inclusion. In order to observe how the inclusive process of people with disabilities mediated by laptops occurs, a qualitative descriptive research was performed, focusing on the TOTAL UCA reality in Tiradentes, Minas Gerais. The results of the research project showed that the distribution of laptops, labeling the offered tool under the concept of technological homogeneity and uniformity, imposes barriers to the care for diversity in a socio-digital inclusion scenario.", "paper_title": "One Computer per Student City - Total UCA An All Inclusive Totality under Discussion", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375100006"}
