Here we contribute to the question of existence of states (=probability measures) on orthomodular lattices. We prove that known techniques do not allow to find examples with less than 19 blocks (=maximal Boolean subalgebras). This bound is achieved by the example by Mayet [R. Mayet, Personal communication, 1993]. Although we do not finally exclude the existence of other techniques breaking this bound, existence of smaller examples is highly unexpected.
