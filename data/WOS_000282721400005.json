By formulating the problem as a multi-dimensional boundary value problem, we show that previous results for the discrete demand case can be extended to problems with highly dense demand data. Further, this approach can be generalized to non-convex allocation decisions. This formulation is illustrated for the Euclidean metric case by representing the affine bisector with two points. A specialized multi-dimensional shooting algorithm is presented and illustrated on an example. Comparisons with two alternative methods through a computational study confirm the efficiency of the proposed methodology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
