In this paper, we present a color image segmentation using pixel wise support vector machine (SVM) classification. Firstly, the pixel-level color feature and texture feature of the image, which is used as input of SVM model (classifier), are extracted via the local homogeneity model and Gabor filter. Then, the SVM model (classifier) is trained by using FCM with the extracted pixel-level features. Finally, the color image is segmented with the trained SVM model (classifier). This image segmentation not only can fully take advantage of the local information of color image, but also the ability of SVM classifier. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed method has a very effective segmentation results and computational behavior, and decreases the time and increases the quality of color image segmentation in comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods recently proposed in the literature.
