Our purpose here is to point out ways to prolong the fun by introducing and finding the basic properties of Venn and near-Venn diagrams that satisfy relaxed notions of symmetry, while leaving tantalizing open problems. A symmetric Venn diagram is one that possesses a rotational symmetry in the plane. A monochrome symmetric Venn diagram is one that is rotationally symmetric when the colours of the curves are ignored. A necessary condition for the existence of a monochrome symmetric Venn diagram is that the number of curves be a prime power. We specify conditions under which all curves must be non-congruent and give examples of small visually striking monochrome symmetric Venn diagrams found by algorithmic searches. A Venn diagram partitions the plane into 2(n) open regions. For non-prime n we also consider symmetric diagrams where the number of regions is as close to 2(n) as possible, both larger and smaller.", "paper_title": "More fun with symmetric Venn diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000237336000004"}
