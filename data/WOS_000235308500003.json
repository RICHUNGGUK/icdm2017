It supports keyboard and mouse as input devices. Typically, SMIL players can play out text, images, audio, and video. SMIL also has a strong support for declarative synchronization and timing. Being an open standard, SMIL could well be utilized in custom applications, in environments such as info kiosks and multimedia consoles. However, these environments usually require better input and output capabilities not available in SMIL. This paper presents nine methods to extend SMIL for custom multimedia applications. The methods include ways to attach new input sources, output capabilities, and extended internal logic. Also, an implementation of an extensible SMIL player is given. As a conclusion, SMIL can be extended in several ways for custom multimedia applications. These extensions will provide new ideas for the future multimedia languages.", "paper_title": "Nine methods to extend SMIL for multimedia applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000235308500003"}
