The basis functions have local supports, they form a convex partition of unity, and every spline is locally controllable by means of control triangles. As application, discrete and differential quasi-interpolants of optimal approximation order are developed and numerical tests for illustrating theoretical results are presented. (C) 2013 IMACS.
