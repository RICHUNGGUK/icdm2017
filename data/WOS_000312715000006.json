A generalized Lyapunov function candidate is introduced to prove the stability condition and some free-weighting matrices are used for less conservative conditions. The resulting stability and robust stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are delay-range-dependent. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the method.", "paper_title": "The delay-range-dependent robust stability analysis for 2-D state-delayed systems with uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000312715000006"}
