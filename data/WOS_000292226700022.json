This paper introduces a theoretical framework for constructing twill-woven objects, i.e., cyclic twill-weavings on arbitrary surfaces, and it provides methods to convert polygonal meshes into twill-woven objects. It also develops a general technique to obtain exact triaxial-woven objects from an arbitrary polygonal mesh surface. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
