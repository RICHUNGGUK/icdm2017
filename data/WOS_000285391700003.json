However, in various applications, a record (e. g., hotel) maybe rated on several attributes (value, service, etc.), in which case simply returning the ones with the highest overall scores fails to capture the individual attribute characteristics and to accommodate different selection criteria. In order to enhance the flexibility of CF, we propose Collaborative Filtering Skyline (CFS), a general framework that combines the advantages of CF with those of the skyline operator. CFS generates a personalized skyline for each user based on scores of other users with similar behavior. The personalized skyline includes objects that are good on certain aspects, and eliminates the ones that are not interesting on any attribute combination. Although the integration of skylines and CF has several attractive properties, it also involves rather expensive computations. We face this challenge through a comprehensive set of algorithms and optimizations that reduce the cost of generating personalized skylines. In addition to exact skyline processing, we develop an approximate method that provides error guarantees. Finally, we propose the top-k personalized skyline, where the user specifies the required output cardinality.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Filtering with Personalized Skylines", "paper_id": "WOS:000285391700003"}
