In this paper, we use single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements to explore the perception of tactile stimuli located on participants' right forearm, which were approximately equally spaced centered on the body midline, 2 leftward and 2 rightward of midline. An EEG-based signal analysis approach to predict the location of the tactile stimuli is proposed. Offline classification suggests that tactile location can be detected from EEG signals in single trial (four-class classifier for location discriminate can achieve up to 96.76%) with a short response time (600 milliseconds after stimulus presentation). From a human-machine-interaction (HMI) point of view, this could be used to design a real-time reactive control machine for patients, e.g., suffering from hypoesthesia.", "paper_title": "EEG-Based Perceived Tactile Location Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000366614800008"}
