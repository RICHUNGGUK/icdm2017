By means of the systematic sampling of the error, in addition to locating the area presenting the smallest error, its \"roughness\", is also characterized. This is a valuable information to evaluate the quality of the identification that has been carried out. The methodology proposed here does not aspire to be \"the solution\" to the problem of parameter identification. The aim is simply to provide a tool which may aid users with criteria.
