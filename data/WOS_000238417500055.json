P2HP utilizes idle computers in the Internet with great scalability to form an enormous computing capability for scientific supercomputing and volunteers form autonomous unstructured P2P network domains. The configuration of P2HP is easy and a programming model is provided. Its applications involve a large range of problems, and a benchmark is applied to evaluate its performance.", "paper_title": "Constructing a P2P-based high performance computing platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500055"}
