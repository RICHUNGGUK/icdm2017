One important feature of the smart grid is the integration of high-speed, reliable and secure data communication networks to manage the complex power systems effectively and intelligently. We provide in this paper a comprehensive survey on the communication architectures in the power systems, including the communication network compositions, technologies, functions, requirements, and research challenges. As these communication networks are responsible for delivering power system related messages, we discuss specifically the network implementation considerations and challenges in the power system settings. This survey attempts to summarize the current state of research efforts in the communication networks of smart grid, which may help us identify the research problems in the continued studies.
