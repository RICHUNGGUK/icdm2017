We demonstrate, using careful numerical computations, that the reduction method, in which the sums for a two-dimensional lattice are expressed as a sum of one-dimensional lattice sums leads to an order-of-magnitude improvement in performance over the well-known Ewald method. In the process we clarify and improve on a number of results originally formulated by Twersky in the 1970s. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
