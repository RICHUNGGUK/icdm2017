These VOs, however, work as disjointed and independent communities with no resource sharing between them. We, in previous work, have proposed a fully decentralized and reconfigurable Inter-Grid framework for resource sharing among such distributed and autonomous Grid systems (Rao et al. in ICCSA, [2006]). The specific problem that underlies in such a collaborating Grids system is scheduling of resources as there is very little knowledge about availability of the resources due to the distributed and autonomous nature of the underlying Grid entities. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic and adaptive scheduling algorithm using system-generated predictions for Inter-Grid resource sharing keeping collaborating Grid systems autonomous and independent. We first use system-generated job runtime estimates without actually submitting jobs to the target Grid system. Then this job execution estimate is used to predict the job scheduling feasibility on the target system. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm adapted itself to the actual resource behavior and performance. Simulation results are presented to discuss the correctness and accuracy of our proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A probabilistic and adaptive scheduling algorithm using system-generated predictions for inter-grid resource sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000256914700003"}
