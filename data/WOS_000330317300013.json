This paper identifies 16-round related-key impossible differentials of LBlock, which are better than the 15-round related-key impossible differentials used in the previous attack. Based on these 16-round related-key impossible differentials, we can attack 23 rounds of LBlock while the previous related-key impossible differential attacks could only work on 22-round LBlock. This makes our attack on LBlock the best attack in terms of the number of attacked rounds.", "paper_title": "Related-Key Impossible Differential Attack on Reduced-Round LBlock", "paper_id": "WOS:000330317300013"}
