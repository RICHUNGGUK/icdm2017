These flying vehicles are often capable of carrying only a few dozen grammes of payload. To achieve autonomy for this kind of aircraft novel sensors are required, which need to cope with strictly limited onboard processing power. One of the key aspects in autonomous behaviour is target tracking. Our visual tracking approach differs from other methods by not using expensive cameras but a Wii remote camera, i.e. commodity consumer hardware. The system works without stationary sensors and all processing is done with an onboard microcontroller. The only assumptions are a good roll and pitch attitude estimation, provided by an inertial measurement unit and a stationary pattern of four infrared spots on the target or the landing spot. This paper details experiments for hovering above a landing place, but tracking a slowly moving target is also possible.", "paper_title": "Low-Cost Visual Tracking of a Landing Place and Hovering Flight Control with a Microcontroller", "paper_id": "WOS:000272360700015"}
