The proposed model is consisting of the walking one strategy, assessment strategy and turbulent strategy. The proposed MTPSO model can solve the planar graph coloring problem using four-colors more efficiently and accurately. Compared to the results shown in Cui et al. (2008), not only the experimental results of the proposed model can get smaller average iterations but can get higher correction coloring rate when the number of nodes is greater than 30.
