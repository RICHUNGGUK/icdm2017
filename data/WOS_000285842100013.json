The condition requires the interference to be weak, a situation commonly encountered, e. g., in digital subscriber line transmission. The optimal power allocation is characterized by using the concavity of the sum-rate capacity as a function of the power constraints.", "paper_title": "Noisy-Interference Sum-Rate Capacity of Parallel Gaussian Interference Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000285842100013"}
