These algorithms, however, are hindered by a semi-convergence behavior, in that the quality of the computed solution first increases and then decreases. In this paper, in order to overcome the semi-convergence behavior, we propose two iterative algorithms based on soft-thresholding for image deblurring problems. One of them combines CGLS with a denoising technique like soft-thresholding at each iteration and another combines MRNSD with soft-thresholding in a similar way. We prove the convergence of MRNSD and soft-thresholding based algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms overcome the semi-convergence behavior and the restoration results are slightly better than those of CGLS and MRNSD with their optimal stopping iterations.
