This issue is substantial, e.g., in modeling multiagent systems, where a group of loosely coupled heterogeneous agents cooperate in achieving a common goal. Information exchange, leading ultimately to knowledge fusion, is a natural and vital ingredient of this process. We use a generalization of rough sets and relations [30], which depends on allowing arbitrary similarity relations. The starting point of this research is [6], where a framework for knowledge fusion in multiagent systems is introduced. Agents' individual perceptual capabilities are represented by similarity relations, further aggregated to express joint capabilities of teams, This aggregation, expressing a shift from individual to social level of agents' activity, has been formalized by means of dynamic logic. The approach of Doherty et al. (2007) [6] uses the full propositional dynamic logic, which does not guarantee tractability of reasoning. Our idea is to adapt the techniques of Nguyen [26-28] to provide an engine for tractable approximate database querying restricted to a Horn fragment of serial dynamic logic. We also show that the obtained formalism is quite powerful in applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
