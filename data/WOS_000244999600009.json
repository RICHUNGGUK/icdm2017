Chung and Ross conjectured that C(n, 2n - 1, r) is rearrangeable if each call has weight chosen from a given set of k weights. Lin et al. confirmed the conjecture for a restricted discrete bandwidth case only. In this paper we show that the conjecture of Chung and Ross holds not only in the discrete bandwidth case but also in the continuous bandwidth case for r <= 2n/5 - 23/5 (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
