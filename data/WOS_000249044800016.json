Impairments to the upstream channel caused by Rayleigh backscattering in the network are mitigated using a dual-feeder-fiber approach in conjunction with a novel detuned filtering and spectral-broadening scheme. The experimental results show that the network, with a total reach of 116 km and an upstream bit rate of 10 Gbits/s, can support up to 256 customers on each TDM PON. The potential performance improvements obtainable from an optimized architecture are also discussed.
