Transf-ID is an RFID-based tracking system for use in the rail freight industry that will identify cargo and rail vehicles but also mechanical parts that are frequently serviced. The system includes middleware as well as hardware components, combined in an end-to-end solution that translates tag scans into meaningful business events. All tagged items are scanned on the move at checkpoints, leading to valuable information regarding their traveled routes.", "paper_title": "Transf-ID: Automatic ID and Data Capture for Rail Freight Asset Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000262501000006"}
