In detail, the hysteresis is described as a first order differential equation with 24 sets of the hysteresis parameters and the creep is modeled as a time-dependent logarithmic function with two sets of creep parameters The characteristics of the flexure guides are analyzed using the finite element method and are embodied into a multi-body-dynamics simulation tool The dynamic behavior of the simulation tool is compared with the experimental data.
