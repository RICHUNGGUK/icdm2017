The random packet losses are described by a Bernoulli distributed white sequence that obeys a conditional probability distribution, and the multiplicative disturbances are in the form of a scalar Gaussian white noise with unit variance. In the presence of mixed delays, random packet losses and multiplicative noises, sufficient conditions for the existence of an observer-based fuzzy feedback controller are derived, such that the closed-loop control system is asymptotically mean-square stable and preserves a guaranteed H-infinity performance. Then a linear matrix inequality approach for designing such an observer-based H-infinity fuzzy controller is presented. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Observer-based H-infinity fuzzy control for discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy mixed delay systems with random packet losses and multiplicative noises", "paper_id": "WOS:000344245000012"}
