We present an O(1.2691(n)) time algorithm solving its counting analogue #BICOLORED INDEPENDENT SET. We show how to use this algorithm to establish algorithms solving biclique counting problems and provide an O(1.2691(n)) time algorithm solving *BIPARTITE BICLIQUE and an O(1.6107(n)) time algorithm solving #NON-INDUCED BICLIQUE.
