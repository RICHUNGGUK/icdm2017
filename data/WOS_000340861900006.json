However, the structural determinations of pHLA complexes remain challenging under the present conditions. In this paper, the performance of a new peptide docking method, namely FlexPepDock, was systematically investigated by a benchmark of 30 crystallized structures of peptide-HLA class I complexes. The docking results showed that the near-native pHLA-I models with peptide bb-RMSD less than 2 A were ranked in the top 1 model for 100% (70/70) docking cases, and the subangstrom models with peptide bb-RMSD less than 1 angstrom were ranked in the top S lowest-energy models for 65.7% (46/70) docking cases. Furthermore, 10 out of 70 docking cases ranked the subangstrom all-atom models in the top S lowest-energy models. The results showed that the FlexPepDock can generate high-quality models of pHLA-I complexes and can be widely applied to pHLA-I modeling and mechanism research of peptide-mediated immune responses.", "paper_title": "Subangstrom Accuracy in pHLA-I Modeling by Rosetta FlexPepDock Refinement Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000340861900006"}
