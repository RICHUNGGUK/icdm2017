The governing equations of moisture and ion diffusion are formulated based on Fick's law and the Nernst-Planck equation, respectively. The governing equations are modified by explicitly including the coupling terms corresponding to the coupled mechanisms. The ionic interaction-induced electrostatic potential is described by electroneutrality condition. The model takes into account the two-way coupled effect of moisture diffusion and ion transport in concrete. The coupling parameters are evaluated based on the available experimental data and incorporated in the governing equations. Differing from previous researches, the material parameters related to moisture diffusion and ion transport in concrete are considered not to be constant numbers and characterized by the material models that account for the concrete mix design parameters and age of concrete. Then, the material models are included in the numerical analysis and the governing equations are solved by using finite element method. The numerical results obtained from the present model agree very well with available test data. Thus, the model can predict satisfactorily the ingress of deicing salts into non-saturated concrete.", "paper_title": "Coupled diffusion of multi-component chemicals in nonsaturated concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000324808900002"}
