A point set with large value of minimum Dick weight gives a quadrature rule with small error in quasi-Monte Carlo integration. In this paper we explicitly construct point sets P subset of F-p(sxn) with large minimum Dick weight using Niederreiter-Xing sequences and Dick's interleaving construction. These point sets, are also examples of low-WAFOM point sets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
