Therefore, improving the efficiency of the traffic flow is a mandatory task in order to mitigate such critical problems. In this article, a Swarm Intelligence approach is proposed for the optimal scheduling of traffic lights timing programs in metropolitan areas. By doing so, the traffic flow of vehicles can be improved with the final goal global target of reducing their fuel consumption and gas emissions (CO and N O (x) ). In this work we optimize the traffic lights timing programs and analyze their effect in pollution by following the standard HBEFA as the traffic emission model. Specifically, we focus on two large and heterogeneous urban scenarios located in the cities of Malaga and Seville (in Spain). When compared to the traffic lights timing programs designed by experts close to real ones, the proposed strategy obtains significant reductions in terms of the emission rates (23.3 % CO and 29.3 % N O (x) ) and the total fuel consumption.", "paper_title": "Reducing vehicle emissions and fuel consumption in the city by using particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000351110600001"}
