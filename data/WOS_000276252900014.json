The system contains a low-order multi-bit analog noise-shaping loop, followed by a scaling block and a high-order single-bit digital modulator. The combination simplifies the realization of the analog modulator, and it allows the use of most of its full-scale input range.", "paper_title": "Hybrid delta-sigma ADC", "paper_id": "WOS:000276252900014"}
