About 3%-5% of patients with CRC have hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Cancer morbidity and mortality can be reduced if early and intensive screening is pursued. However, despite advances in screening, population-wide genetic screening for HNPCC is not currently considered feasible due to its complexity and expense. If the risk of a family having HNPCC can be identified/assessed, then only the high-risk fraction of the population would undergo intensive screening. This identification is currently performed by a genetic counselor/physician who makes the decision based on some predefined criteria. Here, we report on a system to identify. the risk of a family having HNPCC based on its history. We compare artificial neural networks and statistical approaches for assessing the risk of a family having HNPCC and discuss the experimental results obtained by these two approaches.", "paper_title": "Cancer risk analysis in families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000239033000021"}
