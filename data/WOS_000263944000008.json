The label type and label access policy can be defined according to the requirements of different applications. In order to-preserve the integrity of data in XML databases, a constraint between a read-access rule and a write-access rule in label access policy is introduced. Rules for label assignment and propagation are presented to alleviate the workload of label assignments. Furthermore, a solution for resolving conflicts in label assignments is proposed. Rules for update-related operations, rules for exceptional privir leges of ordinary users and the administrator are also proposed to preserve the security of operations in XML databases. The MAC model, we proposed in this study, has been implemented in an XML database. Test results demonstrated that our approach provides rational and scalable performance.
