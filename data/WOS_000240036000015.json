Character regions required in recognition make black pixel and remainder of the passport regions make white pixel in the detected character spaces. This method uses MRZ sub-region in order to automatically decide the threshold value of the binary image and this value is applied to the other character regions. This method also executes horizontal and vertical histogram projection in order to remove picture region of the binary image. After the region detection of the picture area, the image part of the passport is stored in the database for face images. The remainder of the passport is composed of characters. The extraction of the picture area shows 100 % of extraction ratio and the extraction of the characters for the recognition shows 96 % of extraction ratio on ten different passports. From the obtained information, crosscheck process of MRZ information and field information of passport is implemented.", "paper_title": "Crosscheck of passport information for personal identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000015"}
