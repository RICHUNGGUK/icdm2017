For a particular algorithm based on the modified barrier method, we propose to use iterative solvers instead of the routinely used direct factorization techniques. The preconditioned conjugate gradient method proves to be a viable alternative for problems with a large number of variables and modest size of the constrained matrix. We further propose to avoid explicit calculation of the Newton matrix either by an implicit scheme in the matrix-vector product or using a finite-difference formula. This leads to huge savings in memory requirements and, for certain problems, to further speed-up of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "On the solution of large-scale SDP problems by the modified barrier method using iterative solvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908500010"}
