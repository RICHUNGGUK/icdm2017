We first show that the upper bound proposed by Liu et al. (2008) [18] for the state complexity of (L1L2)(R) coincides with the lower bound and is thus the state complexity of this combined operation by providing some witness DFAs. Also, we show that, unlike most other cases, due to the structural properties of the result of the first operation of the combinations (L1L2)-L-R, L-1*L-2, and (L-1 boolean OR L-2)L-3, the state complexity of each of these combined operations is close to the mathematical composition of the state complexities of the component operations. Moreover, we show that the state complexities of (L-1 boolean AND L-2)L-3, L1L2 boolean AND L-3, and L1L2 boolean OR L-3 are exactly equal to the mathematical compositions of the state complexities of their component operations in the general cases. We also include a brief survey that summarizes all state complexity results for combined operations with two basic operations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
