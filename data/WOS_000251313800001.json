Our multistage nested rollout algorithm allows the user to apply separate heuristics at each stage of the search process and tune the search magnitude for each stage. We propose a search-tree compression that reveals a new state representation for the games of Klondike Solitaire and Thoughtful Solitaire, a version of Klondike Solitaire in which the location of all cards is known. Moreover, we present a Thoughtful Solitaire solver based on these methods that can determine over 80% of Thoughtful Solitaire games in less than 4 seconds. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that no less than 82% and no more than 91.44% of Klondike Solitaire games have winning solutions, leaving less than 10% of games unresolved.", "paper_title": "Searching Solitaire in real time", "paper_id": "WOS:000251313800001"}
