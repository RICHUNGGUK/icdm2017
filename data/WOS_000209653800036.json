The emergence of Internet of Things and event-based social applications integrated with context-awareness ability can be helpful in planning and organizing social events like meetings, conferences, and tradeshows. This paper first provides review of the event-based social networks and the basic principles and architecture of event-based MSNs. Next, event-based MSNs with smartphone contained technology elements, such as context-aware mobility and multimedia sharing, are presented. By combining the feature of context-aware mobility with multimedia sharing in event-based MSNs, event organizers, and planners with the service providers optimize their capability to recognize value for the multimedia services they deliver. The unique features of the current event-based MSNs give rise to the major technology trends to watch for designing applications. These mobile applications and their main features are described. At the end, discussions on the evaluation of the event-based mobile applications based on their main features are presented. Some open research issues and challenges in this important area of research are also outlined.", "paper_title": "Event-Based Mobile Social Networks: Services,Technologies, and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800036"}
