A design methodolgy based on a two-moment aproximation algorithm is utilized for optimizing the number of servers, arrival and service rates, and amounts of waiting room in these M/G/c/K multi-server systems where service in the system is from a general distribution. A property describing the relationship between K and rho bounds the region in which optimal results should be found for K. Extensive computational results are provided to evaluate the efficacy and usefulness of this optimization methodology on a number of different system prroblems.", "paper_title": "Multi-server, finite waiting room, M/G/c/K optimization models", "paper_id": "WOS:000258804100006"}
