The governing equations are discretized using a finite volume method using a special dual mesh definition, specially tailored for the hybrid meshes used. A geometrically conservative way of treating these meshes is formulated. The discretized equations are implicit in time, and are solved by a dual time approach. The subiterations involved are performed using multigrid acceleration with explicit relaxation. For moving geometries, the mesh is deformed using a spring analogy approach combined with local remeshing. The approach is demonstrated for several flows of practical interest.
