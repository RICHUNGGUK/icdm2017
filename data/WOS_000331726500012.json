These frequencies were obtained by identifying the frequencies at which the power of the alpha rhythms decreases. In the present study, we present a graphical interactive toolbox that can be plugged into the popular open source environment EEGLAB, making it easy to use CRB. In particular, we illustrate the major functionalities of the software and discuss the advantages of this toolbox for common EEG investigations. The CRB analysis plugin, along with extended documentation and the sample dataset utilized in this study, is freely available on the web at http://bio.dei.unipd12/crb/. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
