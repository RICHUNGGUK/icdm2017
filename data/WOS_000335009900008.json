Experimentally, we observe that human understanding of shape from connected 3D curves is largely consistent, and informed by both topological connectivity and geometry of the curves. We thus employ the flow complex, a structure that captures aspects of input topology and geometry, in a novel algorithm to produce an intersection-free 3D triangulated shape that interpolates the input 3D curves. Our approach is able to triangulate highly nonplanar and concave curve cycles, providing a robust 3D mesh and parametric embedding for challenging 3D curve input. Our evaluation is fourfold: we show our algorithm to match designer-selected curve cycles for surfacing; we produce user-acceptable shapes for a wide range of curve inputs; we show our approach to be predictable and robust to curve addition and deletion; we compare our results to prior art.", "paper_title": "Flow-Complex-Based Shape Reconstruction from 3D Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000335009900008"}
