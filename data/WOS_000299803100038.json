The successful exploration of these data for scientific research and engineering applications requires the capability of efficient storage, retrieval, integration and visualization of these large datasets. Robust publication methods are also needed to enable data exchange through the web to increase global research collaborations. In this study, a comprehensive GIS-based data management and publication framework (GMPF) was developed and applied to the use, representation, and analysis of hydrodynamic modeling results of Hamburg Port, Germany. Linking with GIS, a desktop- and a web-based model-results data atlas were developed to provide an interactive environment for various cartography and time series plots. The implementation of the framework was based on modular software design, open specifications and reuse of open source projects. The study results showed that the project life-cycle was shortened and development efforts were reduced through applying GMPF. The developed system could be integrated into commercial hydrodynamics software platforms to enhance the capability of model-results management and publication. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
