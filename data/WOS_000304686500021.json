In this work an Endex calcium looping system is modelled as a train of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) elements mass-coupled in series and thermally coupled in parallel. A novel simulator was developed that incorporates object-oriented design to describe the Endex reactor and its components, and used to study the effects of varying the most important design and operating parameters. From a reactor design point of view, varying the heat transfer coefficient and the sorbent flow rate amounts to testing the classic tradeoff between capital and running costs: we may choose between higher capital costs (larger heat transfer coefficient) and lower running costs (low sorbent flow rate) or vice versa, for similar scrubbing and regeneration efficiencies.
