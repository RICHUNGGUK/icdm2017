The proposed routing algorithm is designed to minimize the consumed time slots while guaranteeing the required time slots at all the pairs of adjacent nodes over the route and the contention neighbors of these nodes to support the route. Furthermore, the proposed routing algorithm can distribute the network loads well over the entire network. This technology is essential because video streaming applications require stringent quality of service and even larger network resources compared with traditional data services, and these demands may dramatically increase the entire network load and/or cause network congestion. Finally, experimental results are provided to show a performance of the proposed routing algorithm.
