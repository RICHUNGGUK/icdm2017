The presented hybrid mesh-free method is applied for a thick hollow cylinder, which is made of FGNRCN and excited by various mechanical shock loadings. Design/methodology/approach - The FG nanocomposite cylinder is assumed to be under shock loading. The elastic wave propagation is obtained and studied for various nonlinear grading patterns and distributions of the aligned carbon nanotubes. The distribution of carbon naotubes in FG nanocomposite are considered to vary as nonlinear function of radius, which varies with various nonlinear grading patterns continuously through radial direction. The effective material properties of functionally graded carbon nanotube are estimated using a micro-mechanical model. Findings - The mechanical shock analysis of FGNRCN thick hollow cylinder is carried out and the dynamic behavior of displacement field and the time history of radial displacement are obtained for various grading patterns. An effective hybrid mesh-free method based on GFD and Newmark finite difference methods is presented to calculate the average velocity of elastic wave propagation in FGNRCN. The average velocity of elastic wave propagation is obtained for various grading patterns and various kinds of volume fraction. The effects of some parameters on average velocity of elastic wave propagation are obtained and studied in detail. Originality/value - The calculation of elastic radial wave propagation in a FGNRCN thick hollow cylinder is presented using a hybrid mesh-free method. The effects of some parameters on wave propagation such as various grading patterns of distribution of carbon nanotubes are studied in details.", "paper_title": "Elastic wave propagation and time history analysis in FG nanocomposite cylinders reinforced by carbon nanotubes using a hybrid mesh-free method", "paper_id": "WOS:000343322300007"}
