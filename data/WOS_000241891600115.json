This algorithm is termed Immune Clonal MO Algorithm (ICMOA). In ICMOA, the antibody population is split into the population of the nondominated antibodies and that of the dominated antibodied. Meanwhile, the nondominated antibodies are allowed to survive and to clone. A metric of Coverage of Two Sets is adopted for the problems. This quantitative metric is used for testing the convergence to the Pareto-optimal front. Simulation results on the 0/1 knapsack problems show that ICMOA, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared with SPEA, NSGA, NPGA and VEGA.", "paper_title": "Immune Clonal MO Algorithm for 0/1 knapsack problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600115"}
