Changes in respiratory mechanics from healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosed patients are observed with a four- and a five-parameter constant-phase model. Tissue damping (p << 0.01), tissue elastance (p < 0.02) and tissue hysteresivity (p << 0.01) are calculated from the identified model parameters, providing significant separation between healthy and COPD groups. Limitations of the four-parameter constant-phase model are shown in relation to frequency-dependent impedance values within the range 4-48 Hz. The results clearly show that the five-parameter constant-phase model outperforms the four-parameter constant-phase model in this frequency range. The averaged error is 0.02 and 0.04 for healthy subjects in the five-parameter and four-parameter constant-phase models, respectively. The results show that the identified model values are sensitive to variations between healthy and COPD lungs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
