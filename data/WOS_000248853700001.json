The descriptor can be generated by composing the gradient vectors obtained from the sub-images through a wavelet decomposition of a texture image. By exercising a database containing 2400 images which were cropped from a set of 150 types of textures selected from the Brodatz Album, we demonstrated that 93% efficacy can be achieved in image retrieval. Moreover, using CSG vectors as the texture descriptor for image segmentation can generate very successful results for both synthesized and natural scene images. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
