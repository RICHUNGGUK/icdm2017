Jeffrey's rule, which extends conditioning to probabilistic inputs, is appropriate for revising probabilistic epistemic states when new information comes in the form of a partition of events with new probabilities and has priority over prior beliefs. This paper analyses the expressive power of two possibilistic counterparts to Jeffrey's rule for modeling belief revision in intelligent agents. We show that this rule can be used to recover several existing approaches proposed in knowledge base revision, such as adjustment, natural belief revision, drastic belief revision, and the revision of an epistemic state by another epistemic state. In addition, we also show that some recent forms of revision, called improvement operators, can also be recovered in our framework.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Iterated Belief Revision Using Possibilistic Counterparts to Jeffrey's Rule", "paper_id": "WOS:000277761200003"}
