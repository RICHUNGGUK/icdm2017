Six hundred and sixteen students filled out a set of questionnaires. We here report-to our knowledge for the first time-an association between IA and chronotype. Evening types and males had higher IA scores than others. Furthermore, agreeable and conscientious students reported lower IA. No consistent relationship was observed between students' IA scores and openness to experience, extraversion, and neuroticism. We conclude that evening types may be more prone to IA than morning-oriented persons because eveningness is related to personality styles that foster Internet addiction.", "paper_title": "Internet Addiction and Its Relationship to Chronotype and Personality in a Turkish University Student Sample", "paper_id": "WOS:000340090600004"}
