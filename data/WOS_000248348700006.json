Design/methodology/approach - The paper shows the objectives pursued by the BVG, its development, putting special emphasis on the main technological challenges, and presents some data about its usage. Findings - A digital library can be used to stimulate a lesser-used language and to promote the culture and tourism of a region. Originality/value - The paper shows how a digital library can be used to strengthen the Galician language, which is currently categorised as a \"Lesser Used Language\" in the European Community and to contribute to the preservation and spreading of Galician culture and literary works, either from current authors or from previous documents. It also provides a digital publishing house for new authors and opens a communication channel between current authors and their readers. Finally, it helps to connect a scattered community like the Galician, offering a centralised access point to any information about Galicia. This work also presents some technological innovations included in the BVG, especially from the viewpoint of user interface design and search by content.", "paper_title": "The Galician virtual library", "paper_id": "WOS:000248348700006"}
