Although stemming from proof-search considerations, focusing has not been thoroughly investigated in actual theorem proving, in particular w.r.t. termination. We present a contraction-free (and hence terminating) focused multi-succedent sequent calculus for propositional intuitionistic logic, which refines the G4ip calculus in the tradition of Vorob'ev, Hudelmeier and Dyckhoff. We prove completeness of the calculus semantically and argue that this offers a viable alternative to other more syntactical means.", "paper_title": "A Semantical Analysis of Focusing and Contraction in Intuitionistic Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000361568700003"}
