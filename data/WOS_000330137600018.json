It is intended for individuals with body scheme dysfunctions and left-right confusion. The system processes depth information to overcome the shortcomings of a previously presented 2D vision system for the same application. It achieves left and right-hand tracking, and face and facial feature detection (eye, nose, and ears) detection. The system is easily implemented with a consumer-grade computer and an affordable Kinect device and is robust to drastic background and illumination changes. The system was tested and achieved a successful monitoring percentage of 96.28%. The automation of the human body parts motion monitoring, its analysis in relation to the psychomotor exercise indicated to the patient, and the storage of the result of the realization of a set of exercises free the rehabilitation experts of doing such demanding tasks. The vision-based system is potentially applicable to other tasks with minor changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
