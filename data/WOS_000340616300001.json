We present a system that monitors the evolution of the learning process. The system is able to self-diagnose degradations of this process, using change detection mechanisms, and self-repair the decision models. The system uses meta-learning techniques that characterize the domain of applicability of previously learned models. The meta-learner can detect recurrence of contexts, using unlabeled examples, and take pro-active actions by activating previously learned models. The experimental evaluation on three text mining problems demonstrates the main advantages of the proposed system: it provides information about the recurrence of concepts and rapidly adapts decision models when drift occurs.", "paper_title": "Recurrent concepts in data streams classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000340616300001"}
