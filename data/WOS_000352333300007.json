For each iteration of the fitting algorithm, the representation of the multiple ellipses is mapped to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the connections are mapped to geometric constraints for the GMM. The fitting is a modified constrained expectation maximisation (EM) method on the GMM (maximising with respect to the ellipse parameters rather than Gaussian parameters). A key modification is that the precision of the chosen GMM is increased at each iteration. This is similar to slowly inflating a bunch of connected balloons and so this is called balloon fitting. Extensions of the framework to other constraints and possible pre-processing are also discussed. The superiority of balloon fitting is demonstrated through experiments on several silhouettes with noisy edges which compare other existing methods with balloon fitting and some of the extensions.
