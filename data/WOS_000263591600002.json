For that reason, a multimedia application that allows us improve and optimize the teaching-learning process in the resolution of typical problems of this subject has been designed. Easy of use, interactiveness or efficiency are characteristics that can be related to this application. In this article, we describe the more important aspects of the developed Multimedia Trainer, as well as the results obtained in an experience with students with the purpose of evaluating its possibilities of use, (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
