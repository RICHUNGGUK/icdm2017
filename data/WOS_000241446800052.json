The advantage of our tool is focusing the quality refinement phase of ontology construction. Through interactive support for refining the initial ontology, OWL-Lite level ontology, which consists of taxonomic relationships (defined as classes) and non-taxonomic relationships (defined as properties), is constructed effectively. The tool also provides semi-automatic generation of the initial ontology using domain specific documents and general ontologies.", "paper_title": "DODDLE-OWL: A domain ontology construction tool with OWL", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800052"}
