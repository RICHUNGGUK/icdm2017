Visual and tactile skills are learnt in a patient apprenticeship which is expensive and risky for patients. We propose a training alternative through a new virtual simulator supporting the Seldinger technique: ImaGiNe (imaging guided interventional needle) Seldinger. It is composed of two workstations: (1) a simulated pulse is palpated, in an immersive environment, to guide needle puncture and (2) two haptic devices provide a novel interface where a needle can direct a guidewire and catheter within the vessel lumen, using virtual fluoroscopy. Different complexities are provided by 28 real patient datasets. The feel of the simulation is enhanced by replicating, with the haptics, real force and flexibility measurements. A preliminary validation study has demonstrated training effectiveness for skills transfer.
