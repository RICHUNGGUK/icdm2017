We consider mapped multiblock domains for mappings that are conforming at inter-block boundaries. By using a smooth continuation of the mapping into ghost cells surrounding a block, we reduce the inter-block communication problem to finding an accurate, robust interpolation into these ghost cells from neighboring blocks. We demonstrate fourth-order accuracy for the advection equation for multiblock coordinate systems in two and three dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
