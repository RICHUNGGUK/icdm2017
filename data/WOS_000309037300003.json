We first produced high-level gold-standard sentiment dictionaries for two languages and then translated them automatically into third languages. Those words that can be found in both target language word lists are likely to be useful because their word senses are likely to be similar to that of the two source languages. These dictionaries can be further corrected, extended and improved. In this paper, we present results that verify our triangulation hypothesis, by evaluating triangulated lists and comparing them to non-triangulated machine-translated word lists.
