We apply semi-infinite programming (SIP) to solve minimax design problems for nonlinear models in a systematic way using a discretization based strategy and solvers from the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). Using popular models from the biological sciences, we show our approach produces minimax optimal designs that coincide with the few theoretical and numerical optimal designs in the literature. We also show our method can be readily modified to find standardized maximin optimal designs and minimax optimal designs for more complicated problems, such as when the ranges of plausible values for the model parameters are dependent and we want to find a design to minimize the maximal inefficiency of estimates for the model parameters.", "paper_title": "A semi-infinite programming based algorithm for finding minimax optimal designs for nonlinear models", "paper_id": "WOS:000341440800011"}
