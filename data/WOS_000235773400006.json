Erosion and dilation properties of local min/max operations create new ridges from the given image. Thus grey scale skeletons can be effectively obtained by accumulating such ridges. The proposed method is quite salient because it can be also applied to an unsegmented image in which objects are not specified.", "paper_title": "Gray-scale thinning algorithm using local min/max operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773400006"}
