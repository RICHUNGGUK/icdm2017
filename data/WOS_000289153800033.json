In this scheme the decoy-photon technique is exploited to ensure the security of the transmission of qubits. The highlight of our protocol is that in addition to elimination of the drawback \"information leakage\", In our protocol it is not necessary to the parties of communication to have an ideal maximally entangled pairs, which makes this scheme more convenient than previews protocols in a practical application.", "paper_title": "PROBABILISTIC BIDIRECTIONAL QUANTUM SECURE COMMUNICATION BASED ON A SHARED PARTIALLY ENTANGLED STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800033"}
