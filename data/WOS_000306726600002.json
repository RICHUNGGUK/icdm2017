Since in some applications graphs become larger and larger, a research branch has emerged which is concerned with the design and analysis of so-called symbolic algorithms for classical graph problems on OBDD-represented graph instances. Here, a symbolic minimum spanning tree algorithm using O(log(3) vertical bar V vertical bar) functional operations is presented, where V is the set of vertices of the input graph. Moreover, the computation of the transitive closure is investigated and it is proved that there can be an exponential blow-up from input to output size. Furthermore, answering an open problem posed by Sawitzki [37] it is shown that every symbolic OBDD-based algorithm for the minimum spanning tree problem needs exponential space (with respect to the OBDD size of the input graph). This result even holds for planar input graphs. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
