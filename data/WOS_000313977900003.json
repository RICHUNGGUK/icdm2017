This paper investigates the problem of redeploying mobile sensor networks, in which the objective is to design an efficient algorithm which optimizes the global performance of networks. We take a novel approach in analyzing the problem from a macroscopic perspective, modeling the sensor deployment as a density distribution and the redeployment algorithm as an integral transform of that distribution. Despite lacking the details for individual node, we may still derive insightful results, such as number of moves, stability, and transitional behavior. We also derive the bound of total moving distance difference between an arbitrary one-move algorithm and the optimum redeployment algorithm, allowing for the estimation of the minimum moving distance from the initial deployment region. In summary, we present an theoretical analysis of the redeployment problem from a macroscopic perspective, and believe the results can serve as a basis for further algorithm development and analysis.
