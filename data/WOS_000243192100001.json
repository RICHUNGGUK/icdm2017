The transcendental transfer function of the linearized model is obtained by a Laplace transformation and corresponding initial and boundary conditions. The lumped-parameter model is obtained by a Taylor series extension of the transencdental transfer function. Based on the experience of linear models the structure of the neural net model, as an addendum to the nonlinear distributed-parameter model, is obtained. All four models are tested on a real pipeline data with an artificially generated leak.", "paper_title": "Neural net versus classical models for the detection and localization of leaks in pipelines", "paper_id": "WOS:000243192100001"}
