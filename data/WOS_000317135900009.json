However, the vascular pattern of livers in CT images suffers from low contrast to background so that the existing segmentation technologies are not able to extract the blood vessels completely. In the paper, we propose a new algorithm to extract the blood vessels of livers based on the adaptive multi-scale segmentation. First, we prove that the background histogram of normal scale blood vessels obeys the Gaussian distribution in CT images, and obtain the vascular distribution function from the vascular signal segmented from the background with a local optimal threshold. Second, Hessian matrix is employed to enhance the thin blood vessels before the extraction, and a complete and clear segmentation system for blood vessels is constructed by combining the major and thin blood vessels via filtering. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is able to extract more complete blood vessels for 3D system, and assist the clinical liver surgeries efficiently.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATIC MULTI-SCALE SEGMENTATION OF INTRAHEPATIC VESSEL IN CT IMAGES FOR LIVER SURGERY PLANNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000317135900009"}
