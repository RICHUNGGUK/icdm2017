Building oil studies that emphasize the role of intangible assets in interolganizational relationships, this study argues that buyers are less likely to use reverse auctions for supplier relationships involving a high degree of non-contractibility. The argument complements traditional transaction cost economics arguments that focus oil the impact of asset specificity and product specialization. We identify six dimensions of non-contractibility-quality, supplier technological investments, information exchange, responsiveness, trust, and flexibility-which encompass task-based and interaction-based non-contractibility. The study finds that, together with product specialization, these non-contractible elements of interorganizational relationships have greater explanatory power for re verse auction use than asset specificity. This result highlights the importance of supplier investments in non-contractible elements of exchange relationships in an increasingly dynamic service- and knowledge-based economy.", "paper_title": "BUYER INTENTION TO USE INTERNET-ENABLED REVERSE AUCTIONS: THE ROLE OF ASSET SPECIFICITY, PRODUCT SPECIALIZATION, AND NON-CONTRACTIBILITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000261362500004"}
