Under the assumption that the nominal T-S fuzzy-model-based control systems are locally controllable (i.e., each fuzzy rule of the nominal T-S fuzzy-model-based control systems has a full row rank for its controllability matrix), a sufficient condition is proposed to preserve the assumed property when the parameter uncertainties are added into the nominal T-S fuzzy-model-based control systems. The proposed sufficient condition can provide the explicit relationship of the bounds on parameter uncertainties to preserve the assumed property. Besides, a robustly global controllability condition and the related robustly global stabilizability condition of the uncertain T-S fuzzy-model-based control systems are also presented in this paper. A nonlinear mass-spring damper mechanical system with parameter uncertainties is given as an example to illustrate the application of the proposed sufficient conditions.", "paper_title": "Robust Controllability of T-S Fuzzy-Model-Based Control Systems With Parametric Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000272319000008"}
