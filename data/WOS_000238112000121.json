The obtained results enable both heteroassociative and autoassociative memories to be synthesized by assuring the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point and the feeding data via external inputs rather than initial conditions. It is shown that criteria herein can ensure the designed input matrix to be obtained by using one-dimensional space-invariant cloning template. Finally, one specific example is included to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology.", "paper_title": "Associative memories based on discrete-time cellular neural networks with one-dimensional space-invariant templates", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000121"}
