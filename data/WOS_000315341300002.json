A general study showing the advantages of using predictors to avoid mapping inconsistences in autonomous SLAM architectures is presented. In addition, this paper presents a priority-based uncertainty map construction method of the environment by a mobile robot when executing a SLAM algorithm. The SLAM algorithm is implemented with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and extracts corners (convex and concave) and lines (associated with walls) from the surrounding environment. A navigation approach directs the robot motion to the regions of the environment with the higher uncertainty and the higher priority. The uncertainty of a region is specified by a probability characterization computed at the corresponding representative points. These points are obtained by a Monte Carlo experiment and their probability is estimated by the sum of Gaussians method, avoiding the time-consuming map-gridding procedure. The priority is determined by the frame in which the uncertainty region was detected (either local or global to the vehicle's pose). The mobile robot has a non-reactive trajectory following controller implemented on it to drive the vehicle to the uncertainty points. SLAM real-time experiments in real environment, navigation examples, uncertainty maps constructions along with algorithm strategies and architectures are also included in this work.", "paper_title": "Autonomous Simultaneous Localization and Mapping driven by Monte Carlo uncertainty maps-based navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000315341300002"}
