Most discrete transforms for image reconstruction rely on the FFT, via the Fourier slice theorem (FST), in order to compute reconstructions with low-computational complexity. Consequently, complex arithmetic and floating point representations are needed, the latter of which is susceptible to round-off errors. This study shows that the slice theorem is valid within integer fields, via modulo arithmetic, using a circulant theory of the Radon transform (RT). The resulting number-theoretic RT (NRT) provides a representation of images as discrete projections that is always exact and real-valued. The NRT is ideally suited as part of a discrete tomographic algorithm, an encryption scheme or for when numerical overflow is likely, such as when computing a large number of convolutions on the projections. The low-computational complexity of the NRT algorithm also provides an efficient method to generate discrete projected views of image data.", "paper_title": "Exact image representation via a number-theoretic Radon transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000338559500008"}
