Weak keys and forgery attacks against Xiao et al.'s scheme are demonstrated. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the parallel keyed hash function is not security. Besides, some improvement measures are presented to enhance the security of the parallel keyed hash function. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
