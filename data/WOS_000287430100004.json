To capture the essential aspects of (X, S)-bottleneck cell, we use two-hierarchy Quasi-Birth-Death models (QBDs). The general characters of (X, S)-bottleneck cell are govern by the first hierarchy QBD, while the characters of each flow are captured by the second hierarchy QBD. Based on the model, we present a methodology to derive some theoretic ranges for these probabilities. Our results show that the proposed model can analyze effectively the performance of (X, S)-bottleneck cell. The results in the work are helpful for designing and managing wireless networks.
