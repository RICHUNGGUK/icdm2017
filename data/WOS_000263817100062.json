Missing data are often mistreated in data mining and valuable knowledge related to missing data is often overlooked. This study discusses patterns of missing data in survey databases. It proposes a framework of rough set rule induction method that enables the data miner to obtain association rules of patterns of missing data in a survey database. Through an experiment on a real-world data set, we demonstrate the approach to discovering knowledge about missing data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
