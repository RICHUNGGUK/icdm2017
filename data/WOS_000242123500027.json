A single layer functional link ANN is used for the model where the need of hidden layer is eliminated by expanding the input pattern by Chebyshev polynomials. Thus, creation of nonlinear decision boundaries in the multidimensional input space and approximation of complex nonlinear systems becomes easier. These models are linear in their parameters and nonlinear in the inputs. The recursive least squares method with forgetting factor is used as on-line learning algorithm for parameter updation. The good behaviour of the identification method is tested on Box and Jenkins Gas furnace benchmark identification problem, single input single output (SISO) and multi input multi output (MIMO) discrete time plants. Stability of the identification scheme is also addressed. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
