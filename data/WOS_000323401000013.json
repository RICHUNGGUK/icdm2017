It is based on the well-known D8 approach that simulates the overland flow but uses a more elaborate water transfer model that is inspired by the natural behaviour of water. The proposed solution has several advantages: it works on unprocessed DEMs avoiding the problems caused by pits and flats, can generate watercourses with a width greater than one cell and detects fluvial landforms like lakes, marshes or river islands that are not directly handled by Most previous solutions.
