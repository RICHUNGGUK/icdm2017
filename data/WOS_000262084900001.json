Since the UML metamodel does not enforce model consistency, there are no fixed guidelines on how to approach the consistency problem. Current solutions are generally partial. The translation of the metamodel and the user designed model into Description Logics has proved to provide a solution in detecting a large set of inconsistencies. In order to make this solution available to system designers, we have implemented MCC+, a UML model consistency checker, built as a plug-in for Poseidon for UML, and relying on Jena as a reasoning engine. Compared to other approaches, we propose a usable and scalable solution, interoperable with a known modeling tool. We show the application of MCC+ to a real world large example of a meshing tool.", "paper_title": "A TOOL BASED ON DL FOR UML MODEL CONSISTENCY CHECKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000262084900001"}
