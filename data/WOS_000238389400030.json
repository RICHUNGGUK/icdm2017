We bring forward a new method on video texture synthesis, in which evolution computing technique is introduced into the processes of synthesizing videos. In the method, by analyzing and processing a finite source video clip, Infinite video sequences obtained can be played smoothly in vision. Comparing with many existing video texture synthesis algorithms, this method can not only get high-quality video results without complicated pre-processing of source video, but also improve the efficiency of synthesis.", "paper_title": "An evolution computation based approach to synthesize video texture", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400030"}
