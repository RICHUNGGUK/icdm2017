Such agents employ what we call a \"questionable encryption scheme\" in which it is computationally intractable to determine if the output is an asymmetric ciphertext or nonce. We therefore show a fundamental computational limitation of information forensics.", "paper_title": "On fundamental limitations of proving data theft", "paper_id": "WOS:000246145600010"}
