This way, contradiction measures that are semicontinuous and completely semicontinuous, from both below and above, were defined. Although some examples were given, the problem of finding families of functions satisfying the different axioms remained open. The purpose of this paper is to construct some families of contradiction measures firstly using continuous t-norms and t-conorms, and secondly by means of strong negations. In both cases, we study the properties that they satisfy. These families are then classified according the different kinds of measures presented in the above paper.", "paper_title": "OBTAINING CONTRADICTION MEASURES ON INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY SETS FROM FUZZY CONNECTIVES", "paper_id": "WOS:000302473700003"}
