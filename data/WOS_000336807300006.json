Indeed, most camera-enabled electronic devices contain various auxiliary sensors such as accelerometers, compasses, GPS receivers, etc. Data captured by these sensors during the media acquisition have already been used to limit camera degradations such as shake and also to provide some basic tagging information such as the location. However, exploiting the sensor-recordings modality for subsequent higher-level information extraction such as interesting events has been a subject of rather limited research, further constrained to specialized acquisition setups. In this work, we show how these sensor modalities allow inferring information (camera movements, content degradations) about each individual video recording. In addition, we consider a multi-camera scenario, where multiple user generated recordings of a common scene (e.g., music concerts) are available. For this kind of scenarios we jointly analyze these multiple video recordings and their associated sensor modalities in order to extract higher-level semantics of the recorded media: based on the orientation of cameras we identify the region of interest of the recorded scene, by exploiting correlation in the motion of different cameras we detect generic interesting events and estimate their relative position. Furthermore, by analyzing also the audio content captured by multiple users we detect more specific interesting events. We show that the proposed multimodal analysis methods perform well on various recordings obtained in real live music performances.", "paper_title": "Multimodal extraction of events and of information about the recording activity in user generated videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000336807300006"}
