The seminal Hajnal-Szemeredi theorem characterizes the minimum degree that ensures a graph G contains a perfect K-r-packing. In this paper we prove the following analogue for directed graphs: Suppose that T is a tournament on r vertices and G is a digraph of sufficiently large order n where r divides n. If G has minimum in-and outdegree at least (1 - 1/r) n then G contains a perfect T-packing. In the case when T is a cyclic triangle, this result verifies a recent conjecture of Czygrinow, Kierstead and Molla [4] (for large digraphs). Furthermore, in the case when T is transitive we conjecture that it suffices for every vertex in G to have sufficiently large indegree or outdegree. We prove this conjecture for transitive triangles and asymptotically for all r >= 3. Our approach makes use of a result of Keevash and Mycroft [10] concerning almost perfect matchings in hypergraphs as well as the Directed Graph Removal Lemma [1, 6].", "paper_title": "On Directed Versions of the Hajnal-Szemeredi Theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000362717800004"}
