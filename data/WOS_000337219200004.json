Despite the importance of such models in many branches of science they have not been the focus of systematic statistical analysis until recently. In this work we propose a general approach to estimate the parameters of systems of differential equations measured with noise. Our methodology is based on the maximization of the penalized likelihood where the system of differential equations is used as a penalty. To do so, we use a reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach that allows us to formulate the estimation problem as an unconstrained numeric maximization problem easy to solve. The proposed method is tested with synthetically simulated data and it is used to estimate the unobserved transcription factor cdaR in Streptomyces coelicolor using gene expression data of the genes it regulates.
