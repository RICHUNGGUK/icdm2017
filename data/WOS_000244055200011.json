They proved that Aut(G(m)) has a normal subgroup H, which is a semidirect product group of the centralizer Z(f) of f in GL(m)(2) with S-m, and the index [Aut(G(m)) : H] is the number of elements of F-f = {f, 1-f, 1/f, 1-1/f, 1/(1 - f), f/(1 - f)} that are conjugate to f. In this paper, a theorem to describe the relationship between the quotient group Aut(G(m))/H and the set F-f is presented, and a way to find the elements of F-f that are conjugate to f is proposed. Then we prove that Aut(G(m))/H is isomorphic to S-3 and H is a semidirect product group of GL(m/2)(4) with S-m in the linear case. Finally, we generalize a result due to Calderbank et al.", "paper_title": "On the automorphism groups of a family of binary quantum error-correcting codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000244055200011"}
