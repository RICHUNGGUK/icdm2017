However, at-speed scan test suffers the test-induced yield loss. Because the switching-activity in test mode is much higher than that in normal mode, the switching-induced large current drawn causes severe IR drop and increases gate delay. X-filling is the most commonly used technique to reduce IR-drop effect during at-speed test. However, the effectiveness of X-filling depends on the number and the characteristic of X-bit distribution. In this paper, we propose a physical-location-aware X-identification which redistributes X-bits so that the maximum switching-activity is guaranteed to be reduced after X-filling. We estimate IR-drop using RedHawk tool and the experimental results on ITC'99 show that our method has an average of 9.42% more reduction of maximum IR-drop as compared to a previous work which redistributes X-bits evenly in all test vectors.", "paper_title": "A Physical-Location-Aware X-Bit Redistribution for Maximum IR-Drop Reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000307443700009"}
