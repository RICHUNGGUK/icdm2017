Since how to use the rough set model to solve fuzzy problems plays a crucial role in the development of the rough set theory, the fusion of hesitant fuzzy set and rough set is then firstly explored in this paper. Both constructive and axiomatic approaches are considered for this study. In constructive approach, the model of the hesitant fuzzy rough set is presented to approximate a hesitant fuzzy target through a hesitant fuzzy relation. In axiomatic approach, an operators-oriented characterization of the hesitant fuzzy rough set is presented, that is, hesitant fuzzy rough approximation operators are defined by axioms and then, different axiom sets of lower and upper hesitant fuzzy set-theoretic operators guarantee the existence of different types of hesitant fuzzy relations producing the same operators.", "paper_title": "Constructive and axiomatic approaches to hesitant fuzzy rough set", "paper_id": "WOS:000336270600004"}
