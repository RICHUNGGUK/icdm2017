Information security professionals mainly regard users as an information security threat, whereas users believe themselves that they are an untapped resource for security work. The limited interaction between users and information security managers results in a lack of understanding for the other's point of view. These divergent views on and interpretations of information security mean that managers tend to base their practical method on unrealistic assumptions, resulting in management approaches that are poorly aligned with the dynamics of the users' working day.
