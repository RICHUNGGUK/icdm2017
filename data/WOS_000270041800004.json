Based on several passive optical devices, such as beam splitter, optical switch or wavelength divided multiplexer, various types of fiber-based QKD networks have been proposed. However, it is still hard to accurately assess these networks. To find the optimal solution, a general assessment that would not involve detailed schemes is quite necessary. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation method and analyze optical-device-based QKD networks including two rational aspects: (i) network connectivity and network bandwidth which reflect the network's flexibility and performance in theory; (ii) network cost that brings pragmatic restriction on the network construction in practice. Applying this model, we compare five typical types of optical-device-based QKD networks. The explicit results demonstrate the above networks' characteristics and some valuable conclusions.", "paper_title": "QKD NETWORKS WITH PASSIVE OPTICAL ELEMENTS: ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000270041800004"}
