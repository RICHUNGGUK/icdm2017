Our approach is based on irradiance convolutions over a multi-layered representation of the volume for light transport, which is general enough to obtain plausible depictions of translucent objects based on the diffusion approximation. We aim at providing an efficient physically based algorithm that can apply arbitrary diffusion profiles to general geometries. We obtain accurate results for a wide range of materials, on par with the hierarchical method by Jensen and Buhler.", "paper_title": "Convolution-Based Simulation of Homogeneous Subsurface Scattering", "paper_id": "WOS:000297317200011"}
