The task used in this study manipulates varying levels of task complexity for quality control decisions in a high-volume discrete manufacturing environment. The volume of process monitoring and quality control data produced in this type of environment can be daunting. Today's managers need effective decision support tools to sort through the morass of data in a timely fashion to make critical decisions on product and process quality.", "paper_title": "Using Cognitive Fit Theory to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Information Visualizations: An Example Using Quality Assurance Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000279558200013"}
