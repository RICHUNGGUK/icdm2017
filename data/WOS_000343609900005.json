There was sufficient experience that ACA would work with almost any user data that lent itself to co-occurrence. While most of the current researches still relied on the data of scientific literatures. In this study, in order to provide useful information for better enterprise management, the idea and method of ACA was applied to analyze the information interaction intensity and contents of enterprise web users. Firstly, the development of ACA was briefly introduced. Then the sample data and method used in this study were given. Three QQ groups' instant messages of a Chinese company were selected as the raw data and the concepts and model of user interaction intensity (UII) were proposed by referring the ACA theory. Social network analysis method, combined with in-deep interview method were used to analyze the information interaction intensity and contents of enterprise users. Operatively, Excel, Ucinet, Pajek, Netdraw and VOSviewer software were combined to analyze them quantitatively and visually. Finally, it concluded that UII model was relatively reasonable and it could nicely measure the information interaction intensity and contents of enterprise web users.", "paper_title": "Applying author co-citation analysis to user interaction analysis: a case study on instant messaging groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000343609900005"}
