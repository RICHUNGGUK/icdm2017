The strength of the triangle inequality is captured by parametrizing the triangle inequality as follows. A complete directed graph G = (V, E) with a cost function c : E -> R(+) is said to satisfy the gamma-parametrized triangle inequality if gamma(c(u, w) + c(w, v)) >= c(u, v) for all distinct u, v, w is an element of V. Then the graph G is called a gamma-triangular graph. For any gamma-triangular graph G, for gamma < 1 we show that ATSP(G)/AP(G) <= gamma/1-gamma + o(1), where ATSP(G) and AP(G) are the costs of an optimum Hamiltonian cycle and an optimum cycle cover respectively. In addition, we observe that there exists an infinite family of gamma-triangular graphs for each valid gamma < 1 which demonstrates the near-tightness (up to a factor of 1/2 gamma + o(1)) of the above bound. For gamma >= 1, the ratio ATSP(G)/AP(G) can become unbounded. The upper bound is shown constructively and can also be viewed as an approximation algorithm for ATSP with parametrized triangle inequality. We also consider the following problem: in a gamma-triangular graph, does there exist a function f(gamma) such that c(max)/c(min) is bounded by f(gamma)? (Here c(max) and c(min) are the costs of the maximum cost and minimum cost edges respectively.) We show that when gamma < 1/root 3, c(max)/c(min) <= 2 gamma(3)/1-3 gamma(2). This upper bound is sharp in the sense that there exist gamma-triangular graphs with c(max)/c(min) = 2 gamma(3)/1-3 gamma(2). Moreover, for gamma >= 1/root 3, no such function f (gamma) exists.
