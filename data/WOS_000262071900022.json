In the area of medicine one rapidly reaches boundaries in the visualization of complex information [J.L.M. Poiseuille, Recherches experimentales sur le mouvement des liquids clans les tubes de tres petits diametres, Memoires Savant des Etrangers 9 (1846) 433-544]. Learning and teaching without recourse to patients is difficult. Consequently the use of models and simulations are useful. In this paper the authors report about experiences gained with HAEMOSIM, a web-based project in medical education. The goal of this project is the design and development of interactive simulations in local hemodynamics by the application of mathematical-physiological models. These include the modelling of arterial blood flow dependent on the pressure gradient, radius and bifurcations, as well as blood flow profiles in dependency of viscosity, density and radius and finally pulse-wave dynamics with regard to local and global compliance.
