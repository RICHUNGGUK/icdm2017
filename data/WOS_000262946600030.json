However, there exists no known simulation approach on how to deploy a popular real-time network service such as videoconferencing. This paper demonstrates how OPNET can be leveraged to assess the readiness of existing IP networks to support desktop videoconference. To date, OPNET does not have built-in features to support videoconferencing or its deployment. The paper offers remarkable details on how to model and configure OPNET for such a purpose. The paper considers two types of video traffic (viz. fixed and empirical video packet sizes). Empirical video packet sizes are collected from well-known Internet traffic traces. The paper presents in-depth analysis and interpretation of simulation results and shows how to draw proper engineering conclusions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
