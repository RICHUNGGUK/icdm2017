The goal is to find groups or clusters of like data. The clusters will be of interest to the person applying the algorithm. An objective function-based clustering algorithm tries to minimize (or maximize) a function such that the clusters that are obtained when the minimum/maximum is reached are homogeneous. One needs to choose a good set of features and the appropriate number of clusters to generate a good partition of the data into maximally homogeneous groups. Objective functions for clustering are introduced. Clustering algorithms generated from the given objective functions are shown, with a number of examples of widely used approaches discussed.
