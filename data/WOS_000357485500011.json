The microgrid is modelled as a parallel composition of various stochastic hybrid automata. Extensive simulation runs of the behaviour of the main individual microgrid components give insight into the complex dynamics of the system and provide useful information to determine adequate parameter settings. The analysis of the microgrid focuses on determining the probability of linear temporal logic properties expressed in the logic LTL, using the statistical model checker Uppaal-SMC.", "paper_title": "Modelling and statistical model checking of a microgrid", "paper_id": "WOS:000357485500011"}
