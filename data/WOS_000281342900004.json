Although several sophisticated techniques are available for reducing capture IR-drop, there are few complete capture-safe test generation flows. This paper addresses the problem by proposing a novel and practical capture-safe test generation flow, featuring (1) a complete capture-safe test generation flow; (2) reliable capture-safety checking; and (3) effective capture-safety improvement by combining X-bit identification & X-filling with low launch-switching-activity test generation. The proposed flow minimizes test data inflation and is compatible with existing automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) flow. The techniques proposed in the flow achieve capture-safety without changing the circuit-under-test or the clocking scheme.", "paper_title": "A Study of Capture-Safe Test Generation Flow for At-Speed Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342900004"}
