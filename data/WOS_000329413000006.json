The amount of information and the effectiveness of the features used will determine the recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel face recognition approach using information about face images at higher and lower resolutions so as to enhance the information content of the features that are extracted and combined at different resolutions. As the features from different resolutions should closely correlate with each other, we employ the cascaded generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) to fuse the information to form a single feature vector for face recognition. To improve the performance and efficiency, we also employ \"Gabor-feature hallucination\", which predicts the high-resolution (HR) Gabor features from the Gabor features of a face image directly by local linear regression. We also extend the algorithm to low-resolution (LR) face recognition, in which the medium-resolution (MR) and HR Gabor features of a LR input image are estimated directly. The LR Gabor features and the predicted MR and HR Gabor features are then fused using GCCA for LR face recognition. Our algorithm can avoid having to perform the interpolation/super-resolution of face images and having to extract HR Gabor features. Experimental results show that the proposed methods have a superior recognition rate and are more efficient than traditional methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
