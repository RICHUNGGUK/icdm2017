The prediction results are compared by the root mean squared error (RMSE) and scatter plot, respectively. The results show that the performance of the fuzzy system is little bit worse than that of the DPNN but better than that of the neural network. We can develop the desired fuzzy system by optimization methods.", "paper_title": "Index prediction of KOSPI 200 based on data models and knowledge rules for qualitative and quantitative approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300069"}
