With this aim, a method which can be used easily and efficiently by practitioners for optimizing multi-response problems is proposed. Implementation steps and considerations, in addition to optimization measures to assess method's solutions and guide the analyst in finding an effective compromise solution, are also presented. Three classical examples from the literature are used to assess the performance of several prominent methods in the response surface methodology (RSM) framework and help practitioners make a better-informed choice among them.
