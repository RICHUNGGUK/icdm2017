In this paper, based on our former combustion LBM model on the macroscale, we attempt to extend it into premixed microcombustion simulation. Considering the external heat losses in microcombustion, the second-order implicit scheme for boundary condition treatment was adopted in our LBM model. Numerical tests have proved that its accuracy and stability were suitable. Furthermore, planar microcombustion with backward-facing step was also studied in order to show its different performances and improvement, which are compared with microcombustor without back step.", "paper_title": "A NUMERICAL STUDY ON PREMIXED MICROCOMBUSTION BY LATTICE BOLTZMANN METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000304886400005"}
