Preference indicators of co-authorship, cross-reference and cross-citation are defined, presented and discussed. The study revealed that geopolitical location, cultural relations and language are determining factors in shaping preferences whether in co-authorship, cross-reference or cross-citation. Areas like Central Europe, Scandinavia, Latin America (supplemented with Spain and Portugal), the Far East or the Australia-New Zealand-South Africa triad form typical \"clusters\" with mutually strong preferences towards each other. The USA appears to have a distinguished role enjoying universal preference, which - in the cross-reference and cross-citation case - is asymmetric for the greater part of the countries under study.", "paper_title": "Cross-national preference in co-authorship, references and citations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240477700012"}
