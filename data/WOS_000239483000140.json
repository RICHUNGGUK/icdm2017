The PID parameters of the load controller of the double-controller scheme are obtained by a neural network controller with back propagation algorithm. Based on the adaptive algorithm of Universal Learning Network (ULN), ULN is adopted for modeling the plant and being a predictor of the control system. Simulation results prove the applicability and effectiveness of the improved double-controller scheme. ULN and the neural network controller give the double-controller scheme more representing abilities and robust ability.", "paper_title": "Predictive control method of improved double-controller scheme based on neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000140"}
