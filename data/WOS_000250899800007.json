Regional statistical properties on intensities are used to find sharing degrees among features in order to recognize generic objects efficiently. Based on boosting for multi-classification, the layer characteristic and two typical weights in sharing-code maps are taken into account to keep the maximum Hamming distance in categories, and heuristic search strategies are provided in the recognition process. Experimental results reveal that, compared with interest point detectors in representation and multi-boost in learning, joint layer boosting with statistical feature extraction can enhance the recognition rate consistently, with a similar detection rate.
