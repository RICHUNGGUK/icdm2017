This method transforms a conventionally designed sigma-delta A-D converter into a jitter tolerant one. Jitter tolerance is provided by the modified feedback signal paths and a consequently inserted digital LPF. This method is applicable independently of a system order and the other specifications.", "paper_title": "Jitter tolerant continuous-time sigma-delta A-D converter employing in-loop low-pass filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000244547000007"}
