To handle a large amount of imprecise information, uncertain databases have been recently developed. In this paper, we study how to efficiently discover frequent itemsets from large uncertain databases, interpreted under the Possible World Semantics. This is technically challenging, since an uncertain database induces an exponential number of possible worlds. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel methods to capture the itemset mining process as a probability distribution function taking two models into account: the Poisson distribution and the normal distribution. These model-based approaches extract frequent itemsets with a high degree of accuracy and support large databases. We apply our techniques to improve the performance of the algorithms for (1) finding itemsets whose frequentness probabilities are larger than some threshold and (2) mining itemsets with the highest frequentness probabilities. Our approaches support both tuple and attribute uncertainty models, which are commonly used to represent uncertain databases. Extensive evaluation on real and synthetic datasets shows that our methods are highly accurate and four orders of magnitudes faster than previous approaches. In further theoretical and experimental studies, we give an intuition which model-based approach fits best to different types of data sets.", "paper_title": "Model-based probabilistic frequent itemset mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000324652900008"}
