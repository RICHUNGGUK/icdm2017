One of the most important challenges to overcome is how to balance maintenance of the system and the global system availability. In this paper, a novel mechanism is proposed, the Cobweb Guardian, which provides solutions not only to reduce the effects of maintenance but to remove the effects of dependencies on system availability due to deployment dependencies, invocation dependencies, and environment dependencies. By using the Cobweb Guardian, Grid administrators can execute the maintenance tasks safely at runtime whilst ensuring high system availability. The results of our evaluations show that our proposed dependency-aware maintenance mechanism can significantly increase the throughput and the availability of the whole system at runtime.
