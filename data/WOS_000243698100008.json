The hybrid network is able to classify data samples incrementally and, at the same time, to extract rules directly from the network weights for justifying its predictions. With regards to process systems engineering, the proposed network is applied to a fault detection and diagnosis task in a power generation station. Specifically, the efficiency of the network in monitoring the operating conditions of a circulating water (CW) system is evaluated by using a set of real sensor measurements collected from the power station. The rules extracted are analyzed, discussed, and compared with those from a rule extraction method of FAM. From the comparison results, it is observed that the proposed network is able to extract more meaningful rules with a lower degree of rule redundancy and higher interpretability within the neural network framework. The extracted rules are also in agreement with experts' opinions for maintaining the CW system in the power generation plant. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
