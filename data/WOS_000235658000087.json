With the increasingly emerging web services, one of the main problems is not to find out the required services, but to select the optimum one from a set of requirements-satisfying services. In this paper, we propose a workflow-organization-model-based method to compute web services reputation values, then combine the reputation values with QoS-based objective quality values as the judgment standard to provide to users. Based on these values, users can select the optimum web service to execute.", "paper_title": "A method to select the optimum web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000087"}
