It is often difficult to generate traces from deployed systems due to the disturbance and overhead that trace collection may cause on a system in operation. Many organizations also do not keep historical traces of failures. On the other hand earlier techniques focusing on fault diagnosis in deployed systems require a collection of passing-failing traces, in-house reproduction of faults or a historical collection of failed traces. In this paper, we investigate an alternative solution. We investigate how artificial faults, generated using software mutation in test environment, can be used to diagnose actual faults in deployed software systems. The use of traces of artificial faults can provide relief when it is not feasible to collect different kinds of traces from deployed systems. Using artificial and actual faults we also investigate the similarity of function call traces of different faults in functions. To achieve our goal, we use decision trees to build a model of traces generated from mutants and test it on faulty traces generated from actual programs. The application of our approach to various real world programs shows that mutants can indeed be used to diagnose faulty functions in the original code with approximately 60-100% accuracy on reviewing 10% or less of the code; whereas, contemporary techniques using pass-fail traces show poor results in the context of software maintenance. Our results also show that different faults in closely related functions occur with similar function call traces. The use of mutation in fault diagnosis shows promising results but the experiments also show the challenges related to using mutants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
