Representing five broad long-term research directions, these challenges are intimately related with issues whose solution will advance science and have technological, social, and economic impact in Brazil. SBC led the effort to identify these challenges because it detected the need for novel proactive actions to foster long-term planning and research in computer science in Brazil. Further, SBC hoped to enhance cooperation with other scientific domains and provide input to public R&D policymakers.", "paper_title": "Grand research challenges in computer science in Brazil", "paper_id": "WOS:000256765400021"}
