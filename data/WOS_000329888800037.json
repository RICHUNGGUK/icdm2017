However, it is difficult to measure image content similarity due to visual changes caused by varying viewpoint and environment. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient method to more effectively measure content similarity from image measurements. Our method is based on the ranking information available from existing retrieval systems. We observe that images within the set which, when used as queries, yield similar ranking lists are likely to be relevant to each other and vice versa. In our method, ranking consistency is used as a verification method to efficiently refine an existing ranking list, in much the same fashion that spatial verification is employed. The efficiency of our method is achieved by a list-wise min-Hash scheme, which allows rapid calculation of an approximate similarity ranking. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
