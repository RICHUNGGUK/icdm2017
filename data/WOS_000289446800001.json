Let V-1 and V-2 be the discrete function spaces induced from these meshes by equipping them with some choice of basis functions. This work discusses the following problem: given two functions f(1) epsilon V-f and f(2) epsilon V-g, compute f(1) + f(2). Despite the simple statement of the task, the general solution is not obvious, for the desired sum lies neither in V-1 nor in V-2, and is not representable on either mesh. The problem is solved by efficiently constructing a supermesh T-s of T-1 and T-2 which induces a superspace of both V-1 and V-2. Once such a mesh is available, the desired quantity may be represented exactly (subject to roundoff). (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
