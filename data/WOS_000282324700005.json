Based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we analyze the impact of the configuration of destination antennas on the outage performance under arbitrary Nakagami-m fading channels. Results reveal that increasing the number of destination antennas is not necessary for an improvement of outage performance with any Nakagami-m parameter. Inspired by this fact, an approximation is proposed for the optimal selection. Simulation results show that the approximation is an efficient selection method.", "paper_title": "Statistical assessment of selection-based dual-hop semi-blind amplify-and-forward cooperative networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282324700005"}
