The paper presents suitable interface conditions and algorithms for iteratively coupling sub-domains modeled by three different boundary element time-domain formulations, namely: acoustic and elastodynamic BEM formulations based on time-dependent Green's functions and non-linear time-domain approach which employs elastostatic Green's functions and therefore requires domain discretization. Two examples are analyzed and at the end of the paper conclusions of the study are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
