Design/methodology/approach - The torque-speed characteristics are predicted using two different methods. These are direct and indirect finite element methods, at different cross-coupling levels, namely, full cross-coupling on both PM flux linkage and dq-axis inductances, partial cross-coupling on the PM flux linkage only and without cross-coupling. Findings - The influence of the cross-coupling on dq-axis inductances of the studied machine is relatively small. However, it is more significant on the PM flux linkage. Therefore, the partial cross-coupling model, which is much easier and faster, exhibits almost the same accuracy as the full cross-coupling model. Furthermore, the end-effect causes a large reduction in torque-speed characteristics. However, such a reduction is more significant in the flux weakening operation region. Originality/value - This is the first time that the influence of end-effect of SFPM machines on the torque-speed characteristics, especially in flux weakening region, and on the dq-axis inductances has been investigated.", "paper_title": "Torque speed characteristics of switched flux permanent magnet machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000300535100003"}
