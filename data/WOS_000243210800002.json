According to this characteristic, we construct neural networks with a family of self-organizing feature maps to cluster the input data space. The proposed algorithm in this paper defines a novel similarity measure, topological similarity, and employs some new concepts, such as SOFM family, UsageFactor. The clustering algorithm handles the clusters with arbitrary shapes and avoid the limitations of the conventional clustering algorithms. We conclude our paper by several experiments with synthetic and standard data set of different characteristics, which show good performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Clustering algorithm research based on self-organizing feature maps networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243210800002"}
