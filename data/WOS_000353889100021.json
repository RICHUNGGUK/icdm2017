After analyzing the trade-off between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency, various research results are summarized within a framework of energy-efficient resource allocation with optimization as a common tool. Then potential energy efficiency improving approaches in both physical layer and deployment aspects are provided. Finally, energy efficiency related open problems in massive multiple-input multiple-output, device-to-device communications, ultra dense networks, and other emerging technologies are identified.", "paper_title": "RECENT ADVANCES IN ENERGY-EFFICIENT NETWORKS AND THEIR APPLICATION IN 5G SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000353889100021"}
