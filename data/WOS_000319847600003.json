First, this study showed that the virtual teacher's position and orientation have an effect on learning efficiency, when some teacher-settings are more comfortable and easy to watch than others. A sequence of physical-task learning experiments have been conducted using mixed-reality technology. The result suggested that the virtual-teacher's close side-view is the optimal view for learning physical-tasks that include significant one-hand movements. However, when both hands are used, or rotates around, a rotation-angle adjustment becomes necessary. Therefore, we proposed a software automatic-adjustment method governing the virtual teacher's horizontal rotation angle, so that the learner can easily observe important body motions. The proposed software method was revealed to be effective for motions that gradually reposition the most important moving part. Finally, to enhance the proposed method in the future, we conducted an experiment to find out the effect of setting the vertical view-angle. The result recommended that the more motion's rotation involved the more vertical view angles are wanted to see the whole motion clear.
