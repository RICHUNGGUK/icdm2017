In this paper, we analyze the distributing characteristic of hyper-parameters that the optimal hyper-parameters points form neighborhoods. For finding all the optimal points (on the grid points) in neighborhoods, based on this characteristic, we propose a hybrid method that combines evolution strategies (ES) with a grid search (GS), to carry out optimizing selection of these hyperparameters. We firstly use evolution strategies find the optimal points of hyperparameters and secondly execute a grid search in the neighborhood of these points. Our hybrid method takes advantage of the high computing efficiency of ES and the exhaustive searching merit of GS. Experiments show our hybrid method can successfully find the optimal hyper-parameters points in neighborhoods.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the hyper-parameters for SVM by combining evolution strategies with a grid search", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400087"}
