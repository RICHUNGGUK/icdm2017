The living systems (LST) and the dialectical systems theories (DST) are equally old. If both a quite holistic insight and creativity are needed, a combination of the LST and the DST is a better choice than using each of them separately. LST can make many details visible, while DST can make them an information basis for an innovative action. LST alone can hardly provide an action, especially one of a creative orientation. DTS alone can hardly provide all the necessary insight, but it can provide a bridge between different aspects of the process at stake and help them produce creative synergies of different professions' insights. A case of combining both LST and DST in studying public health care proves fruitful. DTS can influence people to use LST and its insight in a creative way.", "paper_title": "Complementarity of the living systems and the dialectical systems theories: The case of public medical care in Slovenia", "paper_id": "WOS:000246579700003"}
