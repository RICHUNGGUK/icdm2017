Searching such services is thus challenging. The authors' cloud service crawler engine collects metadata about 5,883 cloud services over the Web after parsing more than half a million possible links. An extensive statistical analysis on this data gives an overall view of cloud service provisioning's current status.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Web-Scale Cloud Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000338513400009"}
