Various approaches exist, yet none is taking advantage of the diversity of the available solutions to offer a higher anonymity. We introduce a generic framework, a high level host architecture, that allows the mixture of various communication protocols. Our proposal relies on plugin components to offer generic message processing, and on dynamic routing schemes to offer a generic circuit establishment. The results include a potentially higher anonymity for all the networks deployed within the framework, and a pathway towards sharing user-bases and code-bases, mixing the low- and high-latency communication, and benefiting from security-by-obscurity. Blending various protocols also achieves some level of network unobservability. This paper presents the design of the generic framework, the path to its adoption, the model of two real-world systems, the analysis of various security aspects, and the experimental results.
