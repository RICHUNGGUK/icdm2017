Further, time delays between IT investment transfers and actual market performance make measuring the impact of IT investment on market performance more complex. Based on the perspective of long-term, non-linear, closed-loop causality, this study develops a computerized system dynamics model to analyze the dynamic relationships between organizational IT investment strategy and market performance within information-intensive service industries. The results of this study provide several important implications for IT investment management research and practice. The proposed system dynamics model also provides IT managers with a useful decision support tool for evaluating different IT investment strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
