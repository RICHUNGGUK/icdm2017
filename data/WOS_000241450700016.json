By contrast, other model management operations of significant importance remain underdeveloped. One of the least elaborated operations is model merging. In this paper we discuss the special requirements of model merging and introduce the Epsilon Merging Language (EML), a rule-based language, with tool support, for merging models of diverse metamodels and technologies. Moreover, we identify special cases of model merging that are of particular interest and provide a working example through which we demonstrate the practicality and usefulness of the proposed language.", "paper_title": "Merging models with the Epsilon Merging Language (EML)", "paper_id": "WOS:000241450700016"}
