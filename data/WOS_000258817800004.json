This is highly relevant in visual search studies since visual saliency is at the basis Of Visual attention deployment. Visual saliency can also become important in computer vision applications as it can be used to reduce the computational requirements by permitting processing only in those regions of the scenes containing relevant information. The method is based on Bayesian theory to describe the interaction between top-down and bottom-up information. Unlike other approaches, it evaluates and selects visual features before saliency estimation. This can reduce the complexity and, potentially, improve the accuracy of the saliency Computation. To this end, we present an algorithm for feature evaluation and selection. A two-color conjunction search experiment has been applied to illustrate the theoretical framework of the proposed model. The practical Value of the method is demonstrated with video segmentation of instruments in a laparoscopic cholecystectomy operation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
