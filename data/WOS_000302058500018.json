The colour degree of a vertex v is the number of different colours on edges incident with v. Wang and Li conjectured that for k >= 4, every edge-coloured graph with minimum colour degree k contains a rainbow matching of size at least [k/2]. A properly edge-coloured K-4 has no such matching, which motivates the restriction k >= 4, but Li and Xu proved the conjecture for all other properly coloured complete graphs. LeSaulnier, Stocker, Wenger and West showed that a rainbow matching of size [k/2] is guaranteed to exist, and they proved several sufficient conditions for a matching of size [k/2]. We prove the conjecture in full.", "paper_title": "Large Rainbow Matchings in Edge-Coloured Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000302058500018"}
