The spatial properties of teeth along the leaf contour are something to keep track of, which is made possible through the use of structured representations. This paper introduces a sequence representation of leaf margins where teeth are viewed as symbols of a multivariate real valued alphabet. It presents the methods developed to make use of this description for classification and implementation in a mobile tree identifying application. The results of various classification methods are compared and discussed, both in terms of species recognition and of consistency with botanical concepts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
