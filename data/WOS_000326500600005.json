To address these two challenges, we bridge causal relevance and EP discriminability (the predictive ability of emerging patterns) to facilitate EP mining and propose a new framework of mining EPs from high-dimensional data. In this framework, we study the relationships between causal relevance in a causal Bayesian network and EP discriminability in EP mining, and then reduce the pattern space of EP mining to direct causes and direct effects, or the Markov blanket (MB) of the class attribute in a causal Bayesian network. The proposed framework is instantiated by two EPs-based classifiers, CE-EP and MB-EP, where CE stands for direct Causes and direct Effects, and MB for Markov Blanket. Extensive experiments on a broad range of data sets validate the effectiveness of the CE-EP and MB-EP classifiers against other well-established methods, in terms of predictive accuracy, pattern numbers, running time, and sensitivity analysis.", "paper_title": "Bridging Causal Relevance and Pattern Discriminability: Mining Emerging Patterns from High-Dimensional Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000326500600005"}
