This method first extracts the speech envelopes of the signals processed with multi-level discrete wavelet transform, and then makes use of the speech envelopes to estimate a coarse time delay. Finally it searches for the accurate time delay near the coarse time delay by the cross-correlation function calculated in time domain. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate the time delay between two distributed microphone array signals.", "paper_title": "A Time Delay Estimation Method Based on Wavelet Transform and Speech Envelope for Distributed Microphone Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000326321600007"}
