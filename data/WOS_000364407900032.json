Li and J. Yang, A difference-index based ranking bilinear programming approach to solving bimatrix games with payoffs of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, Journal of Applied Mathematics 2013 (2013), 1-10] pointed out that there is no method in the literature for solving such bimatrix games in which payoffs are represented by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and proposed a method for the same. In this paper, it is pointed out that Li and Yang have considered some mathematical incorrect assumptions in their proposed method. For resolving the shortcomings of Li and Yang's method, a new method (named as Mehar method) is proposed. Also, the exact optimal solution of the numerical problem, solved by Li and Yang by their proposed method, is obtained by the proposed Mehar method.", "paper_title": "Modified difference-index based ranking bilinear programming approach to solving bimatrix games with payoffs of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000364407900032"}
