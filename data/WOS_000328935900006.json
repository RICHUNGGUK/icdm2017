The speedup over a known baseline is a function of the core performance, microarchitectural features, application parameters, chip organization, and multicore topology. The model is flexible enough to consider both CPU and GPU like organizations as well as modern topologies from symmetric to aggressive heterogeneous (asymmetric, dynamic, and fused) designs. This extended model incorporates first order effects-exposing more bottlenecks than previous applications of Amdahl's Law-while remaining simple and flexible enough to be adapted for many applications.", "paper_title": "Multicore Model from Abstract Single Core Inputs", "paper_id": "WOS:000328935900006"}
