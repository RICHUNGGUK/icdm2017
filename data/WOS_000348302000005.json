Security of RGB images during transmission is a major concern, discussed globally. This paper proposes a novel technique for color image security by random hill cipher (RHC) over SLn(F) domain associated with 2D discrete wavelet transform. Existing techniques have discussed the security of image data on the basis of the keys only (which provide only one layer of security for image data), but in the proposed cryptosystem, the keys and the arrangement of RHC parameters are imperative for correct decryption of color image data. Additionally, key multiplication side (pre or post) with the RGB image data should inevitably be known, to correctly decrypt the encrypted image data. So, the proposed cryptosystem provides three layers of security for RGB image data. In this approach, we have considered keys from the special linear group over a field F, which provides enormous key-space for the proposed cryptosystem. A computer simulation on standard examples and results is given to support the fixture of the scheme. Security analysis, and detailed comparison between formerly developed techniques and proposed cryptosystem are also discussed for the robustness of the technique. This method will have large potential usage in the digital RGB image processing and the security of image data.", "paper_title": "Application of algebra and discrete wavelet transform in two-dimensional data (RGB-images) security", "paper_id": "WOS:000348302000005"}
