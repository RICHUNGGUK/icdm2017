Compared with the original Frobenius norm approximation-based algorithm, the proposed algorithm can more accurately find the closest doubly stochastic approximation to the affinity matrix by considering the p.s.d. constraint. In this paper, SSC is formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. In order to solve the high computational complexity of SDP, we present a dual algorithm based on the Lagrange dual formalization. Two versions of the proposed algorithm are proffered: one with less memory usage and the other with faster convergence rate. The proposed algorithm has much lower time complexity than that of the standard interior-point-based SDP solvers. Experimental results on both the UCI data sets and real-world image data sets demonstrate that: 1) compared with the state-of-the-art spectral clustering methods, the proposed algorithm achieves better clustering performance and 2) our algorithm is much more efficient and can solve larger-scale SSC problems than those standard interior-point SDP solvers.", "paper_title": "Efficient Semidefinite Spectral Clustering via Lagrange Duality", "paper_id": "WOS:000340099800014"}
