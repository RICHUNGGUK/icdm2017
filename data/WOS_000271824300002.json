In this paper several relevant properties of the subresultant sequence of these two polynomials are introduced which are used to solve simultaneously the implicitization, inversion, properness and reparametrization problems. It is also shown that these methods can be suitably transformed in order to deal with curves in the three-dimensional space presented by a polynomial parametrization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
