In order to address the complexity of the problem, a three-stage hierarchical approach is proposed. In the first stage, global targets are identified by formulating and solving a linear transportation problem for minimum water usage, maximum water recycle, and minimum wastewater discharge. These targets are determined a priori and without commitment to the network configuration. Next, a network with minimum number of tanks is synthesised by solving a mixed-integer non-linear program. The bilinear constraints are relaxed to transform the program into a mixed-integer linear program that is globally solvable. The third stage is aimed at simplifying the network configuration by minimising the number of network inter-connections. Insights gained from the water pinch analysis are also incorporated into the approach to further reduce the water flows via the placement of water regeneration unit. A case study is solved to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
