If the data are observed in matched pairs, it is often of interest to examine the differences between the responses. The focus is on tests of axial symmetry in two-way tables. A commonly used procedure is the Bowker test which is a generalization of the McNemar test. The test decision is based on a chi-squared approximation which might not be adequate, for example if the table is sparse. Therefore, modifications of the test statistic have been discussed. A test of symmetry based on Bowker's test and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is proposed. A simulation study is carried out to determine and compare the performances of the simulation test, the Bowker test and two modifications.
