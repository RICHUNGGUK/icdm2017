Design/methodology/approach - The original numerical method developed in Caron's Kybernetes paper is used and extended to an industrial construction. The method gives a mathematical model of an industrial process and converts the non-linear partial derivative system into an iterative system of linear equations. Using the well-known finite difference approximation, a numerical solution is computed very quickly. Findings - In order to really obtain a computer-aided numerical solution, it is necessary to define a really manageable approximation method. The new simulation results are detailed and show better results for the steady state in time processing and finally, to imagine improvements of the industrial processes. Originality/value - The paper shows the fast numerical solution, which leads to confidence in the numerical approximations to imagine improvements of the industrial processes easily.", "paper_title": "On the new numerical solution of corona-electrostatic electric field model with inductive electrostatic electrode for the industrial separation of granular mixture", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835400015"}
