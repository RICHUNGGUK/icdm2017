In a within- subjects design, participants played two different video games against a computer, a friend, and a stranger. In addition to self- report ratings, cardiac interbeat intervals ( IBIs) and facial electromyography ( EMG) were measured to index physiological arousal and emotional valence. When compared to playing against a computer, playing against another human elicited higher spatial presence, engagement, anticipated threat, post- game challenge appraisals, and physiological arousal, as well as more positively valenced emotional responses. In addition, playing against a friend elicited greater spatial presence, engagement, and self- reported and physiological arousal, as well as more positively valenced facial EMG responses, compared to playing against a stranger. The nature of the opponent influences spatial presence when playing video games, possibly through the mediating influence on arousal and attentional processes.", "paper_title": "Spatial presence and emotions during video game playing: Does it matter with whom you play?", "paper_id": "WOS:000240909800004"}
