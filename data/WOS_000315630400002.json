We study three representative members of the family. For the first two a team sharing quantum correlations (entanglement) has an advantage over any team restricted to classical correlations. We conjecture that this is true for the third member of the family as well.", "paper_title": "Continuous input nonlocal games", "paper_id": "WOS:000315630400002"}
