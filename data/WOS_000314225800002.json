By Lyapunov-Krasovskii function approach, a novel mean-square exponential stability criterion is derived for the situations that the systems transition rates are completely accessible, partially accessible and non-accessible, respectively. Moreover, the developed stability criterion is extended to the systems with different bounded sector nonlinear constraints. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Stability Analysis for Markovian Jump Neutral Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314225800002"}
