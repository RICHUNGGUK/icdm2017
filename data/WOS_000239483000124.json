The key assumptions are that the neural network approximation errors satisfy certain bounding conditions. By a special scheme, the controller singularity problem is avoided perfectly. The proposed scheme improves the control performance of systems and extends the application scope of nonlinear systems. The overall neural network control systems guarantee that all the signals of the systems are uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero by suitably choosing the design parameter.", "paper_title": "Adaptive neural network control for nonlinear systems based on approximation errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000124"}
