Coordinating distributed Grid resources and computational processes requires adaptable interfaces and tools that provide a modularized and configurable environment for accessing Grid clusters and executing high performance computational tasks. In addition, it is beneficial to make these tools available to the community in a unified framework through a shared cyberinfrastructure, or a portal, so scientists can focus on their scientific work and not be concerned with the implementation of the underlying infrastructure. In this paper we describe a scientific workflow approach to coordinate various resources as data analysis pipelines. We present a three tier architecture for LiDAR interpolation and analysis, a high performance processing of point intensive datasets, utilizing a portal, a scientific workflow engine and Grid technologies. Our proposed solution is available through the GEON portal and, though focused on LiDAR processing, is applicable to other domains as well.", "paper_title": "A three tier architecture for LiDAR interpolation and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300123"}
