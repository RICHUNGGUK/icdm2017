A very simple but effective remeshing procedure based on the FE mesh only is used to accommodate crack propagation. The crack-tip region is modelled by an SBFE subdomain whose semi-analytical displacement solutions are used to extract accurate stress intensity factors. The SBFE subdomain is coupled with the surrounding FE mesh through virtual interfaces so that non-matching nodal discretisations of the shared boundaries can be used and only one SBFE subdomain is needed at a crack-tip. A few plane problems are modelled to validate the new method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
