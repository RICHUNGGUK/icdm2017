This study improves an existing irrigation web service, based on the IRRINET model, by describing a protocol for the field implementation of a fully automated irrigation system. We demonstrate a Fuzzy Decision Support System to improve the irrigation, given the information on the crop and site characteristics. It combines a predictive model of soil moisture and an inference system computing the most appropriate irrigation action to keep this above a prescribed \"safe\" level. Three crops were used for testing the system: corn, kiwi, and potato. This Fuzzy Decision Support System (FDSS) favourably compared with an existing agricultural model and data-base (IRRINET). The sensitivity of the FDSS was tested with random rainfall and also in this extended case the water saving was confirmed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
