But it has a disadvantage that it considers that all the independent variables have the equal weights. In that case, the contour lines of the kernel function are circular, but in fact, the influence of each independent variable on the model is so different that it is more reasonable if the contour lines are oval. To overcome this disadvantage, this paper presents an adaptive radial basis function network (ARBFN) with kernel shape parameters and derives the learning rules from supervised learning. To verify that this architecture is superior to that of the traditional RBFN, we make a comparison between three artificial and fifteen real examples in this study. The results show that ARBFN is much more accurate than the traditional RBFN, illustrating that the shape parameters can actually improve the accuracy of RBFN.", "paper_title": "Adaptive radial basis function networks with kernel shape parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000301578900007"}
