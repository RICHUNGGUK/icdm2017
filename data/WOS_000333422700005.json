This paper proposes a robust audio watermarking scheme in Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) domain, in which the higher-order statistics and synchronization code are utilized. Firstly, the wavelet de-noising is performed on the original host audio, the de-noised digital audio is segmented, and then each segment is cut into two parts. Secondly, with the spatial watermarking technique, synchronization code is embedded into the statistics average value of audio samples in the first part. Thirdly, for the second part, EMD is performed, and a series of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a residual are given, and thenthe higher-order statistics of residual are obtained by using the Hausdorff distance. Finally, the digital watermark is embedded into the residual in EMD domain by using the higher-order statistics. Simulation results show that the proposed watermarking scheme is not only inaudible and robust against common signal processing operations such as MP3 compression, noise addition, resampling, and re-quantization etc, but also robust against the desynchronization attacks such as random cropping, amplitude variation, pitch shifting, and jittering etc.", "paper_title": "A Robust Audio Watermarking Scheme using Higher-order Statistics in Empirical Mode Decomposition Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000333422700005"}
