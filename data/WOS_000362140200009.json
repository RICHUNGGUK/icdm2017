To improve its computational efficiency, a hybrid perturbation random moment method (HPRMM) to estimate the objective function and a hybrid perturbation inverse mapping method (HPIMM) to evaluate the component reliability will be proposed. Based on HPRMM and HPIMM, the nested loop optimization is converted into an efficient single-loop process. Effectiveness and efficiency of proposed approaches are checked by solving optimization problems of a structural acoustic system and a disc brake system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
