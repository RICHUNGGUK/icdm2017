Learning from the imbalance data is a remarkable challenge in the knowledge discovery and data mining field. In this paper, we propose a scaling kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) approach to deal with the multi-class imbalanced data classification problem. We first use standard SVM algorithm to gain an approximate hyperplane. Then, we present a scaling kernel function and calculate its parameters using the chi-square test and weighting factors. Experimental results on KEEL data sets show the proposed algorithm can resolve the classifier performance degradation problem due to data skewed distribution and has a good generalization.", "paper_title": "Imbalanced data classification based on scaling kernel-based support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700039"}
