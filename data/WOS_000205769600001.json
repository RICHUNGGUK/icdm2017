One of the problems of macro-mobility is the hand-off latency. In this paper, we analyse two solutions for IP micro-mobility by means of a general taxonomy. The first one is based on the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). which allows the dynamic address configuration of an association. The second one is based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). which is the Most Popular protocol for Multimedia communications over IP networks. We show that for the SCTP solution. there is room for further optimisations of the hand-off latency by adding slight changes to the protocol. However, as full end-to-end solution, SCTP is not able to handle simultaneous movement of hosts, whose probability in general cannot be neglected. On the other hand, the SIP can handle both single and simultaneous movements cases, although the hand-off latency can increase with respect to the SCTP solution. We show that for a correct and fast hand-off, the SIP server Should he statefull.", "paper_title": "Taxonomy and analysis of IP micro-mobility protocols in single and simultaneous movements scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000205769600001"}
