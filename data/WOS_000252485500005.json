The problem is converted into one of optimization; the computation of the gradients of the energy functional is given for both the continuous and the discrete problems. Links with existing methods for data completion are described and numerical experiments highlight the efficiency of the proposed method as well as its robustness in the case of singular data.", "paper_title": "An optimization approach for the Cauchy problem in linear elasticity", "paper_id": "WOS:000252485500005"}
