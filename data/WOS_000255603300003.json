Our algorithms are based on a generalization of the differential forms introduced by W. Ruppert and S. Gao to many variables, and use singular value decomposition or structured total least squares approximation and Gauss-Newton optimization to numerically compute the approximate Multivariate factors. We demonstrate on a large set of benchmark polynomials that our algorithms efficiently yield approximate factorizations within the coefficient noise even when the relative error in the input is substantial (10(-3)).
