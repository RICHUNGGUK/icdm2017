This amendment increases the reliability of the characteristic parameters (e. g., lag phase, maximal growth rate, stationary phase) derived from a single growth curve. By relating obtained parameters to the respective condition (e. g., concentration of a compound) a dose response curve can be derived that enables the calculation of descriptive pharma-/toxicological values like half maximum effective concentration (EC50). Bootstrap and cross-validation techniques are used for estimating confidence intervals of all derived parameters.", "paper_title": "grofit: Fitting Biological Growth Curves with R", "paper_id": "WOS:000275203800001"}
