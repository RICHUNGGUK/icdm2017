The features extraction is performed by Radon transform and by Haar wavelet, then these features are transformed by non-linear Fisher transform. Finally, the matching process is based on Parzen window classifiers. Moreover, we study a method based on tokenised pseudo-random numbers and user specific knuckle features. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the system in terms of equal error rate (EER) (near zero equal error rate).", "paper_title": "A multi-matcher system based on knuckle-based features", "paper_id": "WOS:000262506600010"}
