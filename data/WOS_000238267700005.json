The proposed approach, which is based on a structural description of previous blocks, allows to simulate complex digital circuits which includes some analog parts (e.g., analog filters, voltage regulator, A/D converter, D/A converter etc.) by adopting an event-driven standard simulator (such as VHDL's simulator). Thus avoiding to use transistor-level simulators which dramatically increase the verification time. The application of the proposed methodology is shown developing the equivalent models of a biquad filter and a DC-DC boost converter. In particular, starting from the description of the fundamental building blocks such as voltage dividers, operational amplifiers, comparators, Miller's integrators and function's generators, the more complex Tow-Thomas biquad filter and DC-DC step-up voltage converter were implemented and simulated. The accuracy obtained is suitable for a preliminary design and validation of the whole systems.", "paper_title": "Modeling of analog blocks by using standard hardware description language", "paper_id": "WOS:000238267700005"}
