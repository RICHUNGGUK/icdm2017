Our algorithm is based on the branch-and-bound framework and, unlike most previous approaches, it is fully combinatorial. We introduce novel lower bounds based on packing trees, as well as a new decomposition technique that contracts entire regions of the graph while preserving optimality guarantees. Our algorithm works particularly well on graphs with relatively small minimum bisections, solving to optimality several large real-world instances (with up to millions of vertices) for the first time.", "paper_title": "An exact combinatorial algorithm for minimum graph bisection", "paper_id": "WOS:000364330300007"}
