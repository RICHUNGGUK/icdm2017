Traditional methods for measuring these sighting distances involve manual labour and disruption of rail services. Drawing parallels with other areas, efficiency and cost of such a task can be improved with automation. Hence, in this work, we describe a framework providing such automation, using image frames captured from video equipment as input. Any such framework needs to meet a set of associated challenges, including: determining the image position of decreasing sized assets as they appear farther from the observer, extracting three-dimensional positioning information (relative to motion) from two-dimensional video information and determining when an asset can no longer be seen (i.e. the sighting distance). Results show that the methods included in this framework perform better than a traditional method and information regarding asset-sighting distance is accurately computed.", "paper_title": "A framework for computing asset-sighting distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000310089900006"}
