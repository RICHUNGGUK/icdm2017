Our algorithm combines sparse illumination computation used in the radiance caching algorithm with BRDF importance sampling. To make this approach feasible, we extend the idea of lazy illumination evaluation, used in the caching approaches, front the spatial to the directional domain. Using importance sampling allows Lis to apply caching not only on low-gloss but also on shiny materials with high-frequency BRDFs, for which the radiance caching algorithm breaks down.", "paper_title": "Spatial Directional Radiance Caching", "paper_id": "WOS:000268218400018"}
