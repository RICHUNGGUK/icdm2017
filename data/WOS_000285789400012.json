We present the CalRAdio-Based advanced Spectrum Scanner (CRABSS), an open platform developed to monitor the ISM 2.4-2.499 GHz band and reveal opportunities for a better utilization of the available spectrum resources. CRABSS is built through a modular approach by integrating the development platform CalRadio 1 with the Unified Link Layer API (ULLA) framework. This solution provides sensing capabilities while preserving the 802.11b standard compatibility on the CalRadio 1 platform. Moreover, it takes advantage of the ULLA framework to export spectrum occupancy information to prospective cognitive radio manager engines, through a standardized set of sensing APIs.
