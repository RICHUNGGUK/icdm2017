The resulting arrangement, called here a Fermat star, is a particular Steiner tree with only one intermediate point. We extend these concepts to rooted binary trees under the known rotation distance that measures the difference in shape of such trees. Minimizing delta is hard. due to the intrinsic difficulty of computing the rotation distance. Then we limit our study to establishing significant upper bounds for delta. In particular, for m binary trees of n vertices, we show how to construct efficiently a Fermat star with delta <= mn - 3m, with a technique inherited from the studies on rotation distance.
