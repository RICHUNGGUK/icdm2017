The permanent satisfaction of constraints being insufficient to ensure safety, this approach focuses on the constraints expression: the compatibility between these constraints is studied, and safe alternatives are ensured when compatibility cannot be established. Case studies involving obstacles, joint position, velocity and acceleration limits illustrates the approach. A particular method is developed to take full advantage of a smooth state of the art avoidance techniques (Faverjon and Tournassoud in Proceedings of the 1987 IEEE international conference on robotics and automation, pp. 1152-1159, 1987) while maintaining safety. Experiments involving a 6-DOF manipulator operating in a cluttered environment illustrate the reliability of the approach and validate the expected performances.", "paper_title": "Motion safety and constraints compatibility for multibody robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000302037300010"}
