The article first outlines the emergence of the silent speech interface from the fields of speech production, automatic speech processing, speech pathology research, and telecommunications privacy issues, and then follows with a presentation of demonstrator systems based on seven different types of technologies. A concluding section underlining some of the common challenges faced by silent speech interface researchers, and ideas for possible future directions, is also provided. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
