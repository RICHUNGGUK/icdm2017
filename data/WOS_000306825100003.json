This is a relevant feature, making smart phone devices highly attractive to the M-era. In order to understand the end-users' needs and elevate competitive advantage of the enterprises, this study has set up an evaluation model for the smart phone improvement by using Fuzzy Hybrid MADM method, which integrated DANP in the Fuzzy integral. Analysis of DANP revealed that Mobile convenience (D-3) has the highest impact to improvement of Customer Equity (D-1), while Mobile multimedia services (C-34) showed as the most influential criteria of D-3. In the case of performance evaluation, it was found out that non-additive (fuzzy integral method, FI) could represent more the real behavior than additive (simple additive weighting method, SAW). This study was able to provide the enterprises a recommended direction which can enhance competitiveness of the smart phone according to network relation map (NRM) and performance evaluation.", "paper_title": "Combining Hybrid MADM with Fuzzy Integral for Exploring the Smart Phone Improvement in M-Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306825100003"}
