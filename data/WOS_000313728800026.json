Through exhaustive search, we observe that these two generators characterize the group of symmetries for the examples we were able to compute. Following the results, we conjecture that these generators characterize the group of symmetries of the generic (m + 1)-dimensional periodic Costas arrays over elementary abelian (Z(p))(m) groups.", "paper_title": "Algebraic Symmetries of Generic (m+1)-Dimensional Periodic Costas Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000313728800026"}
