To complete an occluded object, our method first samples a 3-D volume of the video into directional spatio-temporal slices, and performs patch-based image in-painting to complete the partially damaged object trajectories in the 2-D slices. The completed slices are then combined to obtain a sequence of virtual contours of the damaged object. Next, a posture sequence retrieval technique is applied to the virtual contours to retrieve the most similar sequence of object postures in the available non-occluded postures. Key-posture selection and indexing are used to reduce the complexity of posture sequence retrieval. We also propose a synthetic posture generation scheme that enriches the collection of postures so as to reduce the effect of insufficient postures. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can maintain the spatial consistency and temporal motion continuity of an object simultaneously.", "paper_title": "Virtual Contour Guided Video Object Inpainting Using Posture Mapping and Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000288661800011"}
