We present a formula-based method to efficiently extract interconnect capacitances of interconnects with dummy fills for VLSI designs. The whole flow is as follows: 1) in each process, obtain capacitances per unit length using a 3-D field solver and then create formulas, and 2) in the actual design phase, execute a well-known 2.5-D capacitance extraction. Our results indicated that accuracies of the proposed formulas were almost within 3% error. The proposed formula-based method can extract interconnect capacitances with high accuracy for VLSI circuits. Moreover, we present formulas to evaluate the effect of dummy fills on interconnect capacitances. These can be useful for determining design guidelines, such as metal density before the actual design, and for analyzing the effect of each structural parameter during the design phase.", "paper_title": "Formula-based method for capacitance extraction of interconnects with dummy fills", "paper_id": "WOS:000237202400003"}
