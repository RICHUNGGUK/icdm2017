On the one hand, we report on the results of our investigation of different categories of usability issues. On the other hand, we introduce the ideas of context descriptive security models as a means of mastering the usability challenges of highly dynamic systems. Modern computer systems are involved in many situations of our daily lives. This means that newly deployed systems must be carefully designed in order to be correctly used by laypersons. The scenario we introduce shows that it is no longer feasible to argue that users must be educated in order to correctly operate these systems. As soon as such a system is deployed, for example, in a supermarket, the education-barrier will not be accepted: neither by the customer nor by the provider.", "paper_title": "Bringing the user back into control: A new paradigm for usability in highly dynamic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241622700012"}
