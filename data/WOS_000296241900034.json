This measure is based on a combination of the deep structure of the scale space with the well-known concept of homological persistence. We enhance the noise robust persistence measure by implicitly taking the hill-, ridge- and outlier-like spatial extent of maxima and minima into account. This allows for the distinction between different types of extrema based on their persistence at multiple scales. Our importance measure can be computed efficiently in an out-of-core setting. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our method we apply it to a synthetic and a real-world data set and evaluate its performance and scalability.", "paper_title": "A Scale Space Based Persistence Measure for Critical Points in 2D Scalar Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000296241900034"}
