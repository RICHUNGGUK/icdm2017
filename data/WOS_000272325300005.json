DGIM preserves the local geometric characteristics in many graphics applications, such as model remeshing and morphing. The traditional geometry images using Cartesian coordinates require normal maps for correctly rendering models, because they neglect the existence of local geometric details in the image structure, which leads us to compute the normals and curvatures imprecisely. Using our differential geometry images, normals can be reconstructed easily and correctly thereafter normal maps are no longer required. In addition, DGIM can be easily applied to mesh morphing due to its regular topology and well-preserved local details. In this paper, we also demonstrate a variety of plausible mesh morphing results based on DGIM in shape space.", "paper_title": "Differential geometry images: remeshing and morphing with local shape preservation", "paper_id": "WOS:000272325300005"}
