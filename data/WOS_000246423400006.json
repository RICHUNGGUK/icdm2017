FSALS-SVM iteratively builds the decision function by,adding one basis function from a kernel-based dictionary at one time. The process is terminated by using a flexible and stable epsilon insensitive stopping criterion. A probabilistic speedup scheme is employed to further improve the speed of FSALS-SVM and the resulting classifier is named PFSALS-SVM. Our algorithms are of two compelling features: low complexity and sparse solution. Experiments on benchmark data sets show that our algorithms obtain sparse classifiers at a rather low cost without sacrificing the generalization performance.", "paper_title": "Fast sparse approximation for least squares support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000246423400006"}
