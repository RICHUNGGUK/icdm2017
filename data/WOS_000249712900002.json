The algorithm is based on the link-list search algorithm and the continuum surface tension (CST) model. The developed algorithm with the CST model was implemented to a kind of moving particle approach, the finite volume particle (FVP) method. The FVP method with the new algorithm was tested by oscillatory behaviour of a two-dimensional droplet. The oscillatory period agrees well with analytical one, and the transient shape of the droplet is also in good agreement with that obtained by other numerical methods. The droplet impact on a liquid surface was also studied using the new algorithm. The deposition and splashing phenomena were clearly reproduced. Simulated spread radius of the splashing phenomena was consistent with a power law.
