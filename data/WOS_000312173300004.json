First, from a set of random depth features, Random Forest is used to infer a set of label probabilities for each data sample. This vector of probabilities is used as unary term in alpha - beta swap Graph-cuts algorithm. Moreover, depth values of spatio-temporal neighboring data points are used as boundary potentials. Results on a new multi-label human depth data set show high performance in terms of segmentation overlapping of the novel methodology compared to classical approaches.", "paper_title": "Human limb segmentation in depth maps based on spatio-temporal Graph-cuts optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000312173300004"}
