In the research reported here we have carried out a comparative analysis to classify tremor onset based on intraoperative microelectrode recordings of a PD patient's brain Local Field Potential (LFP) signals. In particular, we compared the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with two well known artificial neural network classifiers, namely a Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Radial Basis Function Network (RBN). The results show that in this study, using specifically PD data, the SVM provided an overall better classification rate achieving an accuracy of 81% recognition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
