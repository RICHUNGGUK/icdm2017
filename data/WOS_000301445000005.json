This calls for more communication and collaboration among all healthcare actors. There is also an increasing demand for personalized healthcare systems that provide effective information management, facilitate communication and collaboration, and support applications to meet user requirements. To address these challenges, we need to advance the integration and interoperability of healthcare applications in a controlled manner. Drawing upon a conceptual model from a collaborative care case study, we identified a set of interoperability requirements and developed a Mashup based interoperability framework. Our framework allows patients and other healthcare actors to engage in collaborative processes through online applications facilitated by mashups. We then use proof-of-concept implementations to demonstrate how our framework is able to facilitate different types of interoperability. We believe that collaborative technologies such as mashups can implement process interoperability requirements to support collaborative care delivery, particularly for asynchronous care delivery.", "paper_title": "A mashup based framework for multi level healthcare interoperability", "paper_id": "WOS:000301445000005"}
