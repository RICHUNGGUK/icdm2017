In this paper it is proposed not to use analytical models but to learn instead a rule-based system from experimental data. The presented methodology increases the level of post-processing interpretation accuracy of experimental data obtained during the evaluation of ice-phobic materials for rotorcraft applications. Key to the success of this model is a possibilistic representation of the uncertainty in the data, combined with a fuzzy fitness-based genetic algorithm that is capable to elicit a suitable set of rules on the basis of incomplete and imprecise information.
