It is shown that the cardinality of 2D VWOOC is larger than that of constant-weight 2D OOC and close to the upper bound in theory. In an OCDMA network, the users employing 2D VWOOC codewords with larger Hamming weight outperform the users using 2D VWOOC codewords with smaller Hamming weight in bit-error-rate performance. Therefore, the OCDMA network employing 2D VWOOC can support diverse quality-of-services (QoS) classes and multimedia services, and make the better use of bandwidth resources in optical networks.", "paper_title": "A new family of 2D variable-weight optical orthogonal codes for OCDMA systems supporting multiple QoS and analysis of its performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000256086300006"}
