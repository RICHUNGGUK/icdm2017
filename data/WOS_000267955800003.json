The algorithm takes advantage of the frequency diversity and the voice/data transmission requirements to dynamically assign the number of subcarriers and bits/per symbol on each subcarrier for each user in a single cell. Due to the strict delay requirement of voice service, the subcarriers with low channel gains are assigned for voice transmission with a small number of bits per symbol to guarantee its required bit-error-rate (BER) and transmission rate. Based on the remaining subcarriers with high channel gains and the transmission power, the throughput of data transmission is then maximized by loading as many bits as possible on each subcarrier to achieve the required transmission bit rate and BER. Theoretical analysis and simulation on the proposed algorithm show that a better performance is obtained than previously reported schemes.
