To achieve circularly polarized (CP) radiation, two arc-shaped notches are loaded into the main patch. To enhance the CP bandwidth so that the proposed antenna can also cover the UHF RFID band for Europe (8662869 MHz), a parasitic element is printed besides the main patch. Experimental measurements show that the 10-dB return loss bandwidth of the proposed antenna was 30.95% (833-1138 MHz) and its corresponding 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth was 8.95% (865-946 MHz). Good gain and radiation efficiency of more than 7 dBic and 90%, respectively, were also exhibited across the two desired UHF RFID bands.
