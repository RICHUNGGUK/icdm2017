In a detailed study of this benchmark, the incompressible SPH approach is applied together with a particle shifting algorithm. Additionally, a new treatment for no-slip boundary conditions is developed and tested. The use of the aforementioned numerical treatment for solid walls leads to significant improvements in the results with respect to other SPH simulations carried out with similar spatial resolution. However, the effect of spatial resolution is not considered in the present study as the number of particles used in each case was kept constant, approximately reproducing the same resolutions employed in reference studies available in the literature as well. Altogether, the detailed comparisons of field variables at discreet points demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the new SPH method.
