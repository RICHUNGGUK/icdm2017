Through the SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol, it achieves secure distribution of a handover key, and consequently becomes a security standard for FMIPv6. However, it is still vulnerable to redirection attacks. In addition, clue to the SEND protocol, it suffers from denial of service attacks and expensive computational cost. In this paper, we present a security protocol, which enhances Kempf-Koodli's one with the help of the AAA infrastructure.", "paper_title": "An Enhanced Security Protocol for Fast Mobile IPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394700019"}
