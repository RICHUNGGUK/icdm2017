However, carrying out the different analyses in an integrated way is not an easy task. Accordingly, combining the results in a consistent framework is an issue. Moreover, risk-based methods have been recently proposed to complement traditional deterministic approaches. They are expected to investigate security more in depth by introducing the concepts of probability and impact associated to the contingencies. Probabilistic approaches are, however, more complex to manage. This paper proposes the overall architecture of a security assessment platform, integrating probabilistic and deterministic tools in a unified environment.", "paper_title": "An Integrated Platform for Power System Security Assessment Implementing Probabilistic and Deterministic Methodologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000325403000033"}
