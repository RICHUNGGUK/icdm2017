It is a hybrid detector, which combines parallel and successive cancellation techniques in order to extract the advantages of both schemes. We use the fact that even if the cross-correlation matrix of the system is not diagonal dominant, the sub-matrices corresponding to different groups can be forced to be diagonal dominant by suitable grouping of users to approximate the decorrelator/MMSE detector by a low-complexity polynomial expansion detector. The latter is computationally very efficient if the crosscorrelation matrix of users within the same group is diagonal dominant. Simulation results showed that the (GPE-SIC) detector has the same performance as the linear group decorrelator successive interference cancellation (GDEC-SIC) detector but with low-computational complexity.
