Due to its high impact in various applications involving reasoning tasks, machine learning researchers have proposed a number of techniques to learn Causal Bayesian Networks. Within the existing works in this direction, few studies have explicitly considered the role that decisional guidance might play to alternate between observational and experimental data processing. In this paper, we go further by introducing a serendipitous strategy to elucidate semantic background knowledge provided by the domain ontology to learn the causal structure of Bayesian Networks. We also complement our contribution with an enrichment process by which it will be possible to reuse these causal discoveries, support the evolving character of the semantic background and make an ontology evolution. Finally, the proposed method will be validated through simulations and real data analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
