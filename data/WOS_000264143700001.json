The RedGreenBlue colour model becomes with this new ordering and associated minimum and maximum operators a complete lattice. We also have defined a complement co for colours in the RedGreenBlue model, with which our new ordering is compatible. As an application we illustrate the extension of our morphological magnification method, described in(8) and(1), towards colour images with sharp edges modelled in the RedGreenBlue model. There we have needed the compatibility of <=(RGB) with co to detect the corners in an image using the hit-or-miss transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method gives very good results.", "paper_title": "New Vector Ordering in the RedGreenBlue Colour Model with Application to Morphological Image Magnification", "paper_id": "WOS:000264143700001"}
