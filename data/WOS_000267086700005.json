In the absence of a uniform framework different business organizations may use different representations for the same exception or may interpret the same exception in different ways. In order to address this issue we apply an ontological approach as a uniform way of representing and interpreting exceptions in cross-organizational settings. This helps agents from different organizations interpret exceptional situations in an unambiguous way and exchange exception related information using standard structures. We believe that an exception ontology along with a domain ontology increases the open MAS reliability and also enhances its fault tolerance capability. The proposed ontology is built using the ontological support provided by the JADE agent framework and exception diagnoses agents are implemented using the JACK (TM) agent framework.
