The existing methods are limited in presenting the extracted panels as squares or rectangles and solely use one type of visual patterns, which are not generic in terms of handling comic images with multiple styles or complex layouts. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing approaches, we propose a novel method to detect panels within comic images. The method incorporates three types of visual patterns extracted from the comic image at different levels and a tree conditional random field framework is used to label each visual pattern by modeling its contextual dependencies. The final panel detection results are obtained by the visual pattern labels and a post-processing stage. Notably, the detected panels are presented as convex polygons in order to keep their content integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
