In this paper, we apply this methodology to compression of rectangular image data. We first define a context-free rectangular image grammar (CFRIG) by extending the context-free grammar. Then we propose a quadsection type algorithm by extending a bisection type algorithm for grammar-based compression of text data. We show that our proposed algorithm approximates M polynomial time the smallest CFRIG within a factor of O(n(4/3)), where an input image data is of size O(n) x O(n). Furthermore, we practically improve the proposed algorithm by adding several rules concerning sub-images. We also present results on computational experiments on the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "A quadsection algorithm for grammar-based image compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000300540400003"}
