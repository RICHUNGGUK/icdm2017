In recent years, digital indoor scenes are becoming increasingly popular, consisting of detailed geometry and complex functionalities. These scenes often consist of objects that reoccur in various poses and interrelate with each other. In this work we analyse the reoccurrence of objects in the scene and automatically detect their functional mobilities. Mobility' analysis denotes the motion capabilities (i.e. degree of freedom) of an object and its subpart which typically relates to their indoor functionalities. We compute an object's mobility by analysing its spatial arrangement, repetitions and relations with other objects and store it in a mobility-tree'. Repetitive motions in the scenes are grouped in mobility-groups', for which we develop a set of sophisticated controllers facilitating semantical high-level editing operations. We show applications of our mobility analysis to interactive scene manipulation and reorganization, and present results for a variety of indoor scenes.", "paper_title": "Mobility-Trees for Indoor Scenes Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000331694100002"}
