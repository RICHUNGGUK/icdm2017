Significant advances in live cell microscopy have allowed tracking of these pathways by following the dynamics of fluorescently labelled proteins in living cells. Objectives: This paper explores intelligent data analysis techniques to model the dynamic behavior of proteins in living cells as well as to classify different experimental conditions. Methods: We use a combination of decision tree classification and hidden Markov models. In particular, we introduce a novel approach to \"align\" hidden Markov models so that hidden states from different models can be cross-compared. Results: Our models capture the dynamics of two experimental conditions accurately with a stable hidden state for control data and multiple (less stable) states for the experimental data recapitulating the behaviour of particle trajectories within live cell time-lapse data. Conclusions: In addition to having successfully developed an automated framework for the classification of protein transport dynamics from live cell time-lapse data our model allows us to understand the dynamics of a complex trafficking pathway in living cells in culture.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Data Analysis to Model and Understand Live Cell Time-lapse Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000307487600008"}
