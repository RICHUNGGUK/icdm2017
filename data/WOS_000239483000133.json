The design approach employs a neural network, of which the activation functions satisfy the sector conditions, to approximate the delayed nonlinear system. A full-order dynamic output feedback controller is designed for the approximating neural network. The closed-loop neural control system is transformed into a novel neural network model termed standard neural network model (SNNM). Based on the robust H-infinity performance analysis of the SNNM, the parameters of output feedback controllers can be obtained by solving some lilinear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The well-designed controller ensures the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and guarantees an optimal H-infinity norm bound constraint on disturbance attenuation for all admissible uncertainties.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity control for delayed nonlinear systems based on standard neural network models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000133"}
