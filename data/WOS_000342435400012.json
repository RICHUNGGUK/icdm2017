If the fixed camera assumption does not hold, a frame registration step is followed by the background subtraction. However, this registration step cannot perfectly compensate camera motion, thus errors like translations of pixels from their true registered position occur. In this paper, we overcome these errors with a simple, but effective background subtraction algorithm that combines Temporal and Spatio-Temporal approaches. The former models the temporal intensity distribution of each individual pixel. The latter classifies foreground and background pixels, taking into account the intensity distribution of each pixels' neighborhood. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art systems in the presence of jitter, in spite of its simplicity.", "paper_title": "Background subtraction by combining Temporal and Spatio-Temporal histograms in the presence of camera movement", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435400012"}
