The first technique is based on basic models of the execution time of the routines, whereas the second one manages only empirical information obtained during the installation of the routines. The final goal in both cases is to obtain a balanced assignation of the work to the computing components in the system. The study is carried out with a basic kernel (matrix-matrix multiplication) and a higher level routine (LU factorization) which uses the auto-tuned basic routine. Satisfactory results are obtained, with experimental execution times close to the lowest experimentally achievable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
