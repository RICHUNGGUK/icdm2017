Design/methodology/approach - Benefits and shortcomings of two log file types will be carefully and exhaustively examined. Client-side and server-side log files will be analyzed and compared with proposed units of analysis. Findings - Server-side session time calculation was remarkably reliable and valid based on the high correlation with the client-side time calculation. The analysis result revealed that the server-side log file session time measurement seems more promising than the researchers previously speculated. Practical implications - An ability to identify each individual user and low caching problems were strong advantages for the analysis. Those web design implementations and web log data analysis scheme are recommended for future web log analysis research. Originality/value - This paper examined the validity of the client-side and the server-side web log data. As a result of the triangulation of two datasets, research designs and propose analysis schemes could be recommended.", "paper_title": "On the validity of client-side vs server-side web log data analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242421800007"}
