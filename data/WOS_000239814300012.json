Many algorithms for constructing a broadcast tree with minimum energy consumption and other goals have been developed. However, no previous research work considers the total energy consumption and transmission delays of the broadcast tree simultaneously. In this paper, based on an (alpha, beta)-tree, a novel concept to wireless networks, we define a new Strongly connected Broadcast Arborescence with bounded Transmission delay (SBAT) problem and design the Strongly connected Broadcast Arborescence (SBA) algorithm with linear running time to construct a strongly connected broadcast tree with bounded total power, while satisfying the constraint that the transmission delays between the source and the other hosts are also bounded. We also propose the distributed version of the SBA algorithm. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the SBA algorithm gives a proper solution to the SBAT problem.", "paper_title": "On the construction of a strongly connected broadcast arborescence with bounded transmission delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000239814300012"}
