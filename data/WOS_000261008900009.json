Next, based on spectral-spatial correlation, a novel adaptive heterogeneity-projection with proper mask size for each pixel is presented. Combining the extracted gradient/edge information and the adaptive heterogeneity-projection values, a new edge-sensing demosaicing algorithm is presented. Based on 24 popular testing images, experimental results demonstrated that our proposed high-quality demosaicing algorithm has the best image quality performance when compared with several recently published algorithms.", "paper_title": "Demosaicing of Color Filter Array Captured Images Using Gradient Edge Detection Masks and Adaptive Heterogeneity-Projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000261008900009"}
