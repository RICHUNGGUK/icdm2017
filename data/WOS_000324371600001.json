It can examine the traditional hypotheses H-0: beta(1,1) = ... = beta(t,k) and H-u: beta(1,1),..., beta(t,k) and hypotheses containing simple order restrictions H-m: beta(1,1) >= ... >= beta(t,k), where any \">=\" may be replaced by \"=\" and m is the model/hypothesis index; with beta(h,j) the parameter for the h-th dependent variable and the j-th predictor in a t-variate regression model with k predictors (which might include the intercept). But, the GORIC can also be applied to restrictions of the form H-m: R-1 beta = r(1); R-2 beta >= r(2), with beta a vector of length tk, R-1 a c(m1) x tk matrix, r(1) a vector of length c(m1), R-2 a c(m2) x t(k) matrix, and r(2) a vector of length c(m2). It should be noted that [R-1(inverted perpendicular), R-2(inverted perpendicular)](inverted perpendicular) should be of full rank when [r(1)(inverted perpendicular), r(2)(inverted perpendicular)](inverted perpendicular) not equal 0. In practice, this implies that one cannot examine range restrictions (e. g., 0 < beta(1,1) < 2 or beta(1,2) < beta(1,1) < 2 beta(1,2)) with the GORIC. A Fortran 90 program is presented, which enables researchers to compute the GORIC for hypotheses in the context of multivariate regression models. Additionally, an R package called goric is made by Daniel Gerhard and the first author.", "paper_title": "A Fortran 90 Program for the Generalized Order-Restricted Information Criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000324371600001"}
