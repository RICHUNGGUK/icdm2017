To facilitate event detection in these applications, in this paper we propose a pattern-based event detection approach and integrate the approach into an in-network sensor query processing framework. Different from existing threshold-based event detection, we abstract events into patterns in sensory data and convert the problem of event detection into a pattern matching problem. We focus on applying single-node temporal patterns, and define the general patterns as well as five types of basic patterns for event specification. Considering the limited storage on sensor nodes, we design an on-node cache manager to maintain the historical data required for pattern matching and develop event-driven processing techniques for queries in our framework. We have conducted experiments using patterns for events that are extracted from real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "paper_title": "Pattern-based event detection in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000302641700002"}
