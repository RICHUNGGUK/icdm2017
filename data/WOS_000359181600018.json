However, how to design an efficient joint reconstruction by leveraging more realistic signal models is still an open challenge. In this paper, we present a novel optimal-correlation-based reconstruction method for compressively sampled videos from multiple measurement vectors. In our method, the sparsity is mainly exploited through inter-signal correlations rather than the traditional frequency transform, wherein the optimization is not only over the signal space to satisfy data consistency but also over all possible linear correlation models to achieve minimum-l(1)-norm correlation noise. Additionally, a two-phase Bregman iterative based algorithm is outlined for solving the optimization problem. Simulation results show that our proposal can achieve an improved reconstruction performance in comparison to the conventional approaches, and especially, offer a 0.7-9.9 dB gain in the average PSNR for DCVS.
