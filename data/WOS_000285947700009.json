Although in some settings these approaches are equi-expressive and can capture all epistemic states, in other settings of interest (especially with probability in the picture), we show that they are not equi-expressive. We then consider the pragmatics of dealing with logical omniscience-how to choose an approach and construct an appropriate model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
