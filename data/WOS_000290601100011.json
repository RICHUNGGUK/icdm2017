We introduce an arborescence ranking measure that fuses textual relevancy of the connected Web objects to compute the relevance score of the hyperlink connecting them. To measure the degree of relevance among these Web objects, we computed the arc weights of the corresponding hyperlinks and show the robustness of the algorithm. With real data sets in the experimental procedure, our method showed the effectiveness of the algorithm. Our arborescence ranking measure to build the Web structure as a milestone can be a significant enabler for the improvement of the new Web search mechanism.", "paper_title": "TOPOLOGICAL STRUCTURING WEB MILESTONES BASED ON ARC RANKING METHODS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100011"}
