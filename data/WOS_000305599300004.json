A large number of such experiments performed have been implementations of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. It is known, however, that in some cases the Deutsch-Jozsa problem can be solved classically using as many queries to the black-box as in the quantum solution. In this paper we describe experiments in which we take the contrasting approach of using NMR as a classical computing medium, treating the nuclear spin vectors classically and utilising an alternative embedding of bits into the physical medium. This allows us to determine the actual Boolean function computed by the black-box for the n = 1, 2 cases, as opposed to only the nature (balanced or constant) as conventional quantum algorithms do. Discussion of these experiments leads to some clarification of the complications surrounding the comparison of different quantum algorithms, particularly black-box type algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Implementation of a Classical Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000305599300004"}
