The fact that the nodes are transparent to the switched data complicates the implementation of operations such as interface and link configuration. In this article we present first an algorithm that allows these semi-transparent nodes to be self-configured. The algorithm optimizes the total configuration time by exploiting the capability of optical switches to execute many connections at the same time. Then we present a solution for the link configuration issue that does not require a pre-established control channel between the nodes. The two solutions represent a first step towards the complete automation of future semi-transparent optical networks. The benefits brought by our methods are demonstrated by both simulation and testbed results.", "paper_title": "Automatic configuration in future semi-transparent distributed optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249809000001"}
