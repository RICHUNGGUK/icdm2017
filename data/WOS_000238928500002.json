Optimization methods in metal cutting processes, considered to be a vital tool for continual improvement of output quality in products and processes include modelling of input-output and in-process parameters relationship and determination of optimal cutting conditions. However, determination of optimal cutting conditions through cost-effective mathematical models is a complex research endeavour, and over the years, the techniques of modelling and optimization have undergone substantial development and expansion. In this paper, the application potential of several modelling and optimization techniques in meta, cutting processes, classified under several criteria, has been critically appraised, and a generic framework for parameter optimization in metal cutting processes is suggested for the benefits of selection of an appropriate approach.
