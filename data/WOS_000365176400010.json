This paper shows that for voters who follow the most central political-science model of electorates-single-peaked preferences-those hardness protections vanish. By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial covering challenges, we for the first time show that NP-hard bribery problems-including those for Kemeny and Llull elections-fall to polynomial time for single-peaked electorates. By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial partition challenges, we for the first time show that NP-hard partition-of-voters problems fall to polynomial time for single-peaked electorates. We show that for single-peaked electorates, the winner problems for Dodgson and Kemeny elections, though Theta(p)(2)-complete in the general case, fall to polynomial time. And we completely classify the complexity of weighted coalition manipulation for scoring protocols in single-peaked electorates.", "paper_title": "Bypassing Combinatorial Protections: Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Single-Peaked Electorates", "paper_id": "WOS:000365176400010"}
