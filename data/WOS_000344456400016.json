At the same time, management operations in these virtualized environments, such as load balancing, hardware maintenance, workload consolidation, etc., often make use of live virtual machine (VM) migration to control the placement of VMs. Although existing solutions are able to migrate a single VM efficiently, little attention has been devoted to migrating related VMs in multi-tier applications. Ignoring the relatedness of VMs during migration can lead to serious application performance degradation. This paper formulates the multi-tier application migration problem, and presents a new communication-impact-driven coordinated approach, as well as a system called COMMA that realizes this approach. Through extensive testbed experiments, numerical analyses, and a demonstration of COMMA on Amazon EC2, we show that this approach is highly effective in minimizing migration's impact on multi-tier applications' performance.", "paper_title": "COMMA: Coordinating the Migration of Multi-tier Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000344456400016"}
