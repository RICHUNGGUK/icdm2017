The issues to efficiently perform such analyses on algebraic models are handling solution failures within and close to the feasible region and minimizing the total iteration count. Scanning the domain in the obvious order is sub-Optimal in terms of total iterations and is likely to cause many solution failures. The problem of choosing a better order can be translated geometrically into finding Hamiltonian paths on certain grid graphs. This work proposes two paths, one based on a mixed-radix Gray code and the other, a quasi-spiral path, produced by a novel heuristic algorithm. Some simple, easy-to-visualize examples are presented, followed by performance results for the quasi-spiral algorithm and the practical application of the different paths in a process simulation tool.
