FAHV includes intricate coupling between the engine and flight dynamics, as well as complex interplay between flexible and rigid modes, which results in an intractable system for the control design. In this paper, a longitudinal model, which is described by a coupled system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs), is adopted. Firstly, a linearized ODE model for the rigid part is established around the trim condition, while vibration of the fuselage is described by PDEs. Secondly, based on the Lyapunov direct method, a control law via ODE state feedback and PDE boundary output feedback is designed for the system such that the closed-loop exponential stability is ensured. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "Feedback control design with vibration suppression for flexible air-breathing hypersonic vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000332351000020"}
