EDF represents information about the layout of streets and sidewalks, the rules that govern behavior on roads and walkways, and the locations of agents with respect to navigable structures. The framework serves as the substrate on which behavior programs for autonomous vehicles and pedestrians are built. Pathways are modeled as ribbons in space. The ribbon structure provides a natural coordinate frame for defining the local geometry of navigable surfaces. EDF includes a powerful runtime interface supported by robust and efficient code for locating objects on the ribbon network, for mapping between Cartesian and ribbon coordinates, and for determining behavioral constraints imposed by the environment.", "paper_title": "Ribbon networks for modeling navigable paths of autonomous agents in virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000235828800005"}
