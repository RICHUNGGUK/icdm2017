In the present work, we have focused our main efforts in the Spanish part of the Mixed Monolingual task, but we have also participated in several other languages tasks and in the Bilingual English-Spanish task. A passage- based IR system is applied in the retrieval phase. Also a language identifier has been created in order to build a fully automatic system without the need of knowing the topic language.", "paper_title": "University of Alicante at the CLEF 2005 WebCLEF track", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000094"}
