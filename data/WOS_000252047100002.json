In IHGCA, the improvement operation including five local iteration methods is developed to tune the individual and accelerate the convergence speed of the clustering algorithm, and the partition-absorption mutation operation is designed to reassign objects among different clusters. By experimental simulations, its superiority over some known genetic clustering methods is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Clustering using an improved hybrid genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000252047100002"}
