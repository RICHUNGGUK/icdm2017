Our argument aims at proposing new theoretical frameworks for these topics (especially for the former) based on FDPs, rather than providing some concrete and practical results on the topics. We also give some examples of mathematical discussions on FDFs, which would be of independent interest from mathematical viewpoints. Finally, we discuss possible directions of future research on other cryptographic applications of FDPs and on mathematical studies on FDPs themselves.", "paper_title": "A Mathematical Problem for Security Analysis of Hash Functions and Pseudorandom Generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000354049200001"}
