In this paper, we first propose a new method to identify bad signatures in batches efficiently for the case when the batch contains one bad signature. The method can find out the bad signature using smaller number of modular multiplications than the existing method. We also propose an extension to the proposed method to find out two or more bad signatures in a batch instance. Experimental results show that our method yields better performance than the existing method in terms of the number of modular multiplications.", "paper_title": "Efficient identification of bad signatures in RSA-type batch signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500010"}
