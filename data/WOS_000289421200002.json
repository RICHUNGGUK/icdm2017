The predicted gas phase velocities and particle phase velocities are validated against previously reported experimental data. Two turbulence models, the standard k-epsilon model and Shear Stress Transfer (SST) model, are used to model the gas phase turbulence. This work shows that both models provide acceptable predictions of the gas flow and mixing generated by the three jets. Neither model could accurately reproduce the jet core and the flow near bottom wall. The particle phase in this flow comprises a large number of small particles. Thus particles follow the gas phase flow closely and any errors in the turbulence model and gas flow predictions are passed on to the particle phase simulation. This paper also includes a literature review on rectangular jets in crossflow and gas-particle laden jets in crossflow. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
