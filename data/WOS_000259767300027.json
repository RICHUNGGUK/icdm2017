The conventional stage is improved to an algorithmic circuit involving charge summing, capacitors' exchange and charge redistribution, simply through introducing some extra switches into the analog circuit. This proposed ADC obtains the linearity beyond the accuracy of the capacitor match and verifies the validity of reducing the nonlinear error from the capacitor mismatch to the second order without additional power dissipation through the novel capacitor mismatch calibration technique. It is processed in 0.5 mu m CMOS technology. The transistor-level simulation results show that 72.6 dB SNDR, 78.5 dB SFDR are obtained for a 2 V V-pp 159.144 kHz sine input sampled at 3.7 MS/s. The whole power dissipation of this ADC is 33.4 mW at the power supply of 5 V.", "paper_title": "A 12-bit 3.7-MSample/s pipelined A/D Converter based on the novel capacitor mismatch calibration technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000259767300027"}
