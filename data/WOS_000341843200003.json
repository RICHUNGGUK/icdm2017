This paper investigates the performance of MRNs in a heterogeneous network (HetNet). MRNs as well as other small cells are expected to coexist in a complex manner. In such a HetNet, the inter-cell interference may degrade the expected improvement of MRNs, especially at the cell-edge. In this paper, we investigate the impact of intercell interference on the performance of MRNs. To alleviate this impact, we first formulated a general optimization problem for which it is intractable to find a global optimal solution. To have a practical solution with low computational complexity, we used a practical interference management algorithm that aimed to ensure that every MRN achieved its required minimum-rate while maximizing total network throughput. In the simulations, the proposed algorithm was observed to improve both the QoS and fairness of MRNs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can offer an efficient trade-off between the performance of both the victim MRNs and aggressing femtocells.", "paper_title": "Interference management for rate-constrained moving relay node in a heterogeneous network", "paper_id": "WOS:000341843200003"}
