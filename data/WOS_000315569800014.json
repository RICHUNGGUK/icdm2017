However, the extension of other potential applications with the use of biometric information is a very recent development. This paper summarizes the field of biometrics and investigates the potential of utilizing biometrics beyond the presently limited field of security applications. There are some synergies that can be established within security-related applications. These can also be relevant in other fields such as health and ambient intelligence. This paper describes these synergies. Overall, this paper highlights some interesting and exciting research areas as well as possible synergies between different applications using biometric information.", "paper_title": "Biometric Applications Related to Human Beings: There Is Life beyond Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000315569800014"}
