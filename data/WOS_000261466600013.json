As early as 2004, some authors suggested the use of a PRNG for increasing security. This was later questioned because many thought a PRNG implementation may go well beyond the very limited computational capabilities of low-cost RFID tags. However, its use has been ratified by EPCGlobal (EPC Class-1 Generation-2) and ISO (ISO/IEC 18000-6C). This motivates our proposal of a new PRNG, named LAMED, which is compliant with the standards and successfully passes several batteries of very demanding randomness tests (ENT, DIEHARD, NIST, and SEXTON). A study of its hardware complexity shows that LAMED can be implemented with slightly less than 1.6 K gates, and that pseudo-random numbers can be generated each 1.8 ms. So we can affirm this is a realist proposal both conforming with the EPC-G1C2 standard, and suitable for low-cost RFID tags. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
