In order to reduce the computations in transform and quantization, a novel prediction algorithm is designed to early detect all-zero 4 x 4 blocks prior to transform and quantization. A theoretical analysis is performed on the 4 x 4 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the related quantization functions in HEVC; consequently, two sufficient conditions to early detect all-zero 4 x 4 blocks are derived and the proposed prediction algorithm is developed while balancing the detection efficiency and computational overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently predict all-zero 4 x 4 blocks and reduce redundant DCT and quantization computations while maintaining the same coding performance in terms of video quality and bit rates.
