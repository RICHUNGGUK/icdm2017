Design/methodology/approach - An illustrative example is given and numerical results are compared with Block-Pulse, Wavelet-Galerkin and Shifted-Legendre methods. Findings - The results show the superiority of this method in comparison with the Block-Pulse and the weighted residual methods. Originality/value - The paper is of value in introducing the scaled operation matrix and also the method is straightforward and suitable for digital computation.", "paper_title": "Solution of population balance equations via rationalized Haar functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000260044400009"}
