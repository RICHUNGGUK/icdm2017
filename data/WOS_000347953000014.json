The TV-regularized problem for image denoising is nonconvex thus difficult to tackle directly. Instead, we deal with the problem by proposing a weighted TV (WTV) minimization where the weights are updated iteratively to locally approximate the TV-regularized problem. The difficulty of WTV minimization is dealt with in a modified split Bregman framework. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate improved denoising performance of the new algorithm with relative to that obtained by the standard TV minimization and several recent denoising methods from the literature on a variety of images.", "paper_title": "Image denoising by generalized total variation regularization and least squares fidelity", "paper_id": "WOS:000347953000014"}
