The undergoing chemical reactions are described by the Arrhenian kinetics (reaction rate proportional to exp (- E/RT), where T is temperature). We also consider the heat transfer via conduction and radiation. Moreover we use improved turbulence-chemistry interactions for reaction terms. The system of PDEs is discretized using the finite volume method (FVM) and an advection upstream splitting method as the Riemann solver. The resulting ODEs are solved using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method. Sample simulation results for typical power production levels are presented.", "paper_title": "Model of pulverized coal combustion in a furnace", "paper_id": "WOS:000253459400012"}
