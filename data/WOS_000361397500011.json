The literature shows that heuristic optimization algorithms are able to tackle these problems much better than the mathematical and deterministic methods. In this paper, we propose a new trainer using the recently proposed heuristic algorithm called social spider optimization (SSO) algorithm. The trained FNN by SSO (FNNSSO) is benchmarked on five standard classification data sets: XOR, balloon, Iris, breast cancer, and heart. The results are verified by the comparison with five other well-known heuristics. The results prove that the proposed FNNSSO is able to provide very promising results compared with other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Designing evolutionary feedforward neural networks using social spider optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000361397500011"}
