The single bubble expands up to 0.59 mm in radius, and then closes up by the pressure difference between the ambient liquid pressure at 10(2) kPa and the vapor pressure inside the bubble at 2 kPa. The maximum pressure up to 3 GPa is attained without the strong rebounding surface motion at about 93 mu s after the laser shedding. We present time-resolved velocity measurements for estimating the extreme peak pressures of the first and second shock waves with the Rankine-Hugoniot analysis.", "paper_title": "Dynamics of laser-induced bubble collapse visualized by time-resolved optical shadowgraph", "paper_id": "WOS:000297131800006"}
