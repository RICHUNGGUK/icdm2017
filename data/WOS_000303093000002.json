In this paper, an algorithm to process both the delayed and missing measurements is developed, under the assumption that the data arrives between two consecutive sampling times. Local estimation is then implemented using a fusion algorithm. This study extends the currently available state estimation for asynchronous multi-rate multi-sensor that only considers random measurements missing with the ability to remove delay effect. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed theory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
