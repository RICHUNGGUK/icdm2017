The paper describes a dynamic programming (DP) scheme to solve the NTD-CR problem, and proposes a DP approach, called Dynamic Programming Algorithm to solve NTD-CR (DPCR-ST), to generate the topology using a selected sequence of spanning trees of the network, STXmin The paper shows that our DPCR-ST approach always provides a feasible solution, and produces an optimal topology given an optimal order of spanning trees. The paper proves that the problem of optimally ordering the spanning trees is NP-complete, and proposes three greedy heuristics to generate and order only spanning trees of the network. Each heuristic allows the DPCR-ST approach to generate STXmin using only spanning trees, which improves the time complexity while producing a near optimal topology. Simulations based on fully connected networks that contain up to 2.3 x 10(9) spanning trees show the merits of using the ordering methods and the effectiveness of our algorithm vis-a-vis to four existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our DPCR-ST approach is able to generate 81.5% optimal results, while using only 0.77% of the spanning trees contained in networks. Further, for a typical 2 100 grid network that contains up to 1.899(102) spanning trees, DPCR-ST approach requires only k = 1214 spanning trees to generate a topology with a reliability no larger than 5.05% off from optimal.", "paper_title": "Topology Design with Minimal Cost Subject to Network Reliability Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000350865900011"}
