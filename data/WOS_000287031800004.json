This study tested the construct validity of NEM's ratio measure against common alternatives. Data were collected from 337 participants who separately performed 10 word-completion tasks on a cellular phone interface. The logarithm, ratio, Cohen's d, and Hedges's g measures had similar construct validity, but Hedges's g provided the most accurate measure of effect size. All these measures correlated more strongly with self-reported interface usability and interface knowledge when applied to the number of actions required to complete a task than when applied to task completion time. A weighted average of both measures had the highest correlation. The relatively high correlation between self-reported interface usability and a weighted Hedges's g measure as compared to the correlations found in the literature indicates the usefulness of the weighted Hedges's g measure in identifying usability problems.", "paper_title": "An Improved Usability Measure Based on Novice and Expert Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000287031800004"}
