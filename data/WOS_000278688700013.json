Asset repositioning costs that have been a bane in the context of transportation procurement cannot be alleviated by a solution mechanism that purely caters to either the increase in the number of lane options by virtue of supporting multiple shippers (i.e. DA), or one that solely focuses on allowing a combination of lanes to be packaged for only a single shipper (i.e. CA). To achieve economies of scale as well as scope, this study proposes the combinatorial double auction model where multiple shippers and multiple carriers can specify and transact combination of lanes of their interest in packaged bids through a 'middle agent which can be termed as the electronic transportation marketplace. The superiority of CDA over CA is illustrated with the devise of a new test procedure, where we show that the former generates greater revenue as a result of minimizing free disposal costs. In addition, revenue for the CA model deteriorates as market clearing flexibility reduces, while the solutions of CDA remained relatively stable and were not affected by the treatment.", "paper_title": "OPTIMIZING TRADE IN TRANSPORTATION PROCUREMENT: IS COMBINATORIAL DOUBLE AUCTION APPROACH TRULY BETTER?", "paper_id": "WOS:000278688700013"}
