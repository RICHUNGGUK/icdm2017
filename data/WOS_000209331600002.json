Compares to conventional single view video coding, multiview video coding utilizes inter and intra view motion compensations to yield an improved coding efficiency, and multiple description video coding helps improving video streaming over multiple lossy channels; on the other hand, multiview and multiple description coding techniques increase video frame dependencies, with trades off video streaming quality with an increased drifting error probability. This paper examines the frame dependencies of multi-view video coding against configurable parameters such as the length of group-ofpictures, and the number of viewpoints.", "paper_title": "Inter-frame dependency in multiview multi-description video streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000209331600002"}
