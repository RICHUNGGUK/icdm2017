However, the quality of these hounds may be affected by several properties related not only to how to use the technique but also to the Markovian model itself On the other hand, multiprocessor systems have become an efficient and widely used infrastructure to run several critical-life applications. In this paper, we describe how to calculate a stochastic bound for the multiprocessor system availability. We focus on the irreducibility of the model to show how it might influence the quality of bounds.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Bounds for Microprocessor Systems Availability", "paper_id": "WOS:000287064900013"}
