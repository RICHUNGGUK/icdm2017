A referee asks the players questions sampled from some known distribution and decides whether they win or not based on a known predicate of the questions and the players' answers. The parallel repetition of the game is the game in which the referee samples n independent pairs of questions and sends the corresponding questions to the players simultaneously. If the players cannot win the original game with probability better than (1 - epsilon), what's the best they can do in the repeated game? We improve earlier results of [R. Raz, SIAM J. Comput., 27 (1998), pp. 763-803] and [T. Holenstein, Theory Comput., 5 (2009), pp. 141-172], who showed that the players cannot win all copies in the repeated game with probability better than (1-epsilon/2)(Omega(n epsilon 2/c)) (here c is the length of the answers in the game), in the following ways: (i) We show that the probability of winning all copies is (1 - epsilon/2)(Omega(epsilon n)) as long as the game is a \"projection game,\" the type of game most commonly used in hardness of approximation results. (ii) We prove a concentration bound for parallel repetition (of general games) showing that for any constant 0 < delta < epsilon, the probability that the players win a (1 - epsilon + d) fraction of the games in the parallel repetition is at most exp (-Omega(epsilon)(delta(3)n/c)) (here the constant may depend on epsilon); our result has applications to testing Bell inequalities, since it implies that the parallel repetition of the CHSH game can be used to get an experiment that has a very large classical versus quantum gap. Our first bound is independent of the answer length and has a better dependence on epsilon. By the recent work of Raz [Proceedings of the 49th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2008, pp. 369-373], this bound is tight. Our bound gives a generic way to improve the soundness of a probabilistically checkable proof (PCP), in a way that is independent of the answer length of the PCP. Using it, for every k, one can convert any q query PCP with answer length c, size sc, and soundness (1 - epsilon) into a two-query PCP with answer length ck, size O(ck(2s)(k)), and soundness (1 - epsilon/2q)(Omega(epsilon k/q)). Another consequence of our bound is that the unique games conjecture of Khot [Proceedings of the 34th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2002, pp. 767-775] can now be shown to be equivalent to the following a priori weaker conjecture: There is an unbounded increasing function f : R+ -> R+ such that for every epsilon > 0, there exists an alphabet size M(epsilon) for which it is NP-hard to distinguish a unique game with alphabet size M in which a (1 - epsilon(2)) fraction of the constraints can be satisfied from one in which a (1 - epsilon f(1/epsilon)) fraction of the constraints can be satisfied.", "paper_title": "PARALLEL REPETITION IN PROJECTION GAMES AND A CONCENTRATION BOUND", "paper_id": "WOS:000298377900014"}
