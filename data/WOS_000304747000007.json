To increase classification accuracy, it is thus crucial to identify discriminant spatio-temporal features. This paper presents a method for analyzing the spatio-temporal characteristics associated with Event related Potentials (ERPs). First, a resampling procedure based on Global Field Power (GFP) extracts temporal features. Second, a spatially weighted SVM (sw-SVM) is used to learn a spatial filter optimizing the classification performance for each temporal feature. Third, the so-obtained ensemble of sw-SVM classifiers are combined using a weighted combination of all sw-SVM outputs. Results indicate that the inclusion of temporal features provides useful insight regarding classification performance and physiological understanding. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
