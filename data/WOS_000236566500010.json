Their excellent bandgap characteristics are verified through simulation and measurements. Furthermore, the loss and slow-wave characteristics and the improved characteristic impedance of the meander microstrip lines with 2D DGS are analyzed and given. Also, a comparison of DGA and vertically periodic DGS is discussed.
