In this paper we propose a new approach for mining itemsets. Our approach has the following advantages: an efficient representation of items and a novel data structure to maintain frequent patterns coupled with a fast pruning strategy. At any time, users can issue requests for frequent itemsets over an arbitrary time interval. Furthermore our approach produces an approximate answer with an assurance that it will not bypass user-defined frequency and temporal thresholds. Finally the proposed method is analyzed by a series of experiments on different datasets.", "paper_title": "Towards a new approach for mining frequent itemsets on data stream", "paper_id": "WOS:000244187500002"}
