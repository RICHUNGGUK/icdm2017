The fundamental equations and constraints for designing variable impedance transmission lines are first presented. Then, a proof-of-concept example of a compact non-uniform matching transformer and the counterpart modeled version is elaborated for source and load impedances Z(s) and Z(l), respectively, at 0.5 GHz. For comparison purposes, weights and biases of the proposed ANN are established with three different training techniques; namely: backpropagation (BP), Quasi-Newton (QN), and conjugate gradient (CG); at which the ABCD matrix, impedance variations, input port matching (S-11), and transmission parameter (S-21) are set as benchmarks to examine the validity of the trained model. The concept is then extended to model a NTL ultrawideband (UWB) Wilkinson power divider (WPD) with three resistors for improved isolation. S-parameters derived from the trained ANN outputs are close to those obtained by the traditional time-consuming optimization procedure, and show input and output ports matching and isolation of below -10 dB, and acceptable values of transmission parameters over the 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz band. The resulting models outperform traditional optimizations in terms of simulation time and reserved resources with comparable accuracy. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
