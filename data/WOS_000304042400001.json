The validation of the MPBLS method is carried out first by simulating the free motion of a red blood cell (RBC) in the rotating, shear and Poiseuille flows, respectively. Subsequently, further validations are performed by comparing with the experimental and numerical results published previously. As one of important applications, the MPBLS method is employed to investigate the deformation behaviors of RBCs with different shapes in a capillary. The simulations show that the healthy RBC gradually changes the geometric shape from a biconcave to a steady parachute shape. It is thus guaranteed that the RBC successfully traverses through the smaller capillaries compared with undeformed RBC. However, the unhealthy RBC with the circular or elliptical shape has different deformation behaviors, in which the steady parachute shape is much less concave at the rear and more convex in the front.
