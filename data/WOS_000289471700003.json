This paper has reviewed our previous work in building a co-construction model on the conceptual, logical, and analytical layers and then proposed an expanded Petri net representation that is developed toward a more comprehensive and operational co-construction model, which captures the key conceptual components of a collaborative engineering design process, describes the possible logic flow between these components, and analyzes their interaction in the design process. In this paper, we have also discussed a case study that was conducted in a real-life engineering design to validate our research. At the end of this paper, we emphasized the importance of this study and outlined the future directions of improving this study.", "paper_title": "Modeling Co-construction Processes in a Socio-Technical Framework to Support Collaborative Engineering Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000289471700003"}
