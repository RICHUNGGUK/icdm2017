An edge e = (k, l), connecting the nodes labelled k and l, respectively, in an increasing tree, is associated with the weight w(e) = vertical bar k - l vertical bar, We are interested in the distribution of the number of edges with a fixed edge weight j in a random generalized plane-oriented recursive tree or random d-ary increasing tree. We provide exact formulas for expectation and variance and prove a normal limit law for this quantity. A combinatorial approach is also presented and applied to a related parameter, the maximum edge weight.", "paper_title": "Deterministic Edge Weights in Increasing Tree Families", "paper_id": "WOS:000272935900006"}
