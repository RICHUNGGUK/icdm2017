To describe the uncertainty and fuzziness more objectively, intutionistic fuzzy set could be used for considering the membership, non-membership and uncertainty information. To aggregate the Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy information, we further develop the Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy geometric Bonferroni mean describing the interrelationship between arguments, and some properties and special cases of them are also discussed. Moreover, considering the importance of each argument, the weighted Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy geometric Bonferroni mean is proposed and applied to multi-criteria decision making. An example is given to compare the proposed method with the existing ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
