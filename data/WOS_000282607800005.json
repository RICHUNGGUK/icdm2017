Since there exist some problems of hybrid noises and uncertain data in many actual forecasting problem, the input variables are described as fuzzy numbers by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. Then by the integration of the triangular fuzzy theory, v-SVM and loss function theory, the fuzzy robust v-SVM with robust loss function (FRv-SVM) which can penalize those hybrid noises is proposed. To seek the optimal parameters of FRv-SVM, particle swarm optimization is also proposed to optimize the unknown parameters of FRv-SVM. The results of the application in fuzzy sale system forecasts confirm the feasibility and the validity of the FRv-SVM model. Compared with the traditional model and other SVM methods, FRv-SVM method requires fewer samples and has better generalization capability for Gaussian noise. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
