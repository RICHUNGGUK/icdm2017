However, the spectral property stored in the original hyperspectral image is often distorted when using the class of traditional fusion techniques. Therefore, in this paper, we show how explicitly incorporating the notion of \"spectra preservation\" to improve the spectral resolution of the fused image. First, a new fusion model, spectral preservation based on nonnegative matrix factorization (SPNMF), is developed. Additionally, a multiplicative algorithm aiming at get the numerical solution of the proposed model is presented. Finally, experiments using synthetic and real data demonstrate the SPNMF is a superior fusion technique for it could improve the spatial resolutions of hyperspectral images with their spectral properties reliably preserved.", "paper_title": "Nonnegative matrix factorization-based hyperspectral and panchromatic image fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200034"}
