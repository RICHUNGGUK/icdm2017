The first model is based on deterministic electricity prices while the other integrates price stochasticity through the management of a tree of potential price scenarios. Numerical results based on historical data demonstrate the superiority of the stochastic model over the deterministic one. It is also shown that price volatility impacts the profits obtained by the stochastic model. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
