In particular, the most distinctive elements of a single-sensor imaging pipeline, such as color filter array configurations, image interpolation solutions, and picture storage approaches are reviewed and commented upon. New perspectives in the field are proposed, suggesting that the demand for consumer digital camera solutions and digital color imaging applications will continue.", "paper_title": "Single-sensor imaging in consumer digital cameras: a survey of recent advances and future directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000208118400007"}
