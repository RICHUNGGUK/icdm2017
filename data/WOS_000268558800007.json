The framework is applied to both classical three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and advanced intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Automated BAS and improved dose distribution are achieved within the framework. A metaheuristic approach, nested partitions, is applied. Alternative BAS and DO algorithms or commercial RTP software and clinical experience can be embedded within the framework to provide new methods for warm starts and evaluations of the quality of beam-angle set samples. Computational efficiency is achieved by utilizing high-throughput computing via the Condor system. Computational results show that our framework has led to a significant improvement in terms of solution quality and delivery time compared with current clinical practice.", "paper_title": "Solving Beam-Angle Selection and Dose Optimization Simultaneously via High-Throughput Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000268558800007"}
