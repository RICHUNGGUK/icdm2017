The method discovers general patterns that are rare or even entirely absent from a set of pieces, and among those the patterns that are frequent in a background set. Pattern discovery is performed with reference to a background ontology of folk tune genres. The method is applied to a large corpus of Basque folk tunes and results are evaluated as descriptive patterns and as negative association rules.", "paper_title": "Antipattern Discovery in Folk Tunes", "paper_id": "WOS:000323243600005"}
