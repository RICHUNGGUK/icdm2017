This paper presents a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system (Atheromatic) that analyzes ultrasound images and classifies them into symptomatic and asymptomatic. The classification result is based on a combination of discrete wavelet transform, higher order spectra (HOS) and textural features. In this study, we compare support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with different kernels. The classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel achieved an average accuracy of 91.7% as well as a sensitivity of 97%, and specificity of 80%. Thus, it is evident that the selected features and the classifier combination can efficiently categorize plagues into symptomatic and asymptomatic classes. Moreover, a novel symptomatic asymptomatic carotid index (SACI), which is an integrated index that is based on the significant features, has been proposed in this work. Each analyzed ultrasound image yields on SACI number. A high SACI value indicates that the image shows symptomatic and low value indicates asymptomatic plagues. We hope this SACI can support vascular surgeons during routine screening for asymptomatic plagues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
