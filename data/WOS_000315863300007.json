The dual-phase-lagging model, incorporating time lags in the heat flux and the temperature gradient, and some of its particular cases and approximations, result in heat conduction modeling equations in the form of delayed or hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this work, the application of difference schemes for the numerical solution of lagging models of heat conduction is considered. Numerical schemes for some DPL approximations are developed, characterizing their properties of convergence and stability. Examples of numerical computations are included.
