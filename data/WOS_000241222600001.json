A detailed description is provided of the improvements made on second-order accurate tools for spatial interpolation and gradient calculation to discretize the Navier-Stokes equations in an unstructured framework. The main goal in the development of the discretization tools was to ensure a scalable and accurate parallel code. The performance of the discretization tools has been validated using standard bench-mark problems for non-uniform, non-orthogonal grids. Parallelization of the code is done within the PETSc framework using a single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) parallelization model. The resulting parallel code is shown to scale linearly within the limit of the available number of processors.
