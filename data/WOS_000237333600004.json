We prove a parity property and conjecture that the minimum colourful simplicial depth of any core point in any d-dimensional configuration is d(2) + 1 and that the maximum is d(d+1) + 1. We exhibit configurations attaining each of these depths, and apply our results to the problem of bounding monochrome (non-colourful) simplicial depth.", "paper_title": "Colourful simplicial depth", "paper_id": "WOS:000237333600004"}
