In this paper, the middleware is proposed to support the application development of context-awareness under ubiquitous networks environment. It applies the updated service-oriented and light-weight structure with excellent expansibility and efficiency in the running process. The architecture of middleware is presented and described in detail. Running structure of the middleware is proposed. At the end of the paper, a healthcare scenario is used to validate the design methodology and demonstrate the supporting function of middleware.", "paper_title": "Towards a service-oriented Middleware Enabling Context Awareness for Smart Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000264628500004"}
