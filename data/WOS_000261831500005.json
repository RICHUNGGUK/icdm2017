If all of the elements of P belong to some C(i), M is called a perfect matching. If, in addition, all of the elements of M are pairwise disjoint, we say that this matching M is strong. In this paper we study the existence and characteristics of C-matchings for point sets in the plane when C is the set of isothetic squares in the plane. A consequence of our results is a proof that the Delaunay triangulations for the L(infinity) metric and the L(1) metric always admit a Hamiltonian path.", "paper_title": "Matching Points with Squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000261831500005"}
