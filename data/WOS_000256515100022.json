Literature has identified many different factors that can be related to attractiveness. In this research we analyze the role of symmetry, neoclassical canons, and golden ratio in the determination of attractiveness of a face. We focus on the geometry of a face and use actual faces for our analysis. We find there are some differences in the criteria used by males and females to determine attractiveness. The model we have developed to predict the attractiveness of a face using its geometry is accurate with low residual errors. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
