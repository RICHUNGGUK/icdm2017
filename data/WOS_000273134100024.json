The performance metric used is distortion SNR exponent which is defined as the rate of decay of mean-squared error (MSE) distortion with SNR. The optimal exponent is shown to be equal to the ratio of the number of channel uses to number of source samples. A superposition-based scheme is proposed that can achieve an exponent arbitrarily close to the optimal value.", "paper_title": "A Note on the Rate of Decay of Mean-Squared Error With SNR for the AWGN Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000273134100024"}
