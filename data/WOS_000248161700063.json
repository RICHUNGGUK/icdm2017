We compared the molfraction of each surfactant type on the gold structure with the molfraction of each surfactant type in the surrounding bulk solvent. For alkyl thiol surfactants with 1 to 4 carbon atoms difference, we found that, in contrast to the (111) surface, the adsorption selectivity on a NC is almost identical to that in the solvent.
