Although many concrete models have been proposed for simulating behavior of structures under cyclic loading conditions, accurate simulations remain challenging due to uncertainties in materials, pitfalls of crude assumptions of existing models, and limited understanding of failure mechanisms. The proposed model is equipped with a fully generalized hysteresis rule and is formulated for 2D plane stress non-linear finite element analysis. The proposed model has been formulated in a tangent stiffness-based finite element scheme so that it can be used for most general finite element analysis packages. Moreover, it eliminates the need to check that tensile stresses can be transmitted across a crack. The tension stiffening model is-a function of the bar orientation and any orientation can be accommodated. The proposed model has been verified with a series of experimental results of 2D RC planar panels. This study also demonstrates how parameters of the proposed model associated with cyclic damage modeling influences the pinched cyclic shear behavior.", "paper_title": "A total strain-based hysteretic material model for reinforced concrete structures: theory and verifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000257713000003"}
