In this scheme, the networks with spectrum registration are responsible for configuring the parameters of frequency hopping communications, such as FH frequency lists, which are broadcasted in the coverage area. In the SS networks, the reconfigurable terminals, referred to as CR-MTs, monitor the ambient spectrum context on the basis of cognitive radio (CR) technology. Then communications are realized through FH patterns. In this paper, the transmission model and signaling exchange mechanism in FH-IA scheme are designed. And the interference avoidance (IA) strategies in different conditions are also proposed. Finally, the performance of FH-IA is analyzed, and simulation results reveal that this scheme has better IA capability.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Spectrum Sharing Scheme based on Frequency Hopping Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000207999700010"}
