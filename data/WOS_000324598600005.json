In this paper, we describe the goals and tactics, and present a distributed architecture of m-healthcare social networks. Following each kind of security and privacy challenge, we define a series of basic and sophisticated cyber attacks and give substantial and promising solutions to satisfy the unique security and privacy requirements in m-healthcare social networks. Last but not least, several interesting open problems are pointed out with possible addressing ideas to trigger more research efforts in this emerging area.", "paper_title": "SECURING M-HEALTHCARE SOCIAL NETWORKS: CHALLENGES, COUNTERMEASURES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000324598600005"}
