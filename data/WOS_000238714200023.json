In this model, regularization is achieved during the iterative restoration process with a segmentation-based a priori term. This adaptive edge-preserving regularization term applies a local smoothness constraint to pre-estimated constant-valued regions of the target image. These constant-valued regions (the segmentation map) of the target image are obtained from a preliminary Wiener deconvolution estimate. In order to estimate reliable segmentation maps, we have also adopted a Bayesian Markovian framework in which the regularized segmentations are estimated in the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sense with the joint use of local Potts prior and appropriate Gaussian conditional luminance distributions. In order to make these segmentations unsupervised, these likelihood distributions are estimated in the maximum likelihood sense. To compute the MAP estimate associated to the restoration, we use a simple steepest descent procedure resulting in an efficient iterative process converging to a globally optimal restoration. The experiments reported in this paper demonstrate that the discussed method performs competitively and sometimes better than the best existing state-of-the-art methods in benchmark tests.", "paper_title": "A segmentation-based regularization term for image deconvolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000238714200023"}
