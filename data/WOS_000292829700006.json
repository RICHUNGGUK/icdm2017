In order to obtain the optimal available subcarrier sets and transmission powers, we propose in this paper a distributed resource allocation framework for cognitive ad hoc networks using the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) modulation. This framework integrates together the constraints of quality of service (QoS), maximum powers, and minimum rates. The fairness of resource allocation is guaranteed by introducing into the link capacity expression the probability that a subcarrier is occupied. An incremental subgradient approach is applied to solve the optimization problems that maximize the weighted sum capacities of all links without or with fairness constraints. Distributed subcarrier selection and power allocation algorithms are presented explicitly. Simulations confirm that the approach converges to the optimal solution faster than the ordinary subgradient method and demonstrate the effects of the key parameters on the system performance. It has been observed that the algorithms proposed in our paper outperform the existing ones in terms of the throughput and number of secondary links admitted and the fairness of resource allocation.", "paper_title": "Distributed resource allocation with fairness for cognitive radios in wireless mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292829700006"}
