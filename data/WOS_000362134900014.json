Current workflow languages are not able to completely fulfil these requirements, as they lack expressiveness and flexibility. In this paper, we present an object-oriented workflow language for formalizing processes within heterogeneous and dynamic environments. Its component-based meta-model enables the hierarchical composition of processes and process variants. Domain-specific typing and polymorphism leverage the flexibility of processes by enabling the dynamic selection of process components. We present a modelling environment and a distributed execution engine for the meta-model. In addition, we discuss the use of semantic technologies for smart workflows. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
