The evaluation criteria and design rules are investigated based on the page-oriented optical data storage system. Coding parameters are optimized to achieve large channel capacities. An 8:16 modulation code is designed to reduce the raw bit error rate and its performances are experimentally evaluated. A raw bit error rate of the magnitude of 10(-4) is obtained with a single-data-page storage and 10(-3) with multiplexing.", "paper_title": "A two-dimensional constant-weight sparse modulation code for volume holographic data storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000290579600009"}
