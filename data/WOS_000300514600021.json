Trust and risk are essential factors and can be combined together in access control decision-making to meet the above requirement. In this paper, we propose the combination of the trust and risk in access control to balance information accessibility and protection. Access control decision is made on the basis of trustworthiness of users and risk value of permissions. We use potential relations between users and relations between permissions in access control. Our approach not only provides more access opportunities for trustworthy users in accessing permissions, but also enforces traditional access control constraints such as Chinese Wall policy and Separation of Duty (SoD) of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model in an effective way.", "paper_title": "Trust and Risk based Access Control and Access Control Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000300514600021"}
