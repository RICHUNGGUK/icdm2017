Some explicit and easily verifiable conditions are obtained for the global asymptotic stability of all forms of nonnegative semitrivial constant steady-state solutions. These conditions involve only the competing rate constants and are independent of the diffusion-convection and time delays. The result of global asymptotic stability implies the nonexistence of positive steady-state solutions, and gives some extinction results of the competing species in the ecological sense. The instability of the trivial steady-state solution is also shown. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
