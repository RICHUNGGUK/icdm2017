Containing repeating structural units, solenoid proteins are expected to share sequence similarities. However, in many cases, the sequence similarities are weak and non-detectable. Moreover, solenoids can be degenerated and widely vary in the number of units. So that it is difficult to detect them. Recently, several solenoid repeats detection methods have been proposed, such as self-alignment of the sequence, spectral analysis and discrete Fourier transform of sequence. Although these methods have shown good performance on certain data sets, they often fail to detect repeats with weak similarities. In this article, we propose a new approach to recognize solenoid repeats and non-solenoid proteins using stationary wavelet packet transform (SWPT). Our method associates with three advantages: (i) naturally representing five main factors of protein structure and properties by wavelet analysis technique; (ii) extracting novel wavelet features that can capture hidden components from solenoid sequence similarities and distinguish them from global proteins; (iii) obtaining statistics features that capture repeating motifs of solenoid proteins. Results: Our method analyzes the characteristics of amino acid sequence in both spectral and temporal domains using SWPT. Both global and local information of proteins are captured by SWPT coefficients. We obtain and integrate wavelet-based features and statistics-based features of amino acid sequence to improve the classification task. Our proposed method is evaluated by comparing to state-of-the-art methods such as HHrepID and REPETITA. The experimental results show that our algorithm consistently outperforms them in areas under ROC curve. At the same false positive rate, the sensitivity of our WAVELET method is higher than other methods.", "paper_title": "Solenoid and non-solenoid protein recognition using stationary wavelet packet transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000281714100010"}
