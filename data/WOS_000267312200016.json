Firstly, a knowledge-based model for the nonlinear hysteretic restoring force is identified using the measured data obtained from period loading tests. Secondly, the remaining characteristic of hysteretic restoring force, which cannot be modeled in an easy way, is identified using the NN method through network training. By building up a parallel hybrid NN model for the nonlinear hysteretic restoring force, the dynamic responses of the vibration isolation system under harmonic and broad band random excitations are predicted. The predicted results are compared with the measured ones to validate the effectiveness and prediction accuracy of the model. The comparative studies show the developed hybrid NN model possesses good prediction accuracy and generalization capability in contrast with the pure black box NN model. (C) 2009 IMACS.
