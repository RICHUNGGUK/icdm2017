Following a review of basic simulation paradigms and recent research developments, we propose a new process mapping and simulation methodology for modeling construction operations. The simulation algorithm is presented and the process mapping procedure is illustrated step by step using an earth-moving example featuring technology and resource constraints. It is straightforward to convert the resultant process mapping model describing workflows and resource flows over site locations into a simulation model. A STROBOSCOPE model is formed for the same problem definition to contrast and cross-validate our methodology with the established activity cycle diagram-based modeling approach. One additional case of modeling the concreting site operations by the hoist and barrow method is also given to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology in practical settings.", "paper_title": "Generic process mapping and simulation methodology for integrating site layout and operations planning in construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000250352400009"}
