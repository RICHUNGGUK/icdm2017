We investigate the relation between the T-transitivity of the fuzzy relation and the cycle-transitivity of the associated probabilistic relation. We provide a general result, valid for any t-norm and we later provide explicit expressions for important particular cases. We also apply the results obtained to explore the transitivity satisfied by the probabilistic relation defined on a set of random variables. We focus on uniform continuous random variables.
