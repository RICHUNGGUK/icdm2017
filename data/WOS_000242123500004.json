These properties impart a high degree of robustness and performance that has created great interest in implementing engineering systems. This adopted engineering analogue is called artificial immune system (AIS). This paper presents an immunity-based control framework, which has the ability to detect changes, adapt to dynamic environment and coordinate vehicles activities for goals achievement, to deploy a fleet of autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) for material handling in an automated warehouse. A robust and flexible automated warehousing system is achieved through the self-organized and fully decentralized origination of AGVs. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
