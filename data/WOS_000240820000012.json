The agreements impose policies that govern routing in the AS level, and thus the resulting topology graph is directed, and thus the reachability between Ases is not transitive. We show, using partial views obtained from the Internet, that the Internet's resiliency to a deliberate attack is much smaller than previously found, and its reachability is also somewhat lower under random failures. We use different metrics to measure resiliency, and also investigate the effect of added backup connectivity on the resiliency. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
