The major principles presented in this paper are the mathematical description methods for rose features such as shape, size and color of the flower, petal, leaf, etc, and the object-oriented pattern recognition (OOPR) approach which mathematically deals with how to comprehensively use all different rose features rationally in the recognition scheme. The recognition system is described and some of its experimental results are given which demonstrate the efficiency of our methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
