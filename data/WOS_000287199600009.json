The approach consists of two phases, which separately construct the approximation geometry and the normal field of a subdivision surface. It first exploits quartic triangular Bezier patches to approximate the geometry of the subdivision surface by interpolating a grid of sampled points. To remedy the artifact of discontinuity of normal fields between adjacent patches, a continuous normal field is then reconstructed by approximating the tangent vector fields of the subdivision surfaces with quartic triangular Bezier patches. For regular triangles, the approach reproduces the associated subdivision patches, quartic three-directional box splines.", "paper_title": "Approximation of Loop Subdivision Surfaces for Fast Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000287199600009"}
