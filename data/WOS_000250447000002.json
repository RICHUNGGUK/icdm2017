The resulting model is simpler, more plausible, and more amenable to analysis than previously suggested models. We believe that fuzzy modeling may be suitable for addressing biomimicry, that is, the development of artificial products or machines that mimic biological phenomena, in a systematic manner.", "paper_title": "The fuzzy ant", "paper_id": "WOS:000250447000002"}
