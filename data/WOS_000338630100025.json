The model consists of two independent parts. The first part is aimed at the purely mechanical aspects of the shrink fit (determination of the interference between both parts necessary for transferring the prescribed torque and reduced stress in both parts for the assumed range of revolutions of the system). The second part maps the process of induction heating of the disk before its setting on the shaft. The methodology is then used for an analysis of a typical example whose results are discussed.", "paper_title": "Numerical modelling of cylindrical induction shrink fits", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100025"}
