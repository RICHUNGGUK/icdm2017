Existing mechanisms, such as Electronic Institutions (EIs), provide means to easily specify and automatically execute process models. However, every time the specification is modified, the graphical user interface (GUI) needed during the execution stage should be manually modified accordingly. This article proposes a system that helps maintain such GUIs in an efficient and automated manner. We present and test Charms, a system built on top of EIs that allows the automatic creation and update of GUIs based on the provided process model specification.", "paper_title": "CHARMS: A CHARTER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
