This paper presents an approximate scheme to model and analyze such networks. First, a traffic aggregation technique is proposed to deal with phase-type and bursty traffic, including splitting and merging. For the aggregation of two bursty traffic, a closed-form solution is obtained for buffer state probabilities. For the aggregation of more,bursty traffic, a recursive algorithm is derived in terms of the buffer size and number of inputs of a switch. Second, a switch decomposition technique is developed, by which the crossbar of a switch is decomposed from its preceding and succeeding buffers. In this way, a switch network of N inputs and outputs is converted to N tandem queues, for which the performance can be easily evaluated. Our extensive numerical and simulation examples have shown that the proposed scheme achieves satisfied accuracy and computational efficiency.", "paper_title": "A Performance Modeling Scheme for Multistage Switch Networks With Phase-Type and Bursty Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000281113500007"}
