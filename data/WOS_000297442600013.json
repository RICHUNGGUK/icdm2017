Our approach is composed of two steps. First, in the case of D consisting of one point alpha, we give explicit formulas of (f) over tilde and the minimal distance in terms of alpha. Next, the case of a general closed domain D is considered by using the property that a nearest polynomial (f) over tilde has a zero on the boundary C. The curve C is parameterized piecewisely, and on each piece we search for the minimum of the distance between f and (f) over tilde. At this step we exploit the explicit formula of the minimal distance as a function of a point alpha. Then the global minimum and the nearest polynomial are obtained by comparing the piecewise minima. Some examples are presented: one of them confirms that the distance between a nearest complex polynomial and a given polynomial is less than that between a nearest real polynomial and the given polynomial.
