The study seeks to address concerns about the experiential aspects of mobile commerce regardless of the consumption type. For the purpose, the authors aims to propose a stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) based model that incorporates both utilitarian and hedonic factors of consumers. Design/methodology/approach - A survey study was conducted to collect data from 293 mobile phone users. The questionnaire was administered in study classrooms, a library, or via e-mail. The measurement model and structural model were examined using LISREL 8.7. Findings - The results of this research implied that emotion played a significant role in the mobile consumption experience; hedonic factors had a positive effect on the consumption experience, while utilitarian factors had a negative effect on the consumption experience of consumers. The empirical findings also indicated that media richness was as important as subjective norms, and more important than convenience and self-efficacy. Originality/value - Few m-commerce studies have focused directly on the experiential aspects of consumption, including the hedonic experience and positive emotions among mobile device users. Applying the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework from the perspective of the experiential view, the current research model is developed to examine several utilitarian and hedonic factors in the context of the consumption experience, and indicates a comparison between the information processing (utilitarian) view and the experiential (hedonic) view of consumer behavior. It illustrates the relationships among six variables (i.e. convenience, media richness, subjective norms, self-efficacy, emotion, and consumption experience) in a mobile commerce context.", "paper_title": "Factors influencing consumption experience of mobile commerce A study from experiential view", "paper_id": "WOS:000303299600001"}
