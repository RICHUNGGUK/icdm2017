Precoder division multiple access (PDMA) that implements Vandermonde precoder in cognitive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is proposed, which benefits from the frequency selectivity of the cognitive channel to form a frequency beam-former. Vandermonde precoder enables SUs to achieve higher bit rate with optimal power allocation strategy under the condition of PU interference constraint. Numerical and simulation results are presented to prove theoretical derivations. It is shown that, achievable bit rates (ABR) of SU could be achieved with optimal power allocation scheme in CRN. Meanwhile, it is also verified that, with Vandermonde precoder to form PDMA, SU's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the target rate of PU could impact the ABR of SU significantly in CRN.", "paper_title": "Achievable bit rates of cognitive user with Vandermonde precoder in cognitive radio network", "paper_id": "WOS:000292269700013"}
