We focus on a particular kind of multi-agent based simulation where a collection of interacting autonomous situated entities evolve in a situated environment. Our approach combines the fast multipole method coming from computational physics with agent-based microscopic simulations. The aim is to speed up the execution of a multi-agent based simulation while controlling the precision of the associated approximation. This approach may be considered as the first step of a larger effort aiming at designing a generic kernel to support efficient large-scale multi-agent based simulations. This approach is illustrated in this paper by the simulation of large scale flocking dynamical systems.", "paper_title": "Multi-agent based simulations using fast multipole method: application to large scale simulations of flocking dynamical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000286054000004"}
