The underlying model consists of an anisotropic diffusion term and a forcing term. The balance between these two terms is made in a selective way allowing prominent surface features and other details of the meshes to be treated in different ways. The forcing term keeps smoothed surface close to the initial surface. Thus the volume is preserved, and most important, the shape distortion is prevented. Applying a dynamic balance technique, the equation converges to the solution quickly meanwhile generating a more faithful approximation to the original noisy mesh. Our smoothing method maintains simplicity in implementation and numerical results show its high performance.", "paper_title": "A feature-preserving and volume-constrained flow for fairing irregular meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600017"}
