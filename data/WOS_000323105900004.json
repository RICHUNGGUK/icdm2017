Let be the smallest possible size of an equilateral subset of maximal with respect to inclusion. We first observe that Petty's construction of a - of any finite dimension with can be generalised to give for any of dimension at least which has a smooth point on its unit sphere. By a construction involving Hadamard matrices we then show that for any set , is finite and bounded above by a function of , for all . Also, for all and there exists such that for all - with Banach-Mazur distance less than from . Using Brouwer's fixed-point theorem we show that for all - with Banach-Mazur distance less than from . A graph-theoretical argument furthermore shows that . The above results lead us to conjecture that for all finite-normed spaces X.", "paper_title": "Maximal Equilateral Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000323105900004"}
