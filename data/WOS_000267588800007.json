This policy, called proportional sharing with load reservation (PSLR), provides bandwidth guarantees on a per-flow basis and redistributes the unused bandwidth among active flows in proportion to their priority level. We establish convergence conditions for the PSLR policy and show that it provides a fair service distribution among the flows. Moreover. we establish bounds for the backlog and delay on a per-flow basis, thus enabling a network to provide its users with absolute performance guarantees. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
