By employing the Lyapunov-Razumikhin technique, some criteria ensuring global exponential stability are derived. Our results are then used to obtain some sufficient conditions under which some NNs can be forced to converge by impulsive control. Numerical examples are also discussed to illustrate our results.", "paper_title": "Impulsive stabilization of high-order Hopfield-type neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000252516700006"}
