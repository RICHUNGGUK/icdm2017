This paper proposes the semiparametric spatial effect kernel minimum squared error model (SSEKMSEM) and the semiparametric spatial effect least squares support vector machine (SSELS-SVM) for estimating a hedonic price function and compares the price prediction performance with the conventional parametric models and a semiparametric generalized additive model (GAM). This paper utilizes two data sets. One is a large data set representing 5966 single-family residential home sales between July 2000 and August 2008 from Pitt County, North Carolina. The other is a data set of residential property sales records from September 2000 to September 2004 in Carteret County, North Carolina. The results show that the SSEKMSEM and SSELS-SVM outperform the parametric counterparts and the semiparametric GAM in both in-sample and out-of-sample price predictions, indicating that these kernel machines can be useful for measurement and prediction of housing sales prices.
