In this study, the focus is on a collaborative assembly (CA) framework, inspired by the design principles of CCT, the Collaborative Control Theory, to improve balanceability and flexibility of assembly lines through tool sharing (TS) among idle and bottleneck workstations. TS is widely practiced in advanced assembly facilities to reduce cost and improve consistency and standardization in assembly and in assembly-and-test utilities, relying often on real time control. The framework developed here addresses the systems design aspect of Mechatronics, covering the planning, execution, and control mechanisms. Planning includes assembly line balancing (ALB) and initial TS decisions, made continually by solving a bi-objective mixed-integer program (BOMIP). A collaborative multi-agent system (CMAS) enhanced with a TS-best matching (BM) protocol is developed to execute the plan, control the process, and modify the TS decisions, considering dynamic changes in the system's operations. Experiments show that the new CA framework significantly outperforms classic approaches (i.e., ALB without TS-BM) in terms of cycle time, utilization of tools, and balanceability. In addition, the control mechanism is proven to augment the line's flexibility against the inherent uncertainties of assembly processes, compared to the previously developed static CA frameworks.
