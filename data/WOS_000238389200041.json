Five sets of signals of different qualities were acquired using a high sensitivity probe-accelerometer. We conclude that it is possible to establish a third-order pattern (spectral track) associated to the termite emissions, and resulting from the impulsive response of the sensor and the body or substratum through which the emitted waves propagate.", "paper_title": "Third-order spectral characterization of termite's emission track", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200041"}
