Usually, we apply a selection process and a consensus process to solve a group decision situation. In this paper, we present a consensus model for group decision-making problems with interval fuzzy preference relations. This model is based on two consensus criteria, a consensus measure and a proximity measure, and also on the concept of coincidence among preferences. We compute both consensus criteria in the three representation levels of a preference relation and design an automatic feedback mechanism to guide experts in the consensus reaching process. We show an application example in social work.", "paper_title": "A CONSENSUS MODEL FOR GROUP DECISION-MAKING PROBLEMS WITH INTERVAL FUZZY PREFERENCE RELATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000311164200002"}
