We analyzed the performance of the institutional h-index in the case of Brazilian Psychiatry Post-graduation Programs. Traditional bibliometric indicators and the institutional h-index similarly ranked the programs, except for the Average Impact Factor. The institutional h-index correlated strongly with the majority of the traditional bibliometric indicators, which did not occur with the Average Impact Factor. The institutional h-index balances \"quantity\" and \"quality\", and can be used as part of a panel of bibliometric indicators to aid the peer-review process.", "paper_title": "Institutional h-index: The performance of a new metric in the evaluation of Brazilian Psychiatric Post-graduation Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000260472100010"}
