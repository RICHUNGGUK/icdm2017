MCSC extends the vision of participatory sensing by leveraging both participatory sensory data from mobile devices (offline) and user-contributed data from mobile social networking services (online). Further, it explores the complementary roles and presents the fusion/collaboration of machine and human intelligence in the crowd sensing and computing processes. This article characterizes the unique features and novel application areas of MCSC and proposes a reference framework for building human-in-the-loop MCSC systems. We further clarify the complementary nature of human and machine intelligence and envision the potential of deep-fused human-machine systems. We conclude by discussing the limitations, open issues, and research opportunities of MCSC.", "paper_title": "Mobile Crowd Sensing and Computing: The Review of an Emerging Human-Powered Sensing Paradigm", "paper_id": "WOS:000363733200007"}
