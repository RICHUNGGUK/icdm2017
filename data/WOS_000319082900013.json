In this paper, by comparatively studying the model of a two-qubit system in a common environment with and without dynamical control, we show that dynamical control can be exploited to protect QC from being completely destroyed for a long time. For certain product states, the dynamical control can even be used to generate the QC.", "paper_title": "DYNAMICAL CONTROL OF QUANTUM CORRELATIONS IN A COMMON ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000319082900013"}
