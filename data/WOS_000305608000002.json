Combining multilink architecture developed by the CELTIC MARCH project and adaptive video transmission can be an effective solution for transmitting video streams. Our multilink gateway method aims to increase the quality of the video transmission by splitting and merging the video stream in accord with the importance of the different parts of the video stream into multiple access networks ranked adaptively to the network performance. Our method guarantees the transmission of the highest priority MPEG-2 frames trough the best network available instantaneously.", "paper_title": "Enabling Frame-Based Adaptive Video Transmission in a Multilink Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000305608000002"}
