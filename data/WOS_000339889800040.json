A novel strategy is proposed in this paper by combining texture based image analysis and spatio-temporal representation. Firstly, a correlation based method is proposed to describe spatio-temporal information between sampling points, which is then converted to traditional 2D intensity images. Secondly, abundant texture analysis methods are adopted to construct effective features for high accuracy verification. Furthermore, a template selection strategy based on intra-class variations is presented to further enhance the performance of signature verification. Extensive experiments are conducted on the SVC2004 database and experimental results demonstrate the inspiring performance of our proposed methods.", "paper_title": "On-line signature verification based on spatio-temporal correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000339889800040"}
