The resampling operations considered in our study are typical operations like zoom-in, zoom-out, rotations and distortions. We show experimental evidence that the features computed from these resampling operations form distinct clusters in pattern space for different levels of embeddings and are amenable to classification using a pattern classifier like SVM. Our method works well not only for LSB Replacement Steganography but also for the LSB Matching approach.", "paper_title": "Resampling operations as features for detecting LSB replacement and LSB matching in color images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800033"}
