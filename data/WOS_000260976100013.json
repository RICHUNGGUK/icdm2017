A suitable analytical model, involving two abstraction layers, has been devised to relate expression profiles to the knowledge on transcripts' biological roles, extracted from genomic databases, into a comprehensive exploratory framework. This approach has been implemented into a user-friendly web tool to promote its open use by the community.", "paper_title": "FunNet: an integrative tool for exploring transcriptional interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000260976100013"}
