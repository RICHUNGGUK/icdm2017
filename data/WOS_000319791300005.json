The backbone chromatic number BBC(G, T) is the smallest integer k such that there exists a backbone k-colouring of (G, T). In 2007, Broersma et al. [2] conjectured that BBC (G, T) <= 6 for every planar graph G and every spanning tree T of G. In this paper, we prove this conjecture when T has diameter at most four. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
