BrIek and Reutenauer verified their conjecture for periodic infinite words. Using their result, we prove the conjecture for uniformly recurrent words. Moreover, we summarize results and some open problems related to defects, which may be useful for the proof of the Brlek-Reutenauer conjecture in full generality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
