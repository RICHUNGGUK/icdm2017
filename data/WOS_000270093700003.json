Researchers have also developed a group of visual analytics tools and methods that embody visual analytics principles and attack important and challenging real-world problems. However, these efforts are only the beginning and much study remains to be done. This article examines the state of the art in visual analytics methods and reasoning and gives examples of current tools and capabilities. It shows that the science of visual analytics needs interdisciplinary efforts, indicates some of the disciplines that should be involved and presents an approach to how they might work together. Finally, the article describes some gaps, opportunities and future directions in developing new theories and models that can be enacted in methods and design principles and applied to significant and complex practical problems and data.
