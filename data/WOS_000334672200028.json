A major challenge in network virtualization is the so-called virtual network embedding problem, which deals with the efficient embedding of virtual networks with resource constraints into a shared substrate network. A number of heuristics have been proposed to cope with the NP-hardness of this problem; however, all of the existing proposals reserve fixed resources throughout the entire lifetime of a virtual network. In this paper, we re-examine this problem with the position that time-varying resource requirements of virtual networks should be taken into consideration, and we present an opportunistic resource sharing-based mapping framework, ORS, where substrate resources are opportunistically shared among multiple virtual networks. We formulate the time slot assignment as an optimization problem; then, we prove the decision version of the problem to be NP-hard in the strong sense. Observing the resemblance between our problem and the bin packing problem, we adopt the core idea of first-fit and propose two practical solutions: first-fit by collision probability (CFF) and first-fit by expectation of indicators' sum (EFF). Simulation results show that ORS provides a more efficient utilization of substrate resources than two state-of-the-art fixed-resource embedding schemes.", "paper_title": "Virtual Network Embedding with Opportunistic Resource Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000334672200028"}
