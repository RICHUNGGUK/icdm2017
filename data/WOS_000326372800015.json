Mismatches between patient expectations and the register design may limit the long-term utility of such registers. Objective: This study elicited the views of people with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) on the desirability and expectations regarding a UK Register for MS. Methods: Participants were recruited through a range of traditional means (newsletters, adverts, word of mouth), as well as via the Internet, to obtain a broad sample of PwMS. Semi-structured interviews were conducted over the telephone, and the questions asked about: the desirability of the Register; what the participants envisaged the Register actually being used for; and what they hoped the Register could be used for. Results: The majority of individuals' points postulated that a UK MS Register would be useful, but a range of potential concerns were identified by the sample, such as security, accessibility for all PwMS, and the validity of self-report data. Analysis of the responses revealed a difference between what PwMS thought the Register would be used for, and how they wanted it to be used, particularly in relation to a desired social contact, exchange, and networking function. Conclusions: The security and accessibility of the website, the validity of the data, and mismatches between the expected and actual uses, are all issues of importance in the development of e-health tools, if PwMS are to be successfully engaged over time.
