We propose a new online algorithm for the multiplication using middle and short products of polynomials as building blocks, and we give the first precise analysis of the arithmetic complexity of various online multiplications. Our algorithm is faster than Fischer and Stockmeyer's by a constant factor; this is confirmed by experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
