Burn scars appear reddish-brown in band 742 false-colour composite of Landsat 7 images. This property is used in our algorithm to delineate burn scars. Firstly, we visually choose sample pixels from the burn scar. From these pixels, a discrimination function for burn scars is determined by the principal component analysis and interval estimation. Then we define a modified Chan-Vese functional. The minimizer of the functional corresponds to the boundary of the burn scar. In order to minimize this functional, the corresponding contour evolution equation is given. We use the discrimination function to locate an initial contour that is near the boundary of the burn scar. The evolving curve then efficiently converges to the desired boundary. A Landsat image over Russia is used to examine our algorithm. The result shows that the algorithm is effective. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
