This paper presents our prototype system that provides real-time indoor tracking of elderly residents and their belongings, which is essential to assisting and securing their independent living. For high-fidelity real-time tracking, we propose novel scheduling algorithms. Our scheduling algorithms are designed by harmonizing both sensing and communication signals and leveraging location awareness and mobility consciousness in order to improve tracking accuracy while reducing the energy consumption. We performed extensive experiments through both simulation and actual implementation. Our experimental result says that our scheduling algorithms can provide real-time tracking of residents within a 20 cm error bound in the typical range of human mobility.", "paper_title": "A real-time ubiquitous system for assisted living: Combined scheduling of sensing and communication for real-time tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000255199400006"}
