In this paper, entities appearing in a modeling process are classified into boundary and non-boundary entities. Non-boundary entities are usually embedded into embedding-space entities. These embedding relationships are described by inclusion topology. To support inclusion topology, a new mathematical framework quasi-cell-complex, as well as a topological data structure-Q-Complex, are proposed. Quasi-cell-complex is an extension of cell-complex with inclusion topology supported. Q-Complex is an NMB representation, in which a new topological entity-embedder is created for inclusion topology and zone/disk is adopted to capture the complete adjacencies around a vertex. Thus, Q-Complex allows full adjacencies, incidence-ordering, and inclusion relationships to be derived, and the efficiency of most basic queries is several times faster than most state-of-the-art NMB representations, without increasing storage. Additionally, the benefits of inclusion topology for shape modeling and feature modeling are explored. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
