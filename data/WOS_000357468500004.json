This problem consists of scheduling railway network inspection tasks. The objective is to minimize the total deadhead distance while performing all inspection tasks. Different 0-1 integer formulations for the problem are presented. A heuristic based on both Benders and Dantzig-Wolfe decompositions is proposed to solve this rich arc routing problem. Its performance is analyzed on a real life dataset provided by the French national railway company. The proposed algorithm is compared to a dynamic programming-based heuristic. Its ability to schedule the inspection tasks of 1 year on a sparse graph with thousand nodes and arcs is assessed. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
