This paper deals with the numerical analysis and computing of nonlinear models of option pricing that appear when illiquid market effects are taken into account. A consistent monotone finite difference scheme is proposed and a relationship between the discretization step size is obtained, ensuring nonnegative and stable numerical solutions and avoiding spurious oscillations.
