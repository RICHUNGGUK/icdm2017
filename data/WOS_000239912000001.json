The CrossGrid project offers us a Grid environment oriented towards computation- and data-intensive applications that need interaction with an external user. The air pollution model needs the interaction of an expert in order to make decisions about modifications in the industrial process to fulfill the European standard on emissions and air quality. The benefits of using different CrossGrid components for running the application on a Grid infrastructure are shown in this paper, and some preliminary results on the CrossGrid testbed are displayed.", "paper_title": "High performance air quality simulation in the European CrossGrid project", "paper_id": "WOS:000239912000001"}
