In most of these problems, a uniform and symmetrical distribution of the linguistic term sets for linguistic modeling is assumed. However, there exist problems whose assessments need to be represented by means of unbalanced linguistic term sets, i.e., using term sets that are not uniformly and symmetrically distributed. The use of linguistic variables implies processes of computing with words (CW). Different computational approaches can be found in the literature to accomplish those processes. The 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation introduces a computational model that allows the possibility of dealing with linguistic terms in a precise way whenever the linguistic term set is uniformly and symmetrically distributed. In this paper, we present a fuzzy linguistic methodology in order to deal with unbalanced linguistic term sets. To do so, we first develop a representation model for unbalanced linguistic information that uses the concept of linguistic hierarchy as representation basis and afterwards an unbalanced linguistic computational model that uses the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic computational model to accomplish processes of CW with unbalanced term sets in a precise way and without loss of information.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy linguistic methodology to deal with unbalanced linguistic term sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500008"}
