The covariance and conjugate covariance matrices of the array output are utilized symmetrically within a frame of biquaternions. The direction-of-arrivals are found where the biquaternion steering vectors are orthogonal to the noise subspace in the biquaternion domain. Simulations show the improved performance of the proposed method compared to its complex counterparts.", "paper_title": "Biquaternion noncircular MUSIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000347953000005"}
