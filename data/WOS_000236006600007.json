This article employs conditional random fields (CRFs) for the task of extracting various common fields from the headers and citation of research papers. CRFs provide a principled way for incorporating various local features, external lexicon features and globle layout features. The basic theory of CRFs is becoming well-understood, but best-practices for applying them to real-world data requires additional exploration. We make an empirical exploration of several factors, including variations on Gaussian, Laplace and hyperbolic-L-1 priors for improved regularization, and several classes of features. Based on CRFs, we further present a novel approach for constraint co-reference information extraction; i.e., improving extraction performance given that we know some citations refer to the same publication. On a standard benchmark dataset, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance, reducing error in average F1 by 36%, and word error rate by 78% in comparison with the previous best SVM results. Accuracy compares even more favorably against HMMs. On four co-reference IE datasets, our system significantly improves extraction performance, with an error rate reduction of 6-14%.
