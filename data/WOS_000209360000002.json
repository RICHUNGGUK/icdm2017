Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), due to their population-based approaches, are able to detect multiple solutions within a population in a single simulation run and have a clear advantage over the classical optimization techniques, which need multiple restarts and multiple runs in the hope that a different solution may be discovered every run, with no guarantee however. Numerous evolutionary optimization techniques have been developed since late 1970s for locating multiple optima (global or local). These techniques are commonly referred to as \"niching\" methods. Niching can be incorporated into a standard EA to promote and maintain formation of multiple stable subpopulations within a single population, with an aim to locate multiple globally optimal or suboptimal solutions simultaneously. This article is the first of its kind to present a comprehensive review of the basic concepts related to real-parameter evolutionary multimodal optimization, a survey of the major niching techniques, a detailed account of the adaptation of EAs from diverse paradigms to tackle multimodal problems, benchmark problems and performance measures.
