By querying genomic coordinates in the target species, all the potential paralogous/orthologous regions that overlap >= 80-100% ( adjustable) of the query sequences with user-specified sequence identity (>= 60%similar to >= 90%) are returned. Additional information is also given for the genes that are included in the returned regions, including gene description, alternatively spliced transcripts, gene ontology descriptions and other biologically important information. CNVVdb also provides information of pseudogenes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the CNV-related genomic regions. Moreover, multiple sequence alignments of shared CNVs across species are also provided. With the combination of CNV, SNP, pseudogene and functional information, CNVVdb can be very useful for comparative and functional studies in vertebrates.", "paper_title": "CNVVdb: a database of copy number variations across vertebrate genomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000266109500012"}
