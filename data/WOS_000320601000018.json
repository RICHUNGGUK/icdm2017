Motivated by this, several researchers developed further AES approaches. However, when a dispute occurs between the sender and recipient, there is no mechanism for verification by a third party. To address this problem, in 2002 Wu and Hsu added an additional requirement of convertibility. However, to date there has been no scheme that satisfies all the properties of an ideal AES. In this paper, we propose a scheme that satisfies all the properties of an ideal AES. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
