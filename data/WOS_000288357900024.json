However, in practical deployment scenarios, where location errors inevitably exist, these algorithms are vulnerable to a substantial performance degradation not only in terms of packet delivery ratio but also energy consumption. This paper focuses on the fundamental impact of localization errors in the design of energy-efficient geographic routing algorithms. First, we analyze the properties of existing energy-efficient geographic routing algorithms. This is then extended to compare these energy-efficient geographical routing algorithms in the presence of localization errors. The main contribution of this section is an in-depth analysis of the impact of location errors on geographic routing in terms of energy efficiency. By incorporating location error statistics into an objective function, we propose a new energy-efficient geographic routing algorithm named LED. An adaptive transmission strategy is then proposed to cope with the transmission failure caused by location errors. Finally, extensive performance evaluations show that our proposal is robust to location errors, thus statistically minimizing consumed transmit power as a packet is relayed from source to destination.
