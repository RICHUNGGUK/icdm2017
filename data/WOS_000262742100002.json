DNA strands can be viewed as finite strings over the alphabet [A, G, C, T), and are used in biomolecular computing to encode information. Due to the fact that A is Witson-Crick complementary to T and G to C, DNA single strands that are Watson-Crick complementary can bind to each other or to themselves forming so-called secondary structures, Most of these secondary structures are undesirable for biomolecular computational purposes since the strands they involve cannot further interact with other strands. This paper studies pseudoknot-bordered words, a mathematical formalization of pseudoknot-like inter- and intra-molecular structures. In this context, pseudoknot-unbordered words model DNA or RNA strands that will be free of such secondary structures. We obtain several properties of pseudoknot-bordered and -unbordered words. We also address Following problem: Given a pseudoknot-unbordered word u, does {u}(+) consist of pseudoknot-unbordered words only? We show that this is not generally true. We find that a sufficient condition for {u}(+) to consist of pseudoknot-unbordered words only is that it be not primitive. All of our results hold for arbitrary antimorphic involutions, of which the DNA Watson-Crick complementarity function is a particular case. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.
