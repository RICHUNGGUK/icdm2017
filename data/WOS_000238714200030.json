These delegate services have brought new challenges to the protection of multimedia content confidentiality. This paper discusses the importance and feasibility of applying a joint signal processing and crypto-graphic approach to multimedia encryption, in order to address the access control issues unique to multimedia applications. We propose two atomic encryption operations that can preserve standard compliance and are friendly to delegate processing. Quantitative analysis for these operations is presented to demonstrate that a good tradeoff can be made between security and bitrate overhead. In assisting the design and evaluation of media security systems, we also propose a set of multimedia-oriented security scores to quantify the security against approximation attacks and to complement the existing notion of generic data security. Using video as an example, we present a systematic study on how to strategically integrate different atomic operations to build a video encryption system. The resulting system can provide superior performance over both generic encryption and its simple adaptation to video in terms of a joint consideration of security, bitrate overhead, and friendliness to delegate processing.", "paper_title": "A joint signal processing and cryptographic approach to multimedia encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000238714200030"}
