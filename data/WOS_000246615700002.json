We also apply this to an insurance risk model with a dividend barrier and a general Markovian arrival process of claims with possible dependencies in successive inter-claim intervals and in claim sizes. We demonstrate the implementability and accuracy of our algorithms through a set of numerical examples that could also serve as test cases for comparing other solution approaches.", "paper_title": "Time dependent analysis of finite buffer fluid flows and risk models with a dividend barrier", "paper_id": "WOS:000246615700002"}
