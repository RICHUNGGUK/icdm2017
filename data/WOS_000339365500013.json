Integrating multiple cues has proved to be a promising approach to visual tracking in situations where no single cue is suitable. In this work, a new particle filter based visual tracking algorithm is proposed. By introducing a new cooperative fusion strategy, the proposed tracker has better fault tolerance ability than the traditional methods. Experiments are performed in various tracking scenes to evaluate the proposed algorithm, and the results show improved tracking accuracy.", "paper_title": "Cooperative fusion particle filter tracker", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500013"}
