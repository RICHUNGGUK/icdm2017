One way to reduce the computation is to discard some of the scale-space octaves, and previous research has simply discarded the higher octaves. This paper shows that this approach is not always the most sensible and presents an algorithm for choosing which octaves to discard based on the properties of the imagery. Results obtained with this best octaves algorithm show that it is able to achieve a significant reduction in computation without compromising matching performance.", "paper_title": "An Algorithm for the Contextual Adaption of SURF Octave Selection With Good Matching Performance: Best Octaves", "paper_id": "WOS:000298325500025"}
