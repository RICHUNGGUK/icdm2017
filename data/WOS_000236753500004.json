We introduce a novel approach of mesh fusion in this paper based on functional blending. Our method has no restriction of disk-like topology or one-ring opening on the meshes to be merged. First of all, sections with boundaries of the under-fusing meshes are converted into implicit representations. An implicit transition surface, which joins the sections together while keeping smoothness at the boundaries, is then created based on cubic Hermite functional blending. Finally, the implicit surface is tessellated to form the resultant mesh. Our scheme is both efficient and simple, and with it users can easily construct interesting, complex 3D models.", "paper_title": "Mesh fusion using functional blending on topologically incompatible sections", "paper_id": "WOS:000236753500004"}
