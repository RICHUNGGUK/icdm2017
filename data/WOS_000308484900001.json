Thus, a flexible M2M network architecture is desired to develop cognitive radio networks. As a distributed system framework, service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been well studied to provide the loose coupling, reusability, and scalability, where various system function modules are encapsulated into web services to build a virtual system. In this paper, based on SOA, we propose a flexible M2M architecture, namely, the service-oriented radio architecture (SORA), to develop the cognitive radio systems. It shows that our proposed architecture provides coordinated implementation of cognitive radio systems based on different development platforms. Furthermore, an SORA-based cognitive radio testbed is implemented, where the standard web service technologies and open source software tools are used to support the characteristics of SORA.", "paper_title": "Service-Oriented Radio Architecture: A Novel M2M Network Architecture for Cognitive Radio Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308484900001"}
