In this paper, we propose a new approach for heterogeneous internet based users to construct large-scale CVE (LCVE) system: Mobile Agent Based Framework for LCVE (MACVE). In MACVE, the system workloads are decomposed into independent and fine grained tasks. The tasks are modelled as mobile agents which are not bound to any fixed nodes as the traditional CVE architectures do. As the mobile agents can migrate or clone dynamically at any suitable participating host include traditional servers and qualified user hosts, the system workloads can be distributed more pervasively to avoid potential bottleneck. This improves the scalability of LCVE. Experiments results have demonstrated the scalability of our proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Addressing scalability issues in large-scale collaborative virtual environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600042"}
