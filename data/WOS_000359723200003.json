This modification is crucial for time-geographic calculations on public transit networks with a low frequency of service, which would otherwise return unstable results.", "paper_title": "A modification of the time-geographic framework to support temporal flexibility in 'fixed' activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000359723200003"}
