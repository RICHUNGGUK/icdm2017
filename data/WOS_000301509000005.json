This work focuses on providing fast and practically implementable optimization-based heuristic solution methods for very large scale problem instances. We offer a unique approach that utilizes a high-quality efficient heuristic within a neighborhood search to address the combined assignment and fixed-charge structure of the underlying optimization problem. We also study the potential benefits of combining our approach with a so-called very large-scale neighborhood search (VLSN) method. As our computational test results indicate, our work offers an attractive solution approach that can be tailored to successfully solve a broad class of problem instances for facility location and similar fixed-charge problems.", "paper_title": "A facility neighborhood search heuristic for capacitated facility location with single-source constraints and flexible demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000301509000005"}
