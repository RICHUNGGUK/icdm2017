Ideas and techniques for closing the semantic gap between low-level machine readable features of video data and high-level events seen by a human observer are discussed. An evaluation of the event classification and detection technique is presented and a future experiment to refine this technique is proposed. These experiments are used as a lead to a discussion on the most optimal machine learning algorithm to learn the event representation scheme proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "A framework for a video analysis tool for suspicious event detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000249406900006"}
