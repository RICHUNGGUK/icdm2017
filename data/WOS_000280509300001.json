Our paper probes the question of what can be achieved with respect to the basis {vertical bar 0 >(circle times n) of n logical qubits, given only a few copies of the unknown states vertical bar 0 > and 11). A phase-invariant operator is one that is unchanged under the relative phase-shift vertical bar 1 > -> e(i theta) vertical bar 1 >, for any theta, of all of the n qubits. We show that phase-invariant unitary operators can be implemented exactly with no copies and that phase-invariant states can be prepared exactly with at most n copies each of 10) and vertical bar 1 >; we give an explicit algorithm for state preparation that is efficient for some classes of states (e.g. symmetric states). We conjecture that certain non-phase-invariant operations are impossible to perform accurately without many copies. Motivated by optical implementations of quantum computers, we define \"quantum computation in a hidden basis\" to mean executing a quantum algorithm with respect to the phase-shifted hidden basis {vertical bar 0 >, e(i theta) vertical bar 1 >}, for some potentially unknown theta; we give an efficient approximation algorithm for this task, for which we introduce an analogue of a coherent state of light, which serves as a bounded quantum phase reference frame encoding theta. Our motivation was quantum-public-key cryptography, however the techniques are general. We apply our results to quantum-public-key authentication protocols, by showing that a natural class of digital signature schemes for classical messages is insecure. We also give a protocol for identification that uses many of the ideas discussed and whose security relates to our conjecture (but we do not know if it is secure).", "paper_title": "UNIVERSAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION IN A HIDDEN BASIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280509300001"}
