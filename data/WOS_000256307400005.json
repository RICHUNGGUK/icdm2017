In fact, a fuzzy rule base is a knowledgebase that models human cognitive factors. Fuzzy rules are linguistic 'IF-THEN' constructions where 'IF' part consists of a set of fuzzy variables and 'THEN' part includes a dependent fuzzy variable. In order to identify the underlying mathematical structure in the fuzzy rule base, we develop fuzzy linear and fuzzy polynomial regression techniques in this paper. And the estimation of model parameters is also shown using least-square approach. Finally, examples are illustrated to demonstrate the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy linear and polynomial regression modelling of 'IF-THEN' fuzzy rulebase", "paper_id": "WOS:000256307400005"}
