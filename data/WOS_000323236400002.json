The sufficient condition is derived for the diffusion coefficients so that there exist stochastic control Lyapunov functions for the systems. To illustrate the usefulness of the sufficient condition, the authors propose the stochastic continuous feedback law, which makes the origin of the Brockett integrator become globally asymptotically stable in probability.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Asymptotic Stabilizers for Deterministic Input-Affine Systems Based on Stochastic Control Lyapunov Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236400002"}
