Although such data has been helpful to many people, its helpfulness is limited. The data is dispersed across different sites. Even on the same site, the data is often not properly organised or ranked. This paper proposes a framework for constructing and extending a Q&A thesaurus for various applications, including online commerce. We have implemented the framework, and validated the accuracy of Q&A data classification.", "paper_title": "A framework for collective intelligence from internet Q&A documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000292422800002"}
