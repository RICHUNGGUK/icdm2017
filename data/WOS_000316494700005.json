The model can be implemented as an asynchronous sequential logic circuit and its control parameter is the pattern of wires among the circuit elements that is adjustable after implementation in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device. In this paper, a novel theoretical analysis method for the model is presented. Using this method, stabilities of neuron-like orbits and occurrence mechanisms of neuron-like bifurcations of the model are clarified theoretically. Also, a novel learning algorithm for the model is presented. An equivalent experiment shows that an FPGA-implemented learning algorithm enables an FPGA-implemented model to automatically reproduce typical nonlinear responses and occurrence mechanisms observed in biological and model neurons.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous Cellular Automaton-Based Neuron: Theoretical Analysis and On-FPGA Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000316494700005"}
