We explore the frontier between polynomial and NP-hard variants of the problem, with respect to the class of the underlying graph, as well as the approximability of NP-hard variants. In particular, we present polynomial algorithms for bounded degree trees and star of chains, as well as an approximation algorithm for bipartite graphs of maximum degree at most twelve which beats the best known approximation ratios.", "paper_title": "On the max-weight edge coloring problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000283257500009"}
