Malicious intended attacks to these targets need to be considered during system design. To face these situations, defence plans must be developed in advance. In this paper, we present a Unified Modelling Language profile, named SecAM, that enables the modelling and security specification for critical infrastructures during the early phases (requirements, design) of system development life cycle. SecAM enables security assessment, through survivability analysis, of different security solutions before system deployment. As a case study, we evaluate the survivability of the Saudi Arabia crude-oil network under two different attack scenarios. The stochastic analysis, carried out with Generalized Stochastic Petri nets, quantitatively estimates the minimization of attack damages on the crude-oil network.", "paper_title": "Modelling Security of Critical Infrastructures: A Survivability Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000362959000009"}
