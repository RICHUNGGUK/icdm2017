Let G = (V,E) be a planar graph with n vertices, G' = (V',E') a subgraph of G, and S a set of n distinct points in the plane. We study the problem of computing a point-set embedding of G on S subject to the constraint that G' is drawn with straight-line edges. Different drawing algorithms are presented that guarantee small curve complexity of the resulting drawing, i.e. a small number of bends per edge. It is proved that: If G' is an outerplanar graph and S is any set of points in convex position, a point-set embedding of G on S can be computed such that the edges of E \\ E' have at most 4 bends each. If S is any set of points in general position and G' is a face of G or if it is a simple path, the curve complexity of the edges of E \\ E' is at most 8. If S is in general position and G' is a set of k disjoint paths, the curve complexity of the edges of E \\ E' is O(2(k)).", "paper_title": "CONSTRAINED POINT-SET EMBEDDABILITY OF PLANAR GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283692200004"}
