The purpose is to obtain optimal trajectories for manoeuvres of Autonomous Surface Vessels. The algorithm works with a model of the vehicle, and the solutions achieved are always feasible. With enough time, it can also obtain trajectories very close to the optimal. Provided the appropriate modifications the algorithm can be applied to solve other combinatorial optimisations problems with a non restricted number of feasible solutions. The methodology is tested through simulations on open sea manoeuvres and scenarios with the presence of obstacles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
