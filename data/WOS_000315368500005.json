It obtains geological data from a running Excel application directly, and uses the data to plot geochemical diagrams and to construct stratigraphic columns. The software also contains functions for creating stereographic projections and rose diagrams, which can be used for spatial analysis, on a calibrated geological map. The user-friendly program has been tested to work with CorelDRAW 13-14-15 and Excel 2003-2007. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
