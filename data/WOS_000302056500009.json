This approach is based on the idea to construct hardcore processes by suitable dependent thinnings proposed by Matern but generates packings with higher volume fractions than the known thinning models. Due to the enormous complexity of the computations involved, we develop a two-phase heuristic algorithm whose first phase turns out to yield a structure of Matern III type. We focus mainly on the generation of packings with high volume fractions and present some simulation results for Poisson primary particle processes of equally sized balls in R-2 and R-3. The results are compared with the well-known random sequential adsorption model and Matern type models.", "paper_title": "The maximum volume hard subset model for Poisson processes: simulation aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056500009"}
