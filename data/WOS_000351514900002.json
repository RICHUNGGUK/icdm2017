A major challenge is related to virtual network (VN) mapping, as it is a NP-hard problem. Thus, several heuristics have been proposed aiming to achieve efficient allocation, but they do not consider dependability issues, which directly impact quality of service. This paper proposes a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) based algorithm for dependable virtual network mapping, considering availability as the adopted metric. Redundancy policies are also adopted in order to meet VN requests with high availability constraints. Experiments demonstrate the impacts whenever dependability is taken into accountsss in the allocation as well as the trade-off between VN's availability and cost.", "paper_title": "Dependable virtual network mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000351514900002"}
