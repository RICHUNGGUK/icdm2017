In this type of traffic, vehicles do not follow lane discipline and they move freely over the entire width of roadway based on availability of space, To study this type of complex traffic flow and associated vehicular interactions, simulation is considered as an effective tool. An object-oriented methodology (OOM) for heterogeneous traffic simulation is proposed in this paper with focus on mid-block and intersection flow modeling. The paper presents the basics and advanced features of object-oriented programming (OOP) in detail in the context of traffic flow. The sample C++ code is discussed in detail to demonstrate the implementation of OOP features, such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. The contribution of this research work is the development of software objects for various components such as vehicle, traffic, link and node. This software can be adopted for heterogeneous traffic simulation programs, in general. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
