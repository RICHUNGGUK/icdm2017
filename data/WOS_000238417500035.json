In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of implementing smoothed particle hydrodynamics on the streaming architecture of a GPU. A dynamic quadtree structure is proposed to accelerate the computation of inter-particle forces. Our method readily extends to higher dimensions without undue increase in memory or computation costs. We show that a GPU implementation runs nearly an order of magnitude faster than our CPU version for large problem sizes.", "paper_title": "Particle-based fluid simulation on the GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500035"}
