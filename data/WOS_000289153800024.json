Similar to the traditional (Klyshko) method of absolute calibration, the new one is based on the direct detection of two-mode squeezed vacuum at the output of a traveling wave OPA. However, in the new method, one measures the difference-photocurrent variance rather than the correlation function of photocurrents (number of coincidences), which makes the technique applicable for high-gain OPA. In this work we test the new method versus the traditional one for the case of photon-counting detectors where both techniques are valid.", "paper_title": "COMPARATIVE TEST OF TWO METHODS OF QUANTUM EFFICIENCY ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT BASED ON SQUEEZED VACUUM DIRECT DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800024"}
