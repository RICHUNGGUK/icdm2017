The project spanned four sites in the US and one in India, and is a representative example of the complexities and intricacies of global corporate software development. Objective: Our goal is to provide the rationale behind the methodological choices and derive insights to inform the methodology of future studies of global software engineering teams. The paper also aims to provide an illustrative case of a typical geographically distributed corporate software project, through an in-depth description that emerged by applying the methods. Method: We reflect upon the reasons for choosing each of our methods, viz., non-participant observation, site visits, interviews, and an online questionnaire. We then discuss what we learned from the experience of applying the methods. Results: During and after the study, the discussions surrounding our methodological choices yielded important insights. The dynamics of software engineering practice and the geographical distribution of the project impacted factors such as access, costs, and cultural and linguistic diversity, and influenced the choice of methods. Our experience makes a case for methodological breadth and plurality as a means to a broad understanding of a global project. This understanding could then be linked to the specific research questions under consideration. Conclusion: The in-depth contextual description of the project that emerged from our methods highlights the utility of our methodological approach and provides an illustration of the complex nature of these projects. Our systematic reflection also yielded several methodological insights and provides important implications for future empirical studies of global corporate software development. Our experience can serve as a useful resource in methodological choices for research on globally distributed software engineering teams, or collaborative knowledge work in general.
