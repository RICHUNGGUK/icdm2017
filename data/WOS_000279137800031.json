To this end, this study first proposes an e-training model called the Practice, Reflection and Collaboration (PRC) model, and discusses the rationale and theoretical framework underpinning each key component of the model. This is followed by the discussion of how the model was implemented in a 12-week e-teacher training program with the participation of trainee teachers and real distance students. This analysis focuses on how each component of the proposed model worked in our case, and what mechanisms were employed to nurture the trainees' professional and personal development to become competent and confident e-teachers.
