We then further prove, under strengthened assumptions on the channel, that the entropy rate is jointly analytic as a function of both the input Markov chain parameters and the channel parameters. In particular, the main theorems establish the analyticity of the entropy rate for two representative channels: 1) Cauchy and 2) Gaussian. The analyticity results obtained are expected to be helpful in computation/estimation of entropy rate of hidden Markov chains and capacity of finite-state channels with continuous output alphabet.", "paper_title": "Analyticity of Entropy Rate of Hidden Markov Chains With Continuous Alphabet", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600005"}
