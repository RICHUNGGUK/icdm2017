Five parts of ecosystem services (ES) were included, and they were producing organic matter, atmospheric gas regulation, recycling nutrient matter, holding water resources and conserving soil and water. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) was applied for estimating the service value of conserving soil and water which expected to improve the effect of assessment. From the results, the overall value in the entire region was 1636.81x10(8) RMB, with unbalanced constitution of 5 parts. A clear seasonal division was shown in the overall value and most parts. The distribution pattem in latitude, longitude, altitude was revealed respectively. Most parts of ecosystem services performed consistently response to both seasonal and spatial variation, except for the service of holding water resources and conserving soil and water. The major characteristics of ESV distribution can be roughly explained by the distribution and variation pattern of NPP and other crucial meteorological elements. The assessment of ESV by integrating multi-sourced data can provide an relatively objective result and have some indications for natural resources management.", "paper_title": "SPATIO-TEMPORAL ASSESSMENT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES VALUE ON REGIONAL SCALE", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468800012"}
