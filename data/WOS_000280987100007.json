Once the position of the rod is laterally deviated from the central position, the rod is automatically brought back by this magnetic repulsive force The magnetic field distributions, axial thrust force and lateral magnetic repulsive force are numerically obtained by Governing Equations Analysis (GEA) under cylindrical coordinate. The Finite Element Method (FEM), by the commercial software ANSOFT Maxwell with Transient Solver, is employed to be compared with and validate the solutions obtained by GEA. It is shown that the GEA is extremely agreed with the results by FEM. At last, the efficacy of the proposed MLLA is examined and verified by intensive computer simulations and experiments (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
