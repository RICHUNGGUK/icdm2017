We give a condition for determining whether the resulting codes satisfy the full diversity property, and study their maximum likelihood decoding complexity with respect to sphere decoding. Particular emphasis is given to the asymmetric multiple input double output codes. In the process, we derive an interesting way of obtaining division algebras, and study their centers and maximal subfields.", "paper_title": "Iterated Space-Time Code Constructions From Cyclic Algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800050"}
