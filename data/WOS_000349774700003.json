For natural human computer interaction, such a personal calibration is often inconvenient and unnatural. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic eye gaze tracking system without explicit personal calibration. Unlike the conventional eye gaze tracking methods, which estimate the eye parameter deterministically using known gaze points, our approach estimates the probability distributions of the eye parameter and eye gaze. Using an incremental learning framework, the subject does not need personal calibration before using the system. His/her eye parameter estimation and gaze estimation can be improved gradually when he/she is naturally interacting with the system. The experimental result shows that the proposed system can achieve <3 degrees accuracy for different people without explicit personal calibration.", "paper_title": "A Probabilistic Approach to Online Eye Gaze Tracking Without Explicit Personal Calibration", "paper_id": "WOS:000349774700003"}
