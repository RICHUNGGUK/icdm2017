This paper presents a Multi-Objective grammar-based genetic programming (MOGGP) system that automatically evolves complete rule induction algorithms, which in turn produce both accurate and compact rule models. The system was compared with a single objective GGP and three other rule induction algorithms. In total, 20 UCI data sets were used to generate and test generic rule induction algorithms, which can be now applied to any classification data set. Experiments showed that, in general, the proposed MOGGP finds rule induction algorithms with competitive predictive accuracies and more compact models than the algorithms it was compared with.", "paper_title": "Evolving rule induction algorithms with multi-objective grammar-based genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000266453600002"}
