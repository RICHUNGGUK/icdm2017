By using relation keywords as index key for schema info and partitioning tuples vertically, a method of indexing both schema and data with structured overlay is designed. And an algorithm based on these two levels of indices to support complex queries on multiple attributes is proposed. Qualitative analysis and comparison show that this work is closer to the goal of P2P data management than other projects.", "paper_title": "Supporting complex query with structured overlays in schema-based P2P system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300011"}
