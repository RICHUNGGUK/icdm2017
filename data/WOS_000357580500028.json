The difficult problem posed by urologists for classifying urolithiasis is due to the large number of parameters (components, age, gender, background ...) taking part in the classification, and hence the probable etiology determination. There exist 6 types of urinary lithiasis which are distinguished according to their compositions (chemical components with given proportions), their etiologies and patient profile. This work presents models based on Boosted decision trees results, and which were compared according to their error rates and the runtime. The principal objectives of this work are intended to facilitate the urinary lithiasis classification, to reduce the classification runtime and an epidemiologic interest. The experimental results showed that the method is effective and encouraging for the lithiasis type identification.", "paper_title": "Boosted Decision Trees for Lithiasis Type Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000357580500028"}
