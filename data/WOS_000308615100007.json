Optimal fragmentation schema is designed from workload gathered from data exploitation. However, adapting this technique to data warehouse should consider the specific characteristics of data warehouse such as the complexity of OLAP queries and the dynamicity of data model and workload. In this paper, data fragmentation is formalised as an optimisation problem with constraint and we propose the application of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) technique to design an optimal fragmentation schema.", "paper_title": "Particle swarm optimisation for data warehouse logical design", "paper_id": "WOS:000308615100007"}
