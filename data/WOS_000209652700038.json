Several prototypes operating in the band 1 (31-45 GHz) of the atacama large millimeter array have been fabricated and measured. The design is based on the use of a turnstile junction that is machined in a single block, requiring neither alignment nor a high degree of mechanical tolerances. Thus, a high repeatability of the design is possible for mass production. Across the 31-45 GHz band, the isolation is better than 50 dB and the return losses at the input and outputs of the OMT are better than 25 dB.", "paper_title": "A Compact High-Performance Orthomode Transducer for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 1 (31-45 GHz)", "paper_id": "WOS:000209652700038"}
