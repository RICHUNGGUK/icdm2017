Network users must therefore agree Upon encryption keys and authentication keys The authenticated Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol is used to provide authentication in communication systems. In this paper we present a group key agreement protocol without using one-way hash functions that are based on the DDH problem. The protocol achieves efficiency in both communication and computation aspects We analyzed the security in the security model formalized by Bresson et al Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "paper_title": "A constant rounds group key agreement protocol without using hash functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000274439900001"}
