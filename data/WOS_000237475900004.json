The need that these projects share in common is to apply advanced computing theory and techniques to real problems, overcoming the practical difficulties that are encountered. The main purpose of this paper is to illustrate, from our own experience, how applying advanced computing techniques to a real problem area can lead to unexpected difficulties that may not have been recognised at the theoretical or small-scale implementation stage, and to provide some recommendations for addressing the specific difficulties identified here. These recommendations are in the areas of identifying and rectifying terminological conflicts; handling multiple opinions; and design of architectures that can accommodate variation in platforms and administrative policies, and also accommodate change.", "paper_title": "Applying computer science research to biodiversity informatics: Some experiences and lessons", "paper_id": "WOS:000237475900004"}
