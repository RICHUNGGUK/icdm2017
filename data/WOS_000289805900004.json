In this paper the carbonation induced electrochemical corrosion model is developed and coupled with carbon dioxide transport computational model by the use of a concrete durability computer based model DuCOM developed by our research group at concrete laboratory in the University of Tokyo and its reliability is checked in the light of experiment results of carbonation induced corrosion mass loss obtained in this research. The comparison of model analysis and experiment results shows a fair agreement. The carbonation induced corrosion model computation reasonably predicts the quantitative behavior of corrosion rate for normal air dry relative humidity conditions. The computational model developed also shows fair qualitative corrosion rate simulation and analysis for various pH levels and coupled environmental actions of chloride and carbonation. Detailed verification of the model for the quantitative carbonation induced corrosion rate computation under varying relative conditions, different pH levels and combined effects of carbonation and chloride attack remain as scope for future research.", "paper_title": "Enhanced mass balance Tafel slope model for computer based FEM computation of corrosion rate of steel reinforced concrete coupled with CO2 transport", "paper_id": "WOS:000289805900004"}
