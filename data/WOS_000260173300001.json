We describe the building and testing of the STANDUP program - a large-scale, robust, interactive, user-friendly pun-generator (inspired by Binsted's JAPE program), which is aimed at allowing children, particularly those with communication disabilities, to develop their linguistic skills. The STANDUP system was designed in consultation with potential users and suitable experts, was rigorously engineered using public-domain linguistic data, and has a special purpose, child-friendly, graphical user interface. The software was tested successfully with real users (children with complex communication needs).", "paper_title": "THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PUN GENERATOR FOR LANGUAGE SKILLS DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000260173300001"}
