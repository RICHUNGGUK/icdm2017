Within this scheme, radial basis function RBF neural networks are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions of the subsystems. An adaptive neural controller is designed based on the recursive backstepping procedure and the minimal learning parameter technique. The proposed decentralized control scheme has the following features. First, the controller singularity problem in some of the existing adaptive control schemes with feedback linearization is avoided. Second, the numbers of adaptive parameters required for each subsystem are not more than the order of this subsystem. Lyapunov stability method is used to prove that the proposed adaptive neural control scheme guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded, while tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. The simulation example of a two-spring interconnected inverted pendulum is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Adaptive neural decentralized control for strict feedback nonlinear interconnected systems via backstepping", "paper_id": "WOS:000330318500002"}
