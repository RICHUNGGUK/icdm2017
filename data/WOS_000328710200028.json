Specifically, the Modified micro Genetic Algorithm (MmGA) is used to form the ensemble optimizer. The aim of the MmGA-based ensemble optimizer is two-fold, i.e. to select a small number of input features for classification and to improve the classification performances of neural network models. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a number of benchmark problems are first used, and the results are compared with those from other methods. The applicability of the proposed system to a human motion detection and classification task is then evaluated. The outcome positively demonstrates that the proposed MmGA-based ensemble optimizer is able to improve the classification performances of neural network models with a smaller number of input features.
