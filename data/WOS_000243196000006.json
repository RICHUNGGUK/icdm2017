Mathematical models of these flow problems consist typically of conservation laws like conservation of mass and momentum for each phase together with coupling terms connecting the phases. For multi-phase flow the characteristics are often complex and without the dissipative terms the problem is ill-posed and not computable. We will discuss why the nonlinearity of the system can prevent blow-up.", "paper_title": "A note on viscous conservation laws with complex characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000243196000006"}
