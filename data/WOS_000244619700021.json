The origin of this system is globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stabilized by bounded control laws. The explicit expressions of the control laws applied are determined through recent extensions of the forwarding approach to systems with a delay in the input. In a second step, the output feedback stabilization problem consisting in globally asymptotically stabilizing the origin of the PVTOL when the variables of velocity are unmeasured is solved through a recent technique which extensively exploits the presence of positive delays in the inputs.", "paper_title": "Global asymptotic stabilization of a PVTOL aircraft model with delay in the input", "paper_id": "WOS:000244619700021"}
