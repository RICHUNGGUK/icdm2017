We consider two cases of second-order digital filters: distinct real poles and multiple real poles. In case of second-order digital filters, we can express the L-2-sensitivity of second-order digital filters by a simple linear combination of exponential functions and formulate the L-2-sensitivity minimization problem by a simple polynomial equation. As a result, the minimum L-2-sensitivity realizations can be synthesized by only solving a fourth-degree polynomial equation, which can be analytically solved.", "paper_title": "Closed Form Solutions to L-2-Sensitivity Minimization of Second-Order State-Space Digital Filters with Real Poles", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342800014"}
