In addition to using available real time data, expert knowledge on the relationships of the parameters among different rules is incorporated into the updating process so that the performance of the expert system can be improved. Experiments are carried out to compare the newly proposed algorithm with the previously published algorithms, and results show that the proposed algorithm can update the BRB expert system faster and more accurately, which is important for real-time applications. The BRB expert systems can be automatically tuned to represent complex real world systems, and applied widely in engineering. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
