Alice holds the AC part of each state, Bob holds B, while R represents all other parties correlated with ABC. Alice is required to redistribute the C systems to Bob while asymptotically preserving the overall purity. We prove that this is possible using Q qubits of communication and E ebits of shared entanglement between Alice and Bob, provided that Q >= 1/2 I(C; D|B) and Q + E >= H (C|B), proving the optimality of the Luo-Devetak outer bound. The optimal qubit rate provides the first known operational interpretation of quantum conditional mutual information. We also show how our protocol leads to a fully operational proof of strong subaddivity and uncover a general organizing principle, in analogy to thermodynamics, that underlies the optimal rates.", "paper_title": "Optimal Quantum Source Coding With Quantum Side Information at the Encoder and Decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019700039"}
