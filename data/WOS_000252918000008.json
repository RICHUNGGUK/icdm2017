This also produces alteration of the biomechanical environment and increases articular instability, with a progressive and degenerative arthrosic pathology. Due to these negative consequences, total meniscectomy technique has been avoided, with a clear preference for partial meniscectomies. Despite the better results obtained with this latter technique, it has been demonstrated that the knee still suffers progressive long-term wear, which alters the properties of the surface of articular cartilage. In this paper, a phenomenological isotropic damage model of articular cartilage is presented and implemented in a finite element code. We hypothesized that there is a relation between the increase of shear stress and cartilage degeneration. To confirm the hypothesis, the obtained results were compared to experimental ones. It is used to investigate the effect of meniscectomies on articular damage in the human knee joint. Two different situations were compared for the tibio-femoral joint: healthy and after meniscectomy. The distribution of damaged regions and the damage level distribution resulted qualitatively similar to experimental results, showing, for instance that, after meniscectomy, significant degeneration occurs in the lateral compartment. A noteworthy result was that patterns of damage in a total meniscectomy model give better agreement to clinical results when using relative increases in shear stress, rather than an absolute shear stress criterion. The predictions for partial meniscectomies indicated the relative severity of the procedures. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
