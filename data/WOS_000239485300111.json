Firstly, four texture features including angular second moment, contrast, entropy and inverse differential moment were extracted from gray-level co-occurrence matrices of B-scan ultrasound liver images. They were mapped by a SOM for feature reduction, and then combined with other two features, named approximate entropy and mean intensity ratio. All features were imposed to a MLP for recognition. In the experiment, 130 B-scan liver images were divided into two groups: 104 in training group and 26 in validation group. Both the normal and fatty livers were recognized correctly. This study showed that the hybrid neural network could be used for fatty liver recognition with good performances.", "paper_title": "Recognition of fatty liver using hybrid neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300111"}
