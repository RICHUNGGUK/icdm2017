In this paper, we show that, for any n-dimensional augmented cube (n >= 3) with faulty edges up to 4n - 8 in which each vertex is incident to at least two fault-free edges, there exists a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle. Our result is optimal with respect to the number of faulty edges tolerated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
