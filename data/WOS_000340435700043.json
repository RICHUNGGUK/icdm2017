It is shown that a fuzzy ideal alpha of a ring is fuzzy prime if and only if alpha(x) is a fuzzy prime ideal of R[x]. Moreover, we show that if alpha(x) is a fuzzy maximal ideal of R[x], then alpha is a fuzzy maximal ideal of R.", "paper_title": "On the fuzzy polynomial ideals", "paper_id": "WOS:000340435700043"}
