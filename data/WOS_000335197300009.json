The proposed methodology incorporates probabilistic methodology in the uncertainties representation section, while harmony search algorithm is adopted as a fast and reliable soft computing algorithm to solve the proposed nonlinear, non-convex, large-scaled and combinatorial problem. As an indispensable step towards a more economical power system operation, the optimal generation scheduling strategy in the presence of mixed hydro-thermal generation mix, deemed to be the most techno-economically efficient scheme, comes to the play and is profoundly taken under concentration in this study. This paper devises a comprehensive hybrid optimisation approach by which all the crucial aspects of great influence in the generation scheduling process can be accounted for. Two-point estimation method is also adopted probabilistically approaching the involved uncertain criteria. In the light of the proposed methodology being implemented on an adopted test system, the anticipated efficiency of the proposed method is well verified.", "paper_title": "Hybrid probabilistic- harmony search algorithm methodology in generation scheduling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000335197300009"}
