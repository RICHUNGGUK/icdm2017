To make the smart work environment, the system has to be in a data-driven manner so that the data can keep its consistency. Preexisting data acquisition method in inspection job is almost based on documents or handover from other engineers. However, sometimes it produces inconsistent data which is different from updated information and it leads to potential risk factors. To prevent and reduce inconstant information between users and updated information, this paper suggests radio-frequency identification device (RFID) and cloud technology.", "paper_title": "Cloud-Based RF-Inspection for Ship Maintenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000322653100001"}
