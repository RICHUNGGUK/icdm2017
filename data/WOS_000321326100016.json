The most widespread method applied in job evaluation process is the point-factor method. In this method, for determining the worth of a job, a set of compensable factors are identified. In this study, a fuzzy multi-criteria approach is developed for job evaluation. In the first stage, factors are weighted by using a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) method. Afterwards, the obtained weights are used in the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (F-TOPSIS) for scoring jobs. At last these scores are used to support for an ideal compensation system. An illustrative case study demonstrating the applicability of the model is given. Finally a sensitivity analysis for the deviations in the criteria weights is also made.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy multi-criteria approach to point-factor method for job evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000321326100016"}
