Simulation results show that the proposed 10 Gbps DDO-CE-OFDM system using 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM), 2.66 GHz signal bandwidth, and different values of electrical phase modulation index outperforms DDO-OFDM systems as it increases the fiber nonlinearity tolerance in fiber links without optical dispersion compensation. The bit error rate of the proposed transmission scheme is decreased by a factor of 1000 if compared to conventional DDO-OFDM systems, for 10 dBm of optical input power and considering a span of 960 km of standard single-mode fiber.", "paper_title": "A PAPR Reduction Technique Based on a Constant Envelope OFDM Approach for Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation in Optical Direct-Detection Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000302960200001"}
