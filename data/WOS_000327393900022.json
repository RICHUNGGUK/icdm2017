It has many applications, such as copyright protection, automatic video tagging and online video monitoring. Many existing approaches use only a single feature to represent a video for NDVR. However, a single feature is often insufficient to characterize the video content. Moreover, while the accuracy is the main concern in previous literatures, the scalability of NDVR algorithms for large scale video datasets has been rarely addressed. In this paper, we present a novel approach-Multiple Feature Hashing (MFH) to tackle both the accuracy and the scalability issues of NDVR. MFH preserves the local structural information of each individual feature and also globally considers the local structures for all the features to learn a group of hash functions to map the video keyframes into the Hamming space and generate a series of binary codes to represent the video dataset. We evaluate our approach on a public video dataset and a large scale video dataset consisting of 132,647 videos collected from YouTube by ourselves. This dataset has been released (http://itee.uq.edu.au/shenht/UQ_VIDEO/). The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in both accuracy and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Effective Multiple Feature Hashing for Large-Scale Near-Duplicate Video Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000327393900022"}
