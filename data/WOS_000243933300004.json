A new test is developed which combines momentum-threshold autoregression (MTAR) and local-to-unity detrending via generalised least squares (GLS). Critical values for the newly proposed GLS-MTAR threshold cointegration test are provided under alternative decisions regarding the deterministic terms employed when implementing the test. Simulation analysis of the test shows it to provide a substantial increase in power relative to the previously proposed MTAR threshold cointegration test of Enders and Siklos [W. Enders, P.
