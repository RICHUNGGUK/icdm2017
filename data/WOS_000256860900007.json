Enabling detection of attacks in network traffic is an important and challenging task. However, most existing volume-based schemes can not detect short-term attacks that have a minor effect on traffic volume. On the other hand, feature-based schemes are not suitable for real-time detection because of their complicated calculations. In this paper, we develop an IP packet size entropy (IPSE)-based DoS/DDoS detection scheme in which the entropy is markedly changed when traffic is affected by an attack. Through our analysis, we find that the IPSE-based scheme is capable of detecting not only long-term attacks but also short-term attacks that are beyond the volume-based schemes' ability to detect. Moreover, we test our proposal using two typical Internet traffic data sets from DARPA and SINET, and the test results show that the IPSE-based detection scheme can provide detection of DoS/DDoS attacks not only in a local area network (DARPA) and but also in academic backbone network (SINET).", "paper_title": "IP packet size entropy-based scheme for detection of DoS/DDoS attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256860900007"}
