We introduce a new operator which flips the sign of the targets and evaluate its circuit complexity. We find the condition under which the circuit complexity of the database search algorithm based on this operator is less than that of the conventional one.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM ORACLES IN TERMS OF UNIVERSAL GATE SET", "paper_id": "WOS:000296624600002"}
