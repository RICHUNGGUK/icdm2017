When referred to principal axes (rho, phi, z) in the anisotropic region, both permittivity and permeability tensors were biaxial and diagonal; so, the radial Eigen-functions were complex ordered Bessel's functions. The monostatic and bistatic scattering cross-sections of a PEMC cylinder coated with both of anisotropic DPS (double-positive) medium with positive values of relative permittivity and elements of permeability tensors and anisotropic DNG (double-negative) metamaterial with negative values of relative permittivity and permeability elements of tensors were calculated. The validity of the presented relations was achieved by comparing the results of specific cases of isotropic coated cylinder and anisotropic coated perfect electric conductor cylinder with those of previously published methods.
