In this paper we propose a cellular automata model of the traffic on a single lane highway which considers the drivers' inertial behavior under different driving circumstances. Simulation results show that our model can capture such important features of the traffic as jam formation, phase transition and metastable states. Some of other models, like the slow-to-start model, can be derived from our model.", "paper_title": "a Cellular Automata Model of Traffic Flow with Consideration of the Inertial Driving Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000278088700009"}
