This study focuses on performing the supply chain planning for the BOSC network. The planning is designed to integrate supplier selection, product assembly, as well as the logistic distribution system of the supply chain in order to meet market demands. With multiple suppliers and multiple customer needs, the assembly model can be divided into several sub-assembly steps by applicable sequence. Considering three evaluation criteria, namely costs, delivery time, and quality, a multi-objective optimization mathematical model is established for the BOSC planning in this study. The multi-objective problems usually have no unique optimal solution, and the Pareto genetic algorithm (PaGA) can find good trade-offs among all the objectives. Therefore, the PaGA is applied to find solutions for the mathematical model. In addition, regarding BOSC problems solving, this study proposes a modified Pareto genetic algorithm (mPaGA) to improve the solution quality through revision of crossover and mutation operations. After application and analysis of cases, mPaGA is found to be superior to traditional PaGA (tPaGA) in solution performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
