Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) uses widely separated telescopes where high bandwidth direct connection to a central processor has not been feasible until recently. The academic networks now allow us to connect at high data rates (similar to 1 Gbps) in \"eVLBI\". The ESLEA project has played a major role in the development of eVLBI. We outline this development in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "The Role of ESLEA in the development of eVLBI", "paper_id": "WOS:000271357200012"}
