However, when congestion builds up in the optical network core, large amount of data might be lost. In this article, we propose an efficient optical burst control algorithm that operates based on the awareness of future burst traffic condition to eliminate the effect of congestion reaction delay. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of multiple statistics to improve the estimation accuracy.Through performance evaluation, it is verified that the proposed algorithm proactively controls inbound burst traffic so that the OBS network can stay in a stable traffic condition while keeping the network throughput high.", "paper_title": "Long-term estimation-based burst control algorithm in OBS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000265924000011"}
