The scheme has several attractive characteristics: (i) it is suitable for large density ratios, and numerical experiments with density ratios up to 1000 have been presented; (ii) it involves only constant (time-independent) coefficient matrices for all flow variables, which can be pre-computed during pre-processing, so it effectively overcomes the performance bottleneck induced by variable coefficient matrices associated with the variable density and variable viscosity; (iii) it completely de-couples the computations of the velocity, pressure, and the phase field function. Strategy for spectral-element type spatial discretizations to overcome the difficulty associated with the large spatial order of the Cahn-Hilliard equation is also discussed. Ample numerical simulations demonstrate that the current algorithm, together with the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard phase field approach, is an efficient and effective method for studying two-phase flows involving large density ratios, moving contact lines, and interfacial topology changes.
