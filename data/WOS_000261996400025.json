We have released a major update that comprises various new features for case-control data. Furthermore, we provide an additional program runFamhap that allows users to start the same method repeatedly for varying sets of genetic markers. In addition, a platform-independent graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to simplify the usage of both FAMHAP and runFamhap. The runFamhap program greatly facilitates the application of FAMHAP to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and supports flexible genome-wide haplotype analysis. As an example, we describe application to HapMap data.", "paper_title": "Genetic association analysis with FAMHAP: a major program update", "paper_id": "WOS:000261996400025"}
