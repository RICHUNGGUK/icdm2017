We completely characterize sizes of teams of robots capable of exploring an n-node line. For k < n, exploration by k robots turns out to be possible, if and only if either k = 3, or k >= 5, or k = 4 and n is odd. For all values of k for which exploration is possible, we give an exploration algorithm. For all others, we prove an impossibility result. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
