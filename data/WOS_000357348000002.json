However, few studies include covariate data directly into their biclustering models to explain these variations. A novel biclustering framework that considers both stochastic block structures and covariate effects is proposed to address this modeling problem. Fast approximation estimation algorithms are also developed to deal with a large number of latent variables and covariate coefficients. These algorithms are derived from the variational generalized expectation-maximization (EM) framework where the goal is to increase, rather than maximize, the likelihood lower bound in both E and M steps. The utility of the proposed biclustering framework is demonstrated through two block modeling applications in model-based collaborative filtering and microarray analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
