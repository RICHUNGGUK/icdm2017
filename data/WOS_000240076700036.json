It is shown that for such a simple receiver it is not possible to construct signal sets (or spreading codes) to even satisfy the basic requirement that every user's symbol error probability decays exponentially as noise power vanishes. This result holds for arbitrary received energies, modulation schemes, and any strictly underdetermined system with a finite signal space dimension and a finite number of users.", "paper_title": "On the limitation of linear MMSE detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000240076700036"}
