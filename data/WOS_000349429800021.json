The outer model provides all the values needed by the governing equations of the nesting (inner) subdomain at the boundary (including tangential velocities). A 3D flux relaxation scheme is applied to prevent mass and energy drift. The influence of tangential velocities in the solution is evaluated, showing a substantial reduction on the results' quality when they are considered negligible and lateral circulation exists. The inner/outer coupling implemented achieves a simulation time equal to the inner execution time and allows a transfer step equal to the inner time-step, removing time interpolation errors. This coupling makes feasible the 3D relaxation implemented. A dramatic improvement in memory requirements and simulation time is achieved, that allows the use of low-cost low-power consumption platforms in the simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
