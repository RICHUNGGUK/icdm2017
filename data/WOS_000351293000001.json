Design/methodology/approach - In total, 480 respondents participated in online experiments with a four (positive+objective, positive+subjective, negative+objective, and negative+subjective online review) by two (marketer-generated vs consumer-generated brand community web sites) between subject design. Findings - The experiment showed that: an objective negative online review was rated higher in terms of message usefulness compared to the other types of online reviews; positive reviews, whether they are objective or subjective, were rated higher in terms of attitudes toward and intention to purchase the reviewed product, and the effects of online reviews moderated by e-WOM platforms on consumer judgment were supported. Research limitations/implications - The present study, based on an established theoretical foundation, will help the research community to gain a deeper understanding of the combined effects of online review valence and attributes on consumer judgment and whether user-generated web community is better for consumers to consult product experience. Practical implications - The findings of this study can provide interested firms with useful strategies and tactics to enhance users' acceptance of online reviews in terms of who operates the web sites. Originality/value - With increasing use of consumers' online reviews, the present study proposed and tested a comprehensive research model integrating both the valence and objectivity/subjectivity of online review, which has rarely been addressed in previous research.", "paper_title": "Combined effects of valence and attributes of e-WOM on consumer judgment for message and product The moderating effect of brand community type", "paper_id": "WOS:000351293000001"}
