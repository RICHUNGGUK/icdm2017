We show how to automatically generate a value function approximation basis built upon piecewise-linear ridge functions by developing and exploiting a theoretical connection with the problem of finding optimal cyclic schedules. We provide a variant of the algorithm that is effective in practice, and we exploit the special structure of the GJR problem to provide a coherent, implementable framework.", "paper_title": "Computing Near-Optimal Policies in Generalized Joint Replenishment", "paper_id": "WOS:000300842900011"}
