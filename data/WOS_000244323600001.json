As a result, a designer is generating a piping model, that is, 3D CAD model of the pipes in the hull structure, independently of the hull structural model at the detailed design stage. The designer must manually modify the piping model whenever the hull structural model changes. To lighten the burden imposed on the designer, a generation method of the piping model based on the hull structural model is developed in this study. The applicability of the developed method is demonstrated by applying it to a deadweight 300,000 ton VLCC (Very Large Crude Oil Carrier). The result shows that the developed method can quickly generate the piping model having the relationship with the hull structure in early time. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
