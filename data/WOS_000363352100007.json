In such a case, keeping a single round trip time (RTT) estimator for a multi-path flow is insufficient as each path may experience different round trip times. To solve this problem, it has been proposed to use multiple RTT estimators to predict network condition. In this paper, we examine an alternative approach to this problem, CHoPCoP, which utilizes explicit congestion control to cope with the multiple-source, multiple-path situation. In addition, a parallelized version of CHoPCoP, pCHoPCoP, is designed to support bandwidth aggregation on multi-homed hosts. We have implemented CHoPCoP/pCHoPCoP on the ORBIT testbed and conducted experiments under various network and traffic settings. The evaluation shows that CHoPCoP can effectively deal with congestion in the multipath environment, and pCHoPCoP can maximize the network utilization for a multi-homed host. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
