We show that mutually orthogonal Golay complementary sets can also be directly constructed from second-order cosets of a q-ary generalization of the first-order RM code. This identification can be used to construct zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences directly and it also enables the construction of ZCZ sequences with special subsets.", "paper_title": "Complete mutually orthogonal golay complementary sets from Reed-Muller codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000253602200034"}
