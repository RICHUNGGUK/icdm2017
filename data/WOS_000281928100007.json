Design/methodology/approach - Based on the hierarchy and structure of TASE.2, the overall architecture of the ICS for multi-level EPCC is put forward at first. As the key devices in the system, the structures of the communication gateway (CG) and common interface are designed. Then, the logical procession flows in CG and the con modes, for both CG and IC are analyzed in detail. The web-based software configuration of remote maintenance and fault diagnosis is discussed conceptually. Findings - As a standardized, well-developed, and efficient protocol, TASE.2 is considered to be the most suitable protocol to support the ICS for multi-level EPCC. Research limitations/implications - The performance of the ICS needs to be further simulated. Practical implications - Practical architecture for ICS for multi-level EPCC with robustness and cost-efficient specialty is designed in principle, which is very useful for manufacturers to develop pilot devices or even products. Originality/value - This paper proposes a new ICS scheme for multi-level EPCC based on TASE.2 is proposed.", "paper_title": "An open architecture for information communication systems for multi-level electric power control centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000281928100007"}
