A granule is a subset of a universal set, a granular structure is a family of subsets of the universal set, and relationship between granules is given by the standard set-inclusion relation. By imposing different conditions on the family of subsets, we can define several types of granular structures. A number of studies, including rough set analysis, formal concept analysis and knowledge spaces, adopt specific models of granular structures. The proposed framework therefore provides a common ground for unifying these studies. The notion of approximations is examined based on granular structures.", "paper_title": "Set-theoretic Approaches to Granular Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000302777700009"}
