The errors in vertical force measurements introduced when the stairs interface with a force plate (FP) are less than 0.6%. The centre of pressure error introduced is less than 0.7mm compared to the error from the FP. The challenges of introducing stair gait into a clinical trial with a limited number of FPs and time limitations for assessment sessions are addressed by introducing this cost effective solution. The staircase was used in a study to measure non-pathological knee function of 10 subjects performing stair ascent and descent. The resulting knee kinematics and knee joint moments are in agreement with previous studies. The kinematic and joint moment profiles provide a normative range, which will be useful in future studies for identifying alterations in joint function associated with pathology and intervention.", "paper_title": "Introducing a new staircase design to quantify healthy knee function during stair ascent and descent", "paper_id": "WOS:000278314600009"}
