By applying Markov process, some important performance measures are derived. A cost model is developed to determine the optimal threshold values and the optimal service rate at a minimum cost. Some illustrative examples are provided. The genetic algorithm is employed to search for the joint optimal values of control arrival and service parameters for the system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
