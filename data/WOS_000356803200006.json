Beginning with a nonlinear integer programming problem, we derive the upper bound of optimal value through many-to-many assignment problem and then propose three algorithms for both centralized and distributed scenarios. In centralized case, a heuristic scheme is proposed based on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) over all primary channels (PCs). Then, a greedy scheme is proposed to reduce the reported information from the CRs. In distributed case, a novel scheme with multi-round operation is designed following the coalitional game theory. In each round, each CR selects some PCs based on SNRs. Then, the CRs selecting the same channel play coalitional game, and thereby, multiple games are played concurrently over multiple channels. Finally, the best coalition for each channel is chosen among the formed coalitions to perform the cooperative spectrum sensing. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly increase the number of available channels.
