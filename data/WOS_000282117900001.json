Pixel-value differencing (PVD) approaches are one kind of methods to pass some program detections, but PVD approaches usually provide lower capacities and larger distortion. Accordingly, the combined method of PVD and LSB replacement was proposed to raise the capacity and the quality of PVD approaches over the past literatures. In this paper, not only we contribute a new exploration in spatial domain to benefiting both the capacity and the fidelity on the basis of varied LSB + PVD approaches, but also the risk of the RS-steganalysis detection program is evaded. Furthermore, proof works are conducted to proclaim the correctness of the general LSB + PVD method. Following up, the varied LSB + PVD approach is therefore applied to our scheme.
