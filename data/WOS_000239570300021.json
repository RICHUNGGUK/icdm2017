This may lead to loss of data packets and premature death of sensor nodes which may cause the premature death of entire network. Load-balancing techniques can prolong the lifetime of sensor networks and avoid the occurrence of packet congestions. This paper proposes an approach that using load-balancing network to balancing the load in a static data gathering wireless sensor network. Experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "LBN: Load-balancing network for data gathering wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300021"}
