The contact lines themselves may lie on vertical cylinders or spherical objects. The Laplace-Young equation determining the meniscus shape is solved by a finite-difference method in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates generated by conformal mapping. The elevation of the contact lines is either prescribed or computed as part of the solution to ensure a specified contact angle. The results illustrate that the contact line spacing has an important effect on the contact angle or contact line distribution. Meniscus shapes exist only for a limited range of pressure differences between the upper and lower fluid that depend on the capillary length.
