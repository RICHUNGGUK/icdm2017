Still, this curve has some major issues in terms of unifiedness and completeness. In 2007, Edwards curve has proved to be the answer to such deficiencies with its unified addition law. This curve has been recently extended to Binary Edwards Curves (BEC), due to efficiency of implementation in GF(2(m)) fields and to harvest the advantages of a unified and complete scalar point multiplication on the family of BEC. In spite of achieving the unification, it introduces more challenges to the designer to reduce the computation time and trade-off the area in efficient way. A noble architecture of a BEC processor is proposed in this work in GF(2(233)). We further analyze the work in terms of simple power analysis. Through experimentations, we show that the naive implementation can reveal some important information about the secret key. Finally, we conclude the work with suitable modifications to prevent such side-channel attacks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
