The research highlights the need to support various types of exceptions, including expected, planned, unexpected, and true exceptions. The developed support contemplates the vital human involvement in exception handling. We propose a specialized component supporting exception diagnosis, escalation to several operators, collaboration support, recovery actions, and monitoring the system evolution. The fundamental contribution of this research is the extension of BPM exception-handling capabilities to true exceptions.", "paper_title": "BPM and Exception Handling: Focus on Organizational Resilience", "paper_id": "WOS:000289471700011"}
