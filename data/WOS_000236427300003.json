Emails, mailing lists, chat rooms, electronic bulletin boards, newsgroups are ways for identifying buddies. However, manual ways of finding a buddy are time consuming and not generally effective. Collaborative filtering technologies can provide useful information to users based on others' interests, and software agent technology is a promising tool for finding buddies. Software agents are autonomous and call represent users' preferences and perform tasks with built-in learning and reasoning capabilities. They can also communicate with one another to exchange information. Here, we define an agent-based buddy-finding methodology. Agents are created to represent users and exchange sample information with possible buddies while assessing the information exchanged. Thus, we present a methodology for developing an agent that identifies a set of buddy-agents using a built-in fuzzy reasoning mechanism to assess the buddy membership of peer agents. Using this, the agents cultivate a dynamic acquaintance list of their peer agents. The methodology was empirically tested in a context involving sharing musical-knowledge. We show that the buddies found by agents are as good as those found manually. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
