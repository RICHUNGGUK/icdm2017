The design of the algorithm relies on a deepening of the theory of visibility complexes and on the extension of that theory to the setting of branched coverings. The problem of computing a pseudotriangulation that contains a given set of bitangent line segments is also examined.", "paper_title": "Computing Pseudotriangulations via Branched Coverings", "paper_id": "WOS:000307507800002"}
