This system involves the divergence of a particle kinetic tensor, which is provided by a Lagrangian code and whose components are not smooth. The simulation algorithm is based on the combined use of upwinding and relaxation techniques. The main properties of the method are given, together with the Finite Volume Godunov scheme and this approach is compared to an analogous one that was developed earlier. Some measured rates of convergence in L-1-norm are provided, for a particular choice of the kinetic tensor. To complete the picture, we present some numerical results obtained when non-smooth external data are provided to the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
