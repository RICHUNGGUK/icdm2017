In this article, we are focusing on divergence measures that are based on a class of measures known as Csiszar's divergence measures. In particular, we propose a class of goodness-of-fit tests based on Csiszar's class of measures designed for censored survival or reliability data. Further, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under simple and composite null hypotheses as well as under contiguous alternative hypotheses. Simulations are furnished and real data are analysed to show the performance of the proposed tests for different phi-divergence measures.", "paper_title": "Goodness-of- fit tests via phi-measures of divergence for censored data", "paper_id": "WOS:000330165200002"}
