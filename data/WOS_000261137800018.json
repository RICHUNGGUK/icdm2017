It reviews hardware-accelerated methods like pixel-precise geometric warping, radiometric compensation, multi-focal projection and the correction of general light modulation effects. Online and offline calibration as well as invisible coding methods are explained. Novel attempts in super-resolution, high-dynamic range and high-speed projection are discussed. These techniques open a variety of new applications for projection displays. Some of them will also be presented in this report.", "paper_title": "The Visual Computing of Projector-Camera Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000261137800018"}
