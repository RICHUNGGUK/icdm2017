Most of the organizations in the process of applying this technology encounter with challenges and may have failure despite of spending a lot of energy and huge investments. Therefore they need to implement a service oriented framework for governance. The organizations require a framework to assess their current status of SOA governance, determine their SOA governance requirements and then offer a suitable model for their SOA governance. The aim of this study is development of a framework for evaluating SOA governance. Data collection tool is questionnaire and in order to test the proposed framework, a sample of 16 experts in the field of SOA was included. The results confirm the proposed framework. Then in order to evaluation of the confirmed framework: it was implemented in an Iranian private bank. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
