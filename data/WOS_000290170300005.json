We used phantom data from a prototype small-animal positron emission tomography system and the methods presented here are applied to 2-D sinograms. Further, we assess the performance of the new algorithm by comparing it to the simultaneous version of algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), to expectation maximization maximum likelihood (EM-ML), ISRA, and WLS. All algorithms are compared in terms of cross-correlation coefficient, reconstruction time, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). As it turns out, ISWLS presents higher CNRs than EM-ML, ISRA, and SART for objects of different sizes. Also, ISWLS shows similar performance to WLS during the first iterations but it has better noise manipulation. Finally, ordered subsets ISWLS (OS-ISWLS), the OS version of ISWLS, shows its best performance between the first six-nine iterations. Its behavior seems to be a compromise between OS-ISRA and OS-WLS.", "paper_title": "ISWLS: Novel Algorithm for Image Reconstruction in PET", "paper_id": "WOS:000290170300005"}
