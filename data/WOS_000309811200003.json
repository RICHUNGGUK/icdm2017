The contrary claim has also been made. Unfortunately, these claims are often supported only by informal or anecdotal evidence. In order to assess these competing claims, we present a review of the literature in economics and computer science with a bearing on these issues. Our main findings from this literature survey are as follows: (1) for efficiency assessments, there is wider variance in performance of organizations using market-based control (MBC) than in organizations using centralized control (CC); (2) that MBC and CC have the same efficiency on average, which may explain the observation that (3) human and computer organizations tend to cycle between CC and decentralized control (DC) structures.", "paper_title": "Centralized vs. Market-Based and Decentralized Decision Making: A Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000309811200003"}
