In this paper we propose a new skin detection algorithm based on approximation of an image patch joint distribution, called Best-Tree distribution. A tree distribution model is more general than a bayesian network one. It can represent a joint distribution in an intuitive and efficient way. We assess the performance of our method on the Compaq database by measuring the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and its under area. These measures have proved better performances of our model than the baseline one.", "paper_title": "Probability approximation using best-tree distribution for skin detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100070"}
