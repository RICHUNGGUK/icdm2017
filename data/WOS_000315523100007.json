Basically, vision-based human action recognition is a combination of feature-tracking, descriptor-extraction and subsequent classification of image representations, with a color-based identification tool to distinguish between multiple human subjects. Simple descriptors sets were evaluated to optimize recognition rate and performance and two dimensional (2D) descriptors were found to be effective. These sets installed on the latest phones can recognize human actions in videos in less than one second with a success rate of over 82%.", "paper_title": "VISUAL-BASED HUMAN ACTION RECOGNITION ON SMART PHONES BASED ON 2D AND 3D DESCRIPTORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000315523100007"}
