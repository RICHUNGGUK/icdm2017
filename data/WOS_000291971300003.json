The study shows how evidence is referred to during weekly team meetings; this evidence is related both to scientific studies and to personal experiences of similar cases. We focus on the conversations during the meetings, on the complicated nature of the cases and on the details in the discussions that led the meeting participants to refer to scientific evidence or previous cases. We identify possibilities for improving the use of already documented information from medical records, in order to identify clinically relevant similarities and to bring additional information into the treatment discussion.", "paper_title": "References to personal experiences and scientific evidence during medical multi-disciplinary team meetings", "paper_id": "WOS:000291971300003"}
