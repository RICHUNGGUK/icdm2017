The proposed algorithm is based on a recently developed swarm intelligence technique, known as the bacterial foraging optimization (BFO). A new objective function has been derived to measure the resemblance of a candidate circle with an actual circle on the edge map of a given image based on the difference of their center locations and radii lengths. Guided by the values of this objective function (smaller means better), a set of encoded candidate circles are evolved using the BFO algorithm so that they can fit to the actual circles on the edge map of the image. The proposed method is able to detect single or multiple circles from a digital image through one shot of optimization. Simulation results over several synthetic as well as natural images with varying range of complexity validate the efficacy of the proposed technique in terms of its final accuracy, speed, and robustness.", "paper_title": "Automatic circle detection on digital images with an adaptive bacterial foraging algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000278839300002"}
