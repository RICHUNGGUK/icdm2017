Three hybrid heuristics are presented to solve the multi-depot vehicle routing problem. Each hybrid heuristic combines elements from both constructive heuristic search and improvement techniques. The improvement techniques are deterministic, stochastic and simulated annealing (SA) methods. Experiments are run on a number of randomly generated test problems of varying depots and customer sizes. Our heuristics are shown to outperform one of the best-known existing heuristic. Statistical tests of significance are performed to substantiate the claims of improvement. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
