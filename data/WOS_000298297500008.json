We also present a constant factor algorithm for approximating the optimal distortion of embedding a graph metric into an outerplanar metric. For this, we introduce a general notion of a metric relaxed minor and show that if G contains an alpha-metric relaxed H-minor, then the distortion of any embedding of G into any metric induced by a H-minor free graph is a parts per thousand yen alpha. Then, for H=K (2,3), we present an algorithm which either finds an alpha-relaxed minor, or produces an O(alpha)-embedding into an outerplanar metric.", "paper_title": "Constant Approximation Algorithms for Embedding Graph Metrics into Trees and Outerplanar Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000298297500008"}
