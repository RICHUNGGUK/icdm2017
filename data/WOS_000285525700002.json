However, many learning algorithms, which have been proposed for training neural networks with float weights, are inefficient and difficult to train for neural networks with integer weights. In this paper, a novel regeneratable dynamic differential evolution algorithm (RDDE) is presented. This algorithm is efficient for training networks with integer weights. In comparison with the conventional differential evolution algorithm (DE), RDDE has introduced three new strategies: (1) A regeneratable strategy is introduced to ensure further evolution, when all the individuals are the same after several iterations such that they cannot evolve further. In other words, there is an escape from the local minima. (2) A dynamic strategy is designed to speed up convergence and simplify the algorithm by updating its population dynamically. (3) A local greedy strategy is introduced to improve local searching ability when the population approaches the global optimal solution. In comparison with other gradient based algorithms, RDDE does not need the gradient information, which has been the main obstacle for training networks with integer weights. The experiment results show that RDDE can train integer-weight networks more efficiently.", "paper_title": "A regeneratable dynamic differential evolution algorithm for neural networks with integer weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000285525700002"}
