BSS can find an application in the context of network coding, where relaying linear combinations of packets maximizes the throughput and increases the loss immunity. By relieving the nodes from the need to send the combination coefficients, the overhead cost is largely reduced. However, the scaling ambiguity of the technique and the quasi-uniformity of compressed media sources makes it unfit, at its present state, for multimedia transmission. In order to open new practical applications for BSS in the context of multimedia transmission, we have recently proposed to use a non-linear encoding to increase the discriminating power of the classical entropy-based separation methods. Here, we propose to append to each source a non-linear message digest, which offers an overhead smaller than a per-symbol encoding and that can be more easily tuned. Our results prove that our algorithm is able to provide high decoding rates for different media types such as image, audio, and video, when the transmitted messages are less than 1.5 kilobytes, which is typically the case in a realistic transmission scenario.", "paper_title": "On a Hashing-Based Enhancement of Source Separation Algorithms Over Finite Fields With Network Coding Perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000344720300018"}
