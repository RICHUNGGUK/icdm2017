To capture the local flexural vibration modes of members, skeletal structure should be approximately modeled as frame structure. However, the topology optimization of frame structures has the characteristics of singular optimum and disjoint feasible domain. For the discrete nature of such problem, the optimum design can't be obtained by continuous search. To handle the difficulty, the automatic grouping genetic algorithm with improvements in crossover operator and penalty function is applied to optimize frame structures. Two examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Singular optimum topology of skeletal structures with frequency constraints by AGGA", "paper_id": "WOS:000303052700009"}
