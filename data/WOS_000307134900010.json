The audience, sports fans, and even professionals require more than traditional highlight extraction or semantic summarization. Computer-assisted sports tactic analysis is inevitably in urging demand. Recognizing tactic patterns in broadcast basketball video is a challenging task due to its complicated scenes, varied camera motion, frequently occlusions between players, etc. In basketball games, the action screen means that an offensive player perform a blocking move via standing beside or behind a defender for freeing a teammate to shoot, to receive a pass, or to drive in for scoring. In this paper, we propose a screen-strategy recognition system capable of detecting and classifying screen patterns in basketball video. The proposed system automatically detects the court lines for camera calibration, tracks players, and discriminates the offensive/defensive team. Player trajectories are calibrated to the real-world court model for screen pattern recognition. Our experiments on broadcast basketball videos show promising results. Furthermore, the extracted player trajectories and the recognized screen patterns visualized on a court model indeed assist the coach/players or the fans in comprehending the tactics executed in basketball games informatively and efficiently.
