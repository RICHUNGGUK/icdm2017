In this paper, the predictive capability and reliability of the RST model for turbulent flow in a tube with wavy wall is first examined. We perform a comparison between the results of RST modeling and the existing direct numerical simulation (DNS) by Maass and Schumann (1996). The numerical results, including velocity and pressure coefficients for different profiles, between RST and DNS match well. On this basis, the RST model is considered to be more accurate than other Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models and is applied to research the detailed flow and heat transfer characteristics in corrugated tubes. Detailed predictions of mean velocity, mean temperature and anisotropic Reynolds stress at different profiles in one corrugation are carried out. It is found that the corrugation structure greatly increases the velocity fluctuation intensity. In the transverse direction the velocity fluctuation intensity is larger than that in the streamwise direction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
