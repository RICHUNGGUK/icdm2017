Spectral analysis is an important method for disease detection in terms of remote sensing. In this study, an emerging spectral analysis method known as continuous wavelet analysis (CWA) was examined and compared with several conventional spectral features for the detection of yellow rust disease at a leaf level. The leaf spectral measurements were made by a spectroradiometer at both Zodaks 37 and 70 stages with a large sample size. The results showed that the wavelet features were able to capture the major spectral signatures of yellow rust, and exhibited considerable potential for disease detection at both growth stages. Both the accuracies of the univariate and multivariate models suggested that wavelet features outperformed conventional spectral features in quantifying disease severity at leaf level. Optimal accuracies returned a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.81 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.110 for pooled data at both stages. Furthermore, wavelet features showed a stronger response to the yellow rust at Zodaks 70 stage than at Zodaks 37 stage, indicating reliable estimation of disease severity can be made until the Zodaks 70 stage.
