Specifically, we focus on a low-rank formulation of the RLS, which has linear time complexity in the size of data set only, independent of both the number of classes and number of features. This makes low-rank RLS particularly suitable for problems with large data and moderate feature dimensions. Moreover, we have proposed a general theorem for obtaining the closed-form estimation of prediction values on a holdout validation set given the low-rank RLS classifier trained on the whole training data. It is thus possible to obtain an error estimate for each parameter setting without retraining and greatly accelerate the process of cross-validation for parameter selection. Experimental results on several large-scale benchmark data sets have shown that low-rank RLS achieves comparable classification performance while being much more efficient than standard kernel SVM for nonlinear classification. The improvement in efficiency is more evident for data sets with higher dimensions.", "paper_title": "Efficient nonlinear classification via low-rank regularised least squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000319769300004"}
