Numerous periodic VOD broadcasting protocols have been proposed to support a large number of receivers. Broadcasting is an efficient transmission scheme to provide on-demand service for very popular movies. This paper proposes a new broadcasting scheme called Popularity Cushion Staggered Broadcasting (PCSB). The proposed scheme improves the Periodic Broadcasting (PB) protocols in the latest mobile VOD system, which is called MobiVoD system. It also, reduces the maximum waiting time of the mobile node, by partitioning the 1st segment of the whole video and storing it in the Local Media Forwarder (LMF) exactly in the Pool of RAM (PoR), and then transmitting them when the mobile nodes miss the 1st broadcasted segment. The results show that the PCSB is more efficient and better than the all types of broadcasting and caching techniques in the MobiVoD system. Furthermore, these results exhibits that system performance is stable under high dynamics of the system and the viewer's waiting time are less than the previous system.", "paper_title": "Effective Broadcasting and Caching Technique for Video on Demand over Wireless Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000303933400009"}
