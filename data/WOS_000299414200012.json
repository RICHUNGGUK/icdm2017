Our method is demonstrated on LSFM acquisitions from live sea urchin and zebrafish embryos. The fusion results show improved overall contrast and details when compared with any of the acquired volumes. The proposed method does not need knowledge of the system's point spread function (PSF) and performs better than other existing PSF independent fusion methods. Availability and Implementation: The described method was implemented in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc., USA) and a graphic user interface was developed in Java.", "paper_title": "Wavelet-based image fusion in multi-view three-dimensional microscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000299414200012"}
