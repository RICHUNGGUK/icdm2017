This method, based on the real-time system reconfiguration, exploits the system monitoring information, along with quality parameters from the SLAs and experience from previous executions (e.g. SLA violations). The presented QoS provisioning process proposes a set of actions based on application specific policies, which are closely Coupled with particular SLAs in order to provide, in real time, the required QoS level for the application. Furthermore, a reference implementation of the proposed method is described in detail and the components that compose it, are analyzed. The aforementioned set of components was integrated in a business Grid environment and evaluated for a real application, namely 3D rendering, yielding promising results for the proposed approach.
