It will be advantageous if the parties to a dispute may know with some certainty how the case would be resolved if it were taken to court. The recent advancements in artificial neural networks may render a cost-effective technique to help to predict the outcome of construction claims, on the basis of characteristics of cases and the corresponding past court decisions. In this paper, a split-step particle swarm optimization (PSO) model is applied to train perceptrons in order to predict the outcome of construction claims in Hong Kong. It combines the advantages of global search capability of PSO algorithm in the first step and the local convergence of back-propagation algorithm in the second step. It is shown that, through a real application case, its performance is much better than the benchmark backward propagation algorithm and the conventional PSO algorithm.", "paper_title": "Prediction of construction litigation outcome using a split-step PSO algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100120"}
