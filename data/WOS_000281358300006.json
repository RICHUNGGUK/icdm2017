In consequence their understandability and evolvability are becoming a difficult task. To address this issue, we have previously defined COSA (Component-Object based Software Architecture), which is a software architecture model that describes systems as a collection of components and connectors. However, COSA has been undertaken with academic rather than commercial goals. This paper presents a modeling tool (called COSABuilder) and instantiating tool (called COSAInstantiator) for COSA metamodel and describes their various features. Our contribution is not only offering MDA-based tools but also automatic instantiation and automatic verification of software architecture specifications. The goal is to preserve architecture traceability features in the modeling space and to create accurate architectures.", "paper_title": "COSABuilder AND COSAInstantiator: AN EXTENSIBLE TOOL FOR ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000281358300006"}
