We particularly demonstrate how traditional RDBMS technology can be easily deployed to support several common digital library services. Configuration and customization of the framework to build specialized systems is supported by a wizard-like tool which is based on a generic metamodel for DLs. Such a tool implements a workflow process that segments the DL design tasks into well-defined steps and drives the designer along these steps. Both the framework and the configuration tool are evaluated in terms of several performance and usability criteria. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the feasibility and superior performance of our framework, as well as the effectiveness of the wizard tool for setting up DLs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
