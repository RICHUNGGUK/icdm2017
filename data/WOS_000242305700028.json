However, up to the present time, most mainstream image authentication schemes are still unable to detect burst bit errors. Moreover, the capability of recovering tampered pixels in detail (complex) areas has not been very satisfactory either. In this paper, we offer to combine the Hamming code technique, Torus automorphism and bit rotation technique to do tamper proofing. According to our experimental results, our new hybrid method can effectively eliminate burst bit errors, and our recovered pixels in detail areas can actually gain very high clarity. The results show that our scheme is quite a practical method, which is quite able to detect and recover tampered areas. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
