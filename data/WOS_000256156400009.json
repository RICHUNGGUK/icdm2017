This paper addresses the verification problem by proposing a stepwise application of combined refinement and verification activities in the context of synchronous model of computation. An implementation model is developed from the system model by applying pre-defined design transformations which are as follows: 1) semantic preserving or 2) nonsemantic preserving. Nonsemantic-preserving transformations introduce lower level implementation details, which are necessary to yield an efficient implementation. Our approach divides the verification tasks into two activities: 1) the local correctness of a refined block is checked by using formal verification tools and predefined properties, which are developed for each nonsemantic-preserving transformation, and 2) the global influence of the refinement to the entire system is studied through static analysis. We illustrate the design refinement and verification approach with three transformations: 1) a communication refinement mapping a synchronous channel to an asynchronous one including a handshake mechanism; 2) a computation refinement, which introduces resource sharing in a combinational computation block; and 3) a synchronization demanding refinement, where an algorithm analyzes the influence of a local refinement to the temporal properties of the entire system and restores the system's correct temporal behavior if necessary.", "paper_title": "Application and. verification of local nonsemantic-preserving transformations in system-design", "paper_id": "WOS:000256156400009"}
