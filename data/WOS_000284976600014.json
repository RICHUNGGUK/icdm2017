The method of estimation is an extension of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm from Chib (2007) and Chib et al. (2009). Contrary to conventional data augmentation strategies when dealing with missing data, the proposed algorithm augments the posterior with only a small subset of the total missing data caused by sample selection. This results in improved convergence of the MCMC chain and decreased storage costs, while maintaining tractability in the sampling densities. The methods are applied to estimate the effects of residential density on vehicle miles traveled and vehicle holdings in California.
