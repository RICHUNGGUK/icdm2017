We argue that users should be put at the center of the research work to enable user-centric multimedia access. In this paper we present the requirements for a user-centric multimedia access system in a networked home environment. These requirements are easy access to available content repositories, context awareness, content adaptation and session migration. After showing the limits of state-of-the-art technologies, we present the architecture of a system which allows unified access to the home network content, automatically delivered to rendering devices close to the user, adapted according to the rendering device constraints, and which is also capable of session mobility.", "paper_title": "User-centric universal multimedia access in home networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257384800039"}
