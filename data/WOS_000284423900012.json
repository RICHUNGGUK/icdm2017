A comparative performance analysis of chemical kernels from WRF-Chem and the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) is presented for each platform in double and single precision on coarse and fine grids. We introduce the multicore architecture parameterization that KPPA uses to generate a chemical kernel for these platforms and describe a code generation system that produces highly tuned platform-specific code. Compared to state-of-the-art serial implementations, speedups exceeding 25 x are regularly observed, with a maximum observed speedup of 41.1 x in single precision.", "paper_title": "Automatic Generation of Multicore Chemical Kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000284423900012"}
