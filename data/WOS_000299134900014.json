In this paper, a study is reported on how to generate a tool path so that the maximal angular accelerations of the rotary axes of the five-axis machine can be reduced. Two independent methods are proposed for this task: (1) by optimizing the setup of the workpiece on the machine's table, and (2) by finding better tilt and yaw angles for the tool orientations. In this paper, the setup parameters of the workpiece are incorporated into the inverse kinematic equations, and angular acceleration functions are established according to the numerical solutions of those equations. While varying the tool orientations unquestionably would affect the surface quality of the machining, we introduce the so called Domain of Geometric Constraints that will restrict the allowable tilt and yaw angle of the tool at the cutter contact points on the part surface, so to ensure the satisfaction of the requirement of both local-gouging-free and cusp-height. For the first method - finding the optimal workpiece setup - a heuristic-based approach, i.e., the Genetic Algorithm (GA), is adopted, whereas for the second method - the constrained optimization of tool orientations - we present an elaborate algorithm based on the results from the analysis conducted by the authors. At the end of the paper, computer simulation experiments are reported that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods and algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
