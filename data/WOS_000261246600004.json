The convergence to an all-Ethernet paradigm in Personal and Local Area Networks and the increasing heterogeneity found in these networks emphasizes the current and future applicability of bridging. When bridging is used, a single active spanning tree needs to be defined. A Minimum Routing Cost Tree is known to be the optimal spanning tree if the probability of communication between any pair of network nodes is the same. Given that its computation is a NP-hard problem, approximation algorithms have been proposed. We propose a new approximation Minimum Routing Cost Tree algorithm. Our algorithm has time complexity lower than the fastest known approximation algorithm and provides a spanning tree with the same routing cost in practice. In addition, it represents a better solution than the current spanning tree algorithm used in bridged networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
