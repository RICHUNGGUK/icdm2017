The method was applied to a living-donor kidney transplant data set with 109 cases and 13 predictors. This approach, followed by backward and forward selection procedures, yielded two models, one with four and another with two predictors. These models were compared to two other models, ordinarily built by backward and forward stepwise selection, which yielded, respectively, five and two predictors. After internal validation, the models performance statistics showed similar results. Likelihood ratio tests suggested that backward approach achieved a better fit than the forward modelling in both methods and the Vuong's non-nested test between backward-built models suggested that these were undistinguishable. We conclude that the tolerance distance, in combination with MCA, could be a feasible method for variable selection in logistic modelling, when there are several categorical predictors.
