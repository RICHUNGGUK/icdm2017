Base-band and harmonics termination effects are analyzed by means of a Volterra Series approach, identifying novel conditions to minimize IMD asymmetry and IM(3) power levels. The new inferred conditions do not involve base-band terminations, but harmonic load conditions. The proposed criteria are experimentally validated through harmonic load-pull measurements performed on a GaN HEMT under two-tone excitation. The resulting measurements are in agreement with the forecasted analysis results, showing an IMD asymmetry minimization, with a remarkable increase in C/I(3) of 6 dBc, without affecting the output power (34 dBm) and power added efficiency (65%) levels attained at I dB compression point.
