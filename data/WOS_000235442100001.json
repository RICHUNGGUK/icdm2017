Our scheme is based on the derivation of a rational distance map between the original curve or surface and its offset. By solving a bivariate polynomial equation for an offset curve or a system of three polynornial equations for an offset surface, all local and global self-intersection regions in offset curves or surfaces can be detected. The zero-set of polynomial equation(s) corresponds to the self-intersection regions. These regions are trimmed by projecting the zero-set into an appropriate parameter space. The projection operation simplifies the analysis of the zero-set, which makes the proposed algorithm numerically stable and efficient. Furthermore, in a post-processing step, a numerical marching method is employed, which provides a highly precise scheme for self-intersection elimination in both offset curves and surfaces. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using several experimental results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
