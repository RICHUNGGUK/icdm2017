Greedy routing is an important component of many geographic routing protocols which use a combined routing approach; a kind of recovery routing is used in case that greedy routing is impossible. In this paper, we propose the stateless extension of greedy routing called GR(k) that implements a k-bound forwarding algorithm where the parameter k controls the routing success rate and the corresponding overhead. We design three k-bound forwarding algorithms and evaluate which one is best via extensive simulation. The proposed approach improves the success rate of greedy routing by 20-40% at low node densities but in low overhead. These improvements mitigate the adverse effect of recovery routing (e.g. face routing) because the use of recovery routing is minimized; In particular, using GR(k) instead of greedy routing can reduce the number of packet transmissions up to 50%. We show that GR(k) is effective in reducing the average hop stretch in geographic routing by at most 30%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
