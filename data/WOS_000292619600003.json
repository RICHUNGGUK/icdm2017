Probabilistic model checking can evaluate performance, dependability and stability of information processing systems with random behaviors. We apply a hybrid analysis approach onto real-time distributed systems. In the hybrid analysis approach, we perform stepwise analysis using probabilistic models of target systems in different abstract levels. First, we create a probabilistic model with detailed behavior of the system (called detailed model), and apply simulation on the detailed model. Next, based on the simulation results, we create a probabilistic model in an abstract level (called simplified model). Then, we verify qualitative properties using the probabilistic model checking techniques. This prevents from state-explosion. We evaluate the validity of our approach by comparing to simulation results of NS-2 using a case study of a video data streaming system. The experiments show that the result of the proposed approach is very close to that of NS-2 simulation. The result encourages the approach is useful for the performance analysis on various domain.", "paper_title": "QoS Analysis of Real-Time Distributed Systems Based on Hybrid Analysis of Probabilistic Model Checking Technique and Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619600003"}
