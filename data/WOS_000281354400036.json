Singh, S. Jain, A fixed point theorem in Menger space through weak compatibility, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 301 (2005) 439-448] from Menger and metric spaces to cone metric spaces. We also extend the notions of compatible and weakly compatible mappings from the setting of Menger and metric spaces to the setting of cone metric spaces. We do not impose the normality property on the cone, but suppose only that the cone P, in the ordered Banach space E, has a nonempty interior. Examples are given to illustrate the results.
