It is difficult to detect and resolve conflicts because of strong and complicated conflicts among participants in this system. The traditional conflict resolution methodology which has been applied in a relatively small-scale cooperative system is inapplicable in a large-scale one. A conflict resolution methodology in a large-scale computer-supported cooperative design system is presented in this paper. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) simplifying the conflict model of a large-scale computer-supported cooperative design system in accordance with complex system theories; (2) presenting a merging conflict strategy model based on the complex system theories; (3) showing the role assignment mechanism in the merging conflict strategy system based on complex system theories.", "paper_title": "A conflict resolution methodology in a large-scale CSCD system", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800007"}
