The MB*-tree adopts a two-stage technique, i.e., clustering followed by declustering. The clustering stage iteratively groups a set of modules based on a cost metric guided by area utilization and module connectivity and at the same time establishes the geometric relations for the newly clustered modules by constructing a corresponding B*-tree for them. The declustering stage iteratively ungroups a set of the previously clustered modules (i.e., perform tree expansion) and then refines the floorplanning/placement solution by-using a simulated annealing scheme. In particular, the MB* -tree preserves the geometric relations among modules during declustering, which makes the MB*-tree an ideal data structure for the multilevel floorplanning/placement framework. Experimental results show that the MB*-tree obtains significantly better silicon area and wirelength than previous works. Further, unlike previous works, the MB* -tree scales very well as the circuit size increases.", "paper_title": "MB*-Tree: A multilevel floorplanner for large-scale building-module design", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235900007"}
