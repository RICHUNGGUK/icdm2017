To achieve the target above, we propose a risk-constrained stochastic programming decision framework. Then, we formulate a risk-constrained expected energy cost minimization problem with the uncertainties in spot price and workload. To solve the formulated problem, we use a decomposition-based cutting plane algorithm. Finally, extensive evaluations based on real-life data show the effectiveness of the proposed decision framework.", "paper_title": "Risk-Constrained Operation for Internet Data Centers in Deregulated Electricity Markets", "paper_id": "WOS:000334673200020"}
