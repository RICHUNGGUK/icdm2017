Much attention has been focused on Flickr photos and videos, for which it was found that language modeling approaches are particularly suitable. In particular, state-of-the art systems for georeferencing Flickr photos tend to cluster the locations on Earth in a relatively small set of disjoint regions, apply feature selection to identify location-relevant tags, then use a form of text classification to identify which area is most likely to contain the true location of the resource, and finally attempt to find an appropriate location within the identified area. In this paper, we present a systematic discussion of each of the aforementioned components, based on the lessons we have learned from participating in the 2010 and 2011 editions of MediaEval's Placing Task. Extensive experimental results allow us to analyze why certain methods work well on this task and show that a median error of just over 1 km can be achieved on a standard benchmark test set.
