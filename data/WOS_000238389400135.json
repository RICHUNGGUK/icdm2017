A Network Mobility(NEMO) protocol also provides the limited mobility in IPv6 networks. However, we can easily expect that the current IPv4 network will coexist with IPv6 network in the near future internet environment. So, in this paper, we propose the architecture of mobility between networks of different versions which is supported the NEMO basic protocol. This new mechanism can manage the mobility through a Tunnel Agent(TA). And the TA maintains a NEMO tunnel when a Mobile Router(MR) moves from IPv6 to IPv4 network.", "paper_title": "A service management architecture for NEMO in IPv4 and IPv6 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400135"}
