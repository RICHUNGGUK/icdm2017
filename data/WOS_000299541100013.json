In a specific case, it is of sixth-order accuracy in space. To cut down the computational labor, we adopt ADI strategy in the time direction. Moreover, for nonlinear problem, the second-order standard Strang splitting skill is used. The conservation properties and stability are analyzed for the proposed scheme. Numerical results in 2d and 3d are reported to demonstrate the new spectral-like resolution. Numerical results suggest that the proposed scheme is very efficient and accurate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
