In current solutions, it is generally the client that must first select a datacenter to forward the request to before an internal load-balancer of the selected datacenter can select the optimal instance. An optimal selection requires knowledge of both network and server characteristics, making clients less suitable to make this decision. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) research solved a similar selection problem for static data retrieval by integrating content delivery as a native network feature. We address the selection problem for services by extending the ICN-principles for services. In this paper we present Queue and Latency, a network-driven service selection algorithm which maps user demand to service instances, taking into account both network and server metrics. To reduce the size of service router forwarding tables, we present a statistical method to approximate an optimal load distribution with minimized router state required. Simulation results show that our statistical routing approach approximates the average system response time of source-based routing with minimized state in forwarding tables.", "paper_title": "QuLa: Queue and Latency-Aware Service Selection and Routing in Service-Centric Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000358260700012"}
