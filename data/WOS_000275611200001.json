In this field document clustering plays an important role and remains an interesting and challenging problem in the field of web computing. In this paper we present a document clustering method, which takes into account both contents information and hyperlink structure of web page collection, where a document is viewed as a set of semantic units. We exploit this representation to determine the strength of a relation between two linked pages and to define a relational clustering algorithm based on a probabilistic graph representation. The experimental results show that the proposed approach, called RED-clustering, outperforms two of the most well known clustering algorithm as k-Means and Expectation Maximization.
