A robust scheme is proposed to obtain the optimal linear transmit/receive filters in the sense of minimizing the average sum mean square error (SMSE) conditional on noisy channel estimates under a per-user transmit power constraint. Using an iterative procedure, the proposed scheme extends the existing optimization algorithm for uncorrelated single-user MIMO systems with perfect CSI to solve the problem of minimizing SMSE in spatially correlated MIMO downlinks with imperfect CSI. Comparing with non-robust scheme, we show that robust scheme efficiently mitigates the BER loss induced by imperfect CSI. In addition, the impact of fading correlation at BS on the performance of the proposed robust scheme is analyzed.", "paper_title": "Robust linear transmit/receive processing for correlated MIMO downlink with imperfect CSI", "paper_id": "WOS:000259767300046"}
