Although vertical MDS codes exhibit better load balancing compared to horizontal MDS codes in partial stripes, an I/O unbalancing problem still exists in some vertical codes. To address this issue, we propose a novel efficient data layout, uniform P-code (UPC), to support highly balanced I/Os among P-coded disk arrays (i.e., PC). In UPC, the nonuniformly distributed information symbols in each parity chain of P-code are moved along their columns to other rows, thus enabling the parity chain to keep original parity relationships and tolerate double disk failures. The UPC scheme not only achieves optimal storage efficiency, computational complexity, and update complexity, but also supports better I/O balancing in the context of large-scale storage systems. We also conduct a performance study on reconstruction algorithms using an analytical model. Besides extensive theoretical analysis, comparative performance experiments are conducted by replaying real-world workloads under various configurations. Experimental results illustrate that our UPC scheme significantly outperforms the PC scheme in terms of average user response time. In particular, in the case of a 12-disk array, the UPC scheme can improve the access performance of the RAID-6 storage system by 29.9% compared to the PC scheme.", "paper_title": "An efficient data layout scheme for better I/O balancing in RAID-6 storage systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000354389500001"}
