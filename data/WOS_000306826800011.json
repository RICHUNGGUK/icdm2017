The availability of portable devices, such as smartphones, has been extended over the recent years and has contributed to growing adaptation of SQLite. This implies a high likelihood of digital evidences acquired during forensic investigations to include SQLite database files. Where intentional deletion of sensitive data can be made by a suspect, forensic investigators need to recover deleted records in SQLite at the best possible. This study analyzes data management rules used by SQLite and the structure of deleted data in the system and in turn suggests a recovery tool of deleted data. Further, the study examines major SQLite suited software as it validates feasible possibility of deleted data recovery.", "paper_title": "A recovery method of deleted record for SQLite database", "paper_id": "WOS:000306826800011"}
