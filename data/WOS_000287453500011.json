A linear or quadratic transformation maps data into a new space for better classification, if the transformation method is properly guessed. This new CFS space can be of high or low dimensionality, and the number of dimensions is generally low, and it is equal to the number of classes. The CFS method is based on fitting a hyperplane or curve to the learning data or enclosing them into a hypersurface. In the proposed method, the hyperplanes, curves, or cortex become the axis of the new space. In the new space, a linear support vector machine multi-class classifier is applied to classify the learn data.", "paper_title": "Curve fitting space for classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000287453500011"}
