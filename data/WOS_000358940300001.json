We give a theoretical proof for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to a unique minimum. The proposed method is motivated by the Weiszfeld algorithm, an extremely simple and rapid averaging algorithm, that finds the mean of a set of given points in a Euclidean space. The proposed algorithm is applied to the triangulation problem in computer vision by finding the -closest-point to a set of lines in 3D. Our experimental results for the triangulation problem confirm that the -closest-point method, for , is more robust to outliers than the -closest-point method.", "paper_title": "L-q-Closest-Point to Affine Subspaces Using the Generalized Weiszfeld Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000358940300001"}
