This can have huge security implications. The present article surveys the most important technical security challenges of RFID systems. We first provide a brief summary of the most relevant standards related to this technology. Next, we present an overview about the state of the art on RFID security, addressing both the functional aspects and the security risks and threats associated to its use. Finally, we analyze the main security solutions proposed until date.", "paper_title": "RFID systems: A survey on security threats and proposed solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241592200014"}
