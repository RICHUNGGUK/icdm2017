The turbulence statistics shows the three dimensional nature of the flow with and without the presence of side walls. The presence of side wall neither makes the flow field two dimensional, nor suppresses three dimensional disturbances. However, the comparison of shear layer growth rate and wall pressures reveal a better match with the two dimensional simulation results. This better match is explained on the basis of formation of oblique structures due to the presence of side walls which also suppress the distribution of momentum in third direction making the pressures to be higher as compared with the case without side walls.
