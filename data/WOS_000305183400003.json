The governing dimensionless problems were computed by using the homotopy analysis approach. Convergence of the derived solutions was checked and the influence of embedded parameters was analyzed by plotting graphs. It was noticed that the velocity increases with an increase in the Deborah number. Furthermore, it was found that the temperature is also an increasing function of the Biot number. We further found that for fixed values of other parameters, the local Nusselt number increases by increasing the suction parameter and Deborah number. Numerical values of the skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt numbers were computed and examined.
