We identify a common set of steps that are usually considered across all these approaches and frame our descriptions according to them, providing a unified view of how each approach tackles the different problems that appear during the semantic association process. Furthermore, we provide some recommendations on (a) how and when to use each of the approaches according to the characteristics of the data source, and (b) how to improve results by leveraging the strengths of the different approaches.", "paper_title": "Review of the state of the art: discovering and associating semantics to tags in folksonomies", "paper_id": "WOS:000300561400003"}
