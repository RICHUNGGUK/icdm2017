Extracting users' preferences through their buying behavior and history of purchased products is the most important element of such systems. Due to users' unlimited and unpredictable desires, identifying their preferences is very complicated process. In most researches, less attention has been paid to user's preferences varieties in different product categories. This may decrease quality of recommended items. In this paper, we introduced a technique of recommendation in the context of online retail store which extracts user preferences in each product category separately and provides more personalized recommendations through employing product taxonomy, attributes of product categories, web usage mining and combination of two well-known filtering methods: collaborative and content-based filtering. Experimental results show that proposed technique improves quality, as compared to similar approaches. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
