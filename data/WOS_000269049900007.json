The proof system is entanglement-resistant (i.e., its soundness is robust against provers who have prior shared entanglement), it has one round of interaction, the provers' answers are single bits, and the completeness-soundness gap is constant (formally, NP subset of circle plus MIP*(1-epsilon) (1) (2+epsilon) [2], for any e such that 0 < epsilon < 1 4). Our result is based on the \"oracularizing\" property of a particular private information retrieval scheme (PIR), and it suggests that investigating related properties of other PIRs might bear further fruit.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT-RESISTANT TWO-PROVER INTERACTIVE PROOF SYSTEMS AND NON-ADAPTIVE PIR'S", "paper_id": "WOS:000269049900007"}
