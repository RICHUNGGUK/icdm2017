Meta-data can be discrete, real- or vector-valued Our approach builds on the Implicit Shape Model of Leibe and Schiele [B. Leibe, A Leonardis, B Schiele, Robust object detection with interleaved categorization and segmentation, International journal of computer Vision 77 (1-3) (2008) 259-289], and extends it to transfer annotations from training images to test images We focus on the inference of approximative 3D shape information about objects in a single 2D image. In experiments, we illustrate how our method can infer depth maps, surface normals and part labels for previously unseen object instances (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
