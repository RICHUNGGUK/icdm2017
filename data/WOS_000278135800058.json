One way to achieve this is by local shape exaggeration in rendering. In this paper, we present an interactive scheme for controllable local shape exaggeration. Our approach achieves local, direct, and consistent appearance enhancement by modifying the surface orientation in an intuitive and globally optimized manner with sparse user-specified constraints. Compared with previous approaches, the main contribution of this paper is the introduction of adaptive exaggeration function (AEF), which is capable of modulating the extent of detail enhancement to obtain a satisfactory shape exaggeration result. The AEF model is derived based on a series of experiments. We complement our new approach with a variety of examples, user studies, and provide comparisons with recent approaches.", "paper_title": "Perceptually-motivated shape exaggeration", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800058"}
