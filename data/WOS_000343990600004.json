The Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a circuit-like service that is widely deployed owing to its security merits and the resource constraints of mobile devices. However, VDI requires a high and guaranteed virtually constant wireless data rate. Thus, we focus on the problems that have to be resolved in order for IEEE802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) to support a guaranteed wireless data rate and also enable it to offer optimized and maximized data rate support for mobile cloud services. We also consider a virtual machine (VM) migration scheme that is tightly coupled to mobile networks and can minimize the user's service delay and reduce the bandwidth requirements of the wired network. We then present a consistent control framework by extending the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) control framework to provide a single integrated control framework for cloud computing and Future Internet compatibility. Finally, we develop an experimental testbed using a mobile cloud computing environment and evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. We show that the proposed method can enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE) of mobile cloud computing services with increased data rate support and a single consistent control framework that is compatible with the GENI-based Future Internet architecture. The results of evaluations conducted indicate that our proposed method provides 24%-41% better data rate compared to conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Seamless QoE Support for Mobile Cloud Services Using IEEE802.21 MIH and the GENI Future Internet Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000343990600004"}
