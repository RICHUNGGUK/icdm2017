In order to test their performance thoroughly, we use two real-world databases containing 692 cases and 322 cases collected by a single observer and 19 observers, respectively. The results show that, in general, there are considerable differences in all tests (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PV+, PV- and ROC) when a specific classifier uses the single-observer dataset compared to those when this same classifier uses the multiple-observer dataset. These results suggest that different observers see different things: a problem known as interobserver variability. We graphically unveil such a problem by presenting the structures of the decision trees and Bayesian networks resultant from running both databases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
