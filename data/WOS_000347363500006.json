The diameter of an uncertain graph is essentially an uncertain variable, which indicates the suitability for investigation of its distribution function. The main focus of this paper is to propose an algorithm to determine the distribution function of the diameter of an uncertain graph. We first discuss the characteristics of the uncertain diameter, and the distribution function is derived. An efficient algorithm is designed based on Floyd's algorithm. Further, some numerical examples are illustrated to show the efficiency and application of the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
