As an example, the conversion matrix, computed from a harmonic balance simulation, is used to control the stability of oscillators under large-signal conditions. This allows the suppression of possible spurious frequencies or the intentional generation of spurious signals (e.g. at subharmonic Frequency). 0 2010 Wiley Periodicals.
