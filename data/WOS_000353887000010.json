Existing PIR schemes are impractical because of the expensive cost for complete privacy. In this paper, we propose a flexible, distributed scheme for PIR. First, a new protocol row-based computational PIR (Robac-PIR) is designed to make a trade-off between privacy and efficiency. Second, we apply Robac-PIR in a distributed system to further lower the computational cost. We implement the scheme, and the results show it has a good performance and can also provide the trade-off.
