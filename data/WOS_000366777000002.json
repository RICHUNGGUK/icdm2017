The presentation is carefully tuned in order to realize an isomorphism between the two systems: every single rewriting step on the calculus maps to a single step on proof nets, and vice-versa. In this way, we obtain an algebraic reformulation of proof nets. Moreover, we provide a simple correctness criterion for our proof nets, which employ boxes in an unusual way, and identify a subcalculus that is shown to be as expressive as the full calculus.
