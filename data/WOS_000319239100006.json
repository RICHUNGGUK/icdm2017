This assumption enables a fast and direct simulation of construction stages by analyzing independent Finite Element Models when time-dependent phenomena are neglected. The computational speed and the limited computer storing requirements of the DA make it especially indicated for optimization problems. Furthermore, it can be implemented in any structural analysis software. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
