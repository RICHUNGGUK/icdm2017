Specifically we prove that the problem of finding fuzzy images or signals that remain invariant under a fuzzy morphological opening or under a fuzzy morphological closing, is equal to the problem of finding the L-fuzzy concepts of some L-fuzzy context. Moreover, since the Formal Concept Analysis and the Mathematical Morphology are the particular cases of the fuzzy ones, the showed result has also an interpretation for binary images or signals.", "paper_title": "Application of the L-fuzzy concept analysis in the morphological image and signal processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000342438500007"}
