Taylor distinguished six top-level criteria that mattered most to human actors when using IS/IT artifacts. We develop this approach further and present the TEDS framework as an analytical instrument for actor- and utilization-specific evaluation of IS/IT artifacts as well as a practical tool for moderating and formulating design specifications. We use the empirical case of a comprehensive comparative professional sports team web site evaluation project to illustrate the power and versatility of the extended analytical framework.", "paper_title": "The TEDS Framework for Assessing Information Systems From a Human Actors' Perspective: Extending and Repurposing Taylor's Value-Added Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000288525000014"}
