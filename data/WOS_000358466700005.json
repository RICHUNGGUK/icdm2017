However that intuition has been shown to impair good recommendations as demonstrated by some well-known results in the stochastic optimization literature. Our work on multiattribute ranking and selection procedures demonstrates that Pareto and constraint-based approaches could be used as part of a successful decision process; but a tradeoff-based approach, like multiattribute utility theory, is required to identify the true best system in all but a few special cases. We show that there is no guaranteed strategic equivalence between utility theory and constraint-based approaches when constraints on the means of the performance measures are used in the latter. Hence, a choice must be made as to which is appropriate. In this paper, we extend well-known results in the decision analysis literature to ranking and selection.", "paper_title": "Using multiattribute utility theory to avoid bad outcomes by focusing on the best systems in ranking and selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000358466700005"}
