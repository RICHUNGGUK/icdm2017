Therefore, it would be wise to utilize the effort already invested in existing paths. This paper proposes an efficient way to reuse, whenever possible, existing paths when a new path is being established. In our proposed algorithm, called Route Reutilization Routing (RRR), the reusability is accomplished by the notion of the dynamic proactive zones (DPZ), through which nearby existing path information is disseminated. By utilizing the information stored in DPZs, RRR can achieve considerable savings over other on-demand routing algorithms that use flooding. The unique feature of the proposed algorithm is that DPZs are created and destroyed dynamically around the existing paths, whereas proactive zones are formed around the nodes throughout the network in other route finding algorithms. Even though using DPZs may not result in the shortest path between source and destination, simulation results show the considerable reduction in traffic needed to find a path and therefore increases the available bandwidth for data transmission.", "paper_title": "Route Reutilization Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279378300001"}
