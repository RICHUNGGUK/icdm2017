By combining the time-dependent Lyapunov functional approach and convex combination technique, a criterion is derived to ensure the exponential stability of the error dynamics, which fully utilizes the available information about the actual sampling pattern. Based on the derived condition, the design method of the desired sampled-data controllers is proposed to make the CDNs exponentially synchronized and obtain a lower-bound estimation of the largest sampling interval. Simulation examples demonstrate that the presented method can significantly reduce the conservatism of the existing results, and lead to wider applications.", "paper_title": "Sampled-Data Exponential Synchronization of Complex Dynamical Networks With Time-Varying Coupling Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000322039500001"}
