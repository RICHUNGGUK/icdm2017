Then every vertex is associated with a 'pallet' of incident colours together with their frequencies, which sum up to the degree of upsilon. We say that two vertices have distinct pallets if they differ in frequency of at least one colour. This is always the case if these vertices have distinct degrees. We consider an apparently the worse case, when is regular. Suppose further that this coloured graph is being examined by a person who cannot name any given colour, but distinguishes one from another. Could we colour the edges of so that a person suffering from such colour-blindness is certain that colour pallets of every two adjacent vertices are distinct? Using the Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma, we prove that it is possible using 15 colours for every d-regular graph with d >= 960.", "paper_title": "On colour-blind distinguishing colour pallets in regular graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000338539000003"}
