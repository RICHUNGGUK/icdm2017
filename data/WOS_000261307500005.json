An enhanced radial basis function network (RBFN) is used to compute the sensitivities of the voltage stability margin with respect to the generator outputs. The sensitivities are used in formulating the linearized voltage stability constraints in the optimization procedure. Optimum generator outputs are determined to enhance voltage stability margin for multiple contingencies. Case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
