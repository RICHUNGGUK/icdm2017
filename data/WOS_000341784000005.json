Design/methodology/approach - Partial least squares is used to analyze a sample of 176 manufacturers in China. Findings - TMS and IT are two vital enablers of SCI and have different roles in improving SCI. In addition, SI has a significant effect on business performance, and CI has a marginally significant effect. Originality/value - Based on the RBV/ERBV, this study explores the enablers of SCI and their effects on business performance, ultimately contributing to both SCI theories and practices.", "paper_title": "Relationships between intra-organizational resources, supply chain integration and business performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000341784000005"}
