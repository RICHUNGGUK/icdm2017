The crista surface has the form of a saddle, or a pair of saddles separated by a crux, depending on the species and the canal considered. In birds, it was described as a catenoid by Landolt et al. (J Comp Neurol 159(2):257-287, doi: 10.1002/cne.901590207, 1972). In the present work, we establish that this particular form results from principles of invariance maximization and energy minimization. The formulation of the invariance principle was inspired by Takumida (Biol Sci Space 15(4):356-358, 2001). More precisely, we suppose that in functional conditions, the equations of linear elasticity are valid, and we assume that in a certain domain of the cupula, in proximity of the crista surface, (1) the stress tensor of the deformed cupula is invariant under the gradient of the pressure, (2) the dissipation of energy is minimum. Then, we deduce that in this domain the crista surface is a minimal surface and that it must be either a planar, or helicoidal Scherk surface, or a piece of catenoid, which is the unique minimal surface of revolution. If we add the hypothesis that the direction of invariance of the stress tensor is unique and that a bilateral symmetry of the crista exists, only the catenoid subsists. This finding has important consequences for further functional modeling of the role of the vestibular system in head motion detection and spatial orientation.", "paper_title": "Crista egregia: a geometrical model of the crista ampullaris, a sensory surface that detects head rotations", "paper_id": "WOS:000349405800002"}
