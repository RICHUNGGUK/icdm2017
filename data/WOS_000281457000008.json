They should be secure as well as efficient. Nowadays physical attacks such as side channel analysis or fault attacks become big threats in the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. In this article, we propose two new fault attacks using Jacobi symbol. Furthermore we show that Joye's regular right-to-left algorithms are vulnerable to them. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
