Load balancing aims at utilizing the resources efficiently, maximizing the throughput, and minimizing the request rejection rate. The peer-service area is the recent architecture for IPTV delivery networks that overcomes the flaws of the previous architectures. However, it still suffers from the load imbalance problem. This paper investigates the load imbalance problem, and tries to augment the peer-service area architecture to overcome this problem. To achieve the load balancing over the proposed architecture, we suggest a new load-balancing algorithm that considers both the expected and the current load of both contents and servers. The proposed load-balancing algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage is the contents replication according to their expected load, while the second stage is the content-aware request distribution. To test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we have compared it with both the traditional Round Robin algorithm and Cho algorithm. The experimental results depict that the proposed algorithm outperforms the two other algorithms in terms of load balance, throughput, and request rejection rate.", "paper_title": "Predictive and content-aware load balancing algorithm for peer-service area based IPTV networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500027"}
