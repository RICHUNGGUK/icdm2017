By extracting a Markov process from the queue size process and applying the BASTA property, we derive simple recursive formulae for the stationary distributions of the queue size and the waiting time. These formulae are simple, numerically stable and transform-free. A stochastic decomposition property is given for the stationary waiting time, and relations between the distributions of the stationary queue size and the stationary waiting time are discussed. Numerical examples are given for stationary distributions of the queue size and the waiting time for various DAR(1) inputs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
