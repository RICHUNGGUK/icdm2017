In this paper, we propose a natural and simple random model for generating scale free interval graphs. The model generates a set of intervals randomly under a certain distribution, which defines a random interval graph. The main advantage of the model is its simpleness. The structure/properties of generated graphs are analyzable by relatively simple probabilistic and/or combinatorial arguments, which is different from many other models. Based on such arguments, we show for our random interval graph that its degree distribution follows a power law, and that it has a large average clustering coefficient. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
