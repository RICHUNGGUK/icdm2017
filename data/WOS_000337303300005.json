For production of magnetic water, three devices including an AFM called device(made in UAE), a device marked AC(made in Germany) and finally a device was designed and made in Concrete Laboratory of Sahand University of Technology) have been used. The results show that, intensity and direction of magnetic field, velocity and time of water passing through magnetic device, and amount and type of Colloidal particles have direct effects on properties of magnetic water and using such a water in making cement paste, increases its fluidity and compressive strength up to 10%.", "paper_title": "An investigation of water magnetization and its influence on some concrete specificities like fluidity and compressive strength", "paper_id": "WOS:000337303300005"}
