The predominant method used in these domains is based on statistical sampling. When full search is required, EXPECTIMAX is often the algorithm of choice. However, EXPECTIMAX is a full-width search algorithm. A class of algorithms were developed by Bruce Ballard to improve on EXPECTIMAX'S runtime. They allow for cutoffs in trees with chance nodes similar to how ALPHA-BETA allows for cutoffs in MINIMAX trees. These algorithms were published in 1983-and then apparently forgotten.
