The problem is known to be strongly NP-hard. A two-phase heuristic is developed to solve the problem. Phase I of the heuristic transforms the problem into a no-wait flow shop problem and solves it using the well known Gilmore and Gomory algorithm. Phase 2 of the heuristic improves the solution obtained in phase I using a simple tabu search algorithm. Computational results show that the proposed heuristic performs extremely well in terms of both solution quality and computation time. It finds an optimal solution to about 90% of the problem instances and the average deviation from the lower bond for the other problem instances is infinitesimal. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
