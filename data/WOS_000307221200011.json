The purpose of the presented method could be a part of a high-voltage course for M.Sc. students in electrical engineering departments and a train for junior engineers in industry. The article shows how to simulate the components of testing circuit and transformer to teach them the test. Evaluation of the simulations with 20 students and 20 junior engineers was very positive in terms of their developing confidence and understanding short-circuit withstand test on power transformers.
