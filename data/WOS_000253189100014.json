Applying the fixed point theorem due to Avery and Peterson, we study the existence of at least three symmetric positive solutions to the above boundary value problem. The interesting point is that the nonlinear term f contains the first-order derivative explicitly and the boundary condition is of Sturm-Liouville type. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
