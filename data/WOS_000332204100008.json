The target plant is described by a set of uncertain difference equations with both discrete-time and infinite distributed delays, where two random variables are introduced to account for the randomly occurring nonlinearities. The sensor measurement outputs are subject to randomly occurring sensor saturations due to the physical limitations of the sensors. Through available output measurements from each individual sensor and its neighboring sensors, this paper aims to design distributed state estimators to approximate the states of the target plant in a distributed way. Sufficient conditions are presented which not only guarantee the estimation error systems to be globally asymptotically stable in the mean square sense but also ensure the existence of the desired estimator gains.", "paper_title": "Distributed state estimation for uncertain sensor networks with mixed time delays subject to sensor saturations", "paper_id": "WOS:000332204100008"}
