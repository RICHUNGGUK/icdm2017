In order to ensure valid data access, the cache consistency must be maintained properly. However, this problem has not been sufficiently studied in mobile computing environments, especially those with ad hoc networks. There are two essential issues in cache consistency maintenance: consistency control initiation and data update propagation. Consistency control initiation not only decides the cache consistency provided to the users, but also impacts the consistency maintenance cost. This issue becomes more challenging in asynchronous and fully distributed ad hoc networks. To this end, we propose the predictive consistency control initiation (PCCI) algorithm, which adaptively initiates consistency control based on its online predictions of forthcoming data updates and cache queries. In order to efficiently propagate data updates through multi-hop wireless connections, the hierarchical data update propagation (HDUP) algorithm is proposed. Theoretical analysis shows that cooperation among the caching nodes facilitates data update propagation. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate performance of both PCCI and HDUP. Evaluation results show that PCCI cost-effectively initiates consistency control even when faced with dynamic changes in data update rate, cache query rate, node speed, and number of caching nodes. The evaluation results also show that HDUP saves cost for data update propagation by up to 66%.
