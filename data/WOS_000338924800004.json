Topology aggregation is a method used to facilitate this limited information exchange. The amount of information provided for each domain may vary based on the technical and management decisions taken by the service provider. For instance, some domains may choose to provide only a single shortest path between two border nodes, while another may be able to provide a pair of disjoint paths with minimum total cost. In such cases, end-to-end protected path routing needs to facilitate and use different amounts of domain information provided by domain service providers in order to find the best solution. In this work, we propose several approaches that help find a pair of disjoint end-to-end paths that may traverse multiple domains from source to destination and result in minimum total cost. These approaches include methods for inter-domain information exchange that carry costs of disjoint paths within a domain. The performance of minimizing the total cost of a pair of end-to-end paths is investigated. Finally, the blocking probabilities of these various approaches due to the existence of trap topologies in the network are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Survivable Inter-Domain Routing Based on Topology Aggregation With Intra-Domain Disjointness Information in Multi-Domain Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000338924800004"}
