The nonlinear behavior of the material is modelled with a continuum non-local and isotropic damage model. While the material's behavior is linear elastic, a pure hybrid-displacement Trefftz formulation is adopted. From the point where the concrete assumes a nonlinear behavior, this approach degenerates into a hybrid-displacement formulation. The computational performance is tested by means of two numerical examples which show that the proposed model predicts correctly the global behavior of the structures.
