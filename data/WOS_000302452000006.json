However, because of the lack of central authority, building trust among all nodes contained in a self-organized network would become more difficult. In this paper, we propose a universal reputation system and make it reliable, lie-tolerant and DoS immunity through multidimensional reputation model, adapted discounting algorithm, recommendation game, secure reputation protocol and fault-tolerant framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate its robustness and high efficiency through example and simulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
