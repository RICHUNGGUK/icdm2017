Three inner bounds for the discrete memoryless ICR are proposed, based on three coding strategies that employ layered code at the relay. The first scheme is inspired by layered noisy network coding, proposed by Lim et al. for the two-way relay channel, the second and the third schemes rely on simpler encoding and decoding processes, dubbed layered quantize-forward. Performance of the proposed schemes is investigated for two classes of channels with Gaussian noise: the interference channel with in-band relay reception/out-of-band relay transmission and the interference with in-band relay reception/in-band relay transmission. For the former class of channels, it is shown that the first proposed scheme achieves the same inner bound as the generalized hash-forward scheme with incremental binning. In addition, the inner bound is within 0.5 bit of the capacity region under certain conditions on the channel parameters. For the latter class of channels, new upper bounds on sum-rate are established by extending known upper bounds for symmetric channels. The first inner bound is shown to be within 0.5 bit of the capacity region if the relay's power exceeds a certain threshold, which depends on channel parameters. Numerical examples show that the proposed schemes can achieve significantly higher sum-rates when compared with other compress-forward schemes. Analysis also reveals a tradeoff between achievable rates, coding delay, and complexity of the proposed schemes. Results in this paper provide a better understanding of coding for the ICR, in particular, they show that layered coding is a beneficial element in multiuser networks with relays.", "paper_title": "Layered Coding for the Interference Channel With a Relay", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900024"}
