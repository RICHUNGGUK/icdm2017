This study used seed words, Chinese morphemes, which are mono-syllabic characters that function as individual words or be combined to create Chinese words and phrases, to classify movie reviews found on Yahoo! Taiwan. We utilized higher Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) collocations, which consist of selected morpheme-level compounded features to build classifiers. The contributions of this study include the following: (Bird 2006) proposing a method of generating domain-dependent Chinese morphemes directly from large data set without any predefined sentimental resources; (Bradley and Lang 1999) building morpheme-based classifiers applicable in various movie genres, and shown to produce better results than other classifiers based on keywords (NTUSD and HowNet) or feature selection (TFIDF); (Church and Hanks in Computational linguistics, 16(1), 22-29 1990) identifying compounds that have different semantic polarities depending on contexts.", "paper_title": "Sentiment analysis for Chinese reviews of movies in multi-genre based on morpheme-based features and collocations", "paper_id": "WOS:000365415000011"}
