As an example of its application, we develop new infeasible-start IPM for the linear conic optimization problem. In our setting, the primal and dual cones need not to be self-dual. We can start from any primal-dual point in the interior of the cones. Then, the damped Newton's method can be used for obtaining an approximate solution for the strictly feasible case, or for detecting primal/dual infeasibility. The complexity of these cases depends on the Hessian distance between the starting point and the feasibility/infeasibility certificates. We also present some numerical results.", "paper_title": "Hessian distances and their applications in the complexity analysis of interior-point methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000320093700011"}
