Through the diversity of its functions, it is quite difficult to find new drugs, which bind to calmodulin as a target. We present available structural information on the protein, obtained by X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular modeling and try to derive some conclusions on structure-activity relationships.", "paper_title": "Calmodulin in Complex with Proteins and Small Molecule Ligands: Operating with the Element of Surprise; Implications for Structure-Based Drug Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000272085700004"}
