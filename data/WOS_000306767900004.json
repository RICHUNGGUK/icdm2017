It is an unsupervised learning which has both visualization and clustering properties. In general, the SOM neural network is constructed as a learning algorithm for numeric (vector) data. Although there are different SOM clustering methods for numeric data with real applications in the literature, there is less consideration in a SOM clustering for symbolic data. In this paper, we modify the SOM so that it can treat symbolic data and a so-called symbolic SOM (S-SOM) is then proposed. We first use novel structures to represent symbolic neurons. We then use a suppression concept to create a learning rule for neurons. Therefore, the S-SOM is created for treating symbolic data by embedding the novel structure and the suppression learning rule. Some real data sets are applied with the S-SOM. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed S-SOM in these real applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
