In contrast to classical morphing approaches, SFE CONCEPT allows for larger geometrical modifications via an implicit parameterisation technique. This is advantageous in particular in the early design phases where different design alternatives are investigated and the optimal and robust geometry needs to be identified. As a first example, the front rail of a standard passenger car is optimised here. This is - as one of the main parts of the body in white - an appropriate example for exploration of optimisation methods. The performance of a classical optimisation approach is analysed and complemented by a robustness analysis where uncertainties in shape parameters are considered.", "paper_title": "Shape optimisation for crashworthiness followed by a robustness analysis with respect to shape variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000322342300010"}
