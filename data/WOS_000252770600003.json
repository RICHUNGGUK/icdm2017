TFT LCD display was exposed to harmonic vibration with acceleration amplitudes up to 200 m/s(2) and frequency sweep in the range between 40 Hz and 1.5 kHz. The display was mounted on a shaker in three different positions: landscape, portrait, and face-up. Colorimetric measurements were taken during and after the loading. Euclidian distance in the CIE Lab color space was used as measure of color change due to the loading. The results show that color gamut tends to narrow when increasing the acceleration amplitude. In practical terms however the color change is barely perceptible. In most cases the color changes disappear within 5 h after the stop of the loading. Micro- and macroscopic examination of the LCD was performed to establish an indication of the cause of color change. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
