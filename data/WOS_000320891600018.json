Network mobility is particularly suitable for vehicles because it considers the mobility of an entire network. Vehicles perform handover frequently thus efficient handover is essential to meet the QoS requirements for real-time communications. For high-velocity vehicles, the time constraint is even stricter and the Doppler Effect increases the transmission error rate that both add challenges in mobility management. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer hierarchical network mobility framework called Hi-NEMO for all-IP networks. The advantage of Hi-NEMO is no extra triangular route between a mobile network node and the correspondent node. The design is resilient to error-prone transmission, and protocol-supports fast QoS provisioning in the network mobility service domain. Intensive simulation results demonstrate that Hi-NEMO reduces handover latency as well as packet loss, and supports handover requirements in high-velocity vehicles.", "paper_title": "Protocol and architecture supports for network mobility with QoS-handover for high-velocity vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000320891600018"}
