In this paper, we consider a coarse classification method based on fused least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalization. By adopting fused LASSO, one can deal continuous as well as discrete variables in a unified framework. For computational efficiency, we develop a penalization path algorithm. Through numerical examples, we compare the performances of fused LASSO and LASSO with dummy variable coding.", "paper_title": "Fused least absolute shrinkage and selection operator for credit scoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000353463500001"}
