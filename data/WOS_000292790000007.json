Our approach is based on the multiscale LATIN method with domain decomposition. Here we propose to take advantage of the capability of the LATIN method to reuse the solution of a given problem in order to solve many similar problems. We firstly introduce the LATIN method and compare our approach to different strategies commonly used to solve contact problems. Then, we illustrate the capabilities of our method through two examples. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
