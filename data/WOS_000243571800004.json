For the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm we present the maximal subproblem that can be solved without entanglement, and show that the algorithm still has an advantage over the classical ones. We further show that this subproblem is of greater significance, by proving that it contains all the Boolean functions whose quantum phase-oracle is non-entangling. For Simon's and Grover's algorithms we provide simple proofs that no non-trivial subproblems can be solved by these algorithms without entanglement.", "paper_title": "Quantum advantage without entanglement", "paper_id": "WOS:000243571800004"}
