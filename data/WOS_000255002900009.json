In order to address the adverse effect of outliers, a robust version of the Edgeworth expansion is adopted, in terms of robust cumulants, and robust derivatives of the Hermite polynomials are used. Also, a new constrained version of ICA is introduced, based on goal programming of mutual information objectives, which is applied to the extraction of the antepartum fetal electrocardiogram from multielectrode cutaneous recordings on the mother's thorax and abdomen.", "paper_title": "Sequential fixed-point ICA based on mutual information minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000255002900009"}
