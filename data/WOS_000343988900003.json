In this article, we will suggest a new Strategic Risk Reduction technique for producing optimal risk reduction strategies; which reduce risk exposure for expected income by allowing several countermeasures per risk rather than one countermeasure as previous works did. Our Strategic Risk Reduction will be optimized using Ant Colony Optimization approach.", "paper_title": "A New Strategic Risk Reduction For Risk Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000343988900003"}
