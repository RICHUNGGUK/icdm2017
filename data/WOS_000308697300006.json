An infinite binary sequence X is computably random if no recursive martingale (strategy) can win an infinite amount of money by betting on the values of the bits of X. In the classical model, the martingales considered are real-valued, that is, the bets made by the martingale can be arbitrary real numbers. In this paper, we investigate a more restricted model, where only integer-valued martingales are considered, and we study the class of random sequences induced by this model.", "paper_title": "How Powerful Are Integer-Valued Martingales?", "paper_id": "WOS:000308697300006"}
