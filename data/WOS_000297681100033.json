In this work, we present a novel approach for creating a fantastic collage artform, namely Arcimboldo-like collage, which represents an input image with multiple thematically-related cutouts from the filtered Internet images. Due to the massive data of Internet images, competent image cutouts can almost always be discovered to match the segmented components of the input image. The selected cutouts are purposefully arranged such that as a whole assembly, they can represent the input image with disguise in both shape and color; but separately, individual cutout is still recognizable as its own being. Experimental results and user study show that our algorithm can effectively produce the entertaining Arcimboldo-like collages.", "paper_title": "Arcimboldo-like Collage Using Internet Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000297681100033"}
