When in the same subject recurrent events are considered and these observed events are clustered into groups, independence between the clustered survival times cannot be assumed. A natural way to model the dependence of clustered event times is through the introduction of a cluster-specific random effect: the frailty term. On the other hand, between 10% and 30% of patients diagnosed with bladder carcinoma will present a muscle invasive progression, so the observation process of recurrences could be interrupted by a major failure event (progression). In this regard, a joint modelling of the two processes could make the study of a joint evolution over time possible, giving unbiased and efficient parameters. We jointly analyze recurrences and progression processes by means of the joint frailty model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
