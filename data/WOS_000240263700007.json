We consider a slotted system with three classes of traffic (voice, streaming media and file transfers). A Markov model is used for the fading and also for modeling voice packet arrivals and streaming arrivals. The performance objectives are a loss probability for voice, mean network delay for streaming media, and time average throughput for file transfers. A central scheduler (e.g., the access point in a single cell IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN)) is assumed to be able to keep track of all the available state information and make the scheduling decision in each slot (e.g., as would be the case for PCF mode operation of the IEEE 802.11 WLAN). The problem is modeled as a constrained Markov decision problem. By using constraint relaxations (a linear relaxation and Whittle type relaxations) an index based policy is obtained. For the file transfers the decision problem turns out to be one with partial state information. Numerical comparisons are provided with the performance obtained from some simple policies.", "paper_title": "A stochastic control approach for scheduling multimedia transmissions over a polled multiaccess fading channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000240263700007"}
