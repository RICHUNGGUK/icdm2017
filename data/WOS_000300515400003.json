While all existing MLSD methods for square-law detection receivers are based on direct computation of branch metrics, the proposed algorithm provides an efficient and structured way to implement reduced-state MLSD with almost the same complexity of a MLSD for linear channels. As a result, the proposed algorithm reduces the number of parameters to be estimated and the complexity of computation.", "paper_title": "Reduced-State MLSD Based on Volterra Kernels for Square-Law Detected Multipath Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000300515400003"}
