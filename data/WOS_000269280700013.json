The characteristics are classified into three groups, which are \"common-mind,\" \"uncommon-mind,\" and \"extremely uncommon-mind.\" Our personalization method constructs an index of the anchor text retrieved from the web pages that the user has clicked during his/her past searches. Our method provides different weights to the anchor text according to the psychological characteristics for re-ranking URLs. In the experimental section, we show that our method can provide better performance than Google and another web personalization method in terms of the average rank.", "paper_title": "Personalized URL Re-ranking Method using Psychological User Browsing Characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000269280700013"}
