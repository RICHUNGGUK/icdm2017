A social network usually exhibits some degree of modularity. Previous research efforts that made use of this topological property are restricted to random networks with two communities. In this paper, we firstly transform the influence maximization problem in a modular social network to an optimal resource allocation problem. We assume that the communities of the social network are disconnected. We then propose a recursive relation for finding such an optimal allocation. We prove that finding an optimal allocation in a modular social network is NP-hard and propose a new dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem. We name our new algorithm OASNET (Optimal Allocation in a Social NETwork). We compare OASNET with the high degree heuristics, the single degree discount heuristics, and the degree discount heuristics on three real world datasets. Experimental results show that OASNET outperforms comparison heuristics significantly on the independent cascade model when the diffusion probability is greater than a certain threshold.
