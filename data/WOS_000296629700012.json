A novel method for joint time delay and frequency estimation of sinusoidal signals received at multiple separated sensors is derived. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of multi-invariance characteristic to estimate frequency and also employs single invariance property to estimate time delay. The algorithmic performance is shown to be better than both ESPRIT method and state-space realization algorithm. Simulation results illustrate performance of this algorithm.", "paper_title": "JOINT TIME DELAY AND FREQUENCY ESTIMATION METHOD WITH SHIFT INVARIANCE PROPERTY", "paper_id": "WOS:000296629700012"}
