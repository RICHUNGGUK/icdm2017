In this survey, we focus on emerging approaches to spam filtering built on recent developments in computing technologies. These include peer-to-peer computing, grid computing, semantic Web, and social networks. We also address a number of perspectives related to personalization and privacy in spam filtering. We conclude that, while important advancements have been made in spam filtering in recent years, high performance approaches remain to be explored due to the large scale of the problem.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Emerging Approaches to Spam Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000300901000004"}
