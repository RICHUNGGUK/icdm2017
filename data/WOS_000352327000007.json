Gorman's superposition method is exploited to obtain the solution of the governing equations of motion. The dynamic stiffness matrix is derived using the Projection method. The obtained results are in good agreement with the results obtained using exact solutions for some special cases and also with finite element solutions. Modeling of plates undergoing in-plane vibration using dynamic stiffness method demonstrate high precision, accuracy and low memory requirement in comparison with the finite element method.
