A path in G is a T-path if its ends are distinct terminals. By a multiflow we mean a function F assigning to each T-path P a nonnegative rational weight F(P), and a multiflow is called feasible if the sum of weights of T-paths through each node v does not exceed c(v). The value of F is the sum of weights F(P), and the cost of F is the sum of F(P) times the cost of P w.r.t. a, over all T-paths P. Generalizing known results on edge-capacitated multiflows, we show that the problem of finding a minimum cost multiflow among the feasible multiflows of maximum possible value admits half-integer optimal primal and dual solutions. Moreover, we devise a strongly polynomial algorithm for finding such optimal solutions.", "paper_title": "Min-cost multiflows in node-capacitated undirected networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308969100005"}
