Electronic auctions assist merchants and consumers in reducing costs and enable customized delivery of goods and services. Our goal is to develop a bargaining server prototype and to test its feasibility in the E-Marketplaces. The present auction system is the first and currently the only Internet auction system that supports complex auctions and bids via price-quantity graphs and mobile agents. The agent system allows users to use the system as a third-party auction site, which exploits the bargaining opportunities and market development in the Internet. The most significant achievement of this research is the development of a new e-commerce bargain architecture that adopts an agent's properties and a multiagent framework. It also creates a user friendly interface for Graphic User's Interface (GUI). The implementation prototype system demonstrates excellent performance and the system can be easily implemented in a large bargain database of the e-commerce marketplace for wide accessibility.", "paper_title": "Use of an intelligent agent for an E-Commerce bargaining system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000037"}
