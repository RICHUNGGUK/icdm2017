Expressions phi(i) may contain the operations of union, intersection and elementwise addition S + T = {m + n vertical bar m is an element of S, n is an element of T} . A system with an EXPTIME-complete least solution is constructed in the paper through a complete arithmetization of EXPTIME-completeness. At the same time, it is established that least solutions of all such systems are in EXPTIME. The general membership problem for these equations is proved to be EXPTIME-complete. Among the consequences of the result is EXPTIME-completeness of the compressed membership problem for conjunctive grammars.", "paper_title": "Complexity of Equations over Sets of Natural Numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000286388100004"}
