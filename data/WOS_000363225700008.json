The inputs of to the estimators are picked as the wind turbine power coefficient, rotational rate and blade pitch angle. Polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) are applied as the kernel function of Support Vector Regression (SVR) technique to estimate the wind speed in this study. Instead of minimizing the observed training error, SVR_poly and SVR_rbf attempt to minimize the generalization error bound so as to achieve generalized performance. The results are compared with the adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) results.", "paper_title": "Sensorless Estimation of Wind Speed by Soft Computing Methodologies: A Comparative Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000363225700008"}
