This paper presents a novel CEW scheme based on orthogonal decomposition. Different from current CEW, the proposed CEW not only achieves the integration of encryption and watermarking in the final data but also has no specific restrictions in selecting encryption and watermarking algorithms. Therefore, the proposed CEW possesses higher security and applicability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CEW can keep the performances of selected encryption and watermarking algorithm and show more robustness than other current CEW schemes.", "paper_title": "Commutative encryption and watermarking based on orthogonal decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500011"}
