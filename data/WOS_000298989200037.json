The Peng-Fan bounds on sets of FHSs are generalized to the case of partial correlation. Both individual FHSs with optimal partial autocorrelation and sets of FHSs with optimal partial correlation are presented. The former has more new parameters compared with the known individual FHSs with optimal partial autocorrelation, while the later is obtained in the literature for the first time.", "paper_title": "New Classes of Frequency-Hopping Sequences With Optimal Partial Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298989200037"}
