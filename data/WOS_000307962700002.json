We first present the three axioms of our framework, with several examples as illustration and justification. Then we show how to implement several existing weak memory models in our framework, and prove formally that our implementation is equivalent to the native definition for each of these models.", "paper_title": "A formal hierarchy of weak memory models", "paper_id": "WOS:000307962700002"}
