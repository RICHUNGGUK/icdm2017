In this context, airlines and manufacturing companies can no longer consider air transport exclusively as a cost-oriented problem; thus, for airlines, the choice concerning the purchase of the aircraft is no longer a simple matter of minimizing operative costs, but rather a multi-attribute problem, characterized by a high complexity level in which a variety of factors play a pivotal role. Given this scenario, the aim of this paper is to propose a novel model for aircraft evaluation, based on the investigation of airlines' needs. The model is based on the two main approaches proposed in literature to address generic evaluation problems, Analytic Hierarchy Process and Fuzzy Set Theory, proposing a hybrid approach which combines some the strerigths of the two methodologies. The usability of the hybrid model for the stakeholders of the air transport industry is investigated through an empirical study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
