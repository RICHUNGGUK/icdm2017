The coconut solver system [Schichl, H. 2004a. COCONUT: COntinuous CONstraints-Updating the technology] focuses on nonlinear global continuous optimization and possesses its own modeling language and data structures. The Dr. AMPL meta-solver [Fourer, R., D. Orban. 2007. Dr. AMPL-A meta solver for optimization. Technical Report G-2007-10, GERAD, Montreal] aims to analyze nonlinear differentiable optimization models and hooks into the AMPL Solver Library [Gay, D. M. 2002. Hooking your solver to AMPL]. Our symbolic convexity analysis may be supplemented, when it returns inconclusive results, with a numerical phase that may detect nonconvexity. We report numerical results using these tools on sets of test problems for both global and local optimization.", "paper_title": "Convexity and Concavity Detection in Computational Graphs: Tree Walks for Convexity Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000275160700006"}
