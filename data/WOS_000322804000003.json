These curves can interpolate initial/final positions p(i) and p(f) and orientational frames (t(i), u(i), v(i)) and (t(f), u(f), v(f)) so as to define a rational rotation-minimizing rigid body motion. Two residual free parameters, that determine the magnitudes of the end derivatives, are available for optimizing shape properties of the interpolant. This improves upon existing algorithms for quintic PH curves with rational rotation-minimizing frames (RRMF quintics), which offer no residual freedoms. Moreover, the degree 7 PH curves with rotation-minimizing ERFs are capable of interpolating motion data for which the RRMF quintics do not admit real solutions. Although these interpolants are of higher degree than the RRMF quintics, their rotation-minimizing frames are actually of lower degree (6 versus 8), since they coincide with the ERE This novel construction of rational rotation-minimizing motions may prove useful in applications such as computer animation, geometric sweep operations, and robot trajectory planning.
