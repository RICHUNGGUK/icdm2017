A ubiquitous name-based directory server, accessible and usable with a variety of Web-browsing devices (e. g. Internet-capable mobile phones), could be a unified center for human-centric Web interaction services as well as for business models based on personalized services. We studied the accessibility and usability in user-centric Web interaction with a unified-ubiquitous name-based directory service, as metric metadata for real-time estimation. We studied the real-time metrics in synthetic approach for comparison among different services. We show empirical results based on implementation and experiments in Korea, Japan and China.", "paper_title": "Accessibility and Usability of User-centric Web Interaction with a Unified-Ubiquitous Name-based Directory Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000276134100006"}
