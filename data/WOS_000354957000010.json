Some common perspectives are reviewed by multiple views simultaneously, while some specific ones are reflected by individual views. That is, there are two kinds of properties embedded in the multiview data: 1) consistency and 2) complementarity. Different from most multiview learning approaches only focusing on either consistency or complementarity, this paper proposes a novel semisupervised multiview learning algorithm, called partially shared latent factor (PSLF) learning, which jointly exploits both consistent and complementary information among multiple views. In PSLF, a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based formulation is adopted to learn a compact and comprehensive partially shared latent representation, which is composed of common latent factors shared by multiple views and some specific latent factors to each view. With the learned representations of multiview data, we introduce a robust sparse regression model to predict the cluster labels of labeled data. By integrating the NMF-based model and the regression model, we obtain a unified formulation and propose a multiplicative-based alternative algorithm for optimization. In addition, PSLF can learn the weights of different views adaptively according to the reconstruction precisions of data matrices. Our experimental study indicates different multiview data that contains consistent and complementary information in different degrees. In addition, the encouraging results of the proposed algorithm are achieved in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world data sets.", "paper_title": "Partially Shared Latent Factor Learning With Multiview Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000354957000010"}
