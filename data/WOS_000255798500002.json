Interpretation of kinematics graphs was the physics topic chosen for investigation. The theoretical framework adopted was based on Halloun's schematic modelling approach and on Ausubel's meaningful learning theory. The results of this work show that there was a statistically significant improvement in the experimental group students' performance when compared to the control group, submitted just to a conventional teaching method. Students' perception with respect to the concepts and mathematical relations, as well as the motivation to learn, originated by the activities, have played a fundamental role in these findings.
