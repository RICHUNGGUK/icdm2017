Gradient-based topology optimization algorithms may efficiently solve fine-resolution problems with thousands and up to millions of design variables using a few hundred (finite element) function evaluations (and even less than 50 in some commercial codes). Nevertheless, non-gradient topology optimization approaches that require orders of magnitude more function evaluations for extremely low resolution examples keep appearing in the literature. This forum article discusses the practical and scientific relevance of publishing papers that use immense computational resources for solving simple problems for which there already exist efficient solution techniques.", "paper_title": "On the usefulness of non-gradient approaches in topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000289985500001"}
