However, this matrix-based framework neglects the prior structural information of the whole input space that is made up of all the matrix patterns. This paper aims to overcome such flaw through taking advantage of one structure learning method named Alternative Robust Local Embedding (ARLE). As a result, a new regularization term R-gl is designed, expected to simultaneously represent the globality and the locality of the whole data domain, further boosting the existing matrix-based classification method. To our knowledge, it is the first trial to introduce both the globality and the locality of the whole data space into the matrixized classifier design. In order to validate the proposed approach, the designed Rgi is applied into the previous work matrix-pattern-oriented Ho-Kashyap classifier (MatMHKS) to construct a new globalized and localized MatMHKS named GLMatMHKS. The experimental results on a broad range of data validate that GLMatMHKS not only inherits the advantages of the matrixized learning, but also uses the prior structural information more reasonably to guide the classification machine design.
