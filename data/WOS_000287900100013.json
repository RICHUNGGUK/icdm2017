Electrical engineers have the responsibility to design and to maintain such lines, so it is very important that they acquire sufficient knowledge about these subjects while they are studying. Bundle and stranded conductors modify the spatial distribution of the electric field generated by the power line and also affect the corona onset conditions. This article describes the implementation of a method that models the behavior of electric fields generated by any three-phase power line. Different configurations of overhead power lines are analyzed. The proposed methodology has been contrasted with results from other authors and with available experimental data.
