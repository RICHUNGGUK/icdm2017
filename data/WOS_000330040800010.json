Then, by employing Zhang et al.'s neural dynamic method, a special recurrent neural network termed Zhang neural network (ZNN) is proposed and investigated for solving online the converted time-varying matrix equation as well as the time-varying LMI. Such a ZNN model showed in an explicit dynamics exploits the time-derivative information of time-varying coefficients. In addition, theoretical analysis and results of the proposed ZNN model are discussed and presented to show its excellent performance on solving the time-varying LMI. Computer simulation results further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ZNN model for online solution of the time-varying LMI and the converted time-varying matrix equation.", "paper_title": "Zhang Neural Network for Online Solution of Time-Varying Linear Matrix Inequality Aided With an Equality Conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000330040800010"}
