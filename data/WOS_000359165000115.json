Based on the ergodic theory of continuous time Markov chain, the matrix measure approach and Lyapunov theory, almost sure stability and exponential stability in the mean square for continuous time BAM neural networks are derived. We also present some new stability results for discrete time BAM neural networks with the help of the law of large numbers. Meanwhile, some examples with numerical simulations are given to show that the Markov chain plays an important role in stability of neural networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
