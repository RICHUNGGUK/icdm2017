The considered model has the flexibility for the user to specify the more general membership functions for objectives to reflect the inherent fuzziness, while being simple and practical. We develop two solution strategies with reasonable computing costs. The additional cost, as compared to the type-1 fuzzy model, is indeed insignificant. These two algorithms compute Pareto optimal solutions of the type-2 problems, one being based on a maxmin approach and the other on aggregating the objectives. Finally, applying the proposed algorithms, we work out two illustrative examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
