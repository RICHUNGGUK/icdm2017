In this article, we propose a novel CPS application for energy management framework (EMF) toward autonomous electric vehicle (AEV) in smart grid. We first give a brief overview of related technologies, including open research issues of CPS, enabling wireless communication technologies for CPS, smart grid, AEV and its path planning, energy-efficient design for AEV, etc. Then we design EMF from the following aspects, such as AEV with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) navigation, smart grid communication architecture for EMF and AEV charging station. The proposed EMF is able to collect the real-time power consumption status and demand from AEV and charging stations. We also address EMF to overcome some issues, such as real-time traffic information. Subsequently, the energy-efficient design schemes for AEV are proposed and formulated from the point of view of path planning and event-based control technique. Finally, we outline the issues and challenges for EMF.", "paper_title": "Cyber-Physical Systems for Optimal Energy Management Scheme of Autonomous Electric Vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000322648400004"}
