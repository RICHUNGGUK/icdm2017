Both types of equivolumetric offsets provide us the machining method with the constant material removal rate. The first type of equivolumetric offsets can be used as semi-finished workpiece boundary with which we are able to perform the final finish milling of constant material removal rate with the uniform feedrate profile. Another type of equivolumetric offsets allows us to devise a machining strategy which has the constant material removal rate and the constant contact trajectory speed. By using this, we are able to achieve the constant cutting force and the fairness of the finished surface simultaneously. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
