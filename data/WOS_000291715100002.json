As they are used in early phases, errors and omissions may propagate to later phases and may be very costly to correct. This paper proposes a framework for evaluating conceptual models when represented in a domain specific language based on UML constructs. The framework describes the main aspects to be considered when conceptual models are represented in a domain specific language, presents a classification of semantic issues and some evaluation indicators. The indicators can, in principle, identify situations in the models where inconsistencies or incompleteness might occur. Whether these are real concerns might depend on domain semantics, hence these are semantic, not syntactic checks. The use of the proposed review framework is illustrated in the context of two conceptual models in a domain specific notation, KAMA. With reviews based on the framework, it is possible to spot semantic issues which are not noticed by case tools and help the analyst to identify more information about the domain.
