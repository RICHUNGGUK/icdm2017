LTE is composed of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) and 64-QAM, modulated onto orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single-carrier-frequency division multiplexing for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, respectively. The RoF system is composed of dedicated directly modulated lasers for DL and UL with dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) for instantaneous connections and for Rayleigh backscattering and nonlinear interference mitigation. DL and UL signals have varying carrier frequencies and are categorized as broad frequency spacing (BFS), intermediate frequency spacing (IFS), and narrow frequency spacing (NFS). The adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) for DL and UL with 64-QAM are similar for all frequency spacings while cross talk is observed for NFS. For the best case scenario for DL and UL transmissions we achieve error vector magnitude (EVM) values of similar to 2.30%, similar to 2.33%, and similar to 2.39% for QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM, respectively, while for the worst case scenario with a NFS EVM is increased by 0.40% for all schemes.", "paper_title": "Experimental Full Duplex Simultaneous Transmission of LTE Over a DWDM Directly Modulated RoF System", "paper_id": "WOS:000330477700002"}
