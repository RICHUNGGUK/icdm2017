The model employs a time-splitting scheme that uses a predictor-corrector method for the advection term. The fluxes are calculated based on a Riemann solver in the prediction step and a downwind scheme in the correction step. A simple TVD scheme is employed for shock capturing purposes in which the Minmond limiter is used for flux functions. As a consequence of using staggered grid, an ADI method is adopted for solving the discretized equations for 2-D problems. Several 1-D and 2-D flows have been modeled with satisfactory results when compared with analytical and experimental test cases. The model is also capable of simulating supercritical as well as subcritical flow.
