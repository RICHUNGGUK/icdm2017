Our observations from both intra-urban and inter-urban trips demonstrate a general law of human mobility. Specifically, the probability that a trip will occur is inversely proportional to the size of population located inside a circle with radius equal to the travel distance centered at the trip origin. A simple parameterless rank-based model is presented; this model can predict human flows with a convincing fidelity. Moreover, existing models can be implemented as special cases of our model, suggesting that our model is stable at more spatial scales. Our model also creates a fundamental bridge between individual mobility and social relationships.", "paper_title": "A general law of human mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000362698900003"}
