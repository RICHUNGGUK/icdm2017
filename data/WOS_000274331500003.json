The proof involves computation of the eigenvalues of Kneser graphs. We also show examples of families of simplices (of dimension 4 or greater) which show that the set of (n-2)-dimensional volumes of (n-2)-dimensional faces of a simplex do not determine its volume.", "paper_title": "Simplices and Spectra of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000274331500003"}
