By means of De Morgan's laws, it is easy to transform any well-formed formula phi into an equivalent formula without negations - the negation normal form of phi. Moreover, if phi is of size n, the negation normal form of phi is of the same size O(n). The full modal mu-calculus and the negation normal form fragment are thus equally expressive and concise. In this paper we extend this result to the higher-ordermodal fixed point logic (HFL), an extension of the modal mu-calculus with higher-order recursive predicate transformers. We present a procedure that converts a formula of size n into an equivalent formula without negations of size O(n(2)) in the worst case and O(n) when the number of variables of the formula is fixed.", "paper_title": "A Type-Directed Negation Elimination", "paper_id": "WOS:000367340500011"}
