This framework consists of a four step model that runs periodically: crawl a set of predefined sources of documents; search for potential sources and extract topics from the retrieved documents; retrieve opinionated documents from social networks for each detected topic and extract sentiment information from them. The proposed framework was applied to a set of 20 sources of documents over a period of 8 months. After the analysis period and that the proposed experiments were run, an F-Measure of 0.56 was obtained for the detection of significant events, implying that the proposed framework is a feasible model of how trends could be represented through the analysis of documents freely available on the Web.
