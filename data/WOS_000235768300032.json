However, such an evaluation process might be quite time consuming especially for big fingerprint databases. This may prolong the developing cycles of AFVSs and thus increase the cost. Also, comparison of the reliability of different AFVSs may be unfair if different fingerprint databases are used. In this paper, we propose a solution to solve these problems by creating an AFVS evaluation model which can be used for verification accuracy prediction and fair reliability comparison. Experimental results show that our model can predict the performance of a real AFVS pretty satisfactorily.", "paper_title": "A statistical evaluation model for minutiae-based Automatic Fingerprint Verification Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300032"}
