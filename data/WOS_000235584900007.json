A simulated annealing heuristic with three local moves, including an embedded branch-and-bound move, is developed for the problem. We compared the heuristic with the CPLEX 8.0 solver and the current best non-exact method, Casanova, using the standard CATS benchmark and other realistic test sets. Results show that the heuristic outperforms CPLEX and Casanova. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Heuristics for a bidding problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000235584900007"}
