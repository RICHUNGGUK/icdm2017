Shear waves in the skull have a better impedance match with longitudinal waves in water and thereby produce a more coherent focus inside the skull. This study presents work on an imaging technique that utilizes shear-wave propagation through the skull. The pulse-echo lateral distortion introduced by the skull was analyzed by imaging a point scatterer behind ex vivo human craniums at 1 MHz. Brightness images of the target obtained with either shear-mode or conventional longitudinal-mode transmission in the bone were assessed to quantify lateral resolution. As compared to longitudinal-mode transmission, it was found that the use of shear-mode resulted in improved localization along the propagation (depth) axis at the expense of degraded lateral resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limitations introduced by severe attenuation of shear-waves in the skull were overcome with frequency modulated (FM) coded excitations. This gain in SNR was exchanged with resolution and used for compensation of frequency-dependent attenuation in the skull, resulting in a greater than 20% improvement in lateral resolution for both modes of transcranial transmission. The results are an important step towards enhancing the quality of transcranial sonography.", "paper_title": "Transcranial Shear-Mode Ultrasound: Assessment of Imaging Performance and Excitation Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000265748400013"}
