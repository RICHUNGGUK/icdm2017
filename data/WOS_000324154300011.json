In this paper we derive upper or lower bounds for the connective eccentricity index in terms of some graph invariants such as the radius, independence number, vertex connectivity, minimum degree, maximum degree etc. Moreover, we investigate the maximal and the minimal values of connective eccentricity index among all n-vertex graphs with fixed number of pendent vertices and characterize the external graphs. In addition, we study the cactus on n vertices with k cycles having the maximal connective eccentricity index.", "paper_title": "On Connective Eccentricity Index of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000324154300011"}
