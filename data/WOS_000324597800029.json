In this paper, a general mechanism named multiple look-up table (MLUT) halftoning is proposed to generate the halftones of direct binary search (DBS), whereas the high efficient characteristic of the LUT is still preserved. In the MLUT, the standard deviation is adopted as an important feature to classify various tables. In addition, the proposed quick standard deviation evaluation is employed to yield an extremely low computational complexity in calculating the standard deviation. In the parameter optimization, the autocorrelation is adopted because it can fully characterize the periodicity of dot distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the dot distribution generated by the proposed method approximates to that of the DBS, which enables the proposed scheme as a very competitive candidate in the copying and printing industry.", "paper_title": "Efficient Halftoning Based on Multiple Look-Up Tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800029"}
