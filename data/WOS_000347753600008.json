Via the BYY harmony leaning of finite mixtures, model selection, i.e., the selection of an appropriate number of components for the mixture, can be made automatically during parameter learning on a given dataset. In this paper, an adaptive gradient BYY harmony learning algorithm is proposed for log-normal mixtures to implement parameter learning with automated model selection. It is demonstrated by the experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets that the proposed BYY harmony learning algorithm not only has the ability of automated model selection, but also leads to a rather good estimation of the parameters in the original log-normal mixture.
