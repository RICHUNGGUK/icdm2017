This method consists of two distinct phases: an optimization phase and a reconstruction phase. The optimization phase is developed by applying an extension algorithm of the growing neural gas model, which constitutes an unsupervised incremental clustering algorithm. The primary goal of this phase is to obtain a simplified set of vertices representing the best approximation of the original 3D object. In the reconstruction phase we use the information provided by the optimization algorithm to reconstruct the faces obtaining the optimized mesh as a result. We study the model theoretically, analyzing its main components, and experimentally, using for this purpose some 3D objects with different topologies. To evaluate the quality of approximations produced by the method proposed in this paper, three existing error measurements are used. The ability of the model to establish the number of vertices of the final simplified mesh is demonstrated in the examples. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
