Given that there are a variety of tools that allow one to construct arbitrary network packets and transmit over a network, a potential security risk arises in that it is difficult to discriminate legitimate packets from packets generated by an intruder solely on the basis of packet content. We describe a data clustering approach to discriminating network nodes based on signal strength data measured from multiple angles through a distributed sensor network, and demonstrate that relatively little network data are sufficient for high discrimination accuracy.
