Treatment of these patients with B-Raf inhibitors has been associated with a clear clinical benefit. Unfortunately, multiple resistance mechanisms have been identified and new potent and selective inhibitors are currently needed. In this work, five different type II inhibitors, which bind B-V600E-Raf in its DFG-out conformation, have been studied using molecular dynamics, free energy calculations and energy decomposition analysis. The ranking of calculated MM-PB/GBSA binding affinities is in good agreement with the experimentally measured ones. The per-residue decomposition of Delta G(binding), within the MM-GBSA approach, has been used to identify the key residues governing the allosteric binding of the studied compounds to the B-V600E-Raf protein kinase. Results indicate that although van der Waals interactions are key determinants for binding, hydrogen bonds also play an important role. This work also provides a better structural understanding of the binding of DFG-out inhibitors to B-V600E-Raf, which can be used in a further step for rational design of a new class of B-Raf potent inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Insight into the Binding of DFG-out Allosteric Inhibitors to B-Raf Kinase Using Molecular Dynamics and Free Energy Calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000365622000005"}
