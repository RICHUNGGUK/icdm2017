These devices cooperate to manage sensing and perform acting tasks. Numerous work conducted in the field of WSANs assumes the existence of addresses and routing infrastructure to validate their proposals. However, assigning addresses and delivering detected events in these networks remains highly challenging, specifically due to the sheer number of nodes. To address these issues, this paper proposes SubCast, a novel distributed address assignment and routing scheme based on a topic clustering system and firactal theory iterated function systems. In order to minimize data delivery costs among actors, the proposed architecture first builds an actor overlay network before allocating addresses to network nodes. Location information in the allocated addresses allows establishing data delivery paths. Simulation results confirm that the proposed system efficiently guarantees the allocation of unique addresses and performs efficient data delivery while reducing communication costs, delays as well as the impact of imprecise locations.
