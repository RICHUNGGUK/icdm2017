The main idea is to build a system in the form of a computer program whose core is the manufacturing expert systems to be used by the product designer. The system reveals critical features of the designed product from the manufacturing point of view and points them out to the product designer. The product designer can decide whether to change the critical part of the product or not. The system presented in this paper is prepared for the toolmaking, where a lot of relatively cheap products are made by one relatively expensive tool. Since the shape of the cavity in the tool is the negative shape of the product, small changes in the product design can significantly reduce the manufacturing costs of the tool.", "paper_title": "A novel approach to DFM in toolmaking: a case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000244031000003"}
