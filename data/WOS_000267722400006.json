The purpose of this study was to assess perceptions and attitudes of staff toward the use of a wireless communication device (Vocera, Vocera Communications, Inc., San Jose CA) and to compare communication patters before and after implementation. A pretest posttest quasi-experimental design and the Theory of Planned. Behavior were used. Attitudes subjective norms and perceived control explained 25% of the variation in behavioral intent before and 45% of the variation in behavioral intent after Vocera implementation. The time for key communication activities was reduced by 25% overall. On average each nurse engaged in these activities 16.2 times a day before Vocera and 11.6 times a day with Vocera. This study provides evidence that introduction of novel communication technology must account for user attitudes before implementation Vocera improved \"hand-off\" communication, was perceived to be of benefit, and has the potential to improve patient safety and work environments. This may also translate to reduction in healthcare resources.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of an Innovative Communication Technology in an Acute Care Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000267722400006"}
