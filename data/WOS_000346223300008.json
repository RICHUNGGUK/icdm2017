In the process of decision making with intuitionistic preference relation, the most crucial issue is how to derive the ranking of alternatives from intuitionistic preference relation. In this article, we investigate the ranking methods of alternatives on the basis of intuitionistic preference relation from various angles, which are based on the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging operator, the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric operator, the uncertain averaging operator, the uncertain geometric operator, the uncertain ordered weighted averaging operator, and the uncertain ordered weighted geometric operator, respectively, and study their desirable properties. Moreover, we give a numerical analysis of the developed ranking methods by a practical example, and finally discuss further research directions.", "paper_title": "Ranking Alternatives Based on Intuitionistic Preference Relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000346223300008"}
