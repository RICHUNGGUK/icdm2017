Development of a BBN requires data or expert knowledge to assist in determining the structure and probabilistic parameters in the model. As data are seldom available in the engineering decision making domain, a major barrier in using domain experts is that they are often required to supply a huge and intractable number of probabilities. Techniques for using fractional data to develop complete conditional probability tables were examined. The results showed good predictability of the missing data in a linear domain by the piecewise representation method. By using piecewise representation, the number of probabilities to be elicited for a binary child node with k binary parent nodes is now 2k rather than 2 k.", "paper_title": "Developing complete conditional probability tables from fractional data for Bayesian belief networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247385300005"}
