With a BGK model with two relaxation times approximating the collison term, the improved LBM is shown not only able to recover the equation of state, but also replicates the specific heat ratio, the fluid viscosity and thermal conductivity correctly. With these improvements, the recovery of full set of unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes equations is possible. Two complex aeroacoustic interaction problems, namely the interaction of three fundamental aeroacoustic pulses and scattering of short wave by a zero circulation vortex, are calculated. The LBM solutions are compared with DNS results. In the first case it has been shown that the improved LBM is as effective as the DNS in simulating aeroacoustic interaction of three pulses. Both methods obtain essentially same results using same truncated domains. In the scattering problem, LBM is able to replicate the directivity of scattered acoustic wave from the vortex but it does not accurately reproduce the symmetry as calculated using DNS.", "paper_title": "A lattice Boltzmann method for computation of aeroacoustic interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316000006"}
