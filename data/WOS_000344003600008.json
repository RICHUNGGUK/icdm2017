However, traditional proportioning methods are not sufficient because of their expensive costs, limitations of use, and inability to address nonlinear relationships among components and concrete properties. Consequently, this research introduces a novel genetic algorithm (GA)-based evolutionary support vector machine (GA-ESIM), which combines the K-means and chaos genetic algorithm (KCGA) with the evolutionary support vector machine inference model (ESIM). This model benefits from both complex input-output mapping in ESIM and global solutions with faster convergence characteristics in KCGA. In total, 1,030 data points from concrete strength experiments are provided to demonstrate the application of GA-ESIM. According to the results, the newly developed model successfully produces the optimal mixture with minimal prediction errors. Furthermore, a graphical user interface is utilized to assist users in performing optimization tasks.
