In this paper we consider the time and space constrained simple assembly line balancing problem with the objective of minimizing the number of necessary work stations. This problem is denoted by TSALBP-1 in the literature. For tackling this problem we propose a Beam-ACO approach, which is an algorithm that results from hybridizing ant colony optimization with beam search. The experimental results show that our algorithm is a state-of-the-art meta-heuristic for this problem.", "paper_title": "Beam-ACO applied to assembly line balancing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100009"}
