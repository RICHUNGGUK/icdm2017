However, it is unclear as to the relationship between the structure of the net and the minimal number of monitors required. This paper develops a theory to show that the minimal number of monitors required cannot be less than that of basic siphons in alpha-(SPR)-P-3 (systems of simple sequential processes with resources). This confirms that two of the three controlled systems by Chen etal. are of a minimal monitor configuration since they belong to alpha-(SPR)-P-3 and their number in each example equals that of basic siphons.", "paper_title": "On the lower bound of monitor solutions of maximally permissive supervisors for a subclass alpha-(SPR)-P-3 of flexible manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000343212300012"}
