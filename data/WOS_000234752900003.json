Letting p(n)(t) be the probability that n servers are occupied at time t (0 <= n <= m, t > 0), we study this distribution asymptotically, for m --> infinity with a comparably large arrival rate lambda(t) = O(m) (with mu(t) = O(1)). We use singular perturbation techniques to solve the forward equation for p(n)(t) asymptotically. Particular attention is paid to computing the mean number of occupied servers and the blocking probability p(m)(t). The analysis involves several different space-time ranges, as well as different initial conditions ( we assume that at t = 0 exactly n(0) servers are occupied, 0 <= n(0) <= m). Numerical studies back up the asymptotic analysis.", "paper_title": "On the Erlang loss model with time dependent input", "paper_id": "WOS:000234752900003"}
