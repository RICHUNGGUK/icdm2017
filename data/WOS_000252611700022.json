First, the neural-network (NN) model is employed to approximate each subsystem. Then, a linear differential inclusion (LDI) state-space representation is established for the dynamics of each NN model. According to the LDI state-space representation, a robustness design of fuzzy control is proposed to overcome the effect of modeling errors between subsystems and NN models. Next, in terms of Lyapunov's direct method, a delay-dependent stability criterion is derived to guarantee the asymptotic stability of nonlinear multiple time-delay large-scale systems. Finally, based on this criterion and the decentralized control scheme, a set of fuzzy controllers is synthesized to stabilize the nonlinear multiple time-delay large-scale system.", "paper_title": "Robustness design of fuzzy control for nonlinear multiple time-delay large-scale systems via neural-network-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000252611700022"}
