Transmission schemes based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) combined with Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) techniques are key promising technologies to increase current spectral efficiencies. A Joint SDMA-OFDMA system has to allocate resources in time, frequency and space dimensions to different mobile stations, resulting in a highly complex resource allocation problem. In contrast to related work approaches, in this paper we take a comprehensive view at the complete SDMA-OFDMA scheduling challenge and propose a SDMA-OFDMA Greedy Scheduling Algorithm (sGSA) for WiMAX systems. The proposed solution considers feasibility constraints in order to allocate resources for multiple mobile stations on a per packet basis by using (i) a low complexity SINR prediction algorithm, (ii) a cluster-based SDMA grouping algorithm and (iii) a computationally efficient frame layout scheme which allocates multiple SDMA groups per frame according to their packet QoS utility. A performance evaluation of the proposed sGSA solution as compared to state of the art solutions is provided, based on a comprehensive WiMAX simulation tool. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
