Since human investigators have difficulty in fully handling all reasoning in this highly comp lex hypothesis space, we propose a decision support system to aid the investigation process. The system integrates a rule-based reasoner, a Bayesian network for criminal profiling, and an assumption-based truth maintenance system for evidential reasoning to determine the most plausible suspect. The reasoning process reasons about a profiling classification and an alibi credibility measure. It proved effective in a realistic simulation.", "paper_title": "AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR SUSPECT INVESTIGATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000289853700008"}
