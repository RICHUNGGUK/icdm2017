However, existing mesh saliency cannot be used in mesh resizing directly because of the neglect of resizing direction. In this paper, we propose a region descriptor based on its vulnerability to a resizing direction, and use this descriptor to compute the region's saliency based on its contrast to neighboring regions. In order to avoid being misled by repeated small-scale features on the mesh, we put forward a hierarchical method for saliency computing. We build a hierarchical coarse-to-fine segmentations of the input mesh, and evaluate the saliency value on different levels of segmentations. Finally these saliency values are integrated into one saliency map after applying non-linear suppression. Equipped with the saliency map, a framework for non-homogeneous mesh resizing is presented. We regard every edge as a spring, and scale the mesh by stretching the edge. Based on the salience value, we build a global energy function on the mesh. Experiments show that our resizing method based on hierarchical saliency analysis can produce visually appealing results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
