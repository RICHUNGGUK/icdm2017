However, SQEMA is not complete with respect to the so called complex Sahlqvist formulae. In this paper we, first, introduce the class of complex inductive formulae, which extends both the class of complex Sahlqvist formulae and the class of polyadic inductive formulae, and second, extend SQEMA to SQEMA(sub) by allowing suitable substitutions in the process of transformation. We prove the correctness of SQEMA(sub) with respect to local equivalence of the input and output formulae and d-persistence of formulae on which the algorithm succeeds, and show that SQEMA(sub) is complete with respect to the class of complex inductive formulae.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic Correspondence and Completeness in Modal Logic.
