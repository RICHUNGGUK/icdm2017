Based on the fact that CVT approaches a uniform hexagonal lattice asymptotically, we derive a relationship of darkness between input grayscale images and the corresponding halftone images. Then the derived relationship is used for adjusting the contrast of the halftone images. Experimental results show that the generated halftone images can reproduce the original tone in the input images faithfully.", "paper_title": "Halftoning with Weighted Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations", "paper_id": "WOS:000305204400015"}
