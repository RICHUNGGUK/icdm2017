It is also very useful in coding theory, since it is related to the covering radii of Reed-Muller codes. This paper tightens the lower bounds of the second order nonlinearity of three classes of Boolean functions in the form f(x) = tr(x(d)) in n variables, where (1) d = 2(m+1) + 3 and n = 2m, or (2) d = 2m + 2m+1/2 +1, n =2m and m is odd. or (3) d = 2(2r) + 2(r+1) + 1 and n = 4r.
