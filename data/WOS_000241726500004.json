In this paper, we propose a fault-containing self-stabilizing algorithm for the shortest path problem in a distributed system. The improvement made by the proposed algorithm in stabilization times for single-fault situations can demonstrate the desirability of an efficient fault-containing self-stabilizing algorithm. For single-fault situations, the worst-case stabilization time of the proposed algorithm is O(Delta), where Delta is the maximum node degree in the system, and the contamination number of the proposed algorithm is 1.", "paper_title": "An efficient fault-containing self-stabilizing algorithm for the shortest path problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726500004"}
