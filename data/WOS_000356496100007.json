To avoid the computationally intensive process of sequential test generation, multicycle tests can be generated by extending two-cycle tests. However, the scan-in state of a two-cycle test is not always effective for a multicycle test when the primary input vectors are held constant during the functional clock cycles of a test. This paper studies the extent of this issue by considering exhaustive two-cycle and multicycle test sets with constant primary input vectors for finite-state machine benchmarks. Based on the results of this study, it describes an efficient test compaction procedure that modifies selected two-cycle tests in a given test set in order to make them more effective as a source for multicycle tests with constant primary input vectors. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the importance of this step to test compaction.", "paper_title": "A Multicycle Test Set Based on a Two-Cycle Test Set With Constant Primary Input Vectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000356496100007"}
