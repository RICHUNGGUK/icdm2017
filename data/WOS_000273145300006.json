The important feature of DHCP is a \"dynamic allocation\" mechanism, which assigns an IP address to a client for a limited period of time (called a lease time). Therefore, a previously allocated IP address can automatically be assigned to another host by a DHCP server upon the expiration of the lease time if a host does not renew the use of an allocated IP address. This paper proposes a retrial queueing model to approximate the performability of the DHCP dynamic allocation mechanism. An efficient computational algorithm is developed to calculate the steady state probabilities of a continuous time discrete state Markov process. A comparison of our approximate model with a detailed simulation model of the DHCP dynamic allocation mechanism shows an excellent agreement between the analytical and the simulation results. The impact of the lease time parameter on the performability of the DHCP dynamic allocation mechanism is also illustrated through a numerical study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
