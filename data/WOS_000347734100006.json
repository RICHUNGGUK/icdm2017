Learning navigation and control of mobile robot in an unstructured environment is one of the most challenging problems. Fuzzy logic control is a useful tool in the field of navigation of mobile robot. In this research, we optimized a performance of fuzzy logic controller by evolutionary learning technique. Two proposed approaches have been designed and implemented: Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) and Genetic-Fuzzy Controller (GA-FLC). The Genetic Algorithm is used for automatically learning to tune the membership function parameters for mobile robot motion control. Moreover, the performance of these approaches are compared through simulation.", "paper_title": "Self-learning Mobile Robot Navigation in Unknown Environment Using Evolutionary Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000347734100006"}
