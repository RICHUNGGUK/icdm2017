The design was functionally tested and simulated using ModelSim from Mentor Graphics tools, and then verified using both a VHDL testbench and the Matlab (R) Image processing tools. The design was tested for different image sizes at different clock frequencies with varying block sizes and search areas. With a clock frequency of 400 MHz, the estimated time for motion estimation for QCIF and CIF sequences shows the feasibility for real-time video-codec.", "paper_title": "Hardware implementation of block-based motion estimation for real time applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000249952500010"}
