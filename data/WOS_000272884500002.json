OST is equivalent in strength to admissible set theory, and a natural extension of OST is equivalent in strength to ZFC. The language of OST provides a framework in which to express \"small\" large cardinal notions-such as those of being an inaccessible cardinal, a Mahlo cardinal, and a weakly compact cardinal-in terms of operational closure conditions that specialize to the analogue notions on admissible sets. This illustrates a wider program whose aim is to provide a common framework for analogues of large cardinal notions that have appeared in admissible set theory, admissible recursion theory, constructive set theory, constructive type theory, explicit mathematics, and systems of recursive ordinal notations that have been used in proof theory.
