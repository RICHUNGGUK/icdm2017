In our approach, the watermark is divided into many sub-watermarks, and then we utilize the visible watermark method to hide the sub-watermarks into difference images. When the dynamic image with the hidden watermark is done, the human visual system perceives that the watermark has integrity because of the persistence of human vision. Some verified information, including hash value, recovered data and remaining watermark, is used to maintain the image context and prevent tampering with the image. Moreover, our approach utilizes the histogram-based lossless data embedding scheme to completely recover the image context. Owing to the characteristics of lossless data hiding, the visible watermark can be completely removed, and the extracted data can be investigated. Accordingly, not only the image context is not changed but also no part of image quality is destroyed since the watermark is hidden and extracted.", "paper_title": "Visible watermarking images in high quality of data hiding", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100026"}
