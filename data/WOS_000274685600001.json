There is a review of the existing models describing movement, i.e. deceleration, ablation and fragmentation a meteoric body in atmosphere, in the paper beginning; namely a theory of a single body and a theory of consecutive fragmentation. Methods of determination of meteor body parameters by observation data are reviewed. Further the described models and methods have been applied to the analysis of trajectories of several bolides. It is obtained that the model of a single body with the account of ablation describes trajectories of considered bolides with the best accuracy. The trajectory analysis of Benesov's bolide is carried out, for which there are detailed data of observation. Basic parameters of the bolide are determined, including initial mass. Comparison of the obtained data with results of other authors is made. The second part of the work is devoted to research of interaction of meteoroid fragments in a supersonic flow. We proposed an approximation of numerical data for transverse coefficient by simple analytical function. Further, we obtained analytical solution of a problem on separation of two spherical fragments under the decreasing transverse force without resistance. The new model of layer-by-layer scattering of meteoroid fragments moving as a system of bodies is constructed on the basis of the analytical solutions derived in this work and the numerical data.", "paper_title": "Movement, Ablation and Fragmentation of Meteoroid in the Atmosphere", "paper_id": "WOS:000274685600001"}
