Computer networks and especially ubiquitous intelligent mobile learning environments offer new strategies the dissemination of course work. Following the current trend towards ubiquitous computers, networks, information and services, a new innovative mobile e-learning intelligent world is created, where software components embedded with intelligence assist the users in education and provide functionalities such as context awareness, automation, adaptivity and proactiveness. Within this paper a case study of the similarity and differences between an object oriented solution and an agent-based solution of ubiquitous intelligent mobile learning environment is discussed. The results of this research are presented in terms of preliminary user tests for the design of the Mini-ME Interface and performance testing for both implemented architectures.", "paper_title": "Object oriented vs. agent-based oriented ubiquitous intelligent mobile managed e-learning environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600111"}
