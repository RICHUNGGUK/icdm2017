Indomethacine showed higher scavenging activity against O-2(.-), it being more potent than ibuprofen and nimesulide at the same concentration. Diclofenac showed a more relevant effect on the (NO)-N-. scavenging activity than against O-2(.-). Comparison of the activities of eight compounds showed that the aryl-acetic compounds have higher scavenging activities than the diarylheterocyclic ones. We have also found that the 02 scavenging activity correlates with the Next-Highest-Occupied pi-Orbital (NHOMO) levels and the Next-Lowest-Unoccupied pi-Orbital (NLUMO)NHOMO gaps correlate with Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitory activity. These results suggest that both NHOMO and NHOMO-NLUMO gap energies can be of predictive value in the search for new candidate anti-inflammatory drugs.", "paper_title": "Reactivity of biologically important NSAID compounds with superoxide (O-2(center dot)-), nitric oxide ((NO)-N-center dot) and cyclooxygenase inhibition", "paper_id": "WOS:000245374600007"}
