In this paper, three novel iterative decoding algorithms based on Chase, MAP algorithms and their combination are proposed for shortened-extended turbo product codes. The iterative decoding algorithm based on Chase algorithm is proposed to reduce the decoding complexity without any performance loss. An efficient MAP algorithm is then proposed to decode the component codes of shortened single parity check codes and shortened-extended Hamming codes. A comprehensive performance comparison of the proposed decoding schemes is conducted for three typical classes of turbo product codes in WiMAX OFDMA systems. The suitable decoding algorithms are recommended for different classes based on the simulation results.", "paper_title": "Decoding algorithms for shortened-extended turbo product codes in WiMAX systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273575000020"}
