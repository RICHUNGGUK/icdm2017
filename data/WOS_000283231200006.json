Based on the suggested evaluation criteria, a new type of principal curve-similarity preserving principal curve (SPPC) is proposed. SPPCs minimize the reconstruction error under the condition that the similarity between similar samples are preserved in the extracted features, thus giving researchers effective and reliable cognition of the inner structure of data sets. The existence and properties of SPPCs are analyzed; a practical learning algorithm is proposed and high dimensional extensions of SPPCs are also discussed. Experimental results show the virtues of SPPCs in preserving inner structures of data sets and discovering manifolds with high nonlinearity.", "paper_title": "Similarity Preserving Principal Curve: An Optimal 1-D Feature Extractor for Data Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283231200006"}
