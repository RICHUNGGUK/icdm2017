Thus, the usual technical requirement of prefix-freeness on domains is an option which we show to be non-critical when dealing with universality by adjunction. We also prove that the condition of universality by adjunction (which, though particular, is a very natural case of optimality) is essential in our theorem. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
