It is known that these design techniques suffer from pass-band anomaly under certain conditions. A recent method, that overcomes pass-band anomaly for LS QMFs using a frequency sampling design for the initial filter, is extended to WLS design in this letter. A comparison between the modified LS and WLS designs based on experimental results is presented. Although WLS designs have been reported to have superior near-equiripple stop-band performance as compared to LS designs, we find that this is not always true. Specifically, LS designs, with inherent computational and robustness advantages, also have better peak stop-band ripple and transition bandwidth at higher cut-off frequencies than WLS.", "paper_title": "Design and experimental evaluation of improved least squares and weighted least squares quadrature mirror filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500041"}
