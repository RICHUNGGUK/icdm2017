The results obtained generalize those of Akaike (1959) in several directions. First, all algorithms in the family are shown to have the same asymptotic behaviour (convergence to a two-point attractor), which implies in particular that they have similar asymptotic convergence rates. Second, the analysis also covers the Hilbert space case. A detailed analysis of the stability property of the attractor is provided.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic behaviour of a family of gradient algorithms in R-d and Hilbert spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000236418400004"}
