This article shows how to apply a modern and efficient solution strategy, the Newton-min method, to this geoscience problem and investigates its applicability and efficiency. In particular, numerical experiments show that the Newton-min method is quadratically convergent for this problem. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
