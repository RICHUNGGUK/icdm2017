In this paper, by resorting to complex network theories, we propose two models, namely, a linear growth evolution model (LGEM) and an accelerated growth evolution model (AGEM). In the model evolution processes, the following factors: node addition, node deletion, and link reconstruction that naturally arise from practical WSNs applications are considered. In addition, accelerated growth is introduced into the evolving processes of AGEM. Theoretical analysis shows that AGEM is an extension of the LGEM model, and AGEM is generally more flexible and accommodating in practice. Simulation results show that the degree distributions of two models have scale-free characteristics and the topologies generated by the two models show a good survivability under random and deliberate attacks.
