In addition, fuzzy data are inherent in the real-world applications. Although fuzzy information has been extensively investigated in the context of relational database model, the classical relational database model and its fuzzy extension to date do not satisfy the need of modeling and processing complex objects with imprecision and uncertainty on the Web. Based on fuzzy sets, this paper concentrates on fuzzy information modeling in the EER (enhanced entity-relationship or extended entity-relationship) model and the fuzzy XML model. In particular, the formal approach to mapping the fuzzy EER model to the fuzzy DTD (document type definition) model is developed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
