In particular, it is focused on so-called self-assembling patterns. The application of development in computing is reviewed, as is the evolutionary technique used in the paper-Cartesian Genetic Programming. A novel developmental algorithm, termed the Developmental Cellular Model is introduced, and five sets of experiments on various self-assembly problems are detailed and the results examined.", "paper_title": "Evolution of Self-Assembling Patterns in Cellular Automata using Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000296077200001"}
