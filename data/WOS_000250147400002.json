Building services in ad hoc networks, however, is challenging due to the rapidly changing operating contexts, which often lead to situations where a node hosting a certain service becomes unsuitable for hosting the service execution any longer. We propose a novel model of service provisioning in ad hoc networks based on the concept of context-aware migratory services. Unlike a regular service that executes always on the same node, a migratory service can migrate to different nodes in the network in order to accomplish its task. The migration is triggered by changes of the operating context, and it occurs transparently to the client application. We designed and implemented a framework for developing migratory services. We built TJam, a proof- of- concept migratory service that predicts traffic jams in a given region of a highway by using only car- to- car short- range wireless communication. The experimental results obtained over an ad hoc network of personal digital assistants ( PDAs) show the effectiveness of our approach in the presence of frequent disconnections. We also present simulation results that demonstrate the benefits of migratory services in large- scale networks compared to a statically centralized approach.", "paper_title": "Context-aware migratory services in Ad Hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250147400002"}
