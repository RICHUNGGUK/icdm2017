Motivation for this comparison comes from the distinctly different domains in which these techniques are employed-the probabilistic GMM domain versus the discriminative SVM kernel. A theoretical analysis is given comparing the JFA and NAP approaches to variability compensation. The role of speaker factors in the factor analysis model is also contrasted against the scatter difference NAP objective of retaining speaker information in the SVM kernel space. These methods for retaining speaker variation are found to provide improved verification performance over the removal of channel effects alone. Overall, experimental results on the NIST 2006 and 2008 SRE corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of both JFA and NAP techniques for reducing the effects of variability. However, the overheads associated with the implementation of JFA may make NAP a more attractive technique due to its simple yet effective approach to variability compensation.", "paper_title": "A Comparison of Session Variability Compensation Approaches for Speaker Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000284360000017"}
