LMMDP aims at learning a discriminant linear transformation. Specifically, we define the within-class scatter and the between-class scatter using similarities which cue based on pairwise distances in sample space. After the transformation, the considered pairwise samples within the same class are as close as possible, while those between classes are as far as possible. The structural information of classes is contained in the within-class and the between-class Laplacian matrices. Therefore, the discriminant projection subspace can be derived by controlling the structural evolution of Laplacian matrices. The performance on several data sets demonstrates the competence of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Laplacian Min Max Discriminant Projection and its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000279511600002"}
