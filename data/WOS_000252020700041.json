In the proposed scheme, after performing the SLM for the frequency domain OFDM symbol excluding pre-determined PRSC positions, the SLM-PRSC hybrid sequence with the lowest PAPR, which is generated by adding the time domain PRSC sequence to the results of the SLM, is selected as the transmitted OFDM signal. Since the identical PRSC sequences generated a priori are repeatedly used for every OFDM symbol, excessive IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) calculation is avoided. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme significantly improves the PAPR reduction performance of the conventional SLM, while avoiding excessive increase of IFFT and PAPR calculation.", "paper_title": "An effective SLM-PRSC hybrid scheme for OFDM PAPR reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700041"}
