A novel variant of the Delphi technique, termed the Slow Delphi, was devised for this study. This is aimed at eliciting qualitative understanding of complex conceptual topics, where there are a variety of perspectives and positions to be considered. The results of the study show a variety of points of potential applicability of Slow principles in research into information behaviour and practices, and in information provision. These include: more explicit inclusion of a temporal dimension in information behaviour models; greater recognition of the importance of the tempo of information seeking; more critical consideration of speed and scale as factors in the information environment; and the potential for individuals to exercise greater control over their information environment.", "paper_title": "Slow Delphi: An investigation into information behaviour and the Slow Movement", "paper_id": "WOS:000329726000008"}
