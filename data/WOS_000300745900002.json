We describe applications of this problem to disaster relief and media broadcasting, and show that it generalizes several well-known models including the knapsack problem, the partially ordered knapsack problem, the minimum branching problem, and certain scheduling problems. We prove that our problem is strongly NP-complete and give an integer programming formulation. We also provide five heuristic approaches, illustrate them with a numerical example, and provide a computational study on both small and large sized, randomly generated problems. The heuristics run efficiently on the tested problems and provide solutions that, on average, are fairly close to optimal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
