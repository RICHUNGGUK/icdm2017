The prediction scheme generates the predicted error image, to which the wavelet/sub-band coding algorithm can be applied to obtain efficient compression. In quantization phase, we used a modified SPIHT algorithm to achieve efficiency in memory requirements. The memory constraint plays a vital role in wireless and bandwidth-limited applications. A single reusable list is used instead of three continuously growing linked lists as in case of SPIHT. This method is error resilient. The performance is measured in terms of PSNR and memory requirements. The algorithm shows good compression performance and significant savings in memory. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
