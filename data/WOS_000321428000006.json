Recently, the International Electrotechnical Commission has published a standard for fuzzy control programming in part 7 of the IEC 61131 norm in order to offer a well defined common understanding of the basic means with which to integrate fuzzy control applications in control systems. In this paper, we introduce an open source Java library called jFuzzyLogic which offers a fully functional and complete implementation of a fuzzy inference system according to this standard, providing a programming interface and Eclipse plugin to easily write and test code for fuzzy control applications. A case study is given to illustrate the use of jFuzzyLogic.", "paper_title": "jFuzzyLogic: a Java Library to Design Fuzzy Logic Controllers According to the Standard for Fuzzy Control Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000321428000006"}
