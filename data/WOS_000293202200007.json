An inverse controller based on type-2 fuzzy model can be proposed since inverse model controllers provide an efficient way to control nonlinear processes. Even though various fuzzy inversion methods have been devised for type-1 fuzzy logic systems up to now, there does not exist any method for type-2 fuzzy logic systems. In this study, a systematic method has been proposed to form the inverse of the interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model based on a pure analytical method. The calculation of inverse model is done based on simple manipulations of the antecedent and consequence parts of the fuzzy model. Moreover, the type-2 fuzzy model and its inverse as the primary controller are embedded into a nonlinear internal model control structure to provide an effective and robust control performance. Finally, the proposed control scheme has been implemented on an experimental pH neutralization process where the beneficial sides are shown clearly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
