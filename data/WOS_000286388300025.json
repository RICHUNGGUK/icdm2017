Compared with state-of-the-art efforts in scene classification, the newly proposed method is more robust, more selective, and of lower complexity. These advantages are demonstrated by two sets of experiments on both our own database and standard public ones. Furthermore, occlusion and disorder problems in scene classification in video surveillance are also first studied in this paper.", "paper_title": "Biologically Inspired Features for Scene Classification in Video Surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000286388300025"}
