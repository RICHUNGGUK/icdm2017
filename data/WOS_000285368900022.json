An identification algorithm is used to find the values of the parameters of the model, on the basis of several experimental waveforms. With the identified model, the design phase of the power supply is simplified and improved, thanks to the simulation of the entire system: the converter along with the lamp. This model also helps to correlate the UV radiation with the current which actually flows into the gas: the latter, being a variable which is not directly measurable, is calculated offline.
