Networked devices, formerly placed at scientist and business desk, are now consumer parts and serve for information, communication and entertainment. The facing the emerging paradigm of ubiquitous computing and communication voice and video-conferencing over IP is on the spot to establish as standard internet solutions. However, current roaming procedures are inefficient and unstable for real-time applications. In this paper, we present when MN send BU, it send to add 1 bit for priority. HA or CN according to priority, so general performance is improved. The performance analysis and the numerical results presented in this paper show that our proposal has superior performance by 7%.", "paper_title": "Fast BU process method for real time multimedia traffic in MIPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100035"}
