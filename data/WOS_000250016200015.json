Conde, M. Salicru, Uniform association in contingency tables associated to Csiszar divergence, Statistics and Probability Letters, 37 (1998) 149-154] using the phi-divergence measures, that include as special case the power-divergence [N. Cressie, T.R.C. Read, Multinomial goodness-of-fit tests, Journal of the Royal Statistic Society, Series B, 46 (1984) 440-464] for the analysis of uniform association between two classification processes, based on the local odd ratios. For the above test statistics the significance level and its power are evaluated for different sample sizes when we consider a 3 x 2 contingency table.
