In this paper, a framework for human body parts tracking in video sequences using a self-adaptive cluster background subtraction (CBS) scheme is proposed based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and foreground matching with rectangular pictorial structures. The efficiency of the designed human body parts tracking framework is illustrated over various real-world video sequences. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.
