It is important for many vision understanding applications, such as visual interactive gaming, immersive virtual reality, visual surveillance, and content-based image retrieval. However, it remains a challenging task due to unknown image background, presence of clutter and especially the high dimensional state space (usually 30+ dimensions). In this paper, we contribute to human pose estimation and tracking in two aspects. First, we design two efficient Markov Chain dynamics under the data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework to effectively explore the high dimensional state space. Second, we parse the tree structure state space into a lexicographic order according to the image observations and body topology, and the optimization process is conducted in this order. This realizes a much more efficient exploration of the state space than the sampling based search or exhaustive search, and thus achieves a tremendous speed-up. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating and tracking various kinds of human poses, even against cluttered backgrounds, in poor illumination or under partial self-occlusion.", "paper_title": "Human Pose Estimation and Tracking via Parsing a Tree Structure Based Human Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000335226900006"}
