It appears that with a relatively small contra-spinning surface, the lateral force can be drastically reduced on a wide range of flight conditions. Present computations confirm experiments in supersonics and extend them for high subsonic and transonic regimes for small angles of attack. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
