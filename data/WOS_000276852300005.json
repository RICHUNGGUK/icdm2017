The test is extremely simple, since it only needs to compare the utilization of the tasks with a predetermined bound. As such, utilization-based schedulability tests are suitable for online use. The challenge is how to derive a reasonable utilization bound for a given system. Most existing results are obtained on a case-by-case basis because of their analytical complexity. In this paper, we develop a flexible and unified representation framework of real-time systems (i.e., tasks and schedulers) based on network calculus techniques. Our representation framework, together with the proposed bound derivation method, leads to a general bound result, which is applicable to a large family of real-time systems.", "paper_title": "A General Framework for Parameterized Schedulability Bound Analysis of Real-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000276852300005"}
