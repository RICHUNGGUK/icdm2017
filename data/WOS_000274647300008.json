We are the first to model music generation using Markov decision processes (MDPs). We give a proof of concept for this approach by using MOP planning to generate four-part harmony, given the melody or soprano line. Our initial results show feasibility, and show the variance possible, depending on the choice of reward functions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
