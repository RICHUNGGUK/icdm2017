The variable strength of the keeper is achieved through applying two different body biases to the keeper. The circuits used to generate the body biases are called capacitive body bias generator and cross-coupled capacitive body bias generator. Compared to a previous work, the body bias generator circuits presented in this paper are simpler and do not require double or triple power supply while consuming less area and power. To show the efficiency of the proposed technique, the implementation of a carry generator circuit by the proposed techniques and the previous work are compared. The simulation results for standard CMOS technologies of 0.18 mu m and 70 nm show considerable improvements in terms of power and power delay product. In addition, the proposed technique shows much less temperature dependence when compared to that of previous work.", "paper_title": "Clock delayed domino logic with efficient variable threshold voltage keeper", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684600001"}
