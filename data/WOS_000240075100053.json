This method does not require the user to provide either the expected number of clusters or any threshold values, often with no clear physical meaning, as other algorithms do. The proposed approach has been tested on a standard database of 40 mammographic images and has demonstrated to be very effective, even when the detection phase gives rise to several false positives.", "paper_title": "A graph-based method for detecting and classifying clusters in mammographic images", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100053"}
