This new algorithm addresses deficiencies with ShortStraw while maintaining its simplicity and efficiency. We also develop an extension for ink strokes containing curves and arcs. We compare our algorithm against ShortStraw and two other state of the art corner finding approaches, MergeCF and Sezgin's scale space algorithm. Based on an all-or-nothing accuracy metric, IStraw shows significant improvements over these algorithms for ink strokes with and without curves. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
