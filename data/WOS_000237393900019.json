Triangular meshes that interpolate or approximate these samples usually exhibit relatively big error around the insensitive sampled sharp features. This paper presents a robust general approach conducting bilateral filters to recover sharp edges on such insensitive sampled triangular meshes. Motivated by the impressive results of bilateral filtering for mesh smoothing and denoising, we adopt it to govern the sharpening of triangular meshes. After recognizing the regions that embed sharp features, we recover the sharpness geometry through bilateral filtering, followed by iteratively modifying the given mesh's connectivity to form singlewide sharp edges that can be easily detected by their dihedral angles. We show that the proposed method can robustly reconstruct sharp edges on feature-insensitive sampled meshes.", "paper_title": "Bilateral recovering of sharp edges on feature-insensitive sampled meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000237393900019"}
