An attacker may choose to recapture a forged image in order to conceal imperfections and to increase its authenticity. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting images recaptured from LCD monitors. We provide a comprehensive overview of the traces found in recaptured images, and we argue that aliasing and blurriness are the least scene dependent features. We then show how aliasing can be eliminated by setting the capture parameters to predetermined values. Driven by this finding, we propose a recapture detection algorithm based on learned edge blurriness. Two sets of dictionaries are trained using the K-singular value decomposition approach from the line spread profiles of selected edges from single captured and recaptured images. An support vector machine classifier is then built using dictionary approximation errors and the mean edge spread width from the training images. The algorithm, which requires no user intervention, was tested on a database that included more than 2500 high-quality recaptured images. Our results show that our method achieves a performance rate that exceeds 99% for recaptured images and 94% for single captured images.", "paper_title": "An Image Recapture Detection Algorithm Based on Learning Dictionaries of Edge Profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000352534300006"}
