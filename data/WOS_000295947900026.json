AWS2DLDA can extract the directional features of images in the frequency domain, and it is applied to face recognition. Some experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results confirm that the recognition rate of the proposed system is higher than the other popular algorithms. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.
