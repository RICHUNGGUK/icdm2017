A multi-functional platform needs to perform more intelligent and ubiquitous functions of smart substation effectively. In this paper, we propose a multifunctional platform to implement smart substations effectively. A prototype hardware, functions and communication interfaces on an embedded platform are introduced. Also, we suggest operating system architecture for smart substations.", "paper_title": "A multi-functional platform for implementing intelligent and ubiquitous functions of smart substations under SCADA", "paper_id": "WOS:000274009000006"}
