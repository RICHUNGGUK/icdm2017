The project proceeded in three phases for the FPGA implementation: All-in-C design using Xilinx Microblaze soft core processor system, an accelerated design with custom co-processor and Microblaze soft core processor system, and full custom hardware design implemented using VHDL on Xilinx FPGA. Later the complete system was implemented on ASIC. The ASIC implementation optimized the modules for area and timing for a 130nm process technology.", "paper_title": "Distance and Speed Measurements using FPGA and ASIC on a high data rate system", "paper_id": "WOS:000369851700038"}
