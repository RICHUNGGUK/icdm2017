It is often used to classify an image into separate regions, which ideally correspond to different real-world objects. Several segmentation methods have been proposed in the literature, being thresholding techniques the most popular. In such techniques, it is selected a set of proper threshold values that optimize a determined functional criterion, so that each pixel is assigned to a determined class according to its corresponding threshold points. One interesting functional criterion is the Tsallis entropy, which gives excellent results in bi-level thresholding. However, when it is applied to multilevel thresholding, its evaluation becomes computationally expensive, since each threshold point adds restrictions, multimodality and complexity to its functional formulation. Therefore, in the process of finding the appropriate threshold values, it is desired to limit the number of evaluations of the objective function (Tsallis entropy). Under such circumstances, most of the optimization algorithms do not seem to be suited to face such problems as they usually require many evaluations before delivering an acceptable result. On the other hand, the Electromagnetism-Like algorithm is an evolutionary optimization approach which emulates the attraction-repulsion mechanism among charges for evolving the individuals of a population. This technique exhibits interesting search capabilities whereas maintains a low number of function evaluations. In this paper, a new algorithm for multilevel segmentation based on the Electromagnetism-Like algorithm is proposed. In the approach, the optimization algorithm based on the electromagnetism theory is used to find the optimal threshold values by maximizing the Tsallis entropy. Experimental results over several images demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to improve the convergence velocity, compared with similar methods such as Cuckoo search, and Particle Swarm Optimization.
