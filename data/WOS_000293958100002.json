The proposed technique is based on combinatorial map simplifications guided by geometrical criteria. We illustrate the genericity of the framework by defining three contour simplification methods: a polygonal approximation one based an area deviation computation; a digital straight segments reconstruction one which guaranties to obtain a loss-less representation; and a moment preserving simplification one which simplifies the contours while preserving geometrical moments of the image regions. Thanks to a complete experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed methods can be efficiently implemented in a multi-thread environment to simplify labeled image contours.", "paper_title": "A generic and parallel algorithm for 2D digital curve polygonal approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293958100002"}
