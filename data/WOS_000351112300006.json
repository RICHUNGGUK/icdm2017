Our physical world is structured, and our perception as human beings does not neglect contextual information. In this paper, we propose a framework that is able to simultaneously detect and segment objects of different classes under context. Context is incorporated into our model as long-range pairwise interactions between pixels, which impose a prior on the labeling. Long-range interactions have seen seldom use in the computer vision literature, and we show how to use them to encode contextual information in our segmentation. Our framework formulates the multi-class image segmentation task as an energy minimization problem and finds a globally optimal solution under certain conditions using a single graph cut. We experimentally evaluate performance of our model on two publicly available datasets: the MSRC-1 and the CorelB datasets. Our results show the applicability of our model to the multi-class segmentation problem.", "paper_title": "Context-based global multi-class semantic image segmentation by wireless multimedia sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351112300006"}
