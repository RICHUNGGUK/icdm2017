The proposed control methods include a direct proportional and integral (PI) controller and an adaptive fuzzy logic controller (AFLC). The performances of these controllers were evaluated under different operating conditions of the power system and the results demonstrated that PI and A PLC are very effective in improving the transient power system stability and very robust against variable transmission line parameters.", "paper_title": "A robust adaptive fuzzy control of a unified power flow controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000300137900007"}
