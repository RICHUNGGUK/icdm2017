Certain large scale distributed scientific simulations, especially ones which involve cross-site runs or interactive visualisation and steering capabilities, often require high quality of service, high bandwidth, low latency network interconnects between resources. In this paper, we describe three applications which require access to such network infrastructure, together with the middleware and policies needed to make them possible. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
