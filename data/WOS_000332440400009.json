An integrated approach of agent-based modeling, system dynamics and discrete event simulation was adopted to complement the standard LCA methodology. A hybrid simulation model was developed as a proof-of-concept system, then it was validated using a case study of bottled water and alternative drink products. The model was based on the assumption that parameters and relationships were constant regardless of local uniqueness. The research demonstrates that the hybrid modeling and simulation method can address several limitations of the standard LCA. Also, it is also proven that the method has a potential to address social and economic aspects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
