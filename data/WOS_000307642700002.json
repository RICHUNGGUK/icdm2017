A novel damage indicator is developed based on ratios of mode shape components between before and after damage. Numerical simulation of a simply-supported bridge is presented to demonstrate the memory, inference and anti-noise ability of the proposed method. The bridge is divided into eight elements and nine nodes, the damage indicator vector at characteristic nodes is used as the input measurement of FLS. Results reveal that FLS can detect damage of training patterns with an accuracy of 100%. Aiming at other test patterns, the FLS also possesses favorable inference ability, the identification accuracy for single damage location is up to 93.75%. Tests with noise simulated data show that the FLS possesses favorable anti-noise ability.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy logic-based damage identification method for simply-supported bridge using modal shape ratios", "paper_id": "WOS:000307642700002"}
