We derive a lower bound on the q-binomial moments and introduce a new combinatorial structure called generalized (s, t)-designs which could achieve the lower bounds. Moreover, we employ the q-binomial moments to study the undetected error probability of q-ary constant weight codes. A lower bound on the undetected error probability for q-ary constant weight codes is obtained. This lower bound extends and unifies the related results of Abdel-Ghaffar for q-ary codes and Xia-Fu-Ling for binary constant weight codes. Finally, some q-ary constant weight codes which achieve the lower bounds are found.", "paper_title": "Undetected error probability of q-ary constant weight codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000256008300003"}
