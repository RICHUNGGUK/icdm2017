All this is conducive to the notion of programming in the brain. In this paper, we describe a programmable neural architecture, biologically plausible on the neural level, and we implement, test, and validate it in order to support the programming interpretation of the above-mentioned phenomenology. A programmable neural network is a fixed-weight network that is endowed with auxiliary or programming inputs and behaves as any of a specified class of neural networks when its programming inputs are fed with a code of the weight matrix of a network of the class. The construction is based on the pulling out of the multiplication between synaptic weights and neuron outputs and having it performed in software by specialised multiplicative-response fixed subnetworks. Such construction has been tested for robustness with respect to various sources of noise. Theoretical underpinnings, analysis of related research, detailed construction schemes, and extensive testing results are given.", "paper_title": "Programming in the brain: a neural network theoretical framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000312452100001"}
