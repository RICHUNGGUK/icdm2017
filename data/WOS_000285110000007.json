This profile serves as a valuable tool for multifield data exploration because it provides the user with cues to identify interesting isovalues of scalar fields. Existing isosurface-based techniques for scalar data exploration like Reeb graphs, contour spectra, isosurface statistics, etc., study a scalar field in isolation. We argue that the identification of interesting isovalues in a multifield data set should necessarily be based on the interaction between the different fields. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to explore data from a wide variety of applications.", "paper_title": "Relation-Aware Isosurface Extraction in Multifield Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000285110000007"}
