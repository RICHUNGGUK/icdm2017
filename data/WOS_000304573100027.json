This paper proposes a new index structure for wireless stream of heterogeneous XML data to enhance tuning time performance in processing path queries on the stream. The index called PrefixSummary, stores for each location path in the XML data the address of a bucket in the stream which contains an XML node satisfying the location path and appearing first in the stream. We present algorithms to generate broadcast stream with the proposed index and to process a path query on the stream efficiently by exploiting the index. We also suggest a replication scheme of PrefixSummary within a broadcast cycle to reduce latency in query processing. By analysis and experiment we show the proposed PrefixSummary approach can reduce tuning time for processing path queries significantly while it can also achieve reasonable access time performance by means of replication of the index over the broadcast stream.", "paper_title": "PrefixSummary: A Directory Structure for Selective Probing on Wireless Stream of Heterogeneous XML Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000304573100027"}
