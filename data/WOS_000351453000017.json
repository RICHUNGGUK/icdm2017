ADS-B shares its frequency band with current radar systems that use the same 1,090 MHz band. The coexistence of radar systems and ADS-B systems is a key issue to detect and resolve conflicts in the next generation air transportation system (NextGen). This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of ADS-B with existing radar systems and performance optimization of ADS-B systems to improve the safety and efficiency of conflict detection and resolution in NextGen. We have developed a simulation environment which models the complex interplay among the air traffic load, the radar systems, the ADS-B systems, and the wireless channel. A simple model is used to derive an analytical expression for a performance metric of ADS-B. This model is then used to design an adaptive ADS-B protocol for maximizing the information coverage while guaranteeing reliable and timely communication in air traffic surveillance networks. Simulation results show that the effect of ADS-B interference on the current radar system is negligible. The operational ability of ADS-B meets the performance requirements of conflict detection and resolution in air traffic control. However, upgrades are required in the current radar system for operation within an ADS-B environment since the current radars can significantly degrade the ADS-B performance. Numerical results indicate that the proposed adaptive protocol has the potential to improve the performance of conflict detection and resolution in air traffic control.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation and Optimization of Communication Infrastructure for the Next Generation Air Transportation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000351453000017"}
