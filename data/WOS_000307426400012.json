Thus, it is an essential aspect to develop a suit of elaborately designed VANET security mechanisms for a successful homeland security infrastructure. However, all prior privacy-preserving authentication protocols for secure vehicular communications have not satisfied the fulfillment of location assurance to develop secure location-aware service applications in VANETs. In this paper, we make up for the limitations and propose an efficient privacy-preserving authentication protocol with location assurance for secure location-aware services over VANETs. In particular, we introduce the notion of location-aware credential so as to guarantee the trustworthiness of geographic location in location-aware services while providing conditional privacy preservation which is a desirable property for secure vehicular communications. Furthermore, the proposed protocol provides efficient procedures that alleviate a burden of computation for location-aware signature generation and verification on vehicles in VANETs. In order to achieve these goals, we consider online/offfine signature scheme based on \"hash-sign-switch\" paradigm and identity-based aggregate signature scheme as our building blocks. Comprehensive simulations are conducted to confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocol.", "paper_title": "Providing Secure Location-Aware Services for Cooperative Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307426400012"}
