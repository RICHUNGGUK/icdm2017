Joint models that represent the association through shared dependence of the primary and longitudinal data on random effects are increasingly popular; however, existing inferential methods may be inefficient or sensitive to assumptions on the random effects distribution. We consider a semiparametric joint model that makes only mild assumptions on this distribution and develop likelihood-based inference on the association and distribution, which offers improved performance relative to existing methods that is insensitive to the true random effects distribution. Moreover, the estimated distribution can reveal interesting population features, as we demonstrate for a study of the association between longitudinal hormone levels and bone status in peri-menopausal women.
