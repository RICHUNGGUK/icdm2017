We present an evaluation task at SemEval-2010, designed to provide a framework for comparing different approaches on this problem. The task focuses on 14 Chinese sentiment ambiguous adjectives, and provides manually labeled test data. There are 8 teams submitting 16 systems in this task. In this paper, we define the task, describe the data creation, list the participating systems, and discuss different approaches.", "paper_title": "SemEval-2010 task 18: disambiguating sentiment ambiguous adjectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000323754700008"}
