To deal with this kind of data, several proposals of temporal databases have been introduced. Moreover, time can also be affected by imprecision, vagueness, and/or uncertainty, since human beings manage time using temporal indications and temporal notions, which may also be imprecise. For this reason, information systems require appropriate support to accomplish this task. In this work, we present a novel possibilistic valid time model for fuzzy databases including the data structures, the integrity constraints, and the DML. Together with this model, we also present its implementation by means of a fuzzy valid time support module on top of a fuzzy object-relational database system. The integration of these modules allows to perform queries that combines fuzzy valid time constraints together with fuzzy predicates. Besides, the model and implementation proposed support the crisp valid time model as a particular case of the fuzzy valid time support provided.
