When our framework is instantiated using bilinear-map-based cryptosystems, the resulting protocol is also (reasonably) efficient. Somewhat surprisingly, our framework can be adapted to give protocols in the standard model that are universally composable while still using only one (simultaneous) round.", "paper_title": "Round-Optimal Password-Based Authenticated Key Exchange", "paper_id": "WOS:000323425600004"}
