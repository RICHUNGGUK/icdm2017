In this paper, we address the problem of QoS guaranteed transmission of preorchestrated multimedia data over multiple heterogeneous virtual channels (MHVCs) in a mobile, multihop, wireless network with no fixed infrastructure. This network consists of mobile multimedia database servers which may be connected to wired networks (e.g. ATM or Internet) via satellite links or stand alone. In order to achieve QoS guaranteed transmission, we propose a QoS routing (QoSR) protocol based on the prediction of users' mobility profile. The proposed scheme establishes and maintains QoS guaranteed MHVCs between the source and the destination nodes for the duration of the route life time (RLT). For synchronized and timely delivery of multimedia data, we present a scheduling scheme for transmitting multimedia data over MHVCs to minimize the maximum tardiness.", "paper_title": "A QoS framework for multimedia applications in mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250066400008"}
