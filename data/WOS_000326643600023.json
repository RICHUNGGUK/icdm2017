Here we describe NetWeAvers (Network Weighted Averages) for analyzing groups of regulated proteins in a network context, e. g. as defined by clusters of protein-protein interactions. NetWeAvers is an R package that provides a novel method for analyzing proteomics data integrated with biological networks. The method includes an algorithm for finding dense clusters of proteins and a permutation algorithm to calculate cluster P-values. Optional steps include summarizing quantified peptide values to single protein values and testing for differential expression, such that the data input can simply be a list of identified and quantified peaks.", "paper_title": "NetWeAvers: an R package for integrative biological network analysis with mass spectrometry data", "paper_id": "WOS:000326643600023"}
