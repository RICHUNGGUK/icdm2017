This method can also lead to improve numerical methods. In this work, an architecture of fuzzy neural networks is also proposed to find a fuzzy root of a system of fuzzy nonlinear equations (if exists) by introducing a learning algorithm. We propose a learning algorithm from the cost function for adjusting of fuzzy weights. Finally, we illustrate our approach by numerical examples.", "paper_title": "System of fully fuzzy nonlinear equations with fuzzy neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000308476800040"}
