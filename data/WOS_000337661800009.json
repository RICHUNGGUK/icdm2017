It is based on minimization of the regularization functional with stabilizing terms taking into account features of the ultrasound investigation. The proposed method allows us to solve the problem even in the case of existing areas with unknown data and turbulent flow regions. Test results for the left ventricle color Doppler flow mapping and comparison with the existing unwrapping methods showed effectiveness of the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
