Determining how to realize the effective coordination between the decision makers, and how to generate the optimal solution set by computation are the keys to the research and development of water resources scheduling group decision support system. However, in the existing group decision support systems and literatures about water resources scheduling, the effective solution methods have not been reported. Firstly, this paper analyzes and designs a multi-Agent computation platform which can support the optimal scheme set, and build a functional structure model of multi-Agent computation platform. Then, it provides an algorithm of group decision making optimal scheme set based on Agent computation. The proposed algorithm generates the optimal scheme set by using the multi-Agent computation platform based on the genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can make the coordination satisfaction degree of each group decision-making converge, and generate the optimal solutions set through the effective computation.", "paper_title": "SOLUTION METHOD OF OPTIMAL SCHEME SET FOR WATER RESOURCES SCHEDULING GROUP DECISION-MAKING BASED ON MULTI-AGENT COMPUTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754800005"}
