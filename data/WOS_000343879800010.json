Using the expectancy disconfirmation model and symbolic consumption theory, this study presents and empirically examines a model of customer satisfaction and repurchase intention in this context. Using structural equation modeling to analyze the data collected from 477 consumers of virtual products, this study validates the influence of perceived customization and perceived sociability on customer satisfaction and repurchase intention with regard to virtual products. Additionally, this study statistically confirms the important mediating roles of outcome expectations and perceived quality in the indirect effects of perceived customization and perceived sociability on customer satisfaction. This study also verifies that customer satisfaction is a critical mediator of the indirect influence of the other four constructs in the proposed model on the consumers' repurchase intention with regard to virtual products.", "paper_title": "A study of virtual product consumption from the expectancy disconfirmation and symbolic consumption perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000343879800010"}
