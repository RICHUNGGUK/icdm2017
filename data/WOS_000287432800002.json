In this paper we propose two new approaches in polarized Raman spectroscopy for data with rotational and spatial diversity, respectively. We show that the joint use of parallel and crossed polarization data yields more accurate source separation results and improves the uniqueness properties of the solution in blind nonnegative source separation algorithms. The proposed approaches are validated on two real polarized Raman data sets. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
