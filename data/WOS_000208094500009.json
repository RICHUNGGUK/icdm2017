Thus, molecular topology introduce discrete numbers called topological indices as the key descriptors, whereas quantum chemistry introduces the notion of wavefunction and its square (function density) as the mathematical objects able to encode all the information on the molecule. In this work we aim to set up a straightforward link between both formalisms by assigning wave or quasi-wave functions to the graphs. Two ways are followed: The first, on the basis of the Fourier theorem, describes the graph as a sum of sinusoidal functions. The second is a Hermite-like formalism including the graph characteristic polynomials corrected by exponential factor. As illustration of the potential interest of the method, Randic index is interpreted as a specific point of a continuous function and new topological indices are introduced as well. Their usefulness to predict boiling temperatures is also showed.", "paper_title": "Assigning Wave Functions to Graphs: A Way to Introduce Novel Topological Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000208094500009"}
