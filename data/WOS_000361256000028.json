Current incentive schemes allow consumers to reduce their costs, and from the point of view of the supplier play a role in load balancing, but do not lead to optimal demand patterns. In the context of charging fleets of electric vehicles, we propose a centralised method for setting overnight charging schedules. This method uses evolutionary algorithms to automatically search for optimal plans, representing both the charging schedule and the energy drawn from the grid at each time-step. In successive experiments, we optimise for increased state of charge, reduced peak demand, and reduced consumer costs. In simulations, the centralised method achieves improvements in performance relative to simple models of non-centralised consumer behaviour. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
