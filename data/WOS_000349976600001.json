Therefore, it is very important to be able to build efficient and robust personalization techniques to be part of these services. The evaluation step is a crucial stage in their development and improvement, so much more research is needed to overcome this issue. We have proposed an automatic evaluation methodology for personalized information retrieval systems (ASPIRE), which joins the advantages of both system-centred (repeatable, comparable and generalizable results) and user-centred (considers the user) evaluation approaches, and makes the evaluation process easy and fast. Its reliability and robustness have been assessed by means of a user-oriented evaluation. ASPIRE may be considered as an interesting alternative to the costly and difficult user studies, able to discriminate between either different personalization techniques or different parameter configurations of a given personalization method.", "paper_title": "An automatic methodology to evaluate personalized information retrieval systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000349976600001"}
