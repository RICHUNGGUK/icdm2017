It is based on the finite-difference predictor-corrector scheme and is faster than other methods using this kind of scheme. The new technique capitalizes on low-rank approximations of matrices arising after discretization of the coagulation kernel and includes a new fast convolution algorithm with the trapezoidal quadrature rule. For the grids with N nodes, the complexity of the new method is O(NlogN) for each step with time instead of O(N-2) operations required by the standard implementation of the predictor-corrector scheme.
