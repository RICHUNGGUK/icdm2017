A new DVS-enabled DC-DC converter is presented in this paper. State trajectory is employed to analyze the transient features of PWM and PFM Buck converters. A novel transient enhancement circuit is designed to improve the transient response of the DVS-enabled Buck converter. To further expand the output voltage range of the converter, a current-starved voltage controlled delay line is proposed in the controller of DC-DC converter to obtain an ultra low voltage of 0.5 V. When the input voltage is 3.3 V, the output voltage of the converter can be dynamically regulated from 0.5 to 2.0 V. The output voltage tracking speed is less than 7.5 mu s/V and the recovery speed is 33 mu s/A for a load current step from 0.6 to 0.2 A at output voltage of 0.5 V. The chip area is 1.75 mm x 1.33 mm in a 0.18 mu m standard CMOS process.", "paper_title": "A transient enhanced DVS DC-DC converter based on state trajectory analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000336384500010"}
