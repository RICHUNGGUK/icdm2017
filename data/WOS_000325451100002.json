However, the main disadvantage of an s chart is its slowness to signal small increases in the variability. In this paper, ideas of adaptive control charts are extended to the Shewhart s chart for improving the efficiency in signalling increases in the standard deviation. A Markov chain model is applied to evaluate its performances and compares its performances with combined double sampling and variable sampling intervals s chart, variable parameters (VP) R chart, exponentially weighted moving average and Cusum charts. The statistical performances show that the VP s chart is more sensitive to increases in standard deviation.", "paper_title": "Design of adaptive s control charts", "paper_id": "WOS:000325451100002"}
