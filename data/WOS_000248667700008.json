This paper presents a novel application of computers and Internet technology in chemical engineering education that highlights interactive learning for an undergraduate course in online measurement and control. The proposed client-server architecture can be adapted to drive different kinds of devices and can be easily expanded. The developed online laboratory has been tested by many students using different connections and operating conditions. This Internet-based solution can improve undergraduate engineering education in a conventional unit operation laboratory. As an example, the application of remote experiments to characterize a plug flow reactor is described.
