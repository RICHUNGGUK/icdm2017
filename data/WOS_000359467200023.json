In this paper, Limited-Random Sequence (LRS) matrix is utilized to implement the blind CS detection, which benefits from zero error and lower complexity. The performance in Bit Error Rate (BER) and error-free detection probability confirms the validity and efficiency of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Blind Compressive Sensing Detection of Watermark Coded by Limited-Random Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000359467200023"}
