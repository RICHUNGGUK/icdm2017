In the colored (or categorical) range-searching problem, the set of input points is partitioned into categories; the answer to a query is a piece of information about categories of points in a query range. In this article, we describe several new results for one- and two-dimensional range-searching problems. We obtain an optimal adaptive data structure for counting the number of objects in a three-sided range and for counting categories of objects in a one-dimensional range. We also obtain new results on color range reporting in two dimensions, approximate color counting in one dimension, and some other related problems.", "paper_title": "Efficient Range Searching for Categorical and Plain Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000331124300009"}
