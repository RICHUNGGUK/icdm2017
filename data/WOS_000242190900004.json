In this paper we explore a new architecture of Bayesian classifier that can be used to understand how biological mechanisms differ with respect to time. We show that this classifier improves the classification of microarray data and at the same time ensures that the models can easily be analysed by biologists by incorporating time transparently. In this paper we focus on data that has been generated to explore different types of muscular dystrophy.", "paper_title": "Temporal Bayesian classifiers for modelling muscular dystrophy expression data", "paper_id": "WOS:000242190900004"}
