The traditional fading channel models, such as Rayleigh, Rice, Nakagami-m and multipath channel models, can not describe the whole property of the channels of CR communications. In this letter, the statistical channel modeling scheme for aeronautical CR communications is proposed with a M/M/s(1) queuing model, which properly describes the random spectrum occupation of the primary users, i.e. aircrafts in aeronautical communications. The proposed channel model can be easily utilized in the channel simulation to testify the validity and efficiency of the aeronautical CR communications.", "paper_title": "Statistical Channel Modeling for Aeronautical Cognitive Radio Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567000011"}
