Based on T-S fuzzy models, not only fuzzy model of the time delay memristor-based Chua' circuit is constructed but the fuzzy control vector can also be derived to synchronize two different time delay memristor-based Chua's circuits. Due to the dynamical behavior with complex transient transitions of the memristor-based chaotic system which is heavily dependent on the initial state of the memristor except for the circuit parameters, the memristor-based chaotic system can generate more complex and unpredictable time domain signals. An application to chaos secure communication is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed chaotic synchronization scheme.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of Fuzzy Modeling Chaotic Time Delay Memristor-Based Chua's Circuits with Application to Secure Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000356335400009"}
