We propose a new test for autocorrelation that is robust in the presence of a break in variance. The proposed test is a modified LM test based on a generalized least squares regression. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new test performs well in finite samples and it is especially comparable to other existing heteroskedasticity-robust tests in terms of size, and much better in terms of power.", "paper_title": "A robust test for autocorrelation in the presence of a structural break in variance", "paper_id": "WOS:000334334500010"}
