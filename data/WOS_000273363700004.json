For the simulation of turbulence, vortex methods can now be considered as an interesting alternative to finite difference and spectral methods. The present study focuses on the efficient implementation of the fast multipole method and pseudo-particle method on a cluster of NVIDIA CeForce 8800 GT GPUs, and applies this to a vortex method calculation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The results of the present vortex method agree quantitatively with that of the reference calculation using a spectral method. We achieved a maximum speed of 7.48 TFlops using 64 GPUs, and the cost performance was near $9.4/GFlops. The calculation of the present vortex method on 64 GPUs took 4120 s, while the spectral method on 32 CPUs took 4910 s. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
