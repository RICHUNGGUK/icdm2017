How to effectively schedule messages to improve the performance of array re-decomposition has received much attention in recent years. This paper is devoted to develop efficient scheduling algorithms using the compiling information provided by array distribution patterns, array alignment patterns and the periodic property of array accesses. Our algorithms not only avoid inter-processor contention, but also reduces real communication cost and communication generation time. The experimental results show that the performance of array redecomposition can be significantly improved using our algorithms (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
