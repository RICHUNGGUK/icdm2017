The pendulum model is first time introduced into the physical modeling and formation mechanism analysis of surface clutter, and the quantitative expression of clutter spectrum spread is analytically obtained. Under the assumption of pendulum model, the processing results of measured clutter data agree well with the results of theoretical analysis, which fully verifies the correctness of pendulum model and reveals the formation mechanism of surface clutter spectrum in forward scattering radar. Furthermore, according to the stability of clutter spectrum spread with respect to carrier frequencies and wind speed, the optimal cutoff frequencies of clutter filter can be obtained, which establishes the basis for moving target detection and accurate parameters estimation.", "paper_title": "Physical modeling and spectrum spread analysis of surface clutter in forward scattering radar", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362900014"}
