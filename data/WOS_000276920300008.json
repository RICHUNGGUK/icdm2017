In an effort to improve the efficiency of its usage, alternative spectrum allocation models are being proposed. One of these approaches is the Dynamic Spectrum Access which allows the cognitive radio to use or share the spectrum in an opportunistic manner. This paper proposes a framework for an architecture where unutilized bands are relicensed to different service providers on a short term basis. This framework focuses on the resource allocation process of these leased bands to customers. The proposed model could be utilized as a decision support tool which both satisfies the quality of service requirements of individual users and achieve an efficient utilization of network resources. The hypothesis is that customer information yields an efficient customer-oriented resource management strategy; therefore the allocation process integrates the information about the customer demographics and usage behavior. Simulations with real-life scenarios in cellular networks have been performed: handoff decision, resource allocation at call initiation and profit maximization in allocation of mobile base stations. In each case, the results show that the proposed model performs better in terms of revenue increase when compared to the First-Come First-Serve based approach. The simulation results prove that the population size of a customer group is not always an indicator for higher revenue for a service provider. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
