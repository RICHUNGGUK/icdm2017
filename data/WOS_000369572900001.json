Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising cryptographic primitive, which has been widely applied to design fine-grained access control system recently. However, ABE is criticized for its high scheme overhead as the computational cost grows with the complexity of the access formula. This disadvantage becomes more serious for mobile devices with constrained computing resources. Aiming at tackling the challenge above, we present a generic and efficient solution to implement attribute-based access control system by introducing secure outsourcing techniques into ABE. More precisely, two cloud service providers (CSPs), namely key generation-cloud service provider (KG-CSP) and decryption-cloud service provider (D-CSP) are introduced to perform the outsourced key-issuing and decryption on behalf of attribute authority and users respectively. In order to outsource heavy computation to both CSPs without private information leakage, we formalize an underlying primitive called outsourced ABE (OABE) and propose several constructions with outsourced decryption and key-issuing. Finally, extensive experiment demonstrates that with the help of KG-CSP and D-CSP, efficient key-issuing and decryption are achieved in our constructions.", "paper_title": "New access control systems based on outsourced attribute-based encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000369572900001"}
