The positioning algorithm is an improved Received Signal Strength Indication- (RSSI-) based ranging method. To preprocess the RSSI data Gaussian filter and mean filter are adopted. A sector transmission model is constructed and applied to divide the area around the anchor node into several sectors, and the shadowing model of each sector is measured. Then the average of all RSSI values in a particular sector is considered as the final RSSI value for distance calculation. The calculated distances designated for trilateration are also optimized to eliminate the abnormal distances from positioning calculations. Positioning experiment is designed via ZigBee facilities. The results show that the proposed algorithm greatly improves the positioning accuracy and stability; for instance, the average positioning error is reduced from 1.32 m to 0.79 m. Moreover, this study also proves that the node position has great influence on the positioning accuracy.", "paper_title": "An Improved RSSI-Based Positioning Method Using Sector Transmission Model and Distance Optimization Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000362742300001"}
