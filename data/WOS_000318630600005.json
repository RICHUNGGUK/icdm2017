Collaborative communities can create, update and maintain content models for multimedia resources more effectively than single users working alone. This paper presents MC2, a framework for MPEG-7 content-modelling communities. MC2 is based on the challenges to collaborative multimedia content modelling reported in the research literature and the results of an experiment undertaken to investigate user behaviour in collaborative content modelling. An MC2 service has also been implemented as a proof of concept for this framework, which is evaluated with a population of users and against the challenges.", "paper_title": "MC2: A Framework and Service for MPEG-7 Content-Modelling Communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000318630600005"}
