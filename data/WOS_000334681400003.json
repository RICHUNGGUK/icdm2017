To achieve optimal impedance matching for the lower and upper operating bands, the proposed antenna structure is designed as a quasi-self-complementary (QSC) type, in which the lower (2.4 GHz) operating band is excited through the loop-like structure of the proposed antenna, whereas its self-complementary counterpart (rectangular patch structure) induces the upper (5.2/5.8 GHz) operating band. Further investigation was also conducted by printing the proposed QSC antenna onto a flexible substrate of 0.063 mm in thickness. To cover both operating bands, the proposed flexible antenna was restructured to 20.5 x 8 mm(2). The design and initial characteristics of the two proposed antennas were discussed in detail via simulation, and the experimental results showed satisfactory performance of both operating bands.
