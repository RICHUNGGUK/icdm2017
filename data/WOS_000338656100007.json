We then determine the feasible parameters of such designs that could have a quasi-symmetric residual design with respect to a block, and classify them into two possible families. Finally, we consider the feasible parameters of symmetric designs with inner balance as defined by Nilson andHeidtmann (Des. Codes Cryptogr. doi:10.1007/s10623-012-9730-2, (2012)), and show that (with one exception) they must all belong to one of these families.", "paper_title": "Admissible parameters of symmetric designs satisfying and symmetric designs with inner balance", "paper_id": "WOS:000338656100007"}
