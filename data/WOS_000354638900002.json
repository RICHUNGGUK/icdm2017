This paper dedicates to increase the number of independent voltage measurements by scanning electrode (SE), and design an optimal measurement and stimulation pattern for open electrical impedance tomography (OEIT). Firstly, several measurement patterns are, performed in OEIT, aiming to evaluate the right number of the measurement points for the imaged target in a certain depth. The results indicate that the image quality gets higher with the number of measurement point increased to some extent. Thus, it can guide the optimum design for the electrode system in OEIT. Secondly, through the numerical calculation and salt water tank experiment, in contrast to adjacent current injection pattern, cross-current-injection pattern achieves better reconstruction with higher imaging quality and penetration depth, and is more robust against data noise in deep domain. Lastly, the experiments also indicate that the electrode contact area affects the reconstruction quality and investigation depth. Therefore, OEIT with SE can improve the application in clinic, such as the detection and monitoring of vascular, breast, and pulmonary diseases.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of measurement and stimulation patterns in open electrical impedance tomography with scanning electrode", "paper_id": "WOS:000354638900002"}
