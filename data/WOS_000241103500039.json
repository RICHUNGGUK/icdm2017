It makes possible to combine easily different parsing techniques handling different language aspects into a single parser. Such composition moreover preserves simplicity of design of the combined parts. It opens new ways of parsing for linguistic purposes.", "paper_title": "Parsing with oracle", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500039"}
