Most existing tutoring systems respond to students' mistakes by providing links to a collection of teaching materials. Such an approach does the individual needs of each student. Our idea is to apply a holistic approach that involves looking at the whole system of each student knowledge within an subject rather than just concentrating on single mistakes, lack of knowledge or misconception.", "paper_title": "Application of association rules for finding correlations among students preliminary knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500037"}
