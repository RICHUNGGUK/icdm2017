When these values are not accurate, TCP cannot utilize the bandwidth fully or may generate multiple packet drops. Unfortunately, estimating these parameters are not easy, since little network state information is available for the TCP connection initially. From earlier research, a TCP parameter of a previous connection with the same destination was suggested to be used for a new TCP connection. However, the effectiveness of this method is limited, since the cached parameter of single destination is used. As another attempt, a network monitor was adopted to identify the connections sharing the same subnet, and an averaged parameter of those connections was used for a new TCP connection. In this approach, the overhead of the network monitor may be high. In this paper, fairness of TCP connections sharing the same bottleneck links is considered in obtaining ssthresh and cwnd of a new TCP connection without a network monitor. For evaluation, these parameters are used in simulation with four different slow start strategies, namely, LISS, ISS, MISS, and JS, depending on which parameters are used and whether packet pacing is used. The simulation results show that our estimation method works well for homogeneous and moderately heterogenous environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
