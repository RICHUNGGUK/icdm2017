This resolves a long-standing open problem. The algorithm is a variant of the dynamic all-pairs shortest paths algorithm of Demetrescu and Italiano [2006]. The analysis relies on a proof that the number of locally shortest paths in such randomly weighted graphs is O(n(2)), in expectation and with high probability. We also present a dynamic version of the algorithm that recomputes all shortest paths after a random edge update in O(log(2) n) expected time.", "paper_title": "All-Pairs Shortest Paths in O(n(2)) Time with High Probability", "paper_id": "WOS:000324577800004"}
