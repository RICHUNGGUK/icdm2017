As these approaches are good at dealing with discrete values, a discretizer is required when the approaches are applied to continuous attributes. In this paper, a novel adaptive discretizer based on a statistical distribution index is proposed to preprocess continuous valued attributes in an instance information system, so that the knowledge discovery approaches based on rough sets can reach a high decision accuracy. The experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the proposed discretizer is able to improve the decision accuracy.", "paper_title": "A novel discretizer for knowledge discovery approaches based on rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500035"}
