The spiking NN architecture dynamically changes the atrioventricular (AV) delay and interventricular (W) interval parameters according to the information provided by the intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) and hemodynamic sensors. The spiking NN coprocessor performs the adaptive part and is controlled by a deterministic algorithm master controller. The simulated cardiac output obtained with the adaptive CRT device is 30% higher than with a nonadaptive CRT device and is likely to provide improvement in the quality of life for patients with congestive heart failure. The spiking NN architecture shows synaptic plasticity acquired during the learning process. The synaptic plasticity is manifested by a dynamic learning rate parameter that correlates patterns of hemodynamic sensor with the system outputs, i.e., the optimal AV and VV pacing intervals.", "paper_title": "Adaptive cardiac resynchronization therapy device based on spiking neurons architecture and reinforcement learning scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000244970900017"}
