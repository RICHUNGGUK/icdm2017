The problem of detecting and characterizing such anti-community structure has attracted recent attention. In this paper, we first define the anti-modularity as a quantitative measure of anti-community partitioning on a network. We also theoretically and empirically show the reliability of anti-modularity as a measurement of the quality of an anti-community partitioning. A label propagation algorithm LPAD for anti-community detection is proposed. Experimental results on synthetic and real world networks show that our algorithm LPAD can obtain higher quality anti-community partitioning than other methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
