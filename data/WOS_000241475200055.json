Video streaming, video conferencing, online interactive gaming, and mobile TV are only a few of the applications expected to support the viability, and survival, of next generation mobile wireless networks. It is, therefore, significant to analyze the interaction of the particular media and applications. This paper presents the characteristics of mobile wireless networks and relates these characteristics to the requirements of video transmission. The relationship derived is based not only on the objective QoS metrics measured in the network, but also on the subjective quality measures obtained by video viewers at end hosts. Through this work we establish guidelines for the transmission of video based on the limits of mobile and wireless networks. We believe that the results help researchers and professionals in the fields of video production and encoding to create videos of high efficiency, in terms of resource utilization, and of high performance, in terms of end-user satisfaction.", "paper_title": "Requirements for the transmission of streaming video in mobile wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200055"}
