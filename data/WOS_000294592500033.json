Inherently, an identity-based trapdoor mercurial commitment is an underlying building block for constructing identity-based (non-interactive) zero-knowledge sets. That is, a prover can commit to a set S in a way that reveals nothing about S and prove to a verifier, in zero-knowledge, statements of the form x is an element of S and x is not an element of S. Besides, although the (non-interactive) proof is publicly verifiable, it is also bound to the identity of the prover in a way which is recognizable to any verifier. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
