The medium is defined in terms of an extended scatterer or target which is surrounded by many small scatterers. By extending the classic Foldy-Lax formulation we developed an efficient algorithm for numerical wave propagation in two dimension. In the method that we set forth multiple scattering among the point scatterers and the extended target is fully taken into account via a boundary integral formulation coupled with the Foldy-Lax formulation. This formulation forms the basis for our numerical procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Generalized Foldy-Lax formulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000277944400007"}
