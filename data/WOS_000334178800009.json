Using the DSC technique, a novel fault diagnostic algorithm is proposed, which removes the classical assumption that the time derivative of the output error should be known. Further, an accommodation scheme is proposed to compensate for both actuator time-varying gain and bias faults, and avoids the controller singularity. In addition, the proposed controller guarantees that all signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed FTC approach is demonstrated on a simulated aircraft longitudinal dynamics example.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fuzzy Observer-Based Active Fault-Tolerant Dynamic Surface Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Actuator Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000334178800009"}
