We first explain definition and geometric representation of affine constraints. Next, we derive integrating algorithms to calculate independent first integrals of affine constraints for the two cases where the they are completely integrable and partially nonintegrable. Moreover, we prove the existence of inverse functions in the algorithms. Some examples are also shown to verify our results.", "paper_title": "Integrating Algorithms for Integrable Affine Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300057"}
