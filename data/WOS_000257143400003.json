However, the stack of low-resolution ( LR) observations is space-variantly blurred because of the. nite depth of field of the camera. The authors propose to exploit the defocus information in the stack of LR images to obtain a super-resolved image as well as a high-resolution (HR) depth map of the underlying 3D object. Appropriate observation models are used to describe the image formation process in SFF. Local spatial dependencies of the intensities of pixels and their depth values are accounted for by modelling the HR image and the HR structure as independent Markov random fields. Taking as input the LR images from the stack and the LR depth map, the authors first obtain the super-resolved image of the 3D specimen and use it subsequently to reconstruct a HR depth pro. le of the object.", "paper_title": "Harnessing defocus blur to recover high-resolution information in shape-from-focus technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000257143400003"}
