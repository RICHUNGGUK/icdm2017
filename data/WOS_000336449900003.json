As a possible CEA system, a prototype of a two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) continuous-state coupled elastic actuator (CCEA) is designed to provide a compromise between performance and safety. Using a pair of antagonistic four-bar linkages, the inherent stiffness of the system can be adjusted dynamically. In addition, the optimal control in a simple various stiffness model is used to illustrate how to find the optimal stiffness and force trajectories. Using the optimal control results, the shortest distance control is proposed to control the stiffness and force trajectory of the CCEA. Compared to state-of-the-art variable stiffness actuators, the CCEA system is unique in that it can achieve near-zero mechanical stiffness efficiently and the shortest distance control provides an easy way to control various stiffness mechanisms. Finally, a CCEA exoskeleton is built for elbow rehabilitation. Simulations and experiments are conducted to show the desired properties of the proposed CCEA system and the performance of the shortest distance control.", "paper_title": "Mechanism and Control of Continuous-State Coupled Elastic Actuation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336449900003"}
