Moreover, ECODE efficiently and reliably detects road segments with high traffic congestion in any urban grid-layout area. The traffic situation and the congestion level of each road segment changes from time to time. Proactive, reactive, and hybrid iterative execution schemes have been proposed to execute ECODE repeatedly and to thus obtain a more real-time traffic evaluation of each road segment. These iterative execution schemes aim also at investigating the effects of several data dissemination mechanisms that are usually used to control the congestion over the communication network. ECODE is discussed and its performance is reported on and compared to previous protocols in this field; an extensive set of scenarios and experiments have been used which are in turn implemented by NS-2. From the experimental results, ECODE achieves a 30% more accurate evaluation of traffic characteristics compared to previous protocols in this field. Moreover, it consumes on average 60% of the bandwidth that was consumed by the previous protocols. Considering the iterative execution schemes of ECODE, the proactive scheme consumes 50% more bandwidth than the reactive scheme. However, the accuracy of the traffic evaluation per road segment using the reactive scheme is lower than the accuracy of the proactive scheme used for short intervals. The hybrid scheme lies between the proactive and the reactive schemes in terms of the bandwidth consumption and the accuracy of congestion level evaluation. Finally, we have used ECODE to evaluate the traffic congestion level and to investigate the traffic distribution over some main streets in the downtown area of Ottawa; this has been set up as a practical example of the application of ECODE.
