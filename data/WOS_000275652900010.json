The application layer Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), standardized by 3GPP and 3GPP2 for IMS, is responsible for IMS session establishment, management, and transformation. The IEEE 802.16 worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMax) promises to provide high data rate broadband wireless access services. In this paper, we propose two novel interworking architectures to integrate WiMax and third-generation (3G) networks. Moreover, we analyze the SIP-based IMS registration and session setup signaling delay for 3G and WiMax networks with specific reference to their interworking architectures. Finally, we explore the effects of different WiMax-3G interworking architectures on the IMS registration and session setup signaling delay.", "paper_title": "SIP-Based IMS Signaling Analysis for WiMax-3G Interworking Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000275652900010"}
