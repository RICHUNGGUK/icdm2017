In this article, we describe methods for efficient segmentation of range images and organized point clouds. In order to achieve real-time performance in complex environments, we focus our approach on simple but robust solutions. We present a fast approach to surface reconstruction in range images and organized point clouds by means of approximate polygonal meshing. The obtained local surface information and neighborhoods are then used to (1) smooth the underlying measurements, and (2) segment the image into planar regions and other geometric primitives. A comparative evaluation using publicly available data sets shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while being significantly faster than other methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
