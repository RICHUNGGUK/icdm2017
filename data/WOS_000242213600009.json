The framework enables a mobile agent to be composed from two layered components, which are mobile agents. The former is a carrier of the latter over particular networks independent of any management tasks and the latter defines management tasks performed at each host independently of any networks. The framework also offers a mechanism for matchmaking the two components. Since the mechanism is formulated on a process algebra approach, it can accurately select the appropriate itinerary component to perform management tasks at hosts that the tasks want to visit over networks. The framework provides a methodology for easily developing and operating mobile agents for traveling among multiple sub-networks to perform their management tasks at all of the nodes that they visit. This paper also describes the framework, its prototype implementation, and a practical application.", "paper_title": "Building and selecting mobile agents for network management", "paper_id": "WOS:000242213600009"}
