How to model fuzziness of a spatial object is a main task of next generation GIS. This paper proposes basic fuzzy spatial object types based on fuzzy topology. These object types are the natural extension of current non-fuzzy spatial object types. A fuzzy cell complex structure is defined for modeling fuzzy regions, lines and points. Furthermore, fuzzy topological relations between these fuzzy spatial objects are formalized based on the 9-intersection approach. This model can be implemented for GIS applications due to its scientific theory basis.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy topological relations between fuzzy spatial objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000037"}
