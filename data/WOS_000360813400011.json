The learned subspace is adopted as an intermediate space to reduce the semantic gap between the low-level visual features and the high-level semantics. To guarantee the subspace to be compact and discriminative, the intrinsic geometric structure of data, and the local and global structural consistencies over labels are exploited simultaneously in the proposed algorithm. Besides, we adopt the l(2,1)-norm for the formulations of loss function and regularization respectively to make our algorithm robust to the outliers and noise. An efficient algorithm is designed to solve the proposed optimization problem. It is noted that the proposed framework is a general one which can leverage several well-known algorithms as special cases and elucidate their intrinsic relationships. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on diversity datasets for different image understanding tasks, i.e., image tagging, clustering, and classification, and the more encouraging results are achieved compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "Robust Structured Subspace Learning for Data Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000360813400011"}
