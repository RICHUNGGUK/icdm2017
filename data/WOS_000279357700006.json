The Gen 2 standard allows for a range of PHY layer configurations and does not specify exactly how to compose protocol messages to inventory tags. This has made it difficult to know how well the standard works, and how it is implemented in practice. Our platform provides much needed visibility into Gen 2 systems by capturing reader transmissions using the USRP2 and decoding them in real-time using software we have developed and released to the public. In essence, our platform delivers much of the functionality of expensive (> $50,000) conformance testing products, with greater extensibility at a small fraction of the cost. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the platform and evaluate its effectiveness, showing that it has better than 99% accuracy up to 3 meters. We then use the platform to study a commercial RFID reader, showing how the Gen 2 standard is realized, and indicate avenues for research at both the PHY and MAC layers.", "paper_title": "A \"Gen 2\" RFID Monitor Based on the USRP", "paper_id": "WOS:000279357700006"}
