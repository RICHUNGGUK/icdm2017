This will result in a query that can be evaluated locally thus reducing query process time and the amount of communication required to obtain related data. In this study, new algorithms are proposed to arrange shared documents in peers into hierarchical cluster tree structures, and links will be set up to connect semantically related super peers. During query evaluation, only related peers will be searched thus the complexity of computing is significantly reduced. Consideration is also given to automatically deciding the threshold for clustering and the construction and other essential operations for hierarchical cluster trees. The experiment results illustrate the features of the approach developed in this study.", "paper_title": "Organisation and management of shared documents in super-peer networks based semantic hierarchical cluster trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000301869900007"}
