Though linear correlation has been extensively used to characterize brain connectivity, it is limited to detecting first order dependencies. In this study, we propose a framework where in phase synchronization (PS) between brain regions is characterized using a new metric \"correlation between probabilities of recurrence\" (CPR) and subsequent graph-theoretic analysis of the ensuing networks. We applied this method to resting state fMRI data obtained from human subjects with and without administration of propofol anesthetic. Our results showed decreased PS during anesthesia and a biologically more plausible community structure using CPR rather than linear correlation. We conclude that CPR provides an attractive nonparametric method for modeling interactions in brain networks as compared to standard correlation for obtaining physiologically meaningful insights about brain function.", "paper_title": "PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION IN BRAIN NETWORKS DERIVED FROM CORRELATION BETWEEN PROBABILITIES OF RECURRENCES IN FUNCTIONAL MRI DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000317626200002"}
