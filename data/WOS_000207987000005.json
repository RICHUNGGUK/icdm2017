Here we set out a methodological framework that helps understand different approaches to solving this problem. We argue that a very powerful stratagem is to attempt to 'reverse engineer' the brain and that computational neuroscience plays a pivotal role in this programme. En passant, we also tackle the oftasked and prior question of why we should build computational models of any kind. Our framework uses four levels of conceptual analysis: computation, algorithm, mechanism and biological substrate. As such it enables us to understand how (algorithmic) AI and connectionism may be recruited to help propel the reverse-engineering programme forward. The framework also incorporates the notion of different levels of structural description of the brain, and analysis of this issue gives rise to a novel proposal for capturing computations at multiple levels of description in a single model.", "paper_title": "Reverse Engineering the Vertebrate Brain: Methodological Principles for a Biologically Grounded Programme of Cognitive Modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000207987000005"}
