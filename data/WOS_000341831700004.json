In this paper we study the problem of constructing the shortest tour visiting all lines of a city railway system. This combinatorial optimization problem has links with the classic graph circuit problems and operations research. A broad set of fast algorithms is proposed and evaluated on simulated networks and example cities of the world. We analyze the trade-off between algorithm runtime and solution quality. Time evolution of the trade-off is also captured. Then, the algorithms are tested on a range of instances with diverse features. On the basis of the algorithm performance, measured with various quality indicators, we draw conclusions on the nature of the above combinatorial problem and the tacit assumptions made while designing the algorithms.", "paper_title": "Mind the gap: a heuristic study of subway tours", "paper_id": "WOS:000341831700004"}
