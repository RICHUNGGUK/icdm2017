This leads to biased parameter estimates when interactions are present in a dataset. With the aim of providing an imputation method which preserves interactions in the data automatically, the use of recursive partitioning as imputation method is examined. Three recursive partitioning techniques are implemented in the multiple imputation by chained equations framework. It is investigated, using simulated data, whether recursive partitioning creates appropriate variability between imputations and unbiased parameter estimates with appropriate confidence intervals. It is concluded that, when interaction effects are present in a dataset, substantial gains are possible by using recursive partitioning for imputation compared to standard applications. In addition, it is shown that the potential of recursive partitioning imputation approaches depends on the relevance of a possible interaction effect, the correlation structure of the data, and the type of possible interaction effect present in the data.
