Apart from the normal multicast transmission over UMTS, we consider the handling of exceptional cases caused by user mobility scenarios. The proposed scheme is in accordance with the current specifications of the Multimedia Multicast/Broadcast Service (MBMS) defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and introduces minor modifications in the UMTS architecture and the mobility management mechanisms. The proposed scheme is implemented as an ns-2 network simulator module. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated and analyzed through ns-2 simulation experiments. This new module can be employed to investigate various aspects of UMTS multicast. Furthermore, in order to further highlight the contribution of our mechanism, we have implemented two multicast congestion control mechanisms for UMTS and we have measured their performance for MBMS transmissions.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Mechanism for UMTS Multicast Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000284161400004"}
