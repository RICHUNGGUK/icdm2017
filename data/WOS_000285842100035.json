In this paper, we show that at N = pq, there are many suitable modifications other than the Jacobi or modified Jacobi sequences. Furthermore, we will give three new modifications to the character sequences of length N = pq. Based on these new modifications, for any pair of large p and q, we can construct a binary sequence of length 2pq so that such families of sequences have asymptotic merit factor 6.0 without cyclic shifting of the base sequences.", "paper_title": "Modifications of Modified Jacobi Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000285842100035"}
