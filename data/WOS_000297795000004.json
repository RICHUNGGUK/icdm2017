The most important aspect of this proposal is that the design uses learning as the means to optimize the quality of the presentations. This fuzzy system is used to select the most appropriate group of paragraphs for a presentation. The beliefs of the robot continue evolving in order to coincide with the opinions of the public. It uses a genetic algorithm for the evolution of the rules.", "paper_title": "APG: An Intelligent Automatic Generator of Presentations for Tour-Guide Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000297795000004"}
