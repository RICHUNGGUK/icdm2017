This article provides an overview of various non-cryptographic mechanisms for user authentication and device identification in wireless networks using lower/physical layer properties or information. We discuss merits and demerits of these authentication/identification schemes and the practical implementation issues. Future research on cross-layer security design concludes this article.", "paper_title": "NON-CRYPTOGRAPHIC AUTHENTICATION AND IDENTIFICATION IN WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283448700011"}
