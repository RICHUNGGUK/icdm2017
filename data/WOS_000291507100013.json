This can be achieved by parsing a silhouette into parts and relationships that do not change across similar object views. Medial descriptions, such as skeletons and shock graphs, provide part-based decompositions but suffer from instabilities. As a result, similar shapes may be represented by dissimilar part sets. We propose a novel shape parsing approach which is based on identifying and regularizing the ligature structure of a medial axis, leading to a bone graph, a medial abstraction which captures a more stable notion of an object's parts. Our experiments show that it offers improved recognition and pose estimation performance in the presence of within-class deformation over the shock graph. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
