Nevertheless, as an inherently limited representation of a more complex information need, every query can arguably be considered ambiguous to some extent. In order to tackle query ambiguity, search result diversification approaches have recently been proposed to produce rankings aimed to satisfy the multiple possible information needs underlying a query. In this survey, we review the published literature on search result diversification. In particular, we discuss the motivations for diversifying the search results for an ambiguous query and provide a formal definition of the search result diversification problem. In addition, we describe the most successful approaches in the literature for producing and evaluating diversity in multiple search domains. Finally, we also discuss recent advances as well as open research directions in the field of search result diversification.", "paper_title": "Search Result Diversification", "paper_id": "WOS:000352315300001"}
