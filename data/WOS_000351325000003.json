Reversible data hiding in encrypted images is a technique that makes contribution to cloud data management in privacy preserving and data security. In previous works, Zhang and Hong presented two reversible dada hiding methods in encrypted images, respectively. However, Zhang's work neglected the pixels in the borders of image blocks, and Hong et al.'s research only considered two adjacent pixels of each pixel. In addition, their works only considered that all image blocks are embedded into additional data. In this paper, we propose a novel method of evaluating the complexity of image blocks, which considers multiple neighboring pixels according to the locations of different pixels. Furthermore, data embedding ratio is considered. Experiments show that this novel method can reduce average extracted-bit error rate when the block size is appropriate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
