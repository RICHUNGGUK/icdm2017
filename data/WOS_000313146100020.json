The design strategy is based on the following findings related to the operation of low-power CMOS circuits: (1) The minimum operation voltage (V-DDmin) of a circuit is dominated by flip-flops (FFs), and V-DDmin of an FF can be improved by upsizing a few key transistors, (2) V-DDmin of an FF is stochastically modeled by a log-normal distribution, (3) V-DDmin of a large circuit can be efficiently estimated by using the above model, which eliminates extensive Monte Carlo simulations, and (4) improving V-DDmin may substantially contribute to decreasing energy consumption. The effectiveness of the proposed design strategy has been verified through circuit simulations on various circuits, which clearly show the design tradeoff between voltage scaling and transistor sizing.", "paper_title": "A Variability-Aware Energy-Minimization Strategy for Subthreshold Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100020"}
