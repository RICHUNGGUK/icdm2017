The flow analysis has been developed without low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. The analysis consists of a perturbation expansion in terms of the small wave number. Computations have been established for the pressure gradient, stream function, magnetic force function, axial induced magnetic field and current distribution across the channel. The effects of pertinent parameters on the pressure rise per wavelength are investigated by means of numerical integrations. We also study the effect of these parameters on magnetic force function, axial induced magnetic field and current distribution across the channel. The phenomena of trapping and pumping are further discussed.
