Our model differs significantly from others, e.g., based on machine learning techniques, because we use a linguistic model to represent the subjective designer's perceptions of the human gait process. This model is easily understood and provides good results. We include a practical demonstration with an equal error rate of 3%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
