In recent years, several papers proposed scheduling algorithms to execute redistributions under different constraints in a minimal amount of time. More recently with the expansion of grid computing, several algorithms have been proposed to schedule the messages in a redistribution taking place between two distant clusters. Here, we describe different existing scheduling methods and explain the differences between them. We present a comparison between them for the cases of local redistributions and inter-cluster redistributions.", "paper_title": "Scheduling messages for data redistribution: An experimental study", "paper_id": "WOS:000242290400002"}
