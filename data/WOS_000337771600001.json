The originality of our approach, in contrast with classical factor models is the identification of two factors driving univariate series at well-separated time scales. This is tested with simulated data as well as foreign exchange data. Furthermore, we exploit the model calibration problem of implied volatility surface by postulating a computational scheme, which consists of McMC estimation and variance reduction techniques in MC/QMC simulations for option evaluation under multi-scale stochastic volatility models. Empirical studies and its extension are discussed. (C) 2014 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
