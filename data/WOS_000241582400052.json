We show that the dynamic dominance checks used in symmetry breaking by dominance-detection search for CSPs with piecewise variable and value symmetries have a static counterpart: there exists a set of constraints that can be posted at the root node and that breaks all these symmetries. The amount of these symmetry-breaking constraints is linear in the size of the problem, but they possibly remove a super-exponential number of symmetries on both values and variables. Moreover, static and dynamic structural symmetry breaking coincide for static variable and value orderings.", "paper_title": "Static and dynamic structural symmetry breaking", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400052"}
