In this paper, we partially solve two conjectures on the Randic index R(G) with relations to the diameter D(G) and the average distance mu(G) of a graph G. We prove that for any connected graph G of order n with minimum degree delta(G), if delta(G) >= 5, then R(G) - D(G) >= root 2 - n+1/2; if delta(G) >= n/5 and n >= 15, R(G)/D(G) >= n-3+2 root 2/2n-2 and R(G) >= mu(G). Furthermore, for any arbitrary real number epsilon (0 < epsilon < 1), if delta(G) >= epsilon n, then R(G)/D(G) >= n-3+2 root 2/2n-2 and R(G) >= mu(G) hold for sufficiently large n.", "paper_title": "Randic Index, Diameter and Average Distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000283270800009"}
