In this paper, we present efficient methods for convolution product computation which is a dominant operation of NTRU. The new methods are based on the observation that repeating patterns in coefficients of an NTRU polynomial can be used for the construction of look-up tables, which is a similar approach to the sliding window methods for exponentiation. We provide efficient convolution algorithms to implement this idea, and we make a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of the new algorithms. We also give software implementations over a Pentium IV CPU, a MICAz mote, and a CUDA-based GPGPU platform. 'According to our analyses and experimental results, the new algorithms speed up the NTRU encryption and decryption operations by up to 41%.", "paper_title": "Efficient Implementation of NTRU Cryptosystem Using Sliding Window Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000314080500023"}
