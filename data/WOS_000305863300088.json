This paper explores its reliability and accuracy according to the type of operator used for the detection of edges. An algorithm has been used which processes a photographic image according to the operator selected. The result is a point cloud which is then used to find the desired solution. The comparison between the four discrete gradient operators (Frei-Chen, Prewitt, Roberts and Sobel) has been made taking into account the resolution of the image and the number of vanishing points. The results obtained show that Frei-Chen's operator shows good performance in determining vanishing points with respect to the spatial X axis, Sobel's operator is the best for determining the vanishing point with respect to the spatial Y axis, Roberts' operator gives good results for calculating vanishing points in both spatial axes, and Prewitt's operator is not appropriate for processing this type of image.
