We propose a fast grasp synthesis system which enables a user to choose the desired grasping styles from a set of grasp types in a human grasp taxonomy. Given a 3D model of an object, our system detects graspable positions and generates grasping hand postures in every applicable grasp types in the grasp taxonomy for each grasping position. Hand postures are generated separately for each digit, and hand alignment is then refined iteratively. A user can also specify the grasping position by moving the cursor onto object surface, as well as grasp type. The generated hand postures are shown as a table of thumbnail images, and the user can select the grasping hand posture by clicking on one of those postures. Our system enables interactive generation of various grasping hand postures in real time.", "paper_title": "Fast Grasp Synthesis for Various Shaped Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000306182500004"}
