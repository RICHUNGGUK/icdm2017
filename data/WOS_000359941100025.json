The idea of the CBO is derived from one-dimensional collisions between bodies, in which each agent solution is considered as a massed object or body. Optimization of structures with dynamic frequency constraints, attributable to having nonconvex and numerous local optima in its search space, is a suitable field for testing algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this meta-heuristic algorithm for this field of optimization. Comparative studies illustrate the superiority the CBO algorithm compared with those previously reported in the literature. A parametric study is also conducted to investigate the effect of some parameters on the optimal weight of the structures.
