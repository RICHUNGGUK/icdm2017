If available, the algorithm makes use of prior information such as known relationships (sub-pedigrees) or the age and sex of individuals. Statistical confidence is estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated for simulated data as well as an empirical dataset with known pedigree. The parentage inference is robust even in the presence of genotyping errors.", "paper_title": "FRANz: reconstruction of wild multi-generation pedigrees", "paper_id": "WOS:000268808600026"}
