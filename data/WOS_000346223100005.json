Due to the variability in the temporal scale of human action and the complexity of representing articulated motion, the research of it encounters many difficulties. Especially, when the number of behaviors contained in the motion sequences is unknown in advance, traditional algorithms cannot segment sequences successfully. In this paper, we extend previous works on change-points detection by probabilistic principle component analysis (PPCA). Based on it, an algorithm which is an extension of PCA and Maximum Mean Discrepancy between samples is proposed for estimating the cluster number. Finally, we optimize our approach and detect cyclic units of each action by aligned cluster analysis. We evaluate and compare the approach with the state-of-the-art methods on Synthetic data, Motion Capture Dataset and Kinect data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE SEGMENTATION APPROACH FOR HUMAN ACTION DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000346223100005"}
