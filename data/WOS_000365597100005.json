This type of educational tool is especially relevant to mechanically-complex courses, such as those pertaining to robotics and mechatronics. Build-A-Robot is such a tool, created using the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), MATLAB, and the Simulink 3D Animation Toolbox, to study the forward kinematics of serial robot arms according to the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. This tool is described, and the power of using MATLAB to directly manipulate VRML geometric dimensions is explored. The potential of this tool is evidenced by student survey responses and examination results. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
