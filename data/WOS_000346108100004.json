The main ingredient of this method is a subexponential time algorithm to derive relations between primes of norm bounded by a subexponential value. Besides ideal class group computation, this was successfully used to evaluate isogenies, compute endomorphism rings, solve the discrete logarithm problem in the class group and find a generator of a principal ideal. In this paper, we present a generalization of the relation search to classes of number fields with degree growing to infinity.", "paper_title": "SUBEXPONENTIAL TIME RELATIONS IN THE CLASS GROUP OF LARGE DEGREE NUMBER FIELDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000346108100004"}
