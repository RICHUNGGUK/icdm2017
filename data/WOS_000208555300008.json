Likelihood functions for the studied BNs are formulated, methods for their maximization are described and, finally, the results of a study concerning the reliability of revealing BNs' roles are reported. The results of BN node assignments can be applied to problems of the analysis of gene expression profiles.", "paper_title": "NODE ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM IN BAYESIAN NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208555300008"}
