The communication constraint concerned is that only one sensor node and one actuator node can access the shared network, which is the case in network environment. The accessibility of sensor nodes and/or actuator nodes is determined by medium access control with a prescribed probability. The attention is focused on the design of a piecewise static output feedback controller such that the closed-loop control system is stochastically stable with a guaranteed H-infinity performance. Based on piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions together with some matrix inequality convexifying techniques, an approach to the design of H-infinity output feedback controller is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
