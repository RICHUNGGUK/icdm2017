This paper reports on the second phase of the project, which focused on students' learning experience within five course modules employing different multi-modal media objects for instruction. Seven online surveys were conducted at the beginning of the course, immediately after each of the webcast discussion sessions accompanying each course module, and at the end of the course. The findings show significant relationships among computer skills, online teaching materials, use of communication tools, learning experience, and satisfaction with the course.", "paper_title": "Pedagogical Design for an Online Information Literacy Course: College Students' Learning Experience with Multi-Modal Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000270430700001"}
