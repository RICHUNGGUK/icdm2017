If this is done, then the process may cast into a hierarchical framework and hence rendered suitable for parallel computation. In this paper we describe a spectral method which can be used to partition graphs into nonoverlapping subgraphs. In particular, we demonstrate how the Fiedler-vector of the Laplacian matrix can be used to decompose graphs into non-overlapping neighbourhoods that can be used for the purposes of both matching and clustering.
