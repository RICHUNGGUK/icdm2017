This new algorithm reduces the quantity of information that is stored with a negligible performance loss of 0.05 dB compared with previous proposals. In addition, the algorithm allows us not only to save memory, but also to reduce the number of arithmetic resources needed. In addition, a new initialization of the algorithm avoids using techniques to control data growth without any performance degradation, reduces routing, increasing the maximum frequency achievable, and saves logic. The decoder derived from the simplified algorithm requires almost half the area of previous architectures, with a throughput of 716 Mbps on a 90-nm CMOS process for the (837, 723) nonbinary code over GF(32) at ten iterations.", "paper_title": "Nonbinary LDPC Decoder Based on Simplified Enhanced Generalized Bit-Flipping Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000337167600024"}
