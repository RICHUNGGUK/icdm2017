This paper presents an optimization solution targeted at flexible management of office space considering knowledge management criteria in order to enhance knowledge work productivity. The paper presents the Flexible Office conceptual model and optimization solution. It discusses the theoretical foundation, assumptions and reasoning. A corresponding prototype was field-tested, successfully introduced, evaluated with the help of a series of interviews with users and improved according to their requirements. The paper also reflects on the organizational impact and lessons learned from field test and practical experience.", "paper_title": "Optimizing assignment of knowledge workers to office space using knowledge management criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000257026000001"}
