One such artificial system consists of one artificial fly visual neural network model and one collision detection mechanism. The former one is a computational model to capture membrane potentials produced by neurons. The latter one takes the outputs of the former one as its inputs, and executes three detection schemes: (i) identifying when a spike takes place through the membrane potentials and one threshold scheme; (ii) deciding the motion direction of a moving object by the Reichardt detector model; and (iii) sending collision alarms and collision regions. Experimentally, relying upon a series of video image sequences with different scenes, numerical results illustrated that the artificial system with some striking characteristics is a potentially alternative tool for collision detection.
