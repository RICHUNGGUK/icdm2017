The theory suggests that the fit between characteristics of the task and those of the website predicts user performance and behavioral intentions. Our hypotheses were tested using the input of two large scale studies performed in twelve industries and involving 13,135 participants. Results, which were replicated in a proximate culture, lend support to the predictions of Task-Technology Fit theory. The site information quality and ease of use were the only technology factors that significantly drove the users to a successful completion of their information tasks, rather than the site's graphical attractiveness, interactivity, security and privacy factors. The findings further suggested that focusing on the enhancement of site characteristics that have low fit with the task is not effective as it resulted in slowing the successful completion of the online task.
