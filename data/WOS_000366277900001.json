In this commentary we note that, where relevant but non-redundant features are binary, they inevitably lead to a classifier capable of capturing only a linear relationship between structural features and activity. If, instead, we were to use relevant but non-redundant real-valued features, the resulting predictive model would be capable of describing a non-linear structure-activity relationship. Hence, we suggest that real-valued features, where available, are to be preferred in this scenario.", "paper_title": "A note on utilising binary features as ligand descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000366277900001"}
