In view of the limited power and computational capability of the camera nodes, the paper presents an abnormal behavior detection approach which is convenient and available for camera sensor networks. Trajectory analysis and anomaly modeling are carried out by single-node processing, whereas anomaly detection is performed by multinode voting. The main contributions of the proposed method are summarized as follows. First, target trajectories are reconstructed and represented as symbol sequences. Second, the sequences are taken into account using Markov model for building the transition probability matrix which can be used to automatically analyze abnormal behavior. Third, the final decision of anomaly detection is made through the majority voting of local results of individual camera nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively estimate typical abnormal behaviors in real scenes.", "paper_title": "Abnormal Behavior Detection Using Trajectory Analysis in Camera Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330459000001"}
