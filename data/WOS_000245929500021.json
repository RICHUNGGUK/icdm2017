The emphasis is on the linear complexity and autocorrelation of new prime-square sequences and two-prime sequences, two special cases of these generalized cyclotomic sequences. Our method is based on their characteristic polynomials. Results show that these sequences possess good linear complexity. Under certain conditions, the autocorrelation functions of new prime-square sequences and two-prime sequences may be three-valued.", "paper_title": "Autocorrelation and linear complexity of the new generalized cyclotomic sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000245929500021"}
