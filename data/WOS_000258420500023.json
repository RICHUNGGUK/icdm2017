Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of a coupling between the FEM and the PEEC method. Findings - The paper shows one how to use the FEM-PEEC coupled method to model a problem comprising solid conductors and ferromagnetic materials and compare its results with the FEM. Research limitations/implications - The formulation allows one to treat linear material in the magneto-harmonic assumption. Originality/value - The two methods FE and PEEC are well-known. The innovation here is coupling these methods in order to profit by the main advantages.", "paper_title": "FEM-PEEC coupled method for modeling solid conductors in the presence of ferromagnetic material", "paper_id": "WOS:000258420500023"}
