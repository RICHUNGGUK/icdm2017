We apply the value theories and principles and devise a novel method (conflict resolution algorithm) aiming for allocating an agent team with the least value conflict fashion so as to discover the contextualized mission that could fulfill the needs of the elderly. With the context information reported by pervasive components, this system can proactively provide the directions of the individualized assistance required for the elderly in maintaining an independent lifestyle and reduce possible health-care costs. To show the feasibility of the methodology proposed in the paper, a prototype system has been implemented for justifying the capability of the system's needs identification from the macro and micro perspectives. Moreover, our system also exemplifies a future way of service provision on electronic care. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
