However, because the performance of the K2 algorithm depends on node ordering, more effective node ordering inference methods are needed. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new node ordering algorithm based on a novel scoring function. Because a child has a better conditional frequency or probability under a correct parent than an incorrect one, we have designed a novel scoring function to evaluate this conditional frequency. Given two variables, our scoring function infers which is the better parent variable. Consequently, the proposed method infers candidate parents by considering all pairs of variables; it then uses these parents as input for the K2 algorithm. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms previous methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
