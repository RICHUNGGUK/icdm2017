Given the multi-view video dataset recorded using a set of industrial cameras under general uncontrolled and unknown illumination, we first reconstruct 3D model of the captured target using existing multi-view stereo approach. Using the coarse geometry reconstruction, we estimate the spatially varying surface reflectance in the spherical harmonics domain considering the spatial and temporal coherence. With the estimated geometry and reflectance, the 3D target is relit to the novel illumination with the environment map of the target environment. Relit performance is enhanced using a flow- and quotient-based transfer strategy to achieve detailed and plausible performance relighting. Finally, the free-viewpoint video is generated using a view-dependent rendering strategy. Experimental results on various dataset show that our approach enables plausible free-view relighting, and opens up a path towards relightable free-viewpoint video using less complex acquisition setups.", "paper_title": "Free-viewpoint video relighting from multi-view sequence under general illumination", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435800010"}
