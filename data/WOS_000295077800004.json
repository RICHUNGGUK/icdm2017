The problem is formulated as a bi-level program where the lower level is the cell-transmission-based user-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (UODTA). Due to its Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) complexity, the genetic algorithm (GA) with the simulation-based UODTA is adopted to solve multiorigin multidestination problems. Four GA variations are proposed. GA1 is a simple GA. GA2, GA3, and GA4 with a jam-density factor parameter (JDF) employ time-dependent congestion measures in their decoding procedures. The four algorithms are empirically tested on a grid network and compared based on solution quality, convergence speed, and central processing unit (CPU) time. GA3 with JDF of 0.6 appears best on the three criteria. On the Sioux Falls network, GA3 with JDF of 0.7 performs best. The GA with the appropriate inclusion of problem-specific knowledge and parameter calibration indeed provides excellent results when compared with the simple GA.", "paper_title": "Time-Varying Lane-Based Capacity Reversibility for Traffic Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000295077800004"}
