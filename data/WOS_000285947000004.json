Nevertheless, the detection of cancer signs in mammograms is a difficult procedure owing to the great number of non-pathological structures which are also present in the image. Recent statistics show that in current breast cancer screenings 10%-25% of the tumors are missed by the radiologists. For this reason, a lot of research is currently being done to develop systems for Computer Aided Detection (CADe). Probably, some causes of the false-negative screening examinations are that tumoral masses have varying dimension and irregular shape, their borders are often ill-defined and their contrast is very low, thus making difficult the discrimination from parenchymal structures. Therefore, in a CADe system a preliminary segmentation procedure has to be implemented in order to separate the mass from the background tissue. In this way, various characteristics of the segmented mass can be evaluated and used in a classification step to discriminate benign and malignant cases. In this paper, we describe an effective algorithm for massive lesions segmentation based on a region-growing technique and we provide full details the performance evaluation procedure used in this specific context.
