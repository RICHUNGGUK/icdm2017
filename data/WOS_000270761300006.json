In this paper, we investigate the problem of identifying characters in feature-length films using video and film script. Different from the state-of-the-art methods on naming faces in the videos, most of which used the local matching between a visible face and one of the names extracted from the temporally local video transcript, we attempt to do a global matching between names and clustered face tracks under the circumstances that there are not enough local name cues that can be found. The contributions of our work include: 1) A graph matching method is utilized to build face-name association between a face affinity network and a name affinity network which are, respectively, derived from their own domains (video and script). 2) An effective measure of face track distance is presented for face track clustering. 3) As an application, the relationship between characters is mined using social network analysis. The proposed framework is able to create a new experience on character-centered film browsing. Experiments are conducted on ten feature-length films and give encouraging results.", "paper_title": "Character Identification in Feature-Length Films Using Global Face-Name Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000270761300006"}
