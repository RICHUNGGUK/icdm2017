We add to such systems the basic feature of (cell-like) P systems with active membranes - the possibility to divide cells. As expected (as it is the case for P systems with active membranes), in this way we get the possibility to solve computationally hard problems in polynomial time; we illustrate this possibility with SAT problem.", "paper_title": "Tissue P systems with cell division", "paper_id": "WOS:000257275300007"}
