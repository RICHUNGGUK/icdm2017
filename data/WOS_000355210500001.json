They both utilize nonlinear gradient descent, which is usually applied on intensity values. In this paper, we propose the employment of highly descriptive, densely sampled image features for both problems. We show that the strategy of warping the multichannel dense feature image at each iteration is more beneficial than extracting features after warping the intensity image at each iteration. Motivated by this observation, we demonstrate robust and accurate alignment and fitting performance using a variety of powerful feature descriptors. Especially with the employment of histograms of oriented gradient and scale-invariant feature transform features, our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art results on in-the-wild databases.", "paper_title": "Feature-Based Lucas-Kanade and Active Appearance Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000355210500001"}
