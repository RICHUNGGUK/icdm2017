The fundamental frequencies for CNTs range from 10 to 250 GHz and 100 to 1000 GHz for the cantilevered and bridged conditions, respectively. As the ratio Lid increases the fundamental frequency decreases, as expected. A decrease on fundamental frequencies with the bending waviness was noticed for all conditions. The mode shape for bent carbon nanotubes seems to be a superposition of the vibration mode and the bending mode for the zigzag configuration. Multi-layered graphene nanosheets were also investigated. The fundamental frequencies ranged from 50 to 150 GHz, with an odd/even shape mode switch. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
