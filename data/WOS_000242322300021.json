Design/methodology/approach - In order to cope with the proposal, three new classes of FFG are proposed: replicating grammars: to formalize proper-ties and consequences of DNA duplication; self-controlled grammars: to provide the tools to control the grammar ambiguity and to improve adaptability, and recombinant grammars: to formalize properties and consequences of the sexual reproduction to life evolution. Considering all these facts, FFG are proposed as the key instrument to formalize the basic properties of the chemical transactions supporting life. Findings - The formalism of the model provides a new way to analyze and interpret the findings of the different genome sequencing projects. Originality/value - The theoretical framework developed here provides a new perspective of understanding the code of life and evolution.", "paper_title": "Ambiguous grammars and the chemical transactions of life - Part II: the hierarchy of life's grammars", "paper_id": "WOS:000242322300021"}
