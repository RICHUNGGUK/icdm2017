The methods proposed for clustering probability density functions are mainly focused on univariate settings and are based on heuristic clustering solutions. New aspects of the problem associated with the multivariate setting and a model-based perspective are investigated. The novel approach relies on a hierarchical mixture modeling of the data. The method is introduced in the univariate context and then extended to multivariate densities by means of a factorial model performing dimension reduction. Model fitting is carried out using an EM-algorithm. The proposed method is illustrated through simulated experiments and applied to two real data sets in order to compare its performance with alternative clustering strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
