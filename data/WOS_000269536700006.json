The objective of this type of approach is to distribute a given amount of material in a certain domain, so that the stiffness of the resulting structure is maximized (that is, the compliance, or energy of deformation, is minimized) for a given load case. Thus, the material mass is restricted to a predefined percentage of the maximum possible mass, while no stress or displacement constraints are taken into account. This paper presents a different strategy to deal with topology optimization: a minimum weight with stress constraints Finite Element formulation for the topology optimization of continuum structures. We propose two different approaches in order to take into account stress constraints in the optimization formulation. The local approach of the stress constraints imposes stress constraints at predefined points of the domain (i.e. at the central point of each element). On the contrary, the global approach only imposes one global constraint that gathers the effect of all the local constraints by means of a certain so-called aggregation function. Finally, some application examples are solved with both formulations in order to compare the obtained solutions.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of continuum structures with local and global stress constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000269536700006"}
