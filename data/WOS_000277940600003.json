By considering a series of historical seismic records, and using the seismic design value in the current building code as the evaluation criteria, two metropolitan areas, Taichung and Chiayi, were identified by computational results as having higher estimated horizontal PGAs than the recommended design values. The approach implemented in this study provides a new and good basis for solving this type of seismic problems in the region studied.", "paper_title": "Neural computing with genetic algorithm in evaluating potentially hazardous metropolitan areas result from earthquake", "paper_id": "WOS:000277940600003"}
