This paper proposes a street parking system(SPS) based on wireless sensor networks. The system can monitor the state of every parking space by deploying a magnetic sensor node on the space. For accurately detecting a parking car, a vehicle detection algorithm is proposed. And an adaptive sampling mechanism is used to reduce the energy consumption. Eighty-two sensor nodes are deployed on the street parking spaces to evaluate the performance of SPS. By running the system for more than one year, we observed that the vehicle detection accuracy of the SPS is better than 98%, and the lifetime of the sensor node is more than 5 years with a pair of 2500 mAh Li batteries.", "paper_title": "A Street Parking System Using Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321358900001"}
