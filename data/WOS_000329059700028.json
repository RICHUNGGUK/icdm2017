The ISCB represents nearly 3000 members working in > 70 countries. It has doubled the number of members since 2007. At the same time, the number of meetings organized by the ISCB has increased from two in 2007 to eight in 2013, and the society has cemented many lasting alliances with regional societies and specialist groups. ISCB is ready to grow into a challenging and promising future. The progress over the past 7 years has resulted from the vision, and possibly more importantly, the passion and hard working dedication of many individuals.", "paper_title": "ISCB: past-present perspective for the International Society for Computational Biology", "paper_id": "WOS:000329059700028"}
