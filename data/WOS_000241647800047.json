The starting point is either a MIDI file or the score of a piece of music. The result is a set of likely themes and motifs. The method relies on a pitch intervals representation of music and an event discovery system that extracts significant and repeated patterns from sequences. We report and discuss the results of a preliminary experimentation, and outline future enhancements.", "paper_title": "A methodological contribution to music sequences analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800047"}
