Noise waveform SAR generates radar images of reflective objects of its field of view. A bistatic radiometer with synthetic aperture estimates the thermal radio emissions of the objects along their angular coordinates and even range. The estimated brightness temperatures of rough and smooth surfaces are different, as well as the radar responses from them. Identification of the parameters of objects surfaces may be done using results of joint processing of images generated by both sensors. The optimum and quasi-optimum criteria for fusion of the images were obtained. The latter was experimentally checked. It approves the opportunity to fuse the images for further estimation of some parameters of objects surfaces. The results obtained may be used in environmental and security applications.", "paper_title": "Fusion of Images Generated by Radiometric and Active Noise SAR", "paper_id": "WOS:000368370900007"}
