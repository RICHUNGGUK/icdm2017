The laminated plates are assumed to be simply supported at their boundaries. The results are discussed in detail and compared with those obtained from finite element method (FEM) of analysis. The study of the results has provided confidence in the validity and capability of the developed FSM in handling the post buckling problem of anti-symmetric angle-ply laminates.
