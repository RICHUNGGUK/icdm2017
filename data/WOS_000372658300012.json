This goal has been achieved through a teaching method based on real projects that are closely related to aerospace engineering. Throughout this paper, the process of teaching electronics through two subjects, one compulsory and one elective, is described. Subsequently, a description of the major projects that have been implemented in the last years is given. The academic results have been very satisfactory, and project development has proved a widely accepted method of teaching by students.", "paper_title": "Teaching Electronics to Aeronautical Engineering Students by Developing Projects", "paper_id": "WOS:000372658300012"}
