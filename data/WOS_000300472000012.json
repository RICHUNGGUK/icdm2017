We first sum up basic concepts on discrete mechanics and discuss the explicitness of the linear approximation of the discrete Euler-Lagrange Equations. Next, the discrete cart-pendulum system is derived and analyzed from the viewpoint of solvability of implicit nonlinear control systems. We then show a control algorithm to stabilize the discrete cart-pendulum based on the discrete-time optimal regulator theory. Finally, some simulations are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Control of the Cart-Pendulum System Based on Discrete Mechanics - Part I: Theoretical Analysis and Stabilization Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000300472000012"}
