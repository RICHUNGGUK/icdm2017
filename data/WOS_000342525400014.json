This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of bacterial foraging optimization and particle swarm optimization. It is thus called bacterial foraging particle swarm optimization (BFPSO). The proposed BFPSO method performs local search through the chemotactic movement operation of bacterial foraging whereas the global search over the entire search space is accomplished by a particle swarm operator. The NFC model uses functional link neural networks as the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. This study uses orthogonal polynomials and linearly independent functions in a functional expansion of the functional link neural networks. Finally, the proposed neural fuzzy classifier with bacterial foraging particle swarm optimization (NFC-BFPSO) is adopted in several classification applications. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed NFC-BFPSO method can outperform other methods.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid of Bacterial Foraging Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization for Evolutionary Neural Fuzzy Classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000342525400014"}
