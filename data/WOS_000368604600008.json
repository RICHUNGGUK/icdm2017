The capability to run off intermittent power also moves us closer to the vision of a net-zero data center that consumes no net energy from the electric grid and has a small carbon footprint. However, designing systems to operate under intermittent power is challenging, since applications often access persistent distributed state, where power fluctuations can impact data availability and I/O performance. To address the problem, we design and implement BlinkFS, which combines blinking with a power-balanced data layout and popularity-based replication/reclamation to optimize I/O throughput and latency as power varies. Our experiments show that BlinkFS outperforms approaches that co-opt existing energy-proportional distributed file systems (DFSs) for intermittent power, particularly at low steady power levels and high levels of intermittency. For example, we show that BlinkFS reduces completion time for MapReduce-style jobs by 42% at 50% full power compared to existing energy-proportional DFSs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
