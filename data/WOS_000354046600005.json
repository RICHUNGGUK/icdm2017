Paxos is by no means a simple protocol, even though it is based on relatively simple invariants. We provide pseudocode and explain it guided by invariants. We initially avoid optimizations that complicate comprehension. Next we discuss liveness, list various optimizations that make the protocol practical, and present variants of the protocol.", "paper_title": "Paxos Made Moderately Complex", "paper_id": "WOS:000354046600005"}
