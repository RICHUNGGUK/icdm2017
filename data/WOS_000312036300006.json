A classic theorem of Hajnal and Szemeredi states that if G is a graph of order n with minimum degree delta(G) >= (t - 1 )n/t and t vertical bar n, then G contains a perfect K-t-matching. Let G be a t-partite graph with vertex classes V-1, ..., V-t each of size n. We show that, for any gamma > 0, if every vertex x is an element of V-i is joined to at least ((t - 1)/t + gamma)n vertices of V-j for each j not equal i, then G contains a perfect K-t-matching, provided n is large enough. Thus, we verify a conjecture of Fischer [6] asymptotically. Furthermore, we consider a generalization to hypergraphs in terms of the codegree.", "paper_title": "A Multipartite Version of the Hajnal-Szemeredi Theorem for Graphs and Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000312036300006"}
