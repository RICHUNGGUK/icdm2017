Thus, it provides a means of supporting of variable rate data service at low hardware cost. However, assigning OVSF-CDMA codes to wireless ad hoc nodes posts a new challenge since not every pair of OVSF-CDMA codewords are orthogonal to each other. In an OVSF-CDMA wireless ad hoc network, a code assignment has to be conflict-free, i.e., two nodes can be assigned the same codeword or two non-orthogonal codewords if and only if their transmission will not interfere with each other. The throughput (resp., bottleneck) of a code assignment is the sum (resp., minimum) of the rates of the assigned codewords. The max-throughput (resp., max-bottleneck) conflict-free code assignment problem seeks a conflict-free code assignment which achieves the maximum throughput (resp., bottleneck). In this paper, we present several efficient methods for conflict-free code assignment in OVSF-CDMA wireless ad hoc networks. Each method is proved to be either a constant-approximation for max-throughput conflict-free code assignment problem, or a constant-approximation for max-bottleneck conflict-free code assignment problem, or constant-approximations for both problems simultaneously.", "paper_title": "OVSF-CDMA code assignment in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251455500002"}
