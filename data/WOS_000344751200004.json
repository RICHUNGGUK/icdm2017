First, the basic dynamic decoupling concept is introduced by involving virtual input dynamics, such that the system uncertainty and control input are decoupled in each fuzzy rule. This leads to simplified linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions. Next, the dynamic decoupling approach is extended to controlling uncertain systems with input actuator nonlinearity (e.g., saturation, quantization, dead-zone, etc.) or time-varying input delay. Due to the decoupling between uncertainty, actuator nonlinearity, and input delay, more relaxed stability conditions are obtained for the asymptotic stability and H-infinity control performance. Furthermore, the limit on the initial condition is removed when considering input saturation. Larger and faster time-varying state and input delays are allowed under fewer LMIs. Finally, to show the advantages of the developed control method, numerical simulations are carried out on an inverted pendulum (subject to either the saturation, quantization, or delay input), a delay mass-spring-damper system, and a delay truck-trailer system.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic Decoupling Approach to Robust T-S Fuzzy Model-Based Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000344751200004"}
