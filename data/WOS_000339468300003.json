It is shown that the family of sets representable by unique (least, greatest) solutions of such systems is exactly the family of recursive (r.e., co-r.e., respectively) sets of numbers. Basic decision problems for these systems are located in the arithmetical hierarchy. The same results are established for equations with addition and intersection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
