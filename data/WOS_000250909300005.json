Two instances of this family reduce to previously known interpolants: one based on a generalization of Wachspress coordinates to smooth curves and the other an integral version of mean value coordinates for smooth curves. A third instance of this family yields a previously unknown generalization of discrete harmonic coordinates to smooth curves. For closed, piecewise linear curves, we prove that our interpolant reproduces a general family of barycentric coordinates considered by Floater, Hormarm and Kos that includes Wachspress, coordinates, mean value coordinates and discrete harmonic coordinates.
