It is shown that a line distance matrix of size n > 1 has one positive and n - 1 negative eigenvalues. Furthermore, a recently introduced conjecture that line distance matrices belong to a class of well known squared distance matrices, is confirmed. The interlacing property for line distance matrices is considered.", "paper_title": "On description of biological sequences by spectral properties of line distance matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000249283700003"}
