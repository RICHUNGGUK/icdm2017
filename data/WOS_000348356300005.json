However, by investigating a practical virtual desktop system, where runs video streaming workloads, we find that importing this kind of SSDs into a virtualized system is not as simple as merely a mechanical replacement. Because a large proportion of disk I/O being included in the video streaming workload is write I/O, the inherent weaknesses of NAND flash memory, write amplification (WA), will be magnified in a guest operating system (OS). Worse, some useful remedies in a native OS become disabled or inefficient due to the interposition of hypervisor layer. This paper describes and analyzes these problems based on a practical virtual desktop system, and then proposes a tailor-made method to relieve them. By evaluating realistic user workloads and several typical benchmarks, the result shows that our method can effectively improve these problems in our virtualized SSD system.", "paper_title": "Improving write amplification in a virtualized and multimedia SSD system", "paper_id": "WOS:000348356300005"}
