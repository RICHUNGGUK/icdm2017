One of the most significant issues in WSNs is developing an efficient algorithm to monitor all the targets and, at the same time, extend the network lifetime. As sensors are often densely deployed, employing scheduling algorithms can be considered a promising approach that is able ultimately to result in extending total network lifetime. In this paper, we propose three learning automata-based scheduling algorithms for solving target coverage problem in WSNs. The proposed algorithms employ learning automata (LA) to determine the sensors that should be activated at each stage for monitoring all the targets. Additionally, we design a pruning rule and manage critical targets in order to maximize network lifetime. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, extensive simulation experiments were carried out, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of extending the network lifetime. Simulation results also revealed that by a proper choice of the learning rate, a proper trade-off could be achieved between the network lifetime and running time.", "paper_title": "Learning automata-based algorithms for finding cover sets in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326805000020"}
