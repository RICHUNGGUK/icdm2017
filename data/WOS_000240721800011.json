The method exploits the connection between Lanczos tridiagonalization and Gauss quadrature to determine inexpensively computable lower and upper bounds for certain functionals. This approach to bound functionals was first described in a paper by Dahlquist, Eisenstat, and Golub. A suitable value of the regularization parameter is determined by a modification of the discrepancy principle.", "paper_title": "An iterative Lavrentiev regularization method", "paper_id": "WOS:000240721800011"}
