The problem can be solved, in principle, using real quantifier elimination algorithms, in particular real root classification algorithms. However, it is well known that they can handle only very small cases due to the enormous computing time requirements. In this paper, we present a special algorithm which is much more efficient than the general methods. Its efficiency comes from the exploitation of certain interesting structures of the family of differential equations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
