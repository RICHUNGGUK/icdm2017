This new implementation uses Compute Unified Device Architecture C (CUDA-C) programming model and is designed to be executed on a system equipped with NVIDIA (R)'s graphic cards. The output of the new implementation is compared to a MATLAB code that has already been fully tested in the Water Cycle Multimission Observation Strategy (WACMOS) project. The code is timed against both MATLAB and a purely high-performance C implementation of the same algorithm. The code has been tested on several different NVIDIA (R) cards, with different compute capabilities. The authors have decided to provide the entire source code to the scientific community free of charge; hence, at the end, the instruction on how to obtain the code is also presented.
