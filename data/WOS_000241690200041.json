Our method is based on a theoretical framework using Markov random fields. Our two-stage term dependence model captures both the global dependencies between query components explicitly delimited by separators in a query, and the local dependencies between constituents within a compound word when the compound word appears in a query component. We show that our model works well, particularly when using query structuring with compound words, through experiments using a 100-gigabyte web document collection mostly written in Japanese.", "paper_title": "Query structuring with two-stage term dependence in the Japanese language", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200041"}
