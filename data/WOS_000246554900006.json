Our algorithm performs a sequence of related reconstructions, each using only two projections. The algorithm makes extensive use of network flow algorithms for solving the two-projection subproblems. Our experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can compute highly accurate reconstructions from a small number of projections, even in the presence of noise. Although the effectiveness of the algorithm is based on certain smoothness assumptions about the image, even tiny, non-smooth details are reconstructed exactly. The class of images for which the algorithm is most effective includes images of convex objects, but images of objects that contain holes or consist of multiple components can also be reconstructed very well.", "paper_title": "A network flow algorithm for reconstructing binary images from discrete x-rays", "paper_id": "WOS:000246554900006"}
