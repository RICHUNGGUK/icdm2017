Design/methodology/approach - By means of a thorough review of the literature in this area and an analysis of the current state of the art, the paper investigates a three-level digital preservation framework with a focus on the public sector. It cross-links this framework with the cloud computing concept, in order to propose an appropriate solution. Findings - The mapping of six factors of digital preservation to three levels of digital preservation shows that using appropriate steps supported by suitable strategies and policies enables the public administration sector to take advantage of modern information technology and solve the demanding and critical problem of digital preservation. Practical implications - The paper suggests an organisational and technological solution in the form of a centralised digital preservation repository within a cloud computing framework, to aid both organisations of the public sector which deal with active life cycle document phases and archives and libraries which deal with passive phases of documents and records. Originality/value - The paper addresses the difficulties of digital preservation implementation in the public administration sector. The findings indicate that while developing and implementing digital preservation, the public administration sector should formulate common policies and solutions based on the suggested results of this paper and, in doing so, maximise the benefits of current technologies.", "paper_title": "A possible solution for digital preservation of e-government A centralised repository within a cloud computing framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000323237900005"}
