Because the body force and pressure are solved simultaneously, the boundary condition on the immersed boundary can be fully verified. The computational costs of this iterative IB method is comparable to those of conventional IB methods. We also introduce an improved body force distribution function which transfers the body force in the discrete volume of IB points to surrounding Cartesian grids totally. To alleviate the demanding computational requirements of a full-resolved direct numerical simulation, a wall-layer model is presented. The accuracy and capability of the present method is verified by a variety of two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations, ranging from laminar flow past a cylinder and a sphere to turbulent flow around a cylinder. The improvement of the iterative IB method is fully demonstrated and the influences of different body force distribution strategies is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
