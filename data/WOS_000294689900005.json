Sensing hardware and learning algorithms are two important components in activity recognition. For sensing devices, we prefer to use accelerometers due to low cost and low power requirement. For learning algorithms, we propose a novel implementation of the semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (semi-CRF) introduced by Sarawagi and Cohen. Our implementation not only outperforms the original method in terms of computation complexity (at least 10 times faster in our experiments) but also is able to capture the interdependency among labels, which was not possible in the previously proposed model. Our results indicate that the proposed approach works well even for complicated activities like eating and driving a car. The average precision and recall are 88.47% and 86.68%, respectively, which are higher than results obtained by using other methods such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or Topic Model (TM).", "paper_title": "Semi-Markov conditional random fields for accelerometer-based activity recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000294689900005"}
