A new design is structured to process the window queries. The use of distributed form of spatial indexing introduces greater flexibility and robustness as compared to the previous centralized approach, which lacked proper semantics and evaluation of window queries, in sensor networks, A distributed spatial routing tree efficiently distributes the structure to each node in the sensor network. The MBR of the region where its children and the node itself are located is stored by each parent. The measure of the extent of overlapping determines the inclusion/exclusion of sensor nodes to evaluate the query. Reduction in the number of nodes participating in the query reduces the communication power seeked, thus elongating the life of the embedded sensor system.", "paper_title": "Energy efficient design for window query processing in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100041"}
