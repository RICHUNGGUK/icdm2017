Finding an optimal allocation of customers to satellite channels is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem and is shown to be NP-complete in an earlier study. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to search for the best/optimal assignment of customers to satellite channels. Various issues related to genetic algorithms such as solution representation, selection methods, genetic operators and repair of invalid solutions are presented. A comparison of this approach with the standard optimization method is presented to show the advantages of this approach in terms of computation time.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithm for satellite customer assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000106"}
