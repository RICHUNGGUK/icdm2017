The insertion of a total support phase between each particular swing and support legs phase was produced for all different hexapod gait patterns. Thus, pseudo-synchronous gait pattern transitions are easily allowed and walking stability is potentially improved. Moreover, the insertion of such new phases facilitates to work with two. distinct time periods: (i) when legs are in the typical swing-support phases, i.e., carrying the body of the robot to its future position, and (ii) during total support phases. All new extended SMER-based gait patterns are presented by means of a kinematic analysis made through simulations of a hexapod walking robot. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
