The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) allows computationally efficient feature selection based on linear dependency between input features and output values. In this letter, we consider a feature-wise kernelized Lasso for capturing nonlinear input-output dependency. We first show that with particular choices of kernel functions, nonredundant features with strong statistical dependence on output values can be found in terms of kernel-based independence measures such as the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. We then show that the globally optimal solution can be efficiently computed; this makes the approach scalable to high-dimensional problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through feature selection experiments for classification and regression with thousands of features.", "paper_title": "High-Dimensional Feature Selection by Feature-Wise Kernelized Lasso", "paper_id": "WOS:000328061400007"}
