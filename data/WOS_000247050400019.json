Ali, S. Nadarajah, A truncated Pareto distribution, Computer Communications, in press], we introduce a truncated version of the bivariate generalized Pareto distribution - the most commonly known longtailed distribution - which possesses finite moments of all orders and could therefore be a better model for communication networks. Explicit expressions are derived for the product moments of the truncated distribution. An estimation procedure based on the method of maximum likelihood is also provided. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
