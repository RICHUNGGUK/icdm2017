It is shown that by using both PMOS and NMOS differential pairs in the folding blocks, the overall input voltage range of the ADC can be increased to rail-to-rail. A novel self-adjustment method is also introduced to compensate for the different input-output characteristics of PMOS and NMOS differential pairs. A low voltage 8-bit 80 MSample/s folding/interpolating ADC is then designed and fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process. Operating with a supply voltage as low as 1.2 V, measurements show an INL below +/- 0.55 LSB, SNDR of 43.5 dB at 80 MHz Sampling Frequency and power dissipation of only 30 mW.", "paper_title": "Low voltage low power 8-bit folding/interpolating ADC with rail-to-rail input range", "paper_id": "WOS:000270155000006"}
