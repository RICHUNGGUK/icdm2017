The general mechanism was proposed recently from the type synthesis performed for 5-DOF parallel mechanisms with identical limb structures. In this study, the emphasis is placed on the determination of the constant-orientation workspace using a geometric interpretation of the so-called vertex space, i.e., the motion generated by a limb for a given orientation. The geometric investigation is carried out using geometric constructive approach, which is implemented in a computer algebra system and in a CAD system. This paper shows that these two approaches are complementary tools to investigate the workspace of parallel mechanisms. The geometric constructive approach proposed in this paper bring insight into the architecture optimization and it can be regarded as a guideline for the workspace analysis of parallel mechanisms whose vertex spaces generate Bohemian dome.
