In this review, we describe a biomarker identification pipeline for cardiovascular disease, which includes 1) high-throughput genomic data acquisition, 2) preprocessing and normalization of data, 3) exploratory analysis, 4) feature selection, 5) classification, and 6) interpretation and validation of candidate biomarkers. We review each step in the pipeline, presenting current and widely used bioinformatics methods. Furthermore, we analyze several publicly available cardiovascular genomics datasets to illustrate the pipeline. Finally, we summarize the current challenges and opportunities for further research.", "paper_title": "Cardiovascular Genomics: A Biomarker Identification Pipeline", "paper_id": "WOS:000308992800003"}
