With using frame-based knowledge representation, a knowledge model is constructed to describe the features of heterogeneous robots as well as their behaviors according to human requests. The required knowledge for constructing a heterogeneous multi-robot system can be therefore integrated in a single model and shared by robots and users. Based on the knowledge model, the heterogeneous multi-robot system is defined in the Software Platform for Agents and Knowledge Management (SPAK) by use of XML format. With the use of SPAK, the cooperative operation of heterogeneous multi-robot system can be flexibly carried out. The proposed system not only can integrate heterogeneous robots and various techniques for robots, but also can automatically perform human-robot interaction and plan robot behaviors taking into account different intelligence of robots corresponding to human requests. In this paper, an actual heterogeneous multi-robot system comprised by humanoid robots (Robovie, PINO), mobile robot (Scout) and entertainment robot dog (AlBO) is built and the effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by experiment.
