In this study, generalized regression neural network (GRNN) combined with genetic algorithm (GA) was used to build a match prediction model. A real-time match monitor system was used to collect steady match positions according to a statistical experimental design. GA-GRNN models were compared to GRNN and statistical regression models. Compared to GRNN models, GA-GRNN models demonstrated improved predictions of about 81% and 77% for the impedance and phase positions, respectively. With respect to statistical regression models, GA-GRNN models yielded an improvement of about 80% and 78%, respectively. Moreover, for either model type, the improvements for the training errors were more than about 90% for both positions.", "paper_title": "Prediction of radio frequency impedance matching in plasma equipment using neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300150"}
