The major objectives of autonomic computing are to minimize human intervention and to enable a seamless self-adaptive behavior in the software systems. To achieve self-managing behavior, various methods have been exploited in past. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a problem solving paradigm of artificial intelligence which exploits past experience, stored in the form of problem-solution pairs. We have applied CBR based modeling approach to achieve autonomicity in software systems. The proposed algorithms have been described and CBR implementation on externalization and internalization architectures of autonomic systems using two case studies RUBiS and Autonomic Forest Fire Application (AFFA) have been shown. The study highlights the effect of 10 different similarity measures, the role of adaptation and the effect of changing nearest neighborhood cardinality for a CBR solution cycle in autonomic managers. The results presented in this paper show that the proposed CBR based autonomic model exhibits 90-98% accuracy in diagnosing the problem and planning the solution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
