It uses a transition freezing and melting method which is implemented of the transition freezing block and a MUX. When random test patterns are generated from an LFSR, transitions of those patterns satisfy pseudo-random Gaussian distribution. The proposed technique freezes transitions of patterns using a freezing value. Experimental results show that the proposed BIST TPG schemes can reduce average power reduction by about 60% without performance loss and peak power by about 30% in ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits.", "paper_title": "A new scan power reducdon scheme using transition freezing for pseudo-random logic BIST", "paper_id": "WOS:000255648700034"}
