The manipulation, via pump beam, of the transverse spatial correlation between the photon pairs is explored. Inserting apertures with D-slits in the arms of the down-converted photons, we associate the qudit space with the D possible paths followed by each photon. Experimental results for qudits with D = 4 and 8 are shown. We demonstrate that the generated states cannot be classically correlated. We also show the propagation of entangled states of spatial qudits. Their free-space distribution is performed at the laboratory scale and the propagated states maintain a high fidelity with their original form.", "paper_title": "Generating and distributing two-photon entangled spatial qudits", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862500010"}
