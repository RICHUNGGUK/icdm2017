This process is inextricably bound up with human cognition and, as such, the management of knowledge occurs within an intricately structured behavioral, cultural, and social context. This paper emphasizes the importance of interactive human factors in knowledge management and introduces a model-based human systems integration framework based on systems modeling language (SysML).", "paper_title": "Interactive Management of Human Factors Knowledge for Human Systems Integration Using Systems Modeling Language", "paper_id": "WOS:000267835100007"}
