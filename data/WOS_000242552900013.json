We propose a method to compute distance between two attribute values of same attribute for unsupervised learning. This approach is based on the fact that similarity of two attribute values is dependent on their relationship with other attributes. Computational cost of this method is linear with respect to number of data objects in data set. To see the effectiveness of our proposed distance measure, we use proposed distance measure with K-mode clustering algorithm to cluster various categorical data sets. Significant improvement in clustering accuracy is observed as compared to clustering results obtained using traditional K-mode clustering algorithm. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
