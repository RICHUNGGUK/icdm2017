Although has been studied for decades, it is still rare to find a general, robust and automatic image registration method, and most existing image registration methods are designed for particular application. In this paper, image registration is boil down to a formula discovery problem to match feature points, we develop a new feature-based algorithm for contour registration automatically based on a hybrid approach combining Multi Expression Programming (MEP) with Clonal Selection Principle (CSP). Firstly, the image contours are extracted by fast global minimization of the active contour model, the feature point pairs which are used to establish training set of the hybrid approach are obtained using invariable moments. Secondly, the registration equations are acquired automatically by the proposed hybrid approach and the contours are then registered based on the equations. Experiments show that the proposed approach can be successfully applied to register the image pairs in which the contour information is well preserved. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
