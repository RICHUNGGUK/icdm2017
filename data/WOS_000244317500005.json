This paper presents a method aimed at supporting software product development organisations in the identification of process improvement proposals to increase requirements selection quality. The method is based on an in-depth analysis of requirements selection decision outcomes after the release has been launched to the users. The method is validated in two separate case studies involving real requirements and industrial requirements engineering experts. The conclusions from the two case studies are that the method seems valuable in situations with complex release planning decisions, such as in market-driven projects. It also appears essential that participants with different viewpoints attend the root cause discussion. Requirements interdependencies seem to play a big role in release planning decision-making. In addition, successful projects can also be a source of learning.", "paper_title": "Case studies in process improvement through retrospective analysis of release planning decisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000244317500005"}
