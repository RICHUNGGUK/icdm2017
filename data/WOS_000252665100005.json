We consider in this article parameterized versions of a specific Friedman-style scheme and classify exactly the threshold for the transition from provability to unprovability in PA. For this purpose we fix it natural Schutte-style bijection between the ordinals below epsilon(0) and the positive integers. This coding induces a natural well ordering < oil the positive integers. Using bounds oil the asymptotic of the resulting global count functions we classify precisely the phase transition for the parameterized hierarchy of elementary descent recursive functions and hence for the combinatorial well-foundedness scheme. Let CWF(g) be the assertion that for all natural numbers K there exists a natural number M which is so large that there does not exist a strictly <-descending sequence m(0),...,m(M) of positive integers such that for every i with 0 <= i <= M we have that m(i) <= K + g(i). For classifying the provable from the unprovable version of CWF(g) (as it problem depending oil g) let f(alpha)(i) := i(vertical bar i vertical bar)F(alpha)(-1)(i) where vertical bar center dot vertical bar(k) denotes the k-times iterated binary length function and where F-alpha(-1) denotes the functional inverse of the alpha-th function from the Fast growing hierarchy. Then,, Our main result is: PA proves CWF(f.) iff alpha < epsilon(0).", "paper_title": "A sharp phase transition threshold for elementary descent recursive functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000252665100005"}
