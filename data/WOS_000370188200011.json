It aims to obtain agent-dependent emotion understanding by utilizing special customized knowledge of the agent rather than ordinary surface level emotion understanding that uses visual/acoustic/distance information without any customized knowledge. In the experiment employing special demonstration scenarios where a company employee's emotion is understood by a secretary eye robot equipped with a Kinect sensor device, it is confirmed that the proposed method provides deep level emotion understanding that is different from ordinary surface level emotion understanding. The proposal is being planned to be applied to a part of the emotion understanding module in the demonstration experiments of an ongoing robotics research project titled \"Multi-Agent Fuzzy Atmosfield.\"", "paper_title": "Deep Level Emotion Understanding Using Customized Knowledge for Human-Robot Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000370188200011"}
