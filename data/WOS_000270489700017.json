They are neural FIR adaptive decision feedback equalizer (SNNDFE) and neural FIR adaptive Laguerre equalizer (LSNN). Of these two equalizers, the latter is simple and with characteristics of both infinite impulse response (IIR) and FIR filters; it can use shorter memory length to obtain better performance. As confirmed by theoretical analysis, the novel LSNN equalizer is stable (0 < a < 1). Furthermore, simulation results show that the SNNDFE can get better equalized performance than SNN equalizer, while the latter exhibits better performance than others in terms of convergence speed, mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER). Therefore, it can reduce the input dimension and eliminate linear and nonlinear interference effectively. In addition, it is very suitable for hardware implementation due to its simple structure.", "paper_title": "Neural FIR adaptive Laguerre equalizer with a gradient adaptive amplitude for nonlinear channel in communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000270489700017"}
