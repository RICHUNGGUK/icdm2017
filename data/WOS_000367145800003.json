A decentralized protocol is designed for each agent, without exchanging internal controller states with neighboring agents, to achieve output synchronization and regulated output synchronization while making the H-infinity norm from the disturbances to the synchronization errors in the network arbitrarily small. Furthermore, the idea for output synchronization is applied to a formation problem in the presence of disturbances. The method is illustrated by simulation examples.", "paper_title": "H-infinity Almost Output Synchronization for Heterogeneous Networks Without Exchange of Controller States", "paper_id": "WOS:000367145800003"}
