Sankoff's algorithm requires O(N(6)) time and O(N(4)) space, where N denotes the length of the compared sequences, and thus its applicability is very limited. The current literature offers many heuristics for speeding up Sankoff's alignment process, some making restrictive assumptions on the length or the shape of the RNA substructures. We show how to speed up Sankoff's algorithm in practice via non-heuristic methods, without compromising optimality. Our analysis shows that the expected time complexity of the new algorithm is O(N(4)zeta(N)), where zeta(N) converges to O(N), assuming a standard polymer folding model which was supported by experimental analysis. Hence, our algorithm speeds up Sankoff's algorithm by a linear factor on average. In simulations, our algorithm speeds up computation by a factor of 3-12 for sequences of length 25-250.
