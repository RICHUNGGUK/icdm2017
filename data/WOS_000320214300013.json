The information of the polygon is given online. As the exploration proceeds, the searcher gains more information of the polygon. We give a 1.219-competitive algorithm for this problem. We also study the case of a rectilinear simple polygon, and give a 1.167-competitive algorithm.", "paper_title": "Online Vertex Exploration Problems in a Simple Polygon", "paper_id": "WOS:000320214300013"}
