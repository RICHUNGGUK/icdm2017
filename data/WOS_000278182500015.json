In this paper we predict through global illumination simulation this unintentional indirect component and solve for the optimal compensated projection imagery that will minimize the difference between the desired imagery and the actual total illumination in the resulting physical scene. Our method makes use of quadratic programming to minimize this error within the constraints of the physical system, namely, that negative light is physically impossible. We demonstrate our compensation optimization in both computer simulation and physical validation within a table-top spatially augmented reality system. We present an application of these results for visualization of interior architectural illumination. To facilitate interactive modifications to the scene geometry and desired appearance, our system is accelerated with a CUDA implementation of the QP optimization method.", "paper_title": "Global Illumination Compensation for Spatially Augmented Reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000278182500015"}
