The problem becomes more complicated when the return of all risky assets are subject to uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new portfolio modeling approach with uncertain data and it is also analyzed using different robust optimization techniques. The proposed formulations are solved using genetic algorithm. The implementation of the proposed method is examined on variety of well known benchmark data sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
