Although known since more than 30 years, the understanding of the molecular basis of drug/transporter interaction is still limited, which is mainly due to the lack of structural information available. However, within the past decade X-ray structures of several bacterial homologues as well as very recently also of mouse P-gp have become available. Within this review we give an overview on the current status of structural information available and on its impact for structure-based drug design.", "paper_title": "Impact of the Recent Mouse P-Glycoprotein Structure for Structure-Based Ligand Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000277596900002"}
