In most cases, the data, which we would like to share with others, are multimedia, such as interesting music videos and funny films. Meanwhile, the buffers of mobile wireless devices are usually limited, then some messages with different importance on video recovery, will be dropped during transmission. Therefore, it's imperative to design efficient buffer management strategy to improve the video delivery quality. Several policies have been presented, but they are just designed for general data and not suitable for video transmission. In this paper, we comprehensively take the temporal correlation of video data and the diffusivity of messages into account, and propose DSVM, a novel buffer management strategy. Extensive simulations validate its performance, and up to about 3dB Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gain can be achieved over the existing buffer management policies.", "paper_title": "An Optimal Buffer Management Strategy for Video Transmission in Opportunistic Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364500200009"}
