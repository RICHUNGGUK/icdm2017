For general 3D domains, near optimal p-version meshes require large curved elements over the smooth portions of the domain, geometrically graded curved elements to the singular edges and vertices, and a controlled layer of curved prismatic elements in the thin sections. This paper presents a procedure that accepts a CAD solid model as input and creates a curved mesh with the desired characteristics. One key component of the procedure is the automatic identification of thin sections of the model through a set of discrete medial surface points computed from an Octree-based tracing algorithm and the generation of prismatic elements in the thin directions in those sections. The second key component is the identification of geometric singular edges and the generation of geometrically graded meshes in the appropriate directions from the edges. Curved local mesh modification operations are applied to ensure the mesh can be curved to the geometry to the required level of geometric approximation.", "paper_title": "Construction of near optimal meshes for 3D curved domains with thin sections and singularities for p-version method", "paper_id": "WOS:000278153000002"}
