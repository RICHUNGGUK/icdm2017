The four main features of this class of schemes are: (a) multiresolution wavelet decomposition of the computed flow data as sensors for adaptive numerical dissipative control, (b) multistep filter to accommodate efficient application of different numerical dissipation models and different spatial high order base schemes, (c) a unique idea in solving the ideal conservative MHD system (a non-strictly hyperbolic conservation law) without having to deal with an incomplete eigensystem set while at the same time ensuring that correct shock speeds and locations are computed, and (d) minimization of the divergence of the magnetic field (del center dot B) numerical error. By design, the flow sensors, different choice of high order base schemes and numerical dissipation models are stand-alone modules. A whole class of low dissipative high order schemes can be derived at ease, making the resulting computer software very flexible with widely applicable. Performance of multiscale and multiphysics test cases are illustrated with many levels of grid refinement and comparison with commonly used schemes in the literature. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
