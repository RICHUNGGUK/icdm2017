In this paper, we exploit the speed of the Harmony Search algorithm and the Optimum-Path Forest classifier in order to propose a new fast and accurate approach for feature selection. Comparisons to some other pattern recognition and feature selection techniques showed that the proposed hybrid algorithm for feature selection outperformed them. The experiments were carried out in the context of identifying non-technical losses in power distribution systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
