During the movement of a target, how to select an optimal subset of sensors to wake up is of critical importance both for extending network lifetime and guaranteeing tracking quality. In this paper, we first propose a probabilistic-based dynamic non-complete k-coverage method, alpha-k-coverage, which can guarantee that target moving area is covered by at least k sensors under at least alpha probability. Then, we propose an energy-efficient sensor scheduling scheme, Optimal Cooperation Scheduling Algorithm (OCSA), to balance tracking quality and network lifetime under alpha-k-coverage condition. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through extensive simulation experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
