A set of problem solving agents autonomously process local tasks and cooperatively interoperate via an in-cloud blackboard system to provide QoS and mobility information. A Q-Learning awareness algorithm calculates the exceptive rewards of a handoff to all access networks. These rewards are then used by problem solving agents to determine what actions must be performed. Agents located in the integrated IMS-4G-Cloud networks handle service continuity by using a handoff mechanism. Through operations and cooperation among active agents, these phases select a policy for predictive and anticipated IF Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) handoff management. Compared with conventional IMS handoff management, the proposed DMAS scheme achieves shorter handoff delay and better QoS for real-time service applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
