Such systems are called autonomic computing systems. It is essential that such systems, especially those for critical applications, have the capability of self-protection from attacks under various situations without much human intervention or guidance. To achieve this goal, situation-aware security (SAS) needs to be considered in the development process. In this paper, a model-driven development framework for SAS in autonomic computing systems is presented. The runtime support for SAS is provided by a situation-aware middleware. The advantages of using the development framework and the situation-aware middleware to build autonomic computing systems with SAS are discussed and illustrated.", "paper_title": "Development and runtime support for situation-aware security in autonomic computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800017"}
