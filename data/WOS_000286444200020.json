This system allows for the management of data associated with field collections, culture conditions, harvests, extractions, chemical separations, and biological evaluation. This software utilizes a MySQL database for data storage, which allows for reporting and data mining via third party tools. In addition, a Web-based interface was constructed to allow for multiuser access from a variety of desktop platforms. The code for this system is freely available and has been released under the Illinois Open Source license.", "paper_title": "CYANOS: A Data Management System for Natural Product Drug Discovery Efforts Using Cultured Microorganisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000286444200020"}
