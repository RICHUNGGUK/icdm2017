By using the Lyapunov method combining with the comparison principle, a global synchronization error bound together with new sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) are derived in order to guarantee that the synchronization error dynamics can converge to the predetermined level. Simulation results further demonstrate the validation of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
