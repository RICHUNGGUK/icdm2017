The rainbow vertex-connection number of a connected graph G, denoted by rvc(G), is the smallest number of colors that are needed in order to make G rainbow vertex-connected. In a previous paper we showed that it is NP-Complete to decide whether a given graph G has rvc (G) = 2. In this paper we show that for every integer k >= 2, deciding whether rvc(G) <= k is NP-Hard. We also show that for any fixed integer k >= 2, this problem belongs to NP-class, and so it becomes NP-Complete. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
