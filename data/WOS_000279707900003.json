The algorithm computes a finite partition of the parameters space into constructible sets such that the absolutely irreducible components are given uniformly in each constructible set. Each component will be represented by two items: first by a parametric representative system, i.e., the equations that define the component and second by a parametric effective generic point which gives a parametric rational univariate representation of the elements of the component. The number of absolutely irreducible components is constant in each constructible set. The complexity bound of this algorithm is delta(O(r4))d(r4dO(n3)), being double exponential in n, where d (resp. delta) is an upper bound on the degrees of the input parametric polynomials w.r.t. the main n variables (resp. w.r.t. r parameters).", "paper_title": "On computing absolutely irreducible components of algebraic varieties with parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000279707900003"}
