A k-SAT problem indicates that each clause has exactly k literals. The Not-All-Equal (NAE) 3-SAT problem and One-In-Three (1IN3) 3-SAT pmblem are both NP-complete problems. In this paper, we present molecular solutions to determine all true assignments (for the 3-SAT problem), and furthermore to determine Not-All-Equal (NAE) solutions and One-In-Three (1IN3) solutions in. DNA-based supercomputing. The complexity of the presented DNA-based algorithm is also discussed. We describe the time complexity and volume complexity of Algorithms 3-1 and 4-1, numbers of test tubes used, and the longest library strand M the solution spaces of Algorithms 3-1 and 4-1. Finally, the simulated experiment is applied to verify correction of the proposed DNA-based algorithm for solving the One-In-Three 3-SAT problem.", "paper_title": "A MOLECULAR ALGORITHMIC SOLUTION FOR THE NOT-ALL-EQUAL AND ONE-IN-THREE 3-SAT PROBLEMS IN DNA-BASED SUPERCOMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700007"}
