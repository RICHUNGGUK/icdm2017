In this method, the dynamic responses of vehicle subsystem and bridge subsystem are solved separately, the iteration within time-step is avoided, the computation memory is saved, the programming difficulty is reduced, and it is easy to adopt the commercial structural analysis software for bridge subsystem. The calculation efficiency of the method is discussed by case study and an updated iteration strategy is suggested to improve the convergence characteristics for the proposed method.
