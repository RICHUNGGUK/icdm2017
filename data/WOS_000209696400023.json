A composite model involving path loss, Rayleigh fading, and shadowing is considered. The exact closed-form moment generating function and an accurate approximation are derived. The aggregate interference is shown to be accurately approximated by a Gamma distribution. The exact outage and an asymptotic approximation are derived.", "paper_title": "Aggregate Interference Analysis for Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696400023"}
