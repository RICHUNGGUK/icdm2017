It is shown that interference signals and multipath signals are effectively suppressed using a serial subspace projection method without any knowledge of the incoming directional information. After the subspace projections, a beamformer is used to maximize the SNR of the received signal. The enhancement in the performance is presented in terms of the cross correlation value and beam patterns.", "paper_title": "Interference cancellation and multipath mitigation algorithm for GPS using subspace projection algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000254605300029"}
