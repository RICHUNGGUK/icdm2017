To study how watching 3DTV influences mental fatigue and to investigate the related objective indicators, we use physiological detectors to record EEGs of 10 individual subjects both before and after watching 2D or 3D television. The 2D/3D changes of both energy values of EEG in the four wavebands, namely alpha (alpha), beta (beta), theta (theta), delta (delta), and four fatigue-related algorithms (alpha + theta)/beta, alpha/beta, (alpha + theta)/(alpha + beta) and theta/beta, were compared and analyzed. The results show that the parameters for the 3DTV group, except theta rhythm, changed more significantly than those for the 2DTV groups in some brain regions. For most subjects watching 3DTV, the energy in alpha and beta frequency bands significantly decrease while delta activity shows a significant increase, and theta activity remains largely unchanged. All four algorithms show a significant increase with algorithm (alpha + theta)/beta showing a greater increase (p < 0.01) on individual electrodes. The results of this study have implications for detecting fatigue associated with watching 3DTV. The above parameters, combined with subjective evaluations, can serve as objective indicators to evaluate the level of 3DTV fatigue. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
