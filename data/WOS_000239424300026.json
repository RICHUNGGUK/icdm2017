The tutorials were developed using a learning cycle to address the needs of all learners. Adaptivity was gradually introduced according to the learner interaction behavior with the cycle. Results from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicate that the amount of time spent was significantly reduced in the third and fully adaptive tutorial with comparable performance.", "paper_title": "Adapting educational hypermedia to interaction behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300026"}
