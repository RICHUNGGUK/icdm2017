The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy stochastic time-delay model with parametric uncertainties and unknown nonlinearies is, presented. A sufficient condition for the exponential stability in mean square of the sliding motion is also derived. Moreover, it is shown that when the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with equality constraint are feasible, the designs of both sliding surface and sliding-mode controller can be easily obtained via convex optimization. A simulation example illustrating the proposed method is given.", "paper_title": "Robust fuzzy design for nonlinear uncertain stochastic systems via sliding-mode control", "paper_id": "WOS:000247285300003"}
