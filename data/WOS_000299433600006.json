Transport of nanoparticles is mainly attributed to the Brownian force which increases as the nanoparticle decreases to 1 nm. This paper first verifies a Lagrangian Brownian model found in the commercial computational fluid dynamics software Fluent before applying the model to the nasal cavity and the tracheobronchial (TB) airway tree with a focus on drug delivery. The average radial dispersion of the nanoparticles was 9x greater for the user-defined function model over the Fluent in-built model. Deposition in the nasal cavity was high for very small nanoparticles. The particle diameter range in which the deposition drops from 80 to 18% is between 1 and 10 nm. From 10 to 150 nm, however, there is only a small change in the deposition curve from 18 to 15%. A similar deposition curve profile was found for the TB airway.", "paper_title": "Numerical modelling of nanoparticle deposition in the nasal cavity and the tracheobronchial airway", "paper_id": "WOS:000299433600006"}
