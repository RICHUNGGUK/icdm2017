To deal with this partial knowledge many types of representation other than the quantitative one are used to describe process variables (qualitative, symbolic interval). Thus, the development of automatic reasoning mechanisms about the process is faced with this problem of multiple data representations. In this paper, a unified principle for reasoning about heterogeneous data is introduced. This principle is based on a simultaneous mapping of data from initially heterogeneous spaces into only one homogeneous space based on a relative measure using appropriate characteristic functions. Once the heterogeneous data are represented in a unified space, a single processing for various analysis purposes can be performed using simple reasoning mechanisms. An application of this principle within a fuzzy logic framework is performed here to demonstrate its effectiveness. We show that simple fuzzy reasoning mechanisms can be used to reason in a unified way about heterogeneous data in three well known machine learning problems.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS A UNIFIED PRINCIPLE FOR REASONING ABOUT HETEROGENEOUS DATA: A FUZZY LOGIC FRAMEWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000302474100007"}
