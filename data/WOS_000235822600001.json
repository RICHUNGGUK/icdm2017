For the semiconductor industry, the development of system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology and silicon intellectual property (SIP) are the basis for market strategy and the formation of comparative advantage. in order to achieve quicker time-to-market integrated circuit designs, SIP trade and reuse must be considered. This research applies mobile agent technology that enables the use of SIP automatic e-trade mechanisms over the Internet. Following the principles of autonomous data sharing, asynchronous data acquisition, and parallel task processing, this research applies remote SIP information retrieval and automates the matching and trading activities. A prototype system, called the Knowledge Services and Trade Platform (KSTP), is designed and implemented with web-based interfaces. A mobile agent behavioral model is used for negotiations and knowledge acquisition. The agent-based prototype considers factors of efficiency, cost, and precision throughout the process of SIP knowledge acquisition. For trade partner matching, fuzzy set theory evaluation models are developed. The matching model efficiently and consistently suggests Suitable partners for trade under different circumstances. The goal of the research is to provide all autonomous and collaborative KSTP for SIP exchanges. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
