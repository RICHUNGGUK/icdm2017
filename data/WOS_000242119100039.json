A complete axiom system is presented for the proposed logic, and the new negligibility relation is compared with previous ones and its advantages are presented on the basis of an example.", "paper_title": "Order of magnitude qualitative reasoning with bidirectional negligibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000242119100039"}
