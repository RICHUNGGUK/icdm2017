Of particular interest in this context are room temperature ionic liquids (in short as ILs in this paper). Due to the relatively high viscosity, ILs is expected to be used in the form of solvent diluted mixture with reduced viscosity in industrial application, where predicting the viscosity of IL mixture has been an important research issue. Different IL mixture and many modelling approaches have been investigated. The objective of this study is to provide an alternative model approach using soft computing technique, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) model, to predict the compositional viscosity of binary mixtures of ILs [C-n-mim][ NTf2] with n=4, 6, 8, 10 in methanol and ethanol over the entire range of molar fraction at a broad range of temperatures from T=293.0-328.0K. The results show that the proposed ANN model provides alternative way to predict compositional viscosity successfully with highly improved accuracy and also show its potential to be extensively utilized to predict compositional viscosity taking account of IL alkyl chain length, as well as temperature and compositions simultaneously, i.e., more complex intermolecular interactions between components in which it would be hard or impossible to establish the analytical model. This illustrates the potential application of ANN in the case that the physical and thermodynamic properties are highly non-linear or too complex.", "paper_title": "Artificial Neural Network for Compositional Ionic Liquid Viscosity Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000304476000006"}
