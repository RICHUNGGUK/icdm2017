These restrictions (two-players, zero-sum, binary preferences) strongly limit the expressivity of the framework. While the first two can be easily encompassed by defining the agents' preferences as an arbitrary n-uple of propositional formulas, relaxing the last one needs Boolean games to be coupled with a propositional language for compact preference representation. In this paper, we consider generalized Boolean games where players' preferences are expressed within two of these languages: prioritized goals and propositionalized CP-nets.", "paper_title": "Compact preference representation for Boolean games", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500007"}
