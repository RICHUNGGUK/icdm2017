However, there are few compilations of jurisdictional domains that include their evolution. One of the causes is the complexity of their generation. As an advance in this area, this paper describes a process that facilitates the creation of knowledge bases containing the evolution of jurisdictional domains. As application example, this paper presents the creation of a jurisdictional knowledge base of Spain with its evolution between 1830 and 2011.", "paper_title": "Population of a spatio-temporal knowledge base for jurisdictional domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000342297000012"}
