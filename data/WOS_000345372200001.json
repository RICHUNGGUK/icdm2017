Its management, treatment and follow-up are clinical challenges due to the progressive aortic dilatation and potentially severe complications during follow-up. It is well known that the direction and rate of dilatation of the artery wall depend on haemodynamic parameters such as the local velocity profiles, intra-luminal pressures and resultant wall stresses. These factors act on the FL and true lumen, triggering remodelling and clinical worsening. In this study, we aimed to validate a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tool for the haemodynamic characterisation of chronic (type B) ADs. We validated the numerical results, for several dissection geometries, with experimental data obtained from a previous in vitro study performed on idealised dissected physical models. We found a good correlation between CFD simulations and experimental measurements as long as the tear size was large enough so that the effect of the wall compliance was negligible.", "paper_title": "Validation of numerical flow simulations against in vitro phantom measurements in different type B aortic dissection scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000345372200001"}
