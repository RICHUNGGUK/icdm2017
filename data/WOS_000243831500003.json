In a different and orthogonal work, we proposed a minimalization schema that allows to provide a class of real recursive functions that corresponds to extensions of computable functions over the integers. Mixing the two approaches we prove that computable functions over the real numbers in the sense of recursive analysis can be characterized as the smallest class of functions that contains some basic functions, and closed by composition, linear integration, minimalization and limit schema.", "paper_title": "Recursive analysis characterized as a class of real recursive functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000243831500003"}
