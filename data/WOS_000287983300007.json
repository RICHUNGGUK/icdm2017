This study constructs an uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of the lifetime performance index based on the upper record values for Weibull lifetime model. Then the UMVUE of the lifetime performance index is utilized to develop the new hypothesis testing procedure in the condition of known lower specification limit. Finally, two examples are presented to assess the behavior of this test statistic for testing null hypothesis under given significance level. Moreover, the product managers can then employ the new testing procedure to determine whether the process adheres to the required level. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
