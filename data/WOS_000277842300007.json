The buck-boost requirement arises from the rapid changes in the atmospheric condition or the sunlight incident angle. The system mainly consists of the non-inverting synchronous buck-boost DC/DC power converter, MOSFET drivers, anti-cross conduction logic circuitry, feedback compensator, and PWM regulator. The system is capable of converting the supply voltage source to higher and lower voltages to the load terminal with voltage polarity unchanged. The voltage at the load terminal is controlled by continuously adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM regulator. Application of the buck-boost converter in battery management system design is also addressed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
