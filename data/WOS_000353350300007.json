We present a system for robust matching and retrieval which works well for such difficult query images, using probabilistic information fusion from multiple independent sources of measurement. Our experiments with two robust and computationally inexpensive features show promising results on a representative database, compared with the state-of-the-art in the area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
