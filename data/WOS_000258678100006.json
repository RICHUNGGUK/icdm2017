One of the biggest drawbacks of applying RBDO to practical problem is its high computational cost that is often impractical to industries. In search of the most suitable RBDO method for industrial applications, we first evaluated several existing RBDO approaches in details such as the double-loop RBDO, the sequential optimization and reliability assessment, and the response surface method. Then, based on industry needs, a platform incorporating/integrating the existing algorithm of optimization and reliability analysis is built for a practical RBDO problem. Effectiveness of the proposed RBDO approach is demonstrated using a simple cantilever beam problem and a more complicated industry problem.", "paper_title": "Application of reliability-based optimization to earth-moving machine: hydraulic cylinder components design process", "paper_id": "WOS:000258678100006"}
