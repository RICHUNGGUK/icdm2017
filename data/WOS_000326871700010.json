This test is based on the Kullback-Leibler discrimination methodology proposed by Song [2002, Goodness of fit tests based on Kullback-Leibler discrimination, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 48(5), pp. 1103-1117]. The critical values and powers for some alternatives are obtained by simulation. The proposed test is compared with other tests, namely Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper, Cramer-von Mises, Watson and Anderson-Darling. The use of the proposed test is shown in a real example.", "paper_title": "An entropy test for the Rayleigh distribution and power comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000326871700010"}
