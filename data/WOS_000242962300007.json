The filter uses two Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Networks, operating in parallel, to perform the task of separation of the lung sounds, obtained from patients with pulmonary pathology. Extensive experimental results, including fine/coarse crackles and squawks, are given, and a performance comparison with a series of other models is conducted, underlining the separation capabilities of the proposed filter and its improved performance with respect to its competing rivals.
