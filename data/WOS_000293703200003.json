The goal of these works is to interconnect a large number of servers with significant bandwidth requirements. Coupled with these new DCN structures, routing protocols play an important role in exploring the network capacities that can be potentially delivered by the topologies. This article conducts a survey on the current state of the art of DCN routing techniques. The article focuses on the insights behind these routing schemes and also points out the open research issues hoping to spark new interests and developments in this field.", "paper_title": "Survey on Routing in Data Centers: Insights and Future Directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000293703200003"}
