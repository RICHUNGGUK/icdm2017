To accomplish this goal, our research group focuses on behaviour of biological systems, which inherently are scalable, adaptive and robust. In this paper, we first verify the practicality of control mechanisms adopting a reaction-diffusion equation, which explains emergence of patterns on the surface of body of fishes and mammals, and then propose two methods for faster pattern generation to save energy consumption. Prom simulation and practical experiments on a prototype, it was shown that a stable pattern could be generated in a wireless sensor network in several minutes, even when packets were lost for collisions in wireless communication.", "paper_title": "Reaction-diffusion based autonomous control of wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280056700001"}
