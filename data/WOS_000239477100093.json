This paper presents KrAssess, a programming education system, which aims to facilitate student self-assessment and promote learner reflection through scrutable learner models. KrAssess supports learning by helping students learn to \"see\" solutions according to the criteria valued by their teacher. It also supports learning to write, review and improve solutions to design tasks.", "paper_title": "Scrutable learner modelling and learner reflection in student self-assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100093"}
