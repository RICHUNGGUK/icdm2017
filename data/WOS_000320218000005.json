The proposed clock recovery using expected received signal amplitudes as the criterion realizes minimum mean square error (IVIMSE) clock recovery. A receiver architecture using an integrating DFE with the proposed symbol-rate clock recovery is also proposed. The proposed clock recovery algorithm successfully recovered the clock phase in a system level simulation only with a DFE. Higher jitter tolerance than 0.26 UIPP. at 10 Gb/s operation was also confirmed in the simulation with an 11 dB channel loss at 5 GHz.", "paper_title": "Symbol-Rate Clock Recovery for Integrating DFE Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000320218000005"}
