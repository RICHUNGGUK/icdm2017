The user selection is performed using the minimum probability of missed opportunity criterion and the random search criterion. Both the NeymanPearson rule and the minimum probability of error rule are considered. The sensing performance is examined with respect to different system parameters. Numerical results show that user selection can achieve a large amount of resource saving at little performance loss.
