The primary objective is to identify and evaluate the key techniques that have the highest energy saving potential to be developed in the context of Green Networks while serving as a guideline for future research endeavours. The focus of the paper is targeted towards multicell networks which are composed of multiple BSs co-existing in the same area sharing the available radio resources. Due to this, greater emphasis is given towards the techniques that take inter-cell interference (ICI) into account while allocating the resources and, in the process, maximize the energy efficiency (EE). The resource management solutions presented in the paper are classified under three network domains namely homogeneous, heterogeneous, and cooperative networks. Furthermore, the analytical techniques for characterizing the EE of multicell networks are discussed in terms of the stochastic geometry framework. Finally, the paper outlines the current challenges and open issues in the area of energy efficient resource management for multicell cellular networks.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Energy Efficient Resource Management Techniques for Multicell Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000338700300009"}
