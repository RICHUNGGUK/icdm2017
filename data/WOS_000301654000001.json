It allows users to send image queries of urban scenes using camera phones. The system uses a database of views of scenes to determine the poses of query views provided by the users. Information is then mapped onto the query views. Our approach is based on a fully affine invariant descriptor, coined PRIUS, which can identify corresponding building facades across widely separated views despite the highly repetitive nature of the man-made environments. The system is substantiated by experiments that show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches such as SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform) and MSER (maximally stable external regions) in image retrieval.
