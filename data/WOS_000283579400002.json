To count the number of all the maximal cliques, without actually generating them, our algorithm requires O(log p) communication rounds with O(nm/p) local computation time. We also present an algorithm to generate the first maximal clique in O(log p) communication rounds with O(nm/p) local computation, and to generate each one of the subsequent maximal cliques this algorithm requires O(log p) communication rounds with O(m/p) local computation. The maximal cliques generation algorithm is based on generating all maximal paths in a directed acyclic graph, and we present an algorithm for this problem that uses O(log p) communication rounds with O(m/p) local computation for each maximal path. We also show that the presented algorithms can be extended to the CREW PRAM model.", "paper_title": "PARALLEL ALGORITHMS FOR MAXIMAL CLIQUES IN CIRCLE GRAPHS AND UNRESTRICTED DEPTH SEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000283579400002"}
