The nature of the association between conceptual elements was studied in this paper, where the definition and properties of association intensity were provided. Furthermore, concept granules were constructed by studying the mapping between conceptual elements. The general forms of expansion and aggregation of concept granules were also given. The theories in the study laid the foundation for evolutionary analysis of knowledge-based complex system, and offered a referential model to the studies on knowledge evolution of ontology engineering.
