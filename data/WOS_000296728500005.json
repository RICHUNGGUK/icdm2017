In this survey and tutorial paper we introduce the basic characteristics of vehicular networks, provide an overview of applications and associated requirements, along with challenges and their proposed solutions. In addition, we provide an overview of the current and past major ITS programs and projects in the USA, Japan and Europe. Moreover, vehicular networking architectures and protocol suites employed in such programs and projects in USA, Japan and Europe are discussed.", "paper_title": "Vehicular Networking: A Survey and Tutorial on Requirements, Architectures, Challenges, Standards and Solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000296728500005"}
