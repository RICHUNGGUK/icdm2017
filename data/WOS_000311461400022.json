We showed how these mainly local conformational changes of G(alpha) could Initiate large domain domain motions of the whole complex, the G(beta gamma) behaving as an almost quasi rigid block This separation of the two G(alpha):GTP and G(beta gamma) subunits required the loss of several.:, interactions at the G(alpha):G(beta)gamma interface that were reported.
