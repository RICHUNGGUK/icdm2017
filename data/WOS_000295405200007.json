The reconstruction algorithm developed for images incorporates several new elements to improve computational complexity and reconstruction fidelity in this application regime.", "paper_title": "Efficient Deterministic Compressed Sensing for Images with Chirps and Reed-Muller Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295405200007"}
