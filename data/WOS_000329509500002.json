In General Galerkin, no explicit subgrid model is used; instead, the computational mesh is adaptively refined with respect to an a posteriori error estimate of a quantity of interest in the computation, in this case, the drag force on the rudimentary landing gear. Turbulent boundary layers are modeled using a simple wall-layer model with the shear stress at walls proportional to the skin friction, which here is assumed to be small and, therefore, can be approximated by zero skin friction. We compare our results with experimental data and other state of the art computations, where we find good agreement in sound pressure levels, surface velocities, and flow separation. We also compare with detailed surface pressure experimental data where we find largely good agreement, apart from some local differences for which we discuss possible explanations.
