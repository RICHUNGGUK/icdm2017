The design-for-testability (DFT) strategy has been developed to make the testing of analog cores digitally compliant. The mixed-signal cores have been accessed through specially design mechanisms (switches). A computer-aided test (CAT) tool employing the proposed algorithm has been developed. Extensive experiments have been performed on MSOC benchmarks built of ISCAS'89 circuits for digital cores and ITC'97 circuits for analog cores. Results show that the CAT tool provides a hardware-efficient integrated solution.", "paper_title": "An integrated DFT solution for mixed-signal SOCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238709900013"}
