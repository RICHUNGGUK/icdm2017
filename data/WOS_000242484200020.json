The word \"automatic\" means that the technical details of computation are made transparent to the user. This is achieved by combining a technique from computer science known as \"automatic differentiation\" with the Laplace approximation for calculating the marginal likelihood. Automatic differentiation, which should not be confused with symbolic differentiation, is mostly unknown to statisticians, and hence basic ideas and results are reviewed. The computational performance of the approach is compared to that of existing mixed-model software on a suite of datasets selected from the mixed-model literature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
