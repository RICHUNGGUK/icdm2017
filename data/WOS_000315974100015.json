The Interaction Picture method has good computational features when used together with the standard 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme (giving rise to the RK4-IP method). In this paper we present an embedded Runge-Kutta scheme with orders 3 and 4 with the aim to deliver an estimation of the local error for adaptive step-size control purposes in the Interaction Picture method. The corresponding ERK4(3)-IP method preserves the features of the RK4-IP method and provides a local error estimate at no significant extra cost. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
