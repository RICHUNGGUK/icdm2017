The comparison among the simulation results, test data and early simulation results indicates the 42-component system established by this paper has made improvements against many weaknesses of the Previous simulation in an all-round way. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the case setting and algorithm improvement are effective. It is also found that the modeling of module with chemical reaction, the spool throttling modeling of various regulator valves, the modeling of the turbine characteristics and the modeling of wall heat transfer are four key factors which affect simulation accuracy, and that the coupling modeling of flow and combustion is the key factor which affects simulation stability.
