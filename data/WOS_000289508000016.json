The scheme proposes the development of a fuzzy certainty equivalence controller for controlling non-linear plants. This controller is designed on the basis of plant parameters estimated online at each sampling instant using bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) technique, a stochastic optimization technique, popularly employed in recent times. The utility of the proposed scheme is aptly demonstrated by implementing it to control the level in a surge tank under a variety of reference input commands, where the fuzzy controller could significantly out-perform the corresponding classical feedback linearizing controller and PSO-based fuzzy controller.
