We have developed a unique temporal visual discomfort model (TVDM) that we use to automatically predict the degree of discomfort felt when viewing stereoscopic 3D (S3D) images. This model is based on physiological mechanisms. In particular, TVDM is defined as a second-order system capturing relevant neuronal elements of the visual pathway from the eyes and through the brain. The experimental results demonstrate that the TVDM transfer function model produces predictions that correlate highly with the subjective visual discomfort scores contained in the large public databases. The transfer function analysis also yields insights into the perceptual processes that yield a stable S3D image.", "paper_title": "Transfer Function Model of Physiological Mechanisms Underlying Temporal Visual Discomfort Experienced When Viewing Stereoscopic 3D Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000360066700010"}
