We introduce the human visual perception in video denoising to achieve good performance. In general, smooth regions corrupted by noise are much more annoying to human observers than complex regions. Moreover, human eyes are more interested in complex regions with image details and more sensitive to luminance than chrominance. Based on the human visual perception, we perform perceptual video denoising to effectively preserve image details and remove annoying noise. To successfully remove noise and recover the image details, we extend nonlocal mean filtering to the spatiotemporal domain. With the guidance of content adaptive segmentation and motion detection, we conduct content adaptive filtering in the YUV color space to consider context in images and obtain perceptually pleasant results. Extensive experiments on various video sequences demonstrate that the proposed method reconstructs natural-looking results even in highly corrupted images and achieves good performance in terms of both visual quality and quantitative measures.
