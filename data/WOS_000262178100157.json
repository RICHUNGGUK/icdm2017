The KNM comprises two frameworks: evaluation and calculation framework. Qualitative research methods, including a literature review, in-depth interviews, focus groups and content analysis, are conducted to construct the evaluation framework of KNM. An algorithm model is proposed in the calculation framework and a 30 cases survey was employed to obtain the initial version of the score ranges used to differentiate maturity levels. Several propositions and the corresponding KNM were constructed. We define the KM maturity level into five stages: knowledge chaotic stage, knowledge conscientious stage, KM stage, KM advanced stage, and KM integration stage. The evaluation framework of KNM consists of three aspects: three target management objects (culture, KM process, and information technology), 68 KM activities, and 16 key areas (KAs). The initial version of the score ranges was identified. The study results can be referenced and the methodology can be applied to other countries, although the sample is confined to industries in Taiwan. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
