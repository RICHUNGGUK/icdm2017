This paper deals with SRE based on the l(2)-l(1) problem and applies it to time series prediction problems. The l(2)-l(1) problem consists of l(2)-norm and l(1)-norm regularization terms, where the former denotes the total ensemble empirical risk, and the latter represents the ensemble complexity. Thus, the goal is both to minimize the total ensemble training error and control the ensemble complexity. Experiments on real-world data for regression and time series prediction are given.", "paper_title": "Time series prediction using sparse regression ensemble based on l(2)-l(1) problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000351409400019"}
