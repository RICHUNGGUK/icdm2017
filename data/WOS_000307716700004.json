The representation and the fusion of the information in our method are based on the use of belief function. The proposal generates the basic belief mass assignment using a modified Mahalanobis distance. While the decision making process is based on the extension of the frame of hypotheses. Our method has been tested for a nearly constant velocity target and compared with both the nearest neighbor filter and the joint probabilistic data associations filter in highly ambiguous cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal and show improved performance compared to the aforementioned alternative commonly used methods.", "paper_title": "Data Association in Multi-target Tracking Using Belief Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000307716700004"}
