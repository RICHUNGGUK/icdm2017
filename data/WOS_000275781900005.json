We propose a stochastic programming formulation with Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP) certainty-equivalent models. In experiments neither approach dominates the other. However, the CP approach is orders of magnitude faster for large audit times, and almost as fast as the MILP approach for small audit times. This work generalises a previous approach by relaxing the assumption of instantaneous audits, and by prohibiting concurrent auditing.", "paper_title": "Scheduling internal audit activities: a stochastic combinatorial optimization problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000275781900005"}
