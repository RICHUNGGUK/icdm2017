Simulated and measured performance of a GaN HEMT single-FET switch cell topology and the one of a complete SPDT using the proposed approach are presented to demonstrate the approach feasibility and effectiveness. The resulting SPDT, operating at X Band, is featured by 1 dB insertion loss, isolation better than 37 dB all over the operating bandwidth and a power handling capability higher than 39 dBm.
