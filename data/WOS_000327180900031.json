The experimental activity pertains to inflation tests performed on specific gastrointestinal conduct segments. Different inflation processes are performed according to progressively increasing volumes. Each inflation test is performed by a rapid liquid in-flaw, up to a prescribed volume, which is held constant for about 300 s to allow the development of relaxation processes. The different tests are interspersed by 600 s of rest to allow the recovery of the specimen mechanical condition. A physio-mechanical model is developed to interpret both the elastic behaviour of the sample, as the pressure-volume trend during the rapid liquid in-flaw, and the time-dependent response, as the pressure drop during the relaxation processes. The minimization of discrepancy between experimental data and model results entails the identification of the parameters that characterize the viscoelastic model adopted for the definition of the behaviour of the gastrointestinal regions. The reliability of the procedure is assessed by the characterization of the response of samples from rat small intestine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
