This is a well-studied problem, arising in classical scattering theory, quantum mechanics and numerical analysis, usually addressed through the explicit construction of the Wigner rotation matrices. We show that rotation can be carried out easily and stably through \"pseudospectral\" projection, without ever constructing the matrix entries themselves. Existing fast algorithms, based on recurrence relations, are subject to a variety of instabilities, limiting the effectiveness of the approach for expansions of high degree. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
