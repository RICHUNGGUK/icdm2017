The proposed method extends the sparse representation-based classification algorithm by incorporating the low-rank structure of data representation. The DLRR algorithm recovers a clean dictionary with enhanced discrimination ability from the corrupted training samples for sparse representation. Simultaneously, it learns a low-rank projection matrix to correct corrupted test samples by projecting them onto their corresponding underlying subspaces. The dictionary elements from different classes are encouraged to be as independent as possible by regularizing the structural incoherence of the original training samples. This leads to a compact representation of a corrected test sample by a linear combination of more dictionary elements from the corrected class. The experimental results on benchmark databases show the effectiveness and robustness of our face recognition technique. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
