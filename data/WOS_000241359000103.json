One of them is an Information Retrieval module and the others are Named Entity Recognition modules based on machine learning and based on knowledge. We have carried out several runs with different combinations of these modules for resolving the proposed tasks. The system scored second position for the tasks against German collections and third position for the tasks against English collections.", "paper_title": "University of Alicante at GeoCLEF 2005", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000103"}
