The purpose of the design is to demonstrate how suitable deep submicron CMOS transistors are for ultra low voltage, low power oscillator design. The VCO operates at 6.3 GHz and a divide-by-four circuit buffer provide the wanted 1575.42 MHz signal. Measured phase noise is for a 0.6 V supply voltage and bias current of 2.6 mA - 122 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, measured for a 1.58 GHz carrier. The phase noise of the VCO has been measured for different bias point showing good agreement between measured results and theory.", "paper_title": "An ultra low voltage, low power, fully integrated VCO for GPS in 90 nm RF-CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000233567000007"}
