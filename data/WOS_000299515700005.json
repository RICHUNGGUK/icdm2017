The laser measures the distance to an arbitrary point on a flat surface. After some motion, the odometry estimate of the motion is used to aim the laser to measure the distance to the same point. Through geometric methods the discrepancy in the expected and measured distances can be used to update the odometer estimate of the motion. We present experiments using a mobile robot, pan-tilt unit and laser. Our method could be incorporated into any simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm.", "paper_title": "Improving odometry using a controlled point laser", "paper_id": "WOS:000299515700005"}
