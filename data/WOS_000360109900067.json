When the number of DMs is large, a higher degree of heterogeneity is expected, and it is difficult to translate heterogeneous information into one unified preference without loss of context. In this aspect, the current GDM models face two main challenges, i.e., handling the complexity pertaining to the unification of heterogeneous information from a large number of DMs, and providing optimal solutions based on unification methods. This paper presents a new consensus-based GDM model to manage heterogeneous information. In the new GDM model, an aggregation of individual priority (AIP)-based aggregation mechanism, which is able to employ flexible methods for deriving each DM's individual priority and to avoid information loss caused by unifying heterogeneous information, is utilized to aggregate the individual preferences. To reach a consensus more efficiently, different revision schemes are employed to reward/penalize the cooperative/non-cooperative DMs, respectively. The temporary collective opinion used to guide the revision process is derived by aggregating only those non-conflicting opinions at each round of revision. In order to measure the consensus in a robust manner, a position-based dissimilarity measure is developed. Compared with the existing GDM models, the proposed GDM model is more effective and flexible in processing heterogeneous information. It can be used to handle different types of information with different degrees of granularity. Six types of information are exemplified in this paper, i.e., ordinal, interval, fuzzy number, linguistic, intuitionistic fuzzy set, and real number. The results indicate that the position-based consensus measure is able to overcome possible distortions of the results in large-scale GDM problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier By.
