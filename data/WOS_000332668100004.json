BTC is a simple and efficient image compression technique. However, it yields images of undesirable quality, and significant blocking effects are seen as the block size that is used increases. A modified method known as Enhanced Block Truncation Coding (EBTC) is proposed to solve these problems. For secret sharing, we propose a (2, 2) secret sharing scheme which provides authentication using DE scheme. This scheme was developed for data hiding with grayscale images, but our proposed EBTC uses bitmap images for which the DE scheme is not appropriate. We show the solution for such a problem. Moreover, we reduce the computation complexity for secret sharing using the DE algorithm because past schemes which used polynomial or interpolation algorithms require too much time for secret sharing. In addition, we show how to authenticate a cover image. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme provides secret sharing with proper authentication and acceptable computational complexity.", "paper_title": "A secret sharing scheme for EBTC using steganography", "paper_id": "WOS:000332668100004"}
