In this paper, we have proposed oblivious access control policy evaluation (O-ACE); a data sharing system, which obliviously evaluates access control policy on a cloud server and provisions access to the outsourced data. O-ACE reveals no useful information about the access control policy neither to the cloud service provider nor to the unauthorized users. Through the security analysis of O-ACE it has been observed that computational complexity to compromise privacy of the outsourced data is same as reverting asymmetric encryption without valid key pair. We have realized O-ACE for Google Cloud. Our evaluation results show the fact that O-ACE CPU utilization cost is 0.01-0.30 dollar per 1,000 requests.", "paper_title": "Oblivious access control policies for cloud based data sharing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000310811600001"}
