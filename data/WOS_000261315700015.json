Design/methodology/approach - Different from the ring road systems in the west, Beijing and other big cities in China build ring roads in city center. However, it seems that those systems do not work because the traffic problem still exists when the number of cars in the city increased quickly in past five years. According to the real geographic topology network structure around Er Huan road in Beijing city center, a simplified simulated traffic model was built. Then, two indices of traffic effects, average travel time and path length were studied by comparing the two models with or without ring road. Findings - According to the simulation, although a high-speed ring road shortens the travel time, it isolates the nature road network system and increases travel distance in the city center. Furthermore, it is uneconomic building a ring road to relieve traffic jams. Research dmitations/implications - Only Er Huan road in Beijing traffic system was simulated in the model. A more complicated ring road system needs to be developed. Practical implications - A useful model for optimizing traffic system with ring roads, and providing a support for doubting the strategy of developing ring road in city center district in many cities of China. Originality/value - This is a new way by establishing the simulation model to analyze the scheme of ring road traffic systems. Furthermore, advice for current situation are concluded and it is useful for optimizing current traffic system.", "paper_title": "Studies on traffic effects of high-speed ring road in city center", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700015"}
