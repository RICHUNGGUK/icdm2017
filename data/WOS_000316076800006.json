The key idea is to regard the method at hand as a (Petrov-)Galerkin scheme based on possibly incomplete, broken affine spaces defined from a gradient reconstruction and a point value. The resulting unified framework serves as a basis for the development of a FreeFEM-like domain specific language targeted at defining discrete linear and bilinear forms. Both the back-end and the front-end of the language are extensively discussed, and several examples of applications are provided. The overhead of the language is evaluated with respect to a more traditional implementation. A benchmark including the comparison with more classical finite element methods on standard meshes is also proposed.", "paper_title": "A domain-specific embedded language in C plus plus for lowest-order discretizations of diffusive problems on general meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000316076800006"}
