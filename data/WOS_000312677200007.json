ET systems are progressively introduced in transports systems, and produce a reduction of the associated economic costs and time intervals, and the control of the system is improved. However, the use of ET systems enables various privacy abuses both in real-time and retrospect since the anonymity of users is not always guaranteed and, therefore, users can be traced and their profiles of usual movements can be created. In our review article, we classify and describe the main proposals with special focus on the properties related to user privacy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
