However with increasing Grid size and complexity, the manual diagnosis of application faults becomes impractical, tedious and time-consuming. So far there has been a lack of systematic and comprehensive studies in organization and classification of Grid faults. We address this gap with a multi-perspective Grid fault taxonomy precisely describing an incident using eight different characteristics. Based on that, we develop a pragmatic model-based technique for application-specific fault diagnosis using indicators, symptoms and rules. Customized wrapper services then apply this knowledge to reason about the root causes of failures. In addition to applying user-provided diagnosis models we demonstrate that given a set of past classified fault events it is possible to automatically extract new models through learning. We investigated and compared several supervised classification learning and cluster analysis algorithms for this purpose. Our approach was implemented as part of the Otho Toolkit, a framework for \"service-enabling\" legacy applications by synthesizing tailor-made wrapper service.", "paper_title": "Grid application fault diagnosis using wrapper services and machine learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000258778400003"}
