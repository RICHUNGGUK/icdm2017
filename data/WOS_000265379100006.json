This paper presents two new 4 x 4 bit reversible multiplier designs which have lower hardware complexity, less garbage bits, less quantum cost and less constant inputs than previous ones, and can be generalized to construct efficient reversible n x n bit multipliers. An implementation of reversible HNG is also presented. This implementation shows that the full adder design using HNG is one of the best designs in term of quantum cost. An implementation of MKG is also presented in order to have a fair comparison between our proposed reversible multiplier designs and the existing counterparts. The proposed reversible multipliers are optimized in terms of quantum cost, number of constant inputs, number of garbage outputs and hardware complexity. They can be used to construct more complex systems in nanotechnology.", "paper_title": "OPTIMIZED REVERSIBLE MULTIPLIER CIRCUIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000265379100006"}
