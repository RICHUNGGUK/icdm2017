Relationships between the elements of a generic machine are studied by using parameters describing the performance of the motor, the power demand of the system and the influence of mechanical characteristics on the motor-transmission coupling A knowledge of these reciprocal influences is use critically to analyse the methods used to select motor-reducer units and to identify the boundary conditions of the problem Guidelines for a correct choice of motor and gearbox are suggested: the theoretical discussion is illustrated with graphs that can assess the influence of motor and transmission features on the performance of the machine and suggest to the designer all possible pairings.
