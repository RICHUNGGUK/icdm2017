In this paper, we present two models for optimizing such trajectories. These are the first models to incorporate motion-insensitivity constraints into a nonraster (also called spiral) sampling trajectory. The first model is nonlinear and very specific to Teardrop. The second model uses sequential second-order cone programming, and is generalizable to other trajectories in two and three dimensions. We present a weak convergence proof for the sequential method.", "paper_title": "Optimizing teardrop, an MRI sampling trajectory", "paper_id": "WOS:000257545100008"}
