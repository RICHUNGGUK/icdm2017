Both of them are proved to be indistinguishable against adaptively chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) in the random oracle models. These constructions have the potential to resist Shor's quantum algorithm attack proposed in 1994 and give affirmative answers for the open question announced by Myasnikov, Shpilrain and Ushakov in 2011.
