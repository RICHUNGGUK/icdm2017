Unlike most previous studies that sought only the shortest path, our study proposes a novel trusted route that considers communication reliability and path length for a reliable and feasible packet delivery in a MANET. In most MANET routing schemes, security is an added layer above the routing layer. We introduce the concept of attribute similarity in finding potentially friendly nodes among strangers; so security is inherently integrated into the routing protocol where nodes evaluate trust levels of others based on a set of attributes. Unlike the fixed probability of dropping packets adopted in other routing mechanisms, our new forwarding rule is designed based on the attribute similarity and provides a recommended method in calculating the degree of similarity between attributes. The simulations show that the proposed routing scheme behaves better than the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol in warding off blackhole and changing behavior attacks and that it is unaffected by slander attacks. We also investigate the effects of transmission range, velocity, and number of nodes on routing performances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
