The Lie symmetry analysis leads to many plethora of solutions to the equation. The nonlinear self-adjointness condition for the ZKB equation is established and subsequently used to construct simplified but infinitely many nontrivial and independent conserved vectors. In particular, we also get conservation laws of the equation with the corresponding Lie symmetry. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
