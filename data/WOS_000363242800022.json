It is proved that under some conditions, such n-neuron neural networks can have at least 5(n) equilibrium points, 3(n) of which are locally stable and the others are unstable, based on the contraction mapping theorem and the theory of strict diagonal dominance matrix. The investigation shows that the neural networks with the discontinuous activation functions introduced in this paper can have both more total equilibrium points and more locally stable equilibrium points than the ones with continuous Mexican-hattype activation function or discontinuous two-level activation functions. An illustrative example with computer simulations is presented to verify the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Multistability and Instability of Neural Networks With Discontinuous Nonmonotonic Piecewise Linear Activation Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000363242800022"}
