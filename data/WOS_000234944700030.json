The sum capacity computation relies on a duality between the Gaussian vector broadcast channel and the sum-power constrained Gaussian multiple-access channel. The numerical algorithm is based on a Lagrangian dual decomposition technique and it uses a modified iterative water-filling approach for the Gaussian multiple-access channel. The algorithm converges to the sum capacity globally and efficiently.", "paper_title": "Sum-capacity computation for the Gaussian vector broadcast channel via dual decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000234944700030"}
