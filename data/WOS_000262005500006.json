Design/methodology/approach - The objective is achieved by solving, with a well known commercial simulator, many different configurations of two types of electromagnetic problems: a free-space scattering by a sphere and a waveguide discontinuity problem. Such problems are known to be able to point out the difficulties of numerical simulators. On the other hand, they are representative of two important classes of problems and can provide indications on what can happen in other cases. Findings - This analysis confirms that the numerical errors can be important just in close proximity of the interface between metamaterials and standard media. Small values of loss tangents can be sufficient to obtain very accurate results, Adaptive mesh generators should not be used in the presence of negligible values of the loss tangents. For more uniform meshes the results are satisfactory, with sufficiently fine meshes. When the magnitude of the real parts of the effective dielectric permittivity of a metamaterial and of the adjacent standard media are significantly different, the accuracy is satisfactory in any case. Research limitations/implications - The results are obtained by considering problems of two types. There is no guarantee that all the deductions apply to other models. Practical implications - To design practical devices involving metamaterials reliable electromagnetic simulators are necessary. The reported results seem to indicate that it is possible to adopt some countermeasures against the possible lack of accuracy of finite element simulators in the presence of effective models of metamaterials. Originality/value - For the first time, to the best of authors' knowledge, an extensive analysis on the accuracy of finite element simulators for critical problems involving metamaterials has been carried out. Some simple suggestions to improve their reliability in these cases are provided.", "paper_title": "An assessment by a commercial software of the accuracy of electromagnetic finite element simulators in the presence of metamaterials", "paper_id": "WOS:000262005500006"}
