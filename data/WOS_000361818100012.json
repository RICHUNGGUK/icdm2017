This paper is concerned with the backward perturbation analysis for a given pair of approximate deflating subspaces or an approximate eigenquadruple. Various optimal backward perturbation bounds are obtained, as well as bounds for approximate eigenvalues computed through the pair of approximate deflating subspaces or approximate eigenquadruple. These results are reminiscent of many existing classical ones for the standard eigenvalue problem.", "paper_title": "Backward perturbation analysis and residual-based error bounds for the linear response eigenvalue problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000361818100012"}
