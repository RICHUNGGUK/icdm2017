Characterizations of finite languages and recursively enumerable languages are obtained by asynchronous spiking neural P systems with extended rules. The relationships of the languages generated by asynchronous spiking neural P systems with regular and non-semilinear languages are also investigated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
