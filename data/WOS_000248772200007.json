Underutilization of potential knowledge in the decision-making process of data, information, and knowledge reuse is limited by access to these archives, because of sheer size, decontextualized content, and inconvenient access and presentation. This paper presents an integrated solution called CoMem-iRoom that leverages two technologies Corporate Memory (CoMem) and interactive Room (iRoom) developed at Stanford. CoMem-iRoom addresses critical limitations (content, context, visualization, and interactivity) constraining the process of collaborative exploration toward knowledge reuse and decision making.", "paper_title": "Collaborative design exploration in an interactive workspace", "paper_id": "WOS:000248772200007"}
