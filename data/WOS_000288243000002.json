Guaranteed polygonal output makes it favourable for many applications because of its ease of manipulation and use. The proposed algorithm, called simple-shape, starts reconstruction from the convex hull and makes it concave step by step based on a new hybrid selection criterion which is built on human beings visual perception. Also at the end, a simple-shape algorithm is tested in several cases and the results are compared with the latest shape reconstruction algorithm in the literature.", "paper_title": "Polygonal shape reconstruction in the plane", "paper_id": "WOS:000288243000002"}
