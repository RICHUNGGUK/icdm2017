Security and accuracy are the premise of the localization application. Real-world applications of wireless sensor networks are often subject to a variety of adverse circumstances interference and the localization performance is seriously affected. In this paper, we focus on the problem of node localization with malicious beacon nodes and solve it based on a repeated game method. Trust evaluation method is introduced to distinguish malicious beacon nodes. A repeated game framework is established and the strategies and payoffs are analyzed. Both malicious and normal nodes are driven by profits to a cooperation state and the whole localization performance is improved. Extensive simulation results show normal nodes can obtain higher location precision based on the repeated game. Malicious beacon nodes prefer to take the long-term cooperation attitude. The total losses to the network are less than the total profits caused by malicious nodes with game control.", "paper_title": "Repeated Game Based Localization Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks with Malicious Beacon Nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000352333200002"}
