The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is executed sample-by-sample by a polyphase scheme of the biorthogonal base 5/3. Since the weights of the filters are represented by integer terms and the quantization error is quasi-zero, the principle of Perfect Reconstruction is satisfied. The adaptive threshold is based on a real-time sorting process which calculates the median of the detail coefficients. Simulations are presented to measure the delay, latency, quantization error and hardware cost. A comparison with related works is also provided in order to show the strengths of the current proposal. The good trade-off among reconstruction error, latency, delay and hardware cost permits to use the proposed architecture in a wide variety of signals that require good fidelity and prompt response.
