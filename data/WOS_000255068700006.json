With the help of the Dini-derivative of the expectation of V(t,X(t)) \"along\" the solution X(t) of the model and the technique of Halanay-type inequality, some novel sufficient conditions on pth moment exponential stability of the trivial solution has been established. Results of the development as presented in this paper are more general than those reported in some previously published papers. An example is also given to illustrate that our results are correct and effectiveness. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
