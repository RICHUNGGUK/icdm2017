This paper aims to integrate the conception of the multiple attribute value theory and imperfect maintenance into an improved sequential preventive maintenance (PM) model for the DES subject to degradation. A model-iteration algorithm using a multi-attribute model (MAM) is developed to optimize the maintenance schedule cycle by cycle. The optimal PM interval for each cycle is obtained through MAM, by maximizing the equipment availability and minimizing the maintenance cost simultaneously. A case study is investigated to show that this sequential PM model is much more significant than conventional PM models. Finally, the sensitivity of the proposed method is investigated.
