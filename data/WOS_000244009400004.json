The pitfalls associated with the linearisation of inherently non-linear models are raised and the concept of robustness defined and proposed as a necessary property of scientifically valid models. The existence of chaos in economic time series is discussed and an example, using financial data, presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
