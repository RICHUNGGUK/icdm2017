In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for testing the equivalence of simple functions. Such functions correspond also to one-state deterministic pushdown transducers. Our algorithm works in time polynomial with respect to vertical bar G vertical bar + v(G), where vertical bar G vertical bar is the size of the textual description of G, and v(G) is the maximum of the shortest lengths of words generated by nonterminals of G.
