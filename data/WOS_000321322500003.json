A lot of effort have been made in order to understand this phenomenon, ranging from popular topic detection to information diffusion modeling, including influential spreaders identification. In this article, we present a survey of representative methods dealing with these issues and propose a taxonomy that summarizes the state-of-the-art. The objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis and guide of existing efforts around information diffusion in social networks. This survey is intended to help researchers in quickly understanding existing works and possible improvements to bring.", "paper_title": "Information Diffusion in Online Social Networks: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000321322500003"}
