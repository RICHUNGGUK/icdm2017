To properly represent the RF performance of these devices, the extrinsic structure must also be considered and a variety of sub-circuit configurations, especially for the substrate, have been proposed. As the frequency of operation rises, it may be expected that more elaborate multi-element substrate sub-circuits will become necessary. Here, we consider the RF operation of advanced 0.13 mu m NMOS transistors up to 10 GHz and demonstrate that a simple sub-circuit, using only a single resistor, allows accurate simulation of the two-port parameters, including y(22). We thus demonstrate that the single-resistor substrate sub-circuit approach remains a simple, yet valid, modelling option for MOS simulation up to 10 GHz.", "paper_title": "Validation of the sub-circuit modelling approach for substrate resistance in 0.13 mu m RF MOSFETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000247237800002"}
