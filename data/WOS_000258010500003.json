It is known that the minimal free resolution of semigroup ideals is characterized by the reduced homologies of certain simplicial complexes. In this paper we study the minimal degrees of a Lawrence semigroup ideal and its first syzygy given a combinatorial characterization of the nonvanishing cycles in their associated reduced homologies.
