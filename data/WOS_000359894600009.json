Load balancing is a technique to distribute workload evenly across two or more computers, network links, CPUs, hard drives or other resources, in order to, get optimal resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time and avoid overload. In this paper, we introduce three clustering algorithms that obtain balanced clusters for homogeneous clustered with minimized communication cost.", "paper_title": "Balanced Workload Clusters for Distributed Object Oriented Software", "paper_id": "WOS:000359894600009"}
