We focus on a mathematical structure of the recent major cryptosystems called pairing-based schemes. We present a detection-type watermarking scheme by which a watermark is visible by anyone but unremovable without secret trapdoor. The important feature is that both correctness and security of cryptographic data remain satisfied even if the trapdoor is published.", "paper_title": "Toward Digital Watermarking for Cryptographic Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300031"}
