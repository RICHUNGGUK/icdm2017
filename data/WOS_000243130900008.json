Intuitively, LFS is based on a criterion that allows to guide the search for such local properties by limiting the \"concurrent progress\" of components. In this paper, we elaborate the analysis of the partial orders in question and obtain related but significantly stronger criteria for reductions, show their relation to the previously established criterion, and discuss the algorithmics of the proposed improvement. Our contribution is both fundamental in providing better insights into LFS and practical in providing an improvement of high potential, as is illustrated by experimental results.", "paper_title": "Stronger reduction criteria for local first search", "paper_id": "WOS:000243130900008"}
