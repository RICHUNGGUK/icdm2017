A model to evaluate average power consumption in asynchronous optical switching fabrics is here presented to compare these architectures with other synchronous and asynchronous solutions. The combination of wavelength modular switching fabrics with low spatial complexity and asynchronous operation is demonstrated to be the most power-efficient solution among those considered which employ wavelength converters, through presentation and discussion of a thorough set of numerical results.
