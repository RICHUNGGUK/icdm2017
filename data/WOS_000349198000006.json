For each v E V (G), the indegree of v in D, denoted by di,(v), is the number of arcs with head v in D. An orientation D of G is proper if c1-1)(u) dp-(v), for all uv E E(G). The proper orientation number of a graph G, denoted by (G), is the minimum of the maximum indegree over all its proper orientations. In this paper, we prove that l(G) < (A(G) +,[3)/2 + I if G is a bipartite graph, and l(G) <4 if G is a tree. It is well-known that I (G) < for every graph G. However, we prove that deciding whether -x*(G) < 6.(G) 1 is already an NT-complete problem on graphs with A(G) = k, for every k > 3. We also show that it is NT-complete to decide whether l(G) <2, for planar subcubic graphs G. Moreover, we prove that it is NT-complete to decide whether -5t(G) < 3, for planar bipartite graphs G with maximum degree 5. 0 2014 Elsevier B.V.
