The method allows multidisciplinary designer to synthetically coordinate and optimize parameter considering multidisciplinary knowledge. First, a knowledge network model is established, including design knowledge from assembly, manufacture, performance, and simulation. Second, the parameter coordination method is presented to solve the knowledge network model, monitor the potential conflicts due to engineering changes, and obtain the consistency solution space corresponding to the given knowledge. Finally, the robust parameter optimization model is established, and genetic arithmetic is used to obtain the robust optimization parameter. A design instance is introduced to show the validity of this method.", "paper_title": "Knowledge network driven coordination and robust optimization to support concurrent and collaborative parameter design", "paper_id": "WOS:000247566300005"}
