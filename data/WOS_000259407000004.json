According to this setup, only one of the encoders knows the state of the channel (noncausally), which is also unknown to the receiver. Two independent messages are transmitted: a common message and a message transmitted by the informed encoder. We find explicit characterizations of the capacity region with both noncausal and causal state information. Further, we study the noise-free binary case, and we also apply the general formula to the Gaussian case with noncausal channel state information, under an individual power constraint as well as a sum power constraint. In this case, the capacity region is achievable by a generalized writing-on-dirty-paper scheme.", "paper_title": "Cooperative multiple-access encoding with states available at one transmitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000259407000004"}
