BA is verified using several classical benchmark constraint problems. For further validation, BA is applied to three benchmark constraint engineering problems reported in the specialized literature. The performance of the bat algorithm is compared with various existing algorithms. The optimal solutions obtained by BA are found to be better than the best solutions provided by the existing methods. Finally, the unique search features used in BA are analyzed, and their implications for future research are discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Bat algorithm for constrained optimization tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000318003100022"}
