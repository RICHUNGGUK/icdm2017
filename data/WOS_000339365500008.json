The beamforming weight vectors provided by the antenna array are introduced for the IR users, and the procedures of the multiuser parameter estimation and the interference cancellation are designed. The proposed method can improve the accuracy of the channel estimation of active paths and efficiently reduce the residual multiple access interference. Simulation results show that the proposed method has a much better performance than the available successive multiuser detection and interference cancellation algorithm and accommodates more active ranging users simultaneously accessing into a cell.", "paper_title": "A novel initial ranging algorithm for OFDMA systems using smart antenna", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500008"}
