In the practical networked control systems (NCSs), there are usually unavoidable plant and communication delays. It has been known that time delays may not only deteriorate the system performance, but also destabilize the controlled plant. To alleviate the influence resulting from time delays while maintaining performance, a mixed fuzzy-PID/neural network compensating scheme is applied to the pneumatic system with communication delays. Real-world experiments verify effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
