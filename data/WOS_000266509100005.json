Especially in the installation phase of the wireless telecom services, fraud usage can be an important source of revenue loss. Fraud can be defined as a dishonest or illegal use of services, with the intention to avoid service charges. Fraud detection is the name of the activities to identify unauthorized usage and prevent losses for the mobile network operators'. Mobile phone user's intentions may be predicted by the call detail records (CDRs) by using data mining (DM) techniques. This study compares various data mining techniques to obtain the best practical solution for the telecom fraud detection and offers the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference (ANFIS) method as a means to efficient fraud detection. In the test run, shown that ANFIS has provided sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 99%, where it classified 98.33% of the instances correctly.", "paper_title": "Fraud Detection Using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System in Mobile Telecommunication Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266509100005"}
