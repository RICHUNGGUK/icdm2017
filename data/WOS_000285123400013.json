The first-order shear deformation plate theory is used to define a set of algebraic equations from the equations of motion and boundary conditions. The transient analysis is performed by a Newmark algorithm. In order to assess the quality of the present numerical method, an analytical solution was also developed. Numerical tests on square and rectangular cross-ply laminated plates demonstrate that the present method produces highly accurate displacements and stresses when compared with the available results.
