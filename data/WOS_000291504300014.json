In order to increase the total carried traffic, the proposed approach decreases the blocking probability of new calls by reducing the number of connection reattempts. The proposed queuing policy predicts the time mobile station will spend in the current cell and queues the new calls with high predicted remaining time as they will make more reconnection attempts then calls with low remaining time. We show through simulations that our scheme outperforms the traditionally employed queuing mechanisms in terms of various parameters, i.e., it achieves much lower reattempt and blocking probabilities of new calls without compromising the handoff dropping probability.", "paper_title": "A Prioritized New Call Queuing Policy for Multimedia Wireless Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291504300014"}
