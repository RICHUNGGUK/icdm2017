Nevertheless, Gaussian mixture models are well known to be highly intolerant to the presence of untypical data within the fitting data sets used for their estimation. Finite Student's t-mixture models have recently emerged as a heavier-tailed, robust alternative to Gaussian mixture models, overcoming these hurdles. To exploit these merits of Student's t-mixture models in the context of a sequential data modeling setting, we introduce, in this paper, a novel hidden Markov model where the hidden state distributions are considered to be finite mixtures of multivariate Student's t-densities. We derive an algorithm for the model parameters estimation under a maximum likelihood framework, assuming full, diagonal, and factor-analyzed covariance matrices. The advantages of the proposed model over conventional approaches are experimentally demonstrated through a series of sequential data modeling applications.", "paper_title": "Robust Sequential Data Modeling Using an Outlier Tolerant Hidden Markov Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000267369800009"}
