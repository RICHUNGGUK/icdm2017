During the evolution process, the individuals in this model making up the tribes effect communication cooperatively from one agent to the other in order to increase the homogeneity of the ensemble of the image regions they represent. Two remarkable properties, that is, the monotone contraction and the conservation of the system are proved. Stability and scale control of the proposed method are carefully analyzed. Experimental results are presented and compared with two latest segmentation methods, both quantitatively and visually. We also discuss the results matching with human visual perception.", "paper_title": "Adaptive image segmentation using artificial Co-evolving tribes", "paper_id": "WOS:000251720000005"}
