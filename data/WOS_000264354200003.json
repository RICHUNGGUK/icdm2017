We present the results of project MADAM that has delivered a comprehensive solution for the development and operation of context-aware, self-adaptive applications. The main contributions of MADAM are (a) a sophisticated middleware that supports the dynamic adaptation of component-based applications, and (b) an innovative model-driven development methodology that is based on abstract adaptation models and corresponding model-to-code transformations. MADAM has demonstrated the viability of a general, integrated approach to application-level adaptation. We discuss our experiences with two real-world case studies that were built using the MADAM approach.
