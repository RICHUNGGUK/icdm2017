Every shock can be fatal or not. The shocks follow a Markovian arrival process. When the shock is fatal, the device is instantaneously replaced. The Markov process governing the shocks is constructed, and the stationary probability vector calculated. The probability of the number of replacements during a time is determined. A particular case in which the fatal shock occurs after a fixed number of shocks is introduced, and a numerical application is performed. The expressions are in algorithmic form due to the use of matrix-analytic methods. Computational aspects are introduced. This model extends others previously considered in the literature.
