The explicit equation for the cyclic spectral density in a closed form for AMFM signals is deduced, and its properties in the joint cyclic frequency-frequency domain are summarized. The ratio between the sum of the cyclic spectral density magnitude along the frequency axis at the cyclic frequencies of modulating frequency and 0 Hz varies monotonically with the amplitude modulation magnitude. Hence it is useful to track modulation magnitude. Localized gear damage generates periodic impulses, and its growth increases the magnitude of periodic impulses. Consequently, the amplitude modulation magnitude of gear AMFM vibration signals increases. Hence the ratio can be used as an indicator of the health condition of gearboxes. The analysis of both gear crack simulation vibration signals and gearbox lifetime experiments shows a globally monotonic increase as gear damage severity increases. The proposed approach has the potential to assess the health of gearboxes, and predict severe damage.", "paper_title": "Gear Damage Assessment Based on Cyclic Spectral Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000287861400004"}
