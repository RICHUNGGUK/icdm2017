In the general case this problem was shown to be undecidable by K. Ruohonen (1985). Recently, it was proved that the infinite PCP is undecidable already when the domain alphabet of the morphisms consists of at least 9 letters. Here we show that the problem is undecidable for instances where the morphisms have a domain of 6 letters, when we restrict to solutions of omega-languages of the form R-omega where R is a given regular language.", "paper_title": "Undecidability in omega-regular languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000240746400011"}
