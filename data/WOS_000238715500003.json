To achieve the compensation effect, the fuzzy C-means algorithm is first used to extract features from a backlight image. Then these extracted features are presented to a trained artificial immune system based neuro-fuzzy system (AISNFS) to estimate the amount of compensation. Finally, the estimated amount of compensation incorporated with a compensation equation is used to enhance the intensity component of the backlight image to produce a compensated image. Several backlight images were used to test the performance of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A neuro-fuzzy approach for compensating color backlight images", "paper_id": "WOS:000238715500003"}
