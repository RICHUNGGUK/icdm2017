Unlike the FFBP utilizing two-dimensional image-domain interpolation for sub-aperture fusion, CT-FFBP finishes the image-projection using CT with the accommodation of chirp-s transform and circular shifting. Without interpolation, CT-FFBP yields enhanced efficiency over the interpolation based FFBP, besides maintaining high precision simultaneously. Both simulation and real-data experiments verifies the efficiency and precision superiorities of the CT-FFBP.", "paper_title": "A coordinate-transform based FFBP algorithm for high-resolution spotlight SAR imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000350534000003"}
