As evaluation metrics, we used throughput, one-way delay, jitter, fairness index and residual energy. The simulation results show that for WMN-HC, the throughput of 24 mesh routers is good for both WMN architectures. But, for WMN-SA, the throughput is almost the same. For WMN-HC, the delay and jitter of 24 mesh routers is low for both WMN architectures. However, for WMN-SA, the delay and jitter of 32 mesh routers is higher for I/B WMN architecture. For WMN-HC, the fairness index of 16 mesh routers is high for Hybrid WMN architecture. But, for WMN-SA, the fairness index of 32 mesh routers is high for I/B WMN architecture. For 16 and 32 mesh routers, the remaining energy of WMN-HC is higher than WMN-SA.", "paper_title": "A web interface for wireless mesh networks based on heuristic algorithms: optimisation and analysis for different scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000358995400005"}
