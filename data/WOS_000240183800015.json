The approximation functions are calculated considering a moving least squares (MLS) approach which is consistent provided the basis is complete in the polynomials up to a desired order. An alternative integration method avoiding the consideration of background cells is considered. Shear locking in plate bending is avoided considering the appropriate polynomials for the displacements and rotations, continuity being insured. Obtained results show the adequacy of the method for the analysis of plates and laminates. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
