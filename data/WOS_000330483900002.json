SemWeB supports Web browsing using Linked Open Data and personalization. This is the first time a Semantic Web browser combines the advances in Adaptive Hypermedia (i.e. personalization) and Linked Open Data. In particular, users are provided with a personalized and semantically rich Web browsing experience. For example, SemWeB supplies goal-based adaptive information retrieval from the LOD, adaptive link recommendation using a novel semantic relatedness measure and adaptive content creation. A user based study was used to assess the value of LOD-based hyperlinks and personally relevant content compared with a standard Web browser (Firefox). Results showed that users were able to browse and view more relevant information, as well as, value significance of LOD-based hyperlinks and personalized content in comparison to a standard Web browser.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Linking and Personalization on the Web using Linked Open Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000330483900002"}
