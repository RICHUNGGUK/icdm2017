Firstly the motions involved in stir-fry, the most representative operation in the cooking processes used in Chinese cuisine, are analyzed in details. Then the featured motions are decomposed into four main movements that are used as a design base for a wok motion mechanism. Several three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) parallel manipulators are considered. From these, a 2T1R mechanism is selected as an ideal candidate. A 4-DOF (2T1R+1T) cooking robot is constructed by combining the 2T1R parallel manipulator with a 1-DOF linear feed mechanism. It is shown that the combined 4-DOF robot can perform the required cooking operations, particularly the stir-fry. The analysis conducted on the proposed 2T1R parallel manipulator includes inverse kinematics, forward kinematics, the velocity analysis, the constant orientation workspace, and the total orientation workspace. A prototype of the cooking robot is developed. The experiments verify that the proposed cooking robot is suitable for performing the required operations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
