The type of protocol used to interconnect embedded nodes has a decisive impact on whether the system can operate in a deterministic way. File chunk streaming policy plays a major role for the quality of the end-to-end service provision, where, along with the diffusion process, they both aim to provide availability of the resources on-demand. Considering that reliability and availability are affected by the temporal characteristics, this work proposes an embedded framework using a k-hop collaborative outsourcing scheme for enabling and preserving the reliability in any requested path and for any requested resources. The proposed replication scheme takes into account the pre-determined vehicular mobility-as real-time users-in a k-hop path. The outsourcing strategy uses a sequential scheme for caching requested high-ranked resources onto neighboring nodes. The scheme takes into consideration the community-oriented triggered feedback for cluster formation and topology updates, the different file chunks' capacities, the relay epoch and mobility considerations of each node in the k-hop path for evaluating the device's outsourcing schedules in order to enable end- to-end reliable streaming. Simulation experiments show that the proposed model, through the efficiency of the proposed collaborative streaming policy, can provide scalability and increases the successful delivery rate while it improves significantly the throughput response of the system.", "paper_title": "Embedded Socio-oriented Model for End-to-End Reliable Stream Schedules by Using Collaborative Outsourcing in MP2P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000293634800001"}
