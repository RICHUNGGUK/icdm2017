Considering antimorphisms circle minus is an element of D-m, we show that t(b,m) is saturated by circle minus-palindromes up to the highest possible level. Using the generalisation of palindromic richness recently introduced by the author and E. Pelantova, we show that t(b,m) is D-m-rich. We also calculate the factor complexity of t(b,m).", "paper_title": "GENERALIZED THUE-MORSE WORDS AND PALINDROMIC RICHNESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307856900002"}
