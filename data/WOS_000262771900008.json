The proposed switch architecture employs fixed-input/tunable-output wavelength converters (expected to be less complex than tunable-input/tunable-output ones). The space switching matrix is modular and simple with respect to switching architectures with different wavelength converters sharing schemes (i.e. shared-per-node architecture). A parallel scheduling algorithm is defined to control optical packet forwarding in a synchronous scenario as well as an analytical model to evaluate packet loss performance. The analytical model is validated against simulation and previous analysis and the results obtained show good accuracy in most cases of interest for optical switch design. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
