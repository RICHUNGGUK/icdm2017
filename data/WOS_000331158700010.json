These requirements and assumptions limit their applicability especially in the case of mobile networks where the degree of association and de-association between the nodes is relatively high. In this work, we present a novel lightweight countermeasure for the wormhole attack, called LDAC (Localized-Decentralized Algorithm for Countering wormholes). It is completely localized and works by looking for simple evidence that no attack is taking place, using only connectivity information, as implied by the underlying communication graph. LDAC is not confined to static networks but extends naturally to dynamic and even mobile ones. Rigorous arguments that prove the correctness of the algorithm are coupled with detailed performance evaluation along with an implementation on real sensor devices that demonstrates its efficiency in terms of memory requirements and processing overhead.
