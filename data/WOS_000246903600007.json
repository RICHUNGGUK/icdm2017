Using a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing some free weighting matrices, less conservative delay-dependent robust stability conditions for such systems in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived. Numerical examples are given to indicate significant improvements over some existing results.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent criteria for robust stability of linear neutral systems with time-varying delay and nonlinear perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000246903600007"}
