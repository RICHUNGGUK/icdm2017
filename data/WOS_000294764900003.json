It is thus interesting to consider conditions that would allow such systems to reach computational completeness. In this paper we consider insertion-deletion P systems with insertion and deletion operations applied only at the ends of string (we call them exo-operations). We show that such systems with one-symbol insertion and deletion of up to two symbols are computationally complete, and so are systems with insertion of up to two symbols and one-symbol deletion. The question about the computational power of insertion-deletion P systems with one-symbol insertion and one-symbol deletion operations applied at the ends of string is open. However, the tissue P systems reach computationally completeness even in this case.", "paper_title": "P Systems with Insertion and Deletion Exo-Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000294764900003"}
