In light of institutional approaches and specifically based on the normative dimension, the main findings of the study indicate that participative leadership and higher education represent the strongest explanatory factor in the variance of the current rates of innovative entrepreneurship. This study has contributions for both researchers and policymakers on new firm creation (entrepreneurship) and on the generation of innovation within organizations (intrapreneurship).", "paper_title": "Leadership Styles and Innovative Entrepreneurship: An International Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000352350900008"}
