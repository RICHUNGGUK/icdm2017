It improves in most of the cases the results offered by classical prototype selection algorithms but its computational cost is expensive. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of the evolutionary prototype selection strategy, considering a complexity measure for classification problems based on overlapping. In addition, we have analyzed different k values for the nearest neighbour classifier in this domain of study to see its influence on the results of PS methods. The objective consists of predicting when the evolutionary prototype selection is effective for a particular problem, based on this overlapping measure.", "paper_title": "DIAGNOSE EFFECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY PROTOTYPE SELECTION USING AN OVERLAPPING MEASURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000273425500001"}
