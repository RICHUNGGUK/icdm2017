These grammars are proved to be computationally equivalent to an extension of one-way real-time cellular automata with an extra data channel. The main result is the undecidability of the emptiness problem for grammars restricted to a one-symbol alphabet, which is proved by simulating a Turing machine by a cellular automaton with feedback. The same construction proves the Sigma(0)(2)-completeness of the finiteness problem for these grammars and automata.", "paper_title": "LINEAR GRAMMARS WITH ONE-SIDED CONTEXTS AND THEIR AUTOMATON REPRESENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000357697100004"}
