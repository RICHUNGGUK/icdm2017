We investigate a few subcases where the theory of rational relations can be employed to solve the problem. The case of unary languages is one of them and as a consequence, we show how to decide for two given finite subsets of nonnegative integers, whether they are the nth root of a common set, for some na parts per thousand yen1. We also show that it is decidable whether a finite collection of finite languages is a Parikh code, in the sense that whenever two products of these sets are commutatively equivalent, so are the sequences defining these products. Finally, we consider a nonunary special case where all finite sets consist of words containing exactly one occurrence of the specific letter.", "paper_title": "Unique Decipherability in the Monoid of Languages: An Application of Rational Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000291159100009"}
