RPAC allows users using some data for a certain purpose with Conditions (For instance, Tony agrees that his income information can be used for marketing purposes by removing his name). The structure of RPAC model is investigated after defining access purposes, intended purposes and conditional purposes. An algorithm is developed with role-based access control (RBAC) to achieve the compliance computation between access purposes (related to data access) and intended purposes (related to data objects). Access purpose authorization and authentication in the RPAC model are studied with the hierarchical purpose structure. According to the model, more information from data providers can be extracted while at the same time assuring privacy that maximizes the usability of consumers' data. It extends role-based access control models to a further coverage of privacy preservation in database management systems by adopting purposes and conditional intended purposes and to achieve a fine-grained access control. The work in this paper helps enterprises to circulate a clear privacy promise, and to collect and manage user preferences and consent.", "paper_title": "A role-involved purpose-based access control model", "paper_id": "WOS:000305746400022"}
