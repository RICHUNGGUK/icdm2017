It is assumed that the channel-state information (CSI) is perfectly known at the receiver and is fed back to the transmitter at the regular time intervals. The system capacity is investigated in two cases: 1) finite-state Markov channel, and 2) additive white Gaussian noise channel with time-correlated fading. In the first case, it is shown that the capacity is achievable by multiplexing multiple codebooks across the channel. In the second case, the channel capacity and the optimal adaptive coding is obtained. It is shown that the optimal adaptation can be achieved by a single Gaussian codebook, while adaptively allocating the total power based on the side information at the transmitter.", "paper_title": "On the capacity of time-varying channels with periodic feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235400023"}
