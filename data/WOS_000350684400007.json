For the Parameterized P-2-Packing problem, based on the structure analysis of the problem and using random partition technique, a randomized parameterized algorithm of running time O*(6.75(k)) is obtained, improving the current best result O*(8(k)). For the Parameterized Co-Path Packing problem, we firstly study the kernel and randomized algorithm for the degree-bounded instance, where each vertex in the instance has degree at most three. A kernel of size 20k and a randomized algorithm of running time O*(2(k)) are given for the Parameterized Co-Path Packing problem with bounded degree constraint. By applying iterative compression technique and based on the randomized algorithm for degree bounded problem, a randomized algorithm of running time O*(3(k)) is given for the Parameterized Co-Path Packing problem.", "paper_title": "Randomized parameterized algorithms for P-2-Packing and Co-Path Packing problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000350684400007"}
