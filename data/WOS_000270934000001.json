It is necessary to resolve the services conflict and to satisfy a user who wants to use multiple services. To extract the simultaneous activity patterns, context has been collected from physical sensors and electronic devices. In addition, a context model is organized by the proposed incremental statistical method to determine conflicts and to infer user intentions through analyzing the daily human activity patterns. The context model is represented by the sets of the simultaneous activity patterns and the temporal relations between the sets. To evaluate the method, experiments are carried out on a test-bed called the Ubiquitous Smart Space. Furthermore, the user-intention simulator based on the simultaneous activity patterns and the temporal relations from the results of the inferred intention is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "An Incremental Statistical Method for Daily Activity Pattern Extraction and User Intention Inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000270934000001"}
