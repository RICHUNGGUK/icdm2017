However, many of these applications require effective runtime load balancing for the resulting solutions to be viable. In this paper we present a novel latency-tolerant partitioner, called MinEX, that dynamically balances processor workloads while minimizing data movement and runtime communication for applications that are executed in a parallel distributed grid environment. We also compare the performance of MinEX with that of METIS, a popular multilevel family of partitioners, using simulated heterogeneous grid configurations. A solver for the classical N-body problem is implemented to provide a framework for the comparisons. Experimental results show that the proposed MinEX partitioner provides superior quality partitions while being competitive to METIS in terms of execution speed.", "paper_title": "Design and performance of a heterogeneous grid partitioner", "paper_id": "WOS:000238153600011"}
