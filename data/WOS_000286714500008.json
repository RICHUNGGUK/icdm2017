The system environment, the performance metrics, and the protocol rules of various types of XML protocols are all considered by the model. To facilitate the implementation of XSM, the state diagrams, the sequence diagrams, the component diagram, and the class diagram of XSM are depicted using UML 2.0 notations. We also show a simulation platform constructed from XSM to fairly and comprehensively evaluate the performance of various XML protocols. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
