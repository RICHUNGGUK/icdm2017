Storage technologies take a critical position for WSNs in such scenarios since the sensor nodes may themselves fail unpredictably, resulting in the loss of valuable data. This paper focuses on fountain code-based data storage and recovery solutions for WSNs in disaster scenarios. A review on current technologies is given on challenges posed by disaster environments. Two information fusion-based distributed storage (IFDS) algorithms are proposed in the \"few global knowledge\" and \"zero-configuration\" paradigm, respectively. Correspondingly, a high-efficient retrieve algorithm is designed for general storage algorithms using Robust Soliton distribution. We observe that the successful decoding probability can be provisioned by properly selecting parameters-the ratio of number of source node and total nodes, and the storage capacity M in each node.", "paper_title": "Information Fusion-Based Storage and Retrieve Algorithms for WSNs in Disaster Scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000298688400001"}
