This work is a lead off and complete synergy of layered video multicasting with opportunistic concept. The target application is characterized by groups of users acquiring popular video programs over a fading channel. To accommodate various bandwidth requirements and device capability, video streams are coded into base and enhancement layers using scalable video coding technology. Correspondingly, the optimization problems, which select the best subset of users to receive a specific video layer and assign the most appropriate modulation and coding scheme for this video layer, are specifically formulated for both video layer types. We also design fast and effective algorithms to bridge the gap between theoretical throughput capacity and implementation concerns. Thus, the basic video quality can be efficiently guaranteed to all subscribers while creating most utility out of limited resources on enhancement information. To overcome the inevitable packet loss in a multicast session, an FEC rate adaptation scheme to approach theoretical performance is also presented. Favorable performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by simulations utilizing realistic Mobile WiMAX parameters.", "paper_title": "OLM: Opportunistic Layered Multicasting for Scalable IPTV over Mobile WiMAX", "paper_id": "WOS:000299294400009"}
