The NMM approach is conceived to obtain a trade off between high and low-level design notations. As high-level design notations, NMM models permit architectural details that may hinder the overall understanding of the web application to be left out. As low-level design notations, NMM models can easily be transformed into detailed architectural designs, which are very valuable at coding and maintenance stages. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
