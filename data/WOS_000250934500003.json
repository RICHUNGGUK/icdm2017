The structure's geometry is observed in a banana peel that contains a specific graded structure in a confined space. The structure is responsible for protecting the internal soft core at low impact velocities. Deformation modes, plateau stress, stroke, cell shape and impact energy absorption capabilities are studied on different models and the theoretical expressions are presented to predict the behavior of the structure at low velocities. This structure proves its worthiness over a regular honeycomb structure over a higher range of impact velocity under the same space/stroke constraints. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
