We propose a distributed scheme called BRIDGE that relocates mobile sensors to fulfill an emergent data acquisition task with the objective to minimize the task completion time. BRIDGE gradually finds a sensor that is close to the task location and relocates that sensor to the task location, and at the same time relocates some other sensors to connect that sensor to the base station. BRIDGE exploits the encountered sensors during relocation, and handles the challenges caused by intermittent connections. Our extensive performance study shows the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Sensor relocation for emergent data acquisition in sparse mobile sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280003600002"}
