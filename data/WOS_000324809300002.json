In this proposed model, a discrete element method is introduced to transform the eccentric loading into axial loading. The validity of the model is verified by comparing the predicting results with the published creep experiments results on CFT specimens under compressive loading, together with the predicting values based on other concrete creep models, such as ACI209, CEB90, GL2000 and elastic continuation and plastic flow theory. By using the proposed model, a parameters study is carried out to analysis the effects of practical design parameters, such as concrete mix (e.g. water to cement ratio, aggregate to cement ratio), steel ratio and eccentricity ratio, on the creep of CFT columns under eccentric compressive loading.", "paper_title": "Creep analysis of CFT columns subjected to eccentric compression loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000324809300002"}
