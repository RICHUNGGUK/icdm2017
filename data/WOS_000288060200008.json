It used to be the case that a single user would edit a local knowledge base, that the user would have domain expertise to add to the system, and that the system would have a centralized knowledge base and reasoner. The world surrounding knowledge-rich systems changed drastically with the advent of the Web, and many of the original assumptions were no longer a given. Those assumptions had to be revisited and addressed in combination with new challenges that were put forward. Knowledge-rich systems today are distributed, have many users with different degrees of expertise, and integrate many shared knowledge sources of varying quality. Recent work in interactive knowledge capture includes new and exciting research on collaborative knowledge sharing, collecting knowledge from Web volunteers, and capturing knowledge provenance.", "paper_title": "Interactive knowledge capture in the new millennium: how the Semantic Web changed everything", "paper_id": "WOS:000288060200008"}
