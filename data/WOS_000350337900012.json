Biometrika. 1997;84(3):641-652] approach. The proposed distribution is a compound of the Lomax and Logarithmic distributions (LLD). We provide a comprehensive study of the mathematical properties of the LLD. In particular, the density function, the shape of the hazard rate function, a general expansion for moments, the density of the rth order statistics, and the mean and median deviations of the LLD are derived and studied in detail. The maximum likelihood estimators of the three unknown parameters of LLD are obtained. The asymptotic confidence intervals for the parameters are also obtained based on asymptotic variance-covariance matrix. Finally, a real data set is analysed to show the potential of the new proposed distribution.", "paper_title": "Statistical analysis of the Lomax-Logarithmic distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000350337900012"}
