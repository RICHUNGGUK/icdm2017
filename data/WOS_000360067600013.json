The analysis accounts for the use of two variants of the Time-to-Live (TTL) weak consistency mechanism. The first is the typical TTL scheme (TTL-T) used in the HTTP/1.1 protocol where expired objects are refreshed using conditional GET requests. The second is TTL immediate ejection (TTL-IE) where objects are ejected as soon as they expire. The analysis also accounts for two sharing protocols: Leave Copy Everywhere (LCE) and Promote Cached Objects (PCO). PCO is a new sharing protocol introduced in this paper that decreases the user's perceived latency and is robust under nonstationary access patterns.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Cache Performance Analysis Under TTL-Based Consistency", "paper_id": "WOS:000360067600013"}
