The bottom wall of the enclosure is heated and concentrated uniformly (case-I) and non-uniformly (case-II) while the top wall is cooled and moved uniformly with a constant velocity. Both side walls are adiabatic and impermeable. The coupled governing equations for this phenomenon is solved numerically using weighted residual based Galerkin technique of finite element method (FEM) for Richardson's number (Ri = 0.1-100) and Buoyancy ratio (Br = -10 to 10) at time tau = 1.0. Reynolds number, Prandtl number and Lewis number are fixed at 100, 0.71 and 10 respectively. Streamlines, isotherm lines and iso-concentration lines are used to show the result graphically for velocity, temperature and mass distribution respectively. Nusselt and Sherwood number values are presented graphically to show the heat and mass transfer rate from the bottom surface of the cavity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
