The advantages of a passive star architecture associated with wavelength multiplexing have already been reported. For lower-cost issues, multimode fiber would be preferred, but some problems were raised related to poor uniformity of the N x N multimode coupler when using the usual coarse wavelength division multiplexing sources. An original time-effective method is proposed, based on both simulation and calculation. Many results are provided, giving a better understanding of the behavior of the N x N coupler when different types of sources are used, also taking into account improvement techniques such as offset launching or mode scrambling.", "paper_title": "N x N Coupler Uniformity in a CWDM Passive Star Home Network Based on Multimode Fiber: A Time-Effective Calculation Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000309190100007"}
