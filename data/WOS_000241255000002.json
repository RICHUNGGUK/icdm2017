The proposed methodology is totally independent of the structure of the feedback controller, of the way it is designed, and of the characteristics of the set point signal. By using a nonparametric model of the control loop, that can be easily identified on-line, various tracking problems can be cast into a unified, and easily interpreted optimisation framework. Simulated and physical examples demonstrate the simplicity and efficacy of the proposal. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
