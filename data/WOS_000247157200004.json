In this paper, we develop a latent semantic indexing classifier that combines link analysis with text content in order to retrieve and index domain-specific web documents. Our implementation presents a different approach to focused crawling and aims to overcome the limitations imposed by the need to provide initial data for training, while maintaining a high recall/precision ratio. We compare its efficiency with other well-known web information retrieval techniques. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
