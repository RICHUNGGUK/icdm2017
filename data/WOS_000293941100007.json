The calculations are carried out for the whole range of the gas rarefaction from the free-molecular regime to the hydrodynamic one. Numerical data on the flow rate and distributions of density, bulk velocity and temperature along the symmetry axis are reported. A comparison with the corresponding results obtained previously by the direct simulation Monte Carlo method is performed. A good agreement between these results shows a reliability of the model equations which require less computational effort than the Monte Carlo method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
