The goal of this paper is to achieve transparency in presence of uncertainties. The master-slave systems are approximated by linear dynamic models with perturbed parameters, which is called the model mismatch. Moreover, the time delay in communication channel with uncertainties is considered. The stability analysis will be considered for two cases: (1) stability under time delay uncertainties and (2) stability under model mismatches. For the first case, two local controllers are designed. The first controller is responsible for tracking the master commands, while the second controller is in charge of force tracking as well as guaranteeing stability of the overall closed-loop system. In the second case, an additional term will be added to the control law to provide robustness to the closed-loop system. Moreover, in this case, the local slave controller guarantees the position tracking and the local master controller guarantees stability of the inner closed-loop system. The advantages of the proposed method are two folds: (1) robust stability of the system against model mismatches is guaranteed and (2) structured system uncertainties are well compensated by applying independent controllers to the master and the slave sites. Simulation results show good performance of the proposed method in motion tracking as well force tracking in presence of model mismatches and time delay uncertainties.", "paper_title": "Force reflecting bilateral control of master-slave systems in teleoperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255629200003"}
