Cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained, segmented and transformed into 25 frames of LV for a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study. Multi-block structure meshes were generated for 25 frames and 75 intermediate grids. The complete LV cycle was modelled by using ANSYS-CFX 12. The flow patterns and pressure drops in the LV chamber of this study provided some useful information on intra-LV flow patterns with heart diseases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
