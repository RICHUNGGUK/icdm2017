This study, anchored in activity theory, examines key drivers of VE and its influences on value perceptions and customer loyalty. A hierarchical model indicates that VE comprises second-order variables (i.e., social presence, social capital, flow experience, and situational involvement) and third-order variables (i.e., communal and individual experience). The results obtained from a substantive model further reveal that VE positively influences perceptions of both economic and social value and thus influences loyalty in both the real world and virtual environments.", "paper_title": "A Hierarchical Model of Virtual Experience and Its Influences on the Perceived Value and Loyalty of Customers", "paper_id": "WOS:000350147800006"}
