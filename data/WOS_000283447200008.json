The goal of the survey is to identify distinct security requirements-related to availability, integrity, confidentiality and privacy, and access leakage-of these systems. Existing role-based security models and their limitations to express security policies in distributed CSCW and workflow systems are presented. Last, we present an overview of a framework that we have developed to specify, verify, and enforce security policies in distributed CSCW systems.", "paper_title": "Security Policies in Distributed CSCW and Workflow Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283447200008"}
