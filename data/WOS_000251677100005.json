Components and security specifications about confidentiality as regular languages are modelled. Then a systematic way is provided to synthesise an access control mechanism, which not only guarantees all specifications to be obeyed, but also allows each user to attain maximum permissive behaviours.", "paper_title": "Language-based access control approach for component-based software applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000251677100005"}
