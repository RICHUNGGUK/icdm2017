However, they can be computationally quite expensive because of their iterative nature in which (a) each single iteration may be costly, and (b) the number of iterations can be large. In this paper we propose algorithmic strategies for improving the efficiency of such methods. Our strategies are aimed at simultaneously reducing the cost of each iteration and reducing the number of required iterations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
