This paper considers the mapping phase with the goal of reducing the number of quantum gates required. A novel method for rearranging gates is presented that is shown to be more effective than the conventional moving rule. Results are presented for the quantum library: NOT, controlled-NOT, and the square-root-of-NOT gates (V and V+). The approach is applicable to other quantum gate libraries.", "paper_title": "Mapping a Multiple-control Toffoli Gate Cascade to an Elementary Quantum Gate Circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000294316100007"}
