The challenges of multimedia wireless transmission include high bandwidth requirements, delay intolerance and wireless channel availability. A new Channel Time Allocation Particle Swarm Optimization (CTA-PSO) is proposed to solve the network utility maximization (NUM) resource allocation problem. CTA-PSO optimizes the time allocated to each device in the network in order to maximize the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by each user. CTA-PSO introduces network-linked swarm size, an increased diversity function and a learning method based on the personal best, Pbest, results of the swarm. These additional developments to the PSO produce improved convergence speed with respect to Adaptive PSO while maintaining the QoS improvement of the NUM. Specifically, CTA-PSO supports applications described by both convex and non-convex utility functions. The multimedia resource allocation solution presented in this article provides a practical solution for real-time wireless networks.", "paper_title": "Channel Time Allocation PSO for Gigabit Multimedia Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333111500021"}
