One integral part is the domain decomposition approach adopted, which ensures no small inter-domain angles; therefore, the parallel meshing procedure can fix the inter-domain boundary without compromising mesh quality. Combining the parallel surface mesher with the parallel tetrahedral mesher and improver developed previously, a parallel preprocessing pipeline for large-scale simulations is set up. It only consumes minutes to prepare a mesh containing hundreds of millions of elements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
