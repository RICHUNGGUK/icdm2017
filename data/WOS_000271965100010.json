Concept of the motor is based on a self-moving cell, which consists of an elastic shell structure and a piezoelectric stack actuator. Three cells are connected in series and by activating piezoelectric actuators in these cells, macro movement can be achieved. Since these cells are fit into a guideway with interference, this motor can possess a high stall force and fail-safe lock. When one piezoelectric actuator is activated by open loop control with hysteresis compensation, micro movement can be obtained. Design of self-moving cell structure, fabrication, and control of the motor for macro and micro movements are explained. The maximum moving velocity of 1.05 mm/s and the maximum force of 4.3 N were observed. The possibility of nano scale movement was demonstrated by taking into account the hysteresis compensation of the piezoelectric actuator.
