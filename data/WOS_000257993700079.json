The method is based on a perturbation technique. Voltage and phase angle of a bus is perturbed around their current values and the effect of perturbation is judged on a local network formed around the node concerned. Perturbations generating improved solutions are accepted. The method is slow but robust and is applicable in those cases when the conventional approaches fail. It can be used in finding the loadability limit, generating P-V/Q-V curves and also in finding multiple power flow solutions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
