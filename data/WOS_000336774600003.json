These mechanisms proactively avoid system congestion by: (i) reducing the amount of signaling messages exchanged when triggering low mobility MTC devices and (ii) reducing the signaling message content for a group of MTC devices sharing redundant Information Element (IE) by creating a profile ID for this group. In addition, along with the second solution, we propose a dynamic grouping solution, which groups MTC device with common subscription features in orders to control the MTC signaling traffics when the network is overloaded. Numerical results show the efficiency of using the proposed solutions compared to only grouping the MTC devices, and using a bulk signaling mechanism. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
