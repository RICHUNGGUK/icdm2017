By exploiting the paradigm of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), it is possible to automatically transform design models into analytical models, thus enabling formal property verification. MDE is the core paradigm of the KlaperSuite framework presented in this paper, which exploits the KLAPER pivot language to fill the gap between design and analysis of component-based systems for reliability properties. KlaperSuite is a family of tools empowering designers with the ability to capture and analyze quality of service views of their systems, by building a one-click bridge towards a number of established verification instruments. In this article, we concentrate on the reliability-prediction capabilities of KlaperSuite and we evaluate them with respect to several case studies from literature and industry.", "paper_title": "The KlaperSuite framework for model-driven reliability analysis of component-based systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342493300005"}
