The aim is establish both confidence in the algorithm and its suitability for the intended purpose. In this paper, a direct simulation Monte Carlo solver, called dsmcFoam, is carefully investigated for its ability to solve low and high speed non-reacting gas flows in simple and complex geometries. The test cases are: flow over sharp and truncated flat plates, the Mars Pathfinder probe, a micro-channel with heated internal steps, and a simple micro-channel. For all the cases investigated, dsmcFoam demonstrates very good agreement with experimental and numerical data available in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
