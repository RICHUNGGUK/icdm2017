In particular, we show how the best segmentation, as well as posterior segment class probabilities in individual sequence positions can be computed in O(nC) time in case of C segment classes and a sequence of length n.", "paper_title": "Segmentation with an isochore distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125600036"}
