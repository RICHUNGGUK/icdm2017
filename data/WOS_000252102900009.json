We show that this problem is intractable if f belongs to standard Sobolev spaces, even if we have complete information about q. However, if f and q belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with finite-order weights, we can show that the problem is tractable, and can actually be strongly tractable. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
