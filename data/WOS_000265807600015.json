Two objectives are considered in the model to minimize the total weighted flow time and the total weighted tardiness simultaneously. Due to the complexity of the above model and uncertainty involved in real-world scheduling problems, it is sometimes unrealistic or even impossible to acquire exact input data. Hence, we consider the parallel-machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent set-up times under the hypothesis of fuzzy processing time's knowledge and two fuzzy objectives as the MIGP model. In addition, a quite effective and applicable methodology for solving the above fuzzy model are presented. At the end, the effectiveness of the proposed model and the denoted methodology is demonstrated through some test problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
