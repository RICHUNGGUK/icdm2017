Our system, named ASSIST and developed as an EU research project, assists in cervical cancer research by unifying multiple patient record repositories, physically located in different medical centers or hospitals. Semantic modeling of medical data and rules for inferring domain-specific information allow the system to (i) homogenize the information contained in the isolated repositories by translating it into the terms of a unified semantic representation, (ii) extract diagnostic information not explicitly stored in the individual repositories, and (iii) automate the process of evaluating medical hypotheses by performing case-control association studies, which is the ultimate goal of the system.
