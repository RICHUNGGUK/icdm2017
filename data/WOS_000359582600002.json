We show how FL-VC achieves an effective balance between implementation feasibility and performance of the applications using the network. Focusing on metropolitan area networks and real-world file distributions, we also show that an adequate selection of packet duration leads to nearly optimal application throughput with respect to conventional variable-length, fixed-bit-rate packets (VL-FBR), and that this optimal packet duration is robust against changes in the workload. Finally, we show that a single fiber delay line per OPS switch managed by a first-fit scheduler can increase throughput to levels similar to those obtained by random access buffers.", "paper_title": "Performance of Fixed-Length, Variable-Capacity Packets in Optical Packet-Switching Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359582600002"}
