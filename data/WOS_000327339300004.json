A quantity arising in the analysis of phylogenetic trees is also proved to have a similar asymptotic expansion. Our method of proof is new in the literature of discrete probability and the analysis of algorithms, and it is based on the logarithmic psi-series expansions for nonlinear differential equations. Such an approach is very general and applicable to many other problems involving nonlinear differential equations; many examples are discussed in this article and several attractive phenomena are discovered.Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
