However, the theoretical comparison of the performance of their methods has not been conducted yet. In this paper, we propose a hue-preserving saturation maximization method, and show a relationship of the saturation of enhanced colors by related methods. We also demonstrate the correctness of the relationship experimentally.", "paper_title": "On Hue-Preserving Saturation Enhancement in Color Image Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464800020"}
