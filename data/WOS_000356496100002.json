In this paper, we utilize tensors (namely, a higher order generalization of matrices) to develop a tensor-based nonlinear model order reduction algorithm we named TNMOR for the efficient simulation of nonlinear circuits. Unlike existing nonlinear model order reduction methods, in TNMOR high-order nonlinearities are captured using tensors, followed by decomposition and reduction to a compact tensor-based reduced-order model. Therefore, TNMOR completely avoids the dense reduced-order system matrices, which in turn allows faster simulation and a smaller memory requirement if relatively low-rank approximations of these tensors exist. Numerical experiments on transient and periodic steady-state analyses confirm the superior accuracy and efficiency of TNMOR, particularly in highly nonlinear scenarios.", "paper_title": "Model Reduction and Simulation of Nonlinear Circuits via Tensor Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000356496100002"}
