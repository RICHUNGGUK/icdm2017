To fully exploit these techniques, a cross-platform and open-source software stack based on standardized data exchange formats is required. Results: We present TAPIR, a fast and efficient Python visualization software for chromatograms and peaks identified in targeted proteomics experiments. The input formats are open, community-driven standardized data formats (mzML for raw data storage and TraML encoding the hierarchical relationships between transitions, peptides and proteins). TAPIR is scalable to proteome-wide targeted proteomics studies (as enabled by SWATH-MS), allowing researchers to visualize high-throughput datasets. The framework integrates well with existing automated analysis pipelines and can be extended beyond targeted proteomics to other types of analyses.", "paper_title": "Efficient visualization of high-throughput targeted proteomics experiments: TAPIR", "paper_id": "WOS:000358173500033"}
