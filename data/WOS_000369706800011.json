The browser facilitates a new alternative website distribution paradigm to the traditional HTTP-based, client-server model. This decentralised web is powered by each of the visitors accessing each Maelstrom hosted website. Each user shares their copy of the website;s source code and multimedia content with new visitors. As a result, a Maelstrom hosted website cannot be taken offline by law enforcement or any other parties. Due to this open distribution model, a number of interesting censorship, security and privacy considerations are raised. This paper explores the application, its protocol, sharing Maelstrom content and its new visitor powered \"web-hosting\" paradigm.", "paper_title": "PROJECT MAELSTROM: FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF THE BITTORRENT-POWERED BROWSER", "paper_id": "WOS:000369706800011"}
