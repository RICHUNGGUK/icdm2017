Specifically, the analytical BER is derived for both cases based on a general framework, that is by exploiting the statistics of the equalized noise. In comparison with the exiting alternatives, the proposed BER analysis has only half of the computational complexity for the OFDMA system and is more general for the SC-FDMA case.", "paper_title": "A General Framework for BER Analysis of OFDMA and Zero-Forcing Interleaved SC-FDMA over Nakagami-m Fading Channels with Arbitrary m", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696800008"}
