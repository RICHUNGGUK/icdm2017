Instead of using boundaries of time delays to represent all time delays, the occurrence probability of each time delay is considered in H-infinity stability analysis and stabilisation. The problem addressed is the design of an output feedback controller such that, for all admissible uncertainties, the resulting closed-loop system is stochastically stable for the zero disturbance input and also simultaneously achieves a prescribed H-infinity performance level. It is shown that less conservativeness is obtained. A set of linear matrix inequalities is given to solve the corresponding controller design problem. An example is provided to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust output feedback H-infinity control for networked control systems based on the occurrence probabilities of time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000296975800006"}
