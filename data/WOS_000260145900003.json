The method employs the signal strength as input, and has two steps: an initial estimation of the position of the nodes is obtained centrally by one robot and is based on particle filtering. It does not require any prior information about the position of the nodes. In the second stage, the nodes refine their position estimates employing a decentralized information filter. The paper shows how the method is able to recover the 3D position of the nodes, and is very suitable for WSN outdoor applications. The paper includes several implementation aspects and experimental results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
