The research is inspired by how humans learn-first by observation of a teacher's performance and then by practicing the performance themselves. The objectives of this approach are to produce a high-performing agent that 1) approaches or exceeds the proficiency of a human and 2) does so in a human-like manner. We accomplish these objectives by combining observational learning with experiential learning. These processes are executed sequentially, with the former creating a competent but somewhat limited human-like model from scratch, and the latter improving its performance without significantly eroding its human-like qualities. The process is described in detail, and test results confirming our hypothesis are described.", "paper_title": "Building High-Performing Human-Like Tactical Agents Through Observation and Experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000290734400016"}
