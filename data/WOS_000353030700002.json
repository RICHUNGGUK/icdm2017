It is shown in this study that the existing near-wall modeling for the immersed boundary (IB) methods that imposes the velocity boundary condition at the IB node is not sufficient to enforce a correct wall shear stress at the IB node. A new method that imposes a shear stress condition through the modification of the subgrid scale-eddy viscosity at the IB node is proposed. In this method, the subgrid eddy viscosity at the IB node is modified such that the viscous flux at the face adjacent to the IB node correctly approximates the total shear stress. The method is applied to simulate the fully developed turbulent flows in a plane channel and a circular pipe. It is demonstrated that the new method improves the prediction of the mean velocity and turbulence stresses in comparison with the existing wall modeling based solely on the velocity boundary condition.
