This paper proposes a two-phase learning method for FANNs, which reduces the generated error based on genetic algorithms (GAs). The optimization process is held on the alpha cuts of each fuzzy weight. Global optimized values of the alpha cuts at zero and one levels are obtained in the first phase and optimal values of several other alpha cuts are obtained in the second phase. Proposed method is shown to be superior in terms of generated error and executed time when compared with basic GA-based algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
