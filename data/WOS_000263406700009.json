This technical paper proposes and formally defines a set of conditions for generating a minimum valid subset of an EXPRESS schema corresponding to a concept, where a concept is a general idea and a subset is a partial model of a data schema. We introduce a notion of \"minimal set\" to define the relationships between a subset and other subsets, and also between a subset and concepts. A minimal set is the smallest complete subset of a schema that corresponds to a concept. Using IFC, an international standard data model for the architecture, engineering, and construction industry, the proposed conditions have been implemented in a software application developed for extracting subsets from the IFC schema matching the concepts. A number of examples are demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Concept-Based Method for Extracting Valid Subsets from an EXPRESS Schema", "paper_id": "WOS:000263406700009"}
