Existence logic is a conservative extension of intuitionistic logic by an existence predicate. Therefore, eskolemization provides a skolemization method for intuitionistic logic as well. All proofs in Baaz and Iemhoff (2006, Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, 142, 269-295) were semantical. In this article, a proof-theoretic proof of the completeness of eskolemization with respect to existential quantifiers is presented.", "paper_title": "Eskolemization in Intuitionistic Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000293303900005"}
