That is to say, there is an algorithmic implementation of the method that does not distinguish, or make choices, between variables or constraints in the program unless they are distinguished by properties definable from the program. In particular, we demonstrate that the solvability of linear programs can be expressed in fixed-point logic with counting (FPC) as long as the program is given by a separation oracle that is itself definable in FPC. We use this to show that the size of a maximum matching in a graph is definable in FPC. This settles an open problem first posed by Blass, Gurevich and Shelah [Blass et al. 1999]. On the way to defining a suitable separation oracle for the maximum matching program, we provide FPC formulas defining canonical maximum flows and minimum cuts in undirected capacitated graphs.", "paper_title": "Solving Linear Programs without Breaking Abstractions", "paper_id": "WOS:000366430000005"}
