We focus on two settings, where (1) the input array is available at query time, and (2) the input array is available only at construction time. In setting (1), we show new data structures (a) of size 2n/c(n) - Theta(n lg lg n/c(n) lg n) bits and query time O(c(n)) for any positive integer function c(n) is an element of O(n(epsilon)) for an arbitrary constant 0 < epsilon < 1, or (b) with O(nH(k)) + o(n) bits and O(1) query time, where H-k denotes the empirical entropy of kth order of the input array. In setting (2), we give a data structure of size 2n + o(n) bits and query time O(1). All data structures can be constructed in linear time and almost in-place.", "paper_title": "SPACE-EFFICIENT PREPROCESSING SCHEMES FOR RANGE MINIMUM QUERIES ON STATIC ARRAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289974100009"}
