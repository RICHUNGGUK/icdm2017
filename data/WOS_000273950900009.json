Genetic engineering technology was the field examined in this study. From the references listed in the patents, it was observed that the technology development in genetic engineering was influenced heavily by the research done by public sector. Over 90% of the citations were non-patent literatures, and the majority of non-patent citations were journal articles. Citing preferences, such as country preference and institute preference were observed from the data included in this study.", "paper_title": "Scientific linkage of science research and technology development: a case of genetic engineering research", "paper_id": "WOS:000273950900009"}
