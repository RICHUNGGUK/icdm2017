A fast and efficient SBD algorithm is necessary for real-time video processing applications. Extensive work has focused on accurate shot boundary detection at the expense of demanding computational costs. In this paper, we propose a fast SBD approach that reduces the computation pixel-wise and frame-wise while still giving satisfactory accuracy. The proposed approach substantially speeds up the computation through reducing both detection region and scope. Color histogram and mutual information are used together to measure the difference between frames. Corner distribution of frames is utilized to exclude most of false boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed approach, and the results show that our approach can not only speed up SBD, but also detect shot boundaries with high accuracy in both Cut (CUT) and Gradual Transition (GT) boundaries.", "paper_title": "To accelerate shot boundary detection by reducing detection region and scope", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387000035"}
