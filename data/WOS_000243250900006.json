The WMPCA methodology, proposed by us earlier, is based on the assumption that the rates of variation of the different regions of a face are different due to variations in expression and illumination. Given a database of sample faces for training and a query face for recognizing, the WMPCA methodology involves division of the face into horizontal regions. Each of these regions are analyzed independently by computing the eigenfeatures and comparing the same with the corresponding eigenfeatures of the faces stored in the sample database to calculate the corresponding error. The final decision of the face recognizer is based on the weighted sum of the errors computed from each of the regions. These weights are calculated based on the extent to which the various samples of the subject are spread in the eigenspace. The WMPCA methodology has a better recognition rate compared to the modular PCA approach developed by Rajkiran and Vijayan [Rajkiran, G., Vijayan, K., 2004. An improved face recognition technique based on modular PCA approach. Pattern Recognition Letters, 25(4), 429-436]. The methodology also has a wide scope for parallelism. We present an architecture that exploits this parallelism and implement the same as a system-on-programmable-chip on an ALTERA based field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. The implementation has achieved a processing speed of about 26 frames per second at an operating frequency of 33.33 MHz. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
