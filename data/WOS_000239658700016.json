In general, the AN.P2P allows the peer to send the content's original object with the associated content adaptation workflow to other peers. The recipient peer can reuse the original object to generate different content presentations. In order to achieve reasonable performance, this paper proposes several object placement schemes and caching strategies. Our simulation results show that these methods could effectively improve the system performance in terms of query hops, computation cost and retrieval latency.", "paper_title": "Object placement and caching strategies on AN.P2P", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700016"}
