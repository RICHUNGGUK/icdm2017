To date, H withstands any attempt to prove its termination automatically. This motivates our interest in term rewrite systems encoding the Hydra battle, as a careful study of such systems may prove useful in the design of automatic termination tools. Moreover it has been an open problem, whether any termination order compatible with H has to have the Howard-Bachmann ordinal as its order type, i.e., the proof theoretic ordinal of the theory of one inductive definition. We answer this question in the negative, by providing a reduction order compatible with H, whose order type is at most epsilon(0), the proof theoretic ordinal of Peano arithmetic.", "paper_title": "The Hydra battle and Cichon's principle", "paper_id": "WOS:000266643400002"}
