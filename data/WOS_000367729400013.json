Existing communication technologies are quite limited in satisfying the challenging demands of HSR networks, providing poor quality of experience for HSR passengers (e.g., frequent link failures and long network delays). 5G mobile communications are expected to overcome these challenging issues in current HSR networks. In this article, we focus on the great innovations of a novel smart network architecture for 5G communications, and propose a specific SCN-R to promote efficient and reliable communications in HSR scenarios. Experiment results have verified that SCN-R provides an efficient solution to improve the usage of network resources and the quality of service with respect to the existing state-of-the-art solutions.", "paper_title": "PROMOTING EFFICIENT COMMUNICATIONS FOR HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY USING SMART COLLABORATIVE NETWORKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000367729400013"}
