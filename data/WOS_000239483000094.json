This paper proposes a no-reference perceptual quality-assessment method based on a general regression neural network (GRNN). The three visual features of artifacts introduced in JPEG images are formulated block by block individually so that our method is computation-efficient and memory-efficient. The GRNN is used to realize the mapping of these visual features into a quality score in real time because of its excellent approximation and very short training time (one-pass learning). Experimental results on an on-line database show that our estimated scores have an excellent correlation with subjective MOS scores.", "paper_title": "No-reference perceptual quality assessment of JPEG images using general regression neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000094"}
