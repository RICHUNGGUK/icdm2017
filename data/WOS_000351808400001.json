Adults described arrays of objects, half the time with a screen occluding their interlocutor and half the time with the interlocutor visible. When participants could not see their listener, they used more words, particularly concrete words and tended to gesture more. This difference was moderated by extroversion for gestures (i.e., extroverts gestured more when their interlocutor was occluded) but not for speech. We argue that visibility of a listener may influence how speakers use nonverbal feedback from their interlocutors differentially according to extroversion. In particular, visibility and personality may impact how speakers use gestures when they do not know whether their interlocutor has understood them. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
