Since obfuscation may find wide use in computer security, information hiding and cryptography, security requirements to program obfuscators have become a major focus of interest in the theory of software obfuscation starting from the pioneering works in this field. In this paper we give a survey of various definitions of obfuscation security and basic results that establish possibility or impossibility of secure program obfuscation under certain cryptographic assumptions.", "paper_title": "The current state of art in program obfuscations: definitions of obfuscation security", "paper_id": "WOS:000364955300006"}
