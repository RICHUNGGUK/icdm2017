In this paper, biomechanical behaviors of curved artery with flexible wall subjected to physiological flow were presented. Fluid-structure interaction effect was considered. The Von Mises stress variation and distribution patterns, the influence of artery curvature and flexibility on peak wall Von Mises stress, diameter change and cross sectional shape variation of the curved artery in the cardiac cycle were studied in detail. We believe that the findings may provide important implications for individualized treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
