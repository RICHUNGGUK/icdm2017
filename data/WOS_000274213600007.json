The influence of various energy components on the formation of Si center dot center dot center dot N-beta-donor bond is explored. The importance of the electron delocalization from the lone pair of nitrogen atom into the acceptor-orbitals connected with Si atom is elicited by our calculations. The electron delocalization from the lone pair of nitrogen atom into the antibonding orbital of Si-X bond is quite different among the isoelectronic molecules with various types of SiXN units.", "paper_title": "Combined DFT and NBO study on the electronic basis of Si center dot center dot center dot N-beta-donor bond", "paper_id": "WOS:000274213600007"}
