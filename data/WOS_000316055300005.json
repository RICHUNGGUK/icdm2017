Although an MCMC algorithm can be very useful, it also requires care in use and interpretation of results. In particular, MCMC algorithms generally make extensive use of priors on model parameters. In this paper, MCMC estimation is illustrated using a simple mixture IRT model, a mixture Rasch model (MRM), to demonstrate how the algorithm operates and how results may be affected by some commonly used priors. Priors on the probabilities of mixtures, label switching, model selection, metric anchoring, and implementation of the MCMC algorithm using WinBUGS are described, and their effects illustrated on parameter recovery in practical testing situations. In addition, an example is presented in which an MRM is fitted to a set of educational test data using the MCMC algorithm and a comparison is illustrated with results from three existing maximum likelihood estimation methods.", "paper_title": "Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation of a mixture item response theory model", "paper_id": "WOS:000316055300005"}
