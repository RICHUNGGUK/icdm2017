Only recently. methods have been discovered for the systematic generation and evaluation of all possible complex column configurations for the separation of multicomponent mixtures. However, there is a lack of robust methods for the globally optimal design of complex column sequences. This presentation reviews recent advances to tackle the challenges of synthesizing complex column networks with computer-aided design algorithms. An automatic procedure to generate optimal column sequences based on a thermodynamic problem transformation called temperature collocation is discussed and its current capabilities and limitations illustrations with the help of two realistic case studies.
