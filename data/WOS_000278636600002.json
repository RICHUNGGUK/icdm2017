The category PStone of pairwise Stone spaces is isomorphic to the category Spec of spectral spaces and to the category Pries of Priestley spaces. In fact, the isomorphism of Spec and Pries is most naturally seen through PStone by first establishing that Pries is isomorphic to PStone, and then showing that PStone is isomorphic to Spec. We provide the bitopological and spectral descriptions of many algebraic concepts important in the study of distributive lattices. We also give new bitopological and spectral dualities for Heyting algebras, thereby providing two new alternatives to Esakia's duality.", "paper_title": "Bitopological duality for distributive lattices and Heyting algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000278636600002"}
