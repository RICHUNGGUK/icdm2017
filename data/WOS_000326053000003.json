FieldML version 0.5 is the most recently released format from the FieldML project. It is an XML format that already has sufficient capability to represent the majority of euHeart's explicit models such as the anatomical FEM models and simulation solution fields. The details of FieldML version 0.5 are presented, as well as its limitations and some discussion of the progress being made to address these limitations.", "paper_title": "FieldML, a proposed open standard for the Physiome project for mathematical model representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000326053000003"}
