We propose a new ingredient, namely, working on the group of translations and discrete rotations SE(2,N). The theoretical side of our study relates the stochastic nature of the problem with the Moore group structure of SE(2,N). Harmonic analysis over this group leads to very simple finite dimensional reductions. We then apply these ideas to the inpainting problem which is reduced to the integration of a completely parallelizable finite set of Mathieu-type diffusions (indexed by the dual of SE(2,N) in place of the points of the Fourier plane, which is a drastic reduction). The integration of the the Mathieu equations can be performed by standard numerical methods for elliptic diffusions and leads to a very simple and efficient class of inpainting algorithms. We illustrate the performances of the method on a series of deeply corrupted images.", "paper_title": "Hypoelliptic Diffusion and Human Vision: A Semidiscrete New Twist", "paper_id": "WOS:000338782900004"}
