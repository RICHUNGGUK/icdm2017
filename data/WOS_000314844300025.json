Based on the concept named multistage organizations, the main objective of which is to define a multi-layer fusion function adapted to each recognition problem, we propose dynamic multistage organization (DMO), which defines the best multistage structure for each test sample. By extending Dos Santos et al.'s approach, we propose two implementations for DMO, namely DSA (m) and DSA (c) . While the former considers a set of dynamic selection functions to generalize a DMO structure, the latter considers contextual information, represented by the output profiles computed from the validation dataset, to conduct this task. The experimental evaluation, considering both small and large datasets, demonstrated that DSA (c) dominated DSA (m) on most problems, showing that the use of contextual information can reach better performance than other existing methods. In addition, the performance of DSA (c) can also be enhanced in incremental learning. However, the most important observation, supported by additional experiments, is that dynamic selection is generally preferred over static approaches when the recognition problem presents a high level of uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Dynamic selection approaches for multiple classifier systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300025"}
