The approach was applied to fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), a key deactivating enzyme in the endocannabinoid system. The resultant dynamic pharmacophore models are rapidly able to identify known FAAH inhibitors over drug-like decoys. Different sources of FAAH conformational ensembles were explored, with both snapshots from molecular dynamics simulations and a group of X-ray structures performing well. Results were compared to those from docking and pharmacophore models generated from a single X-ray structure. Increasing conformational sampling consistently improved the pharmacophore models, emphasizing the importance of incorporating target flexibility in structure-based drug design.", "paper_title": "Approximating Protein Flexibility through Dynamic Pharmacophore Models: Application to Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH)", "paper_id": "WOS:000298315900022"}
