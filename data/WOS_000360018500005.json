A general grey number is a real number that may be a member of a discrete set of real numbers, or may fall within one or several intervals. It can represent uncertain preference of decision makers in a meaningful way. Here, a grey-based preference structure is developed and integrated with GMCR. Utilizing a number of grey-based ideas, solution concepts describing human behavior under conflict in the face of uncertain preference are defined for a conflict model. This grey-based GMCR is then applied to a generic sustainable development conflict with uncertain preferences in order to demonstrate how it can be conveniently utilized in practice.", "paper_title": "Grey-Based Preference in a Graph Model for Conflict Resolution With Multiple Decision Makers", "paper_id": "WOS:000360018500005"}
