Recent NIST speaker recognition evaluations (SRE) include a multilingual scenario with training conversations involving multilingual speakers collected in a number of other languages, leading to further performance decline. One important reason for this is that more and more researchers are using phonetic clustering to introduce high level information to improve speaker recognition. But such language dependent methods do not work well in multilingual conditions. In this paper, we study both language and channel mismatch using a support vector machine (SVM) speaker recognition system. Maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) transforms adapting a universal background model (UBM) are adopted as features. We first introduce a novel language independent statistical binary-decision tree to reduce multi-language effects, and compare this data-driven approach with a traditional knowledge based one. We also construct a framework for channel compensation using feature-domain latent factor analysis (LFA) and MLLR supervector kernel-based nuisance attribute projection (NAP) in the model-domain. Results on the NIST SRE 2006 1conv4w-1conv4w/mic corpus show significant improvement. We also compare our compensated MLLR-SVM system with state-of-the-art cepstral Gaussian mixture and SVM systems, and combine them for a further improvement.", "paper_title": "Research on Intersession Variability Compensation for MLLR-SVM Speaker Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648400019"}
