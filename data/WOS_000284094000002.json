The collaboration is achieved in a distributed manner, and is designed based on peer-to-peer computing model. The objective is to provide (1) a decentralized solution, and (2) a near optimal performance with reasonably low overhead. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme. In addition, the results show that SPACE evenly distributes work loads among participators, and entirely eliminates any requirement of a central cache manager.", "paper_title": "SPACE: A lightweight collaborative caching for clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000284094000002"}
