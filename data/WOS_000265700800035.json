Lighting is crucial to our perception of shape. Careful use of lighting has been widely used in art. scientific illustration, and computer graphics to guide visual attention. In this paper, we explore how the saliency of 3D objects can be used to guide lighting to emphasize important regions and suppress less important ones.", "paper_title": "Saliency-Guided Lighting", "paper_id": "WOS:000265700800035"}
