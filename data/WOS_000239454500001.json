Whereas the project originally started out with the idea to develop a logic-based extraction language and a tool to visually define extraction programs from sample Web pages, the scope of the project has been extended over time. Today, new issues such as employing learning algorithms for the definition of extraction programs, automatically extracting data from Web pages featuring a table-centric visual appearance, and extracting from alternative document formats such as PDF are being investigated.", "paper_title": "The Lixto project: Exploring new frontiers of web data extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454500001"}
