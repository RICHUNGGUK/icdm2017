The artistic filter works as a two-dimensional (2-D) rendering technique a for non-photorealistic effect based on the algorithm introduced in [8]. We modified this method to properly work with a 3-D image, enhancing the efficiency of the filter as well. The required 3-D structure model is obtained from actual brushstroke samples provided by an artist. We employ a photometric stereo technique in constructing a 3-D model for a brushstroke sample, since this method is capable of capturing sophisticated variation details in brushstroke textures. A 3-D oil painting is completed by incorporating the 3-D model to the brushstrokes rendered by the artistic filter. The created image would show a natural illumination change as the position of the light source varies, providing a realistic effect to the image. We can further enhance the study by analyzing a real painting and by directly applying the current algorithm to synthesize a 3-D oil painting in the style of the original real painting.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional oil painting reconstruction with stroke based rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000249207600027"}
