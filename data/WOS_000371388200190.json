In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of QLDPC codes from the perspective of code design as well as in terms of their decoding algorithms. We also conceive a modified non-binary decoding algorithm for homogeneous Calderbank Shor Steane-type QLDPC codes, which is capable of alleviating the problems imposed by the unavoidable length-four cycles. Our modified decoder outperforms the stateof-the-art decoders in terms of their word error rate performance, despite imposing a reduced decoding complexity. Finally, we intricately amalgamate our modified decoder with the classic uniformly reweighted belief propagation for the sake of achieving an improved performance.", "paper_title": "Fifteen Years of Quantum LDPC Coding and Improved Decoding Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200190"}
