Based on the experimental results, several limitations of this scheme, such as the multicast latency and signal impairment, are discussed. In addition, its performance in OPS networks is investigated by computer simulations. From the simulation results, a conclusion can be drawn that compared with the parallel-mode multicasting scheme (PM) producing multiple simultaneous copies of the optical packets by an optical power splitter or other devices, the SM scheme can increase the multicast success ratio and reduce the multicast retransmission times at the costs of some signal impairments and some extra transmission latency.", "paper_title": "Performance analyses of serial-mode multicasting scheme in optical packet switched networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000265924000002"}
