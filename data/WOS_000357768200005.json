With features extracted from a driving posture dataset, holdout and cross-validation experiments on driving posture classification are then conducted using k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifier compared with a number of commonly used classification methods including Intersection Kernel Support Vector Machine (IKSVM), Multilayer Perception (MLP) classifier, and Parzen classifier. The holdout and cross-validation experiments show that the kNN classifier offers the best classification performance than the other three classifiers. Among the four predefined classes, the class of eating a cake is the most difficult to classify. With kNN classifier, the classification accuracies of eating a cake are over 88% in holdout and cross-validation experiments, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method and the importance of kNN classifier in automatically understanding and characterizing the driver behaviours.", "paper_title": "Recognition of driving postures by nonsubsampled contourlet transform and k-nearest neighbor classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000357768200005"}
