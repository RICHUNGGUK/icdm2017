Little attention has been paid to the relationship between commitments and the temporal dimension and to the corresponding run-time verification. Building on previous work, we present a declarative axiomatization of time-aware social commitments, extending their basic life cycle with time-related transitions and compensation mechanisms. The formalization is based on a reactive version of the event calculus, able to monitor the commitment's evolution during a system's execution, to check whether the interacting agents are honoring them or not. The resulting monitoring framework can be used in the context of agent-based simulation, either to dynamically evaluate whether a running simulation is compliant with a commitment-based contract or to provide useful information to the interacting agents, helping them to behave in a compliant manner.", "paper_title": "Monitoring Time-Aware Commitments Within Agent-Based Simulation Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000295620500005"}
