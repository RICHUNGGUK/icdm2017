The present study adopts ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to develop a novel ACO-SVM model to solve this problem. The proposed algorithm is applied on some real world benchmark datasets to validate the feasibility and efficiency, which shows that the new ACO-SVM model can yield promising results.
