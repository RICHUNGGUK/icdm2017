Simulation and measurements results, with a 130 nm CMOS technology, show that the gain is enhanced by about 3 dB and the NF is reduced by at least 0.5 dB, with a negligible impact on the circuit linearity (IIP3 is about 0 dBm). The total power dissipation is only 4.8 mW, and the active area is less than 50 x 50 mu m(2)", "paper_title": "A low power balun LNA with active loads for gain and noise figure optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000345842200015"}
