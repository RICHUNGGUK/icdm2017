This paper presents Frame-Based Proportional Round-Robin (FBPRR), a real-time fair scheduler providing high and bounded proportional fairness accuracy and O(1) scheduling overhead with the ability to efficiently handle a set of dynamic tasks. FBPRR achieves this by applying the benefits of Virtual-Time Round-Robin (VTRR) scheduling mechanism within a frame-based scheduling approach. Simulation results show that the algorithm gains a speedup of 5 to 20 times ( over O(lg n) complexity schedulers) with fairly high fairness.", "paper_title": "Frame-Based Proportional Round-Robin", "paper_id": "WOS:000239159700007"}
