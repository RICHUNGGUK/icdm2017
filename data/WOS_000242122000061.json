In order to obtain the factors that cause a single fault to change to multi-faults, the standard rough set based methods should be rebuilt. In this paper, we propose a decernibilty matrix based algorithm with which the cause of every single fault to change to multi-faults can be revealed. Additionally, we propose another rough set based algorithm to induce the common causes of all the single faults to change to their corresponding multi-faults, which is a process of knowledge discovery in rule base, i.e., not the usual database. Inducing more abstract rules in knowledge base is a very challenging problem that has not been resolved well.", "paper_title": "Using rough set to induce more abstract rules from rule base", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000061"}
