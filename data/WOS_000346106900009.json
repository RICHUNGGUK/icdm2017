Then we show that ABC(G) = Sigma(i similar to j) root di + dj - 2/d(i)d(j) <= Sigma(i similar to j) root R-ij, where R-ij is the effective resistance between i and j. This general bound allows us to obtain many other particular bounds and asymptotic maximal results for the ABC index with elementary proofs.", "paper_title": "A Resistive Upper Bound for the ABC Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000346106900009"}
