In the recent years several researchers proposed sufficient conditions for its nondegeneracy, e.g. Arutyanov and Assev (1997), Rampazzo and Vinter (1999, 2000), Galbraith and Vinter (2003). In all these papers the most important assumption links dynamics of a control system with tangent cones to constraints. It is the so called inward pointing condition of control theory that is in the same spirit with the well known Slater and Managasarian-Fromowitz conditions of mathematical programming. We propose here two sufficient conditions for normality when the boundary of constraints is C(1) and the end point is free. The first one applies to every nondegenerate maximum principle without any assumptions on the initial state. The second one applies to every maximum principle, but involves an additional assumption on the initial conditions.", "paper_title": "Normality of the maximum principle for absolutely continuous solutions to Bolza problems under state constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000278080400003"}
