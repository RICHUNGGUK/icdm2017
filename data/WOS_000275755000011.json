In this paper, an evolving category of auto-associative neural network is presented which is applied to perform dynamic nonlinear principal component analysis. Training strategy of the network implements both constructive and destructive algorithms to extract dynamic principal components of speech database. In addition, the proposed network makes it possible to eliminate some dimensions of sequences that do not play important role in the quality of speech processing. Finally, the network is successfully applied to solve missing data problem.", "paper_title": "An evolving neural network to perform dynamic principal component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000275755000011"}
