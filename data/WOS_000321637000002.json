While our focus is on voxel-based data sets from real porous media imaging, our methodology is verified first on synthetic geometries, and we analyze various scaling and convergence properties. We show that the choice of a voxel-based grid and representative elementary volume size can lead up to 10-20 % difference in calculated conductivities. On the other hand, the conductivities decrease significantly with flow rates, starting in a regime usually associated with the onset of inertia effects. This is accompanied by deteriorating porescale solver performance, and we continue our experiments up until about 50 % reduction in conductivities, i.e., to Reynolds number just under 1. To account for this decrease, we propose a practical power-based fully anisotropic non-Darcy model at corescale for which we calculate the parameters by upscaling.", "paper_title": "Pore-to-core simulations of flow with large velocities using continuum models and imaging data", "paper_id": "WOS:000321637000002"}
