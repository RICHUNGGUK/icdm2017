An attractive feature in these methods are the application of the Jacobian matrix based on the P-1 element approximation, resulting in a huge reduction of memory requirement compared with DG (P-2). Also, three approaches - analytical derivation, divided differencing, and automatic differentiation (AD) are presented to construct the Jacobian matrix respectively, where the AD approach shows the best robustness. A variety of compressible flow problems are computed to demonstrate the fast convergence property of the implemented flow solver. Furthermore, an SPMD (single program, multiple data) programming paradigm based on MPI is proposed to achieve parallelism. The numerical results on complex geometries indicate that this low-storage implicit method can provide a viable and attractive DG solution for complicated flows of practical importance.
