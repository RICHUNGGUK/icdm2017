The SCSDL uses the charge recycling technique to reduce power dissipation of differential logic in the precharge phase. The simulation results show that the SCSDL has the best power-delay product compared to several other differential logic families. An eight-bit carry lookahead adder (CLA) designed using the proposed SCSDL can reduce at least 30.64% of power-delay product compared to DCVSL CLA dissipation. A test chip was fabricated to illustrate the feasibility of the SCSDL circuit.", "paper_title": "Low-power eight-bit SCSDL CLA with a novel split-level charge-sharing differential logic (SCSDL)", "paper_id": "WOS:000251176000005"}
