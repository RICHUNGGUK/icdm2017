We have the following results. First, the volatility of the stock market decreases with the index future market and cross-market arbitrageurs. Second, different investment strategies have different effects on stock market volatility. In many cases, both market-imitating and stop-loss strategies can increase stock market volatility. Third, the mechanism of price limits for the index futures market can help to stabilize the fluctuation of the stock market.", "paper_title": "CROSS-MARKET FINANCIAL RISK ANALYSIS: AN AGENT-BASED COMPUTATIONAL FINANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000290857200009"}
