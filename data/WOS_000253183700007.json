The paper deals with an essential activity enabling seamless enterprises integration, that is, a similarity-based schema matching. To this end, we present a supervised approach to measure semantic similarity between XML schema documents, and, more importantly, address a novel approach to augment reliably labeled training data from a given few labeled samples in a semi-supervised manner. Experimental results reveal the proposed method is very cost-efficient and reliably predicts semantic similarity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
