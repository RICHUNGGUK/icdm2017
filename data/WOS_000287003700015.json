However, building a simulation model of a manufacturing system is time-consuming and error-prone because of the complexity of the systems. This paper introduces a generic simulation modeling framework to reduce the simulation model build time. The framework consists of layout modeling software and a data-driven generic simulation model. The generic simulation model was developed considering the processing as well as the logistics aspects of assembly manufacturing systems. The framework can be used to quickly develop an integrated simulation model of the production schedule, operation processes and logistics of a system. The framework was validated by developing simulation models of cellular and conveyor manufacturing systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
