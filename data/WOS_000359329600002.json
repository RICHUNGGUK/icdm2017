The construction conforms to given refinement requirements associated to subdomains. In contrast to the original LR-paper (Dokken et al., 2013) and similarly to the hierarchical B-spline framework (Forsey and Bartels, 1988) the construction of the mesh is based on a priori choice of a sequence of nested tensor B-spline spaces.
