To provide appropriate gate voltages for output stage transistors, a dynamic gate bias generator without gate-oxide overstress effect is implemented. The proposed I/O also takes advantage of a novel gate-tracking circuit and a PAD voltage detector by means of eliminating the leakage current such that the compatibility among all subcircuits is ensured. Our design is proved on silicon using 0.18 mu m CMOS process that when VDDIO is 5.0/3.3/1.8/1.2/0.9 V, the maximum data rate is found to be 80/80/125/100/80 MHz, respectively, with a given capacitive load of 10 pF.", "paper_title": "A Wide Voltage Range Digital I/O Design Using Novel Floating N-Well Circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000293712100015"}
