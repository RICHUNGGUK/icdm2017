An automatic Web based Global Carpooling Matching Service (GCPMS) for matching commuting trips has been designed. The service supports carpooling candidates by supplying advice during their exploration for potential partners. Such services collect data about the candidates, and base their advice for each pair of trips to be combined, on an estimate of the probability for successful negotiation between the candidates to carpool. The probability values are calculated by a learning mechanism using, on one hand, the registered person and trip characteristics, and on the other hand, the negotiation feedback. The problem of maximizing the expected value of carpooling negotiation success was formulated and was proved to be NP-hard. In addition, the network characteristics for a realistic case have been analyzed. The carpooling network was established using results predicted by the operational FEATHERS activity based model for Flanders (Belgium). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
