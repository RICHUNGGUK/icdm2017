One of the major reasons for this untapped potential is that companies often lack an adequate understanding of how consumers use the Web to support their multifaceted shopping activities. In particular, consumers may perceive some characteristics of the technology as beneficial and others as only marginally useful because they engage in a variety of online shopping activities. We develop three constructs that make up a user's perceived characteristics of the Web (PCW) as they relate to the consumer's perceptions of the value of online shopping: perceived employability, relative advantage, and riskiness. These perceptions may differ depending on the type of product or service for which the consumer is interested, as well as the specific tasks in which the consumer is engaged. We conducted a large-scale Web survey that included the three PCW constructs associated with Web technology, three product/service categories, and three types of shopping behaviors. The results indicate that Internet users' perceived characteristics of the Web, as compared with other shopping channels, significantly influences all three levels of channel adoption behavior studied. Further, these channel adoption behaviors differ across product and service types. The implications for online storefront designers and net-enabled commerce researchers are discussed.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Product Type and Perceived Characteristics of the Web on Multifaceted Online Shopping Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000264374800001"}
