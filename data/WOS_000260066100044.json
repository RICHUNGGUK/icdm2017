Traditional CFA designs correlation filters by using two-dimensional (2D) Fourier transforms of the images. In this paper, we propose a tensor correlation filter based CFA (TCF-CFA) method to generalize traditional CFA by encoding the image data as tensors. Experimental results on four benchmark face databases show the effectiveness and robustness of TCF-CFA for face recognition. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
