The novel feature of the proposed method is that a low-bitrate encoder, G.726 ADPCM, is used as a reference for deciding how many bits can be embedded in a sample. Experiments showed that the method outperformed the simple LSB substitution method and the selective embedding method proposed by Aoki. We achieved 4-kbit/s embedding with almost no subjective degradation of speech quality, and 10 kbit/s while maintaining good quality.", "paper_title": "Information Hiding for G.711 Speech Based on Substitution of Least Significant Bits and Estimation of Tolerable Distortion", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342900001"}
