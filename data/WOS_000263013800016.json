The IEEE 802.21 standard defines three types of MIH services (event, command, and information) that facilitate the mobility management and handover process in heterogeneous networks. To support MIH services, we develop a MIH-capable mobile node and the MIH information service server. Then. we introduce the Connection Manager (CM) which utilizes MIH services. Two main roles of CM are supporting seamless vertical handovers and efficient access point (AP) discoveries. From the experimental results in the real test-bed, we can know that the MIH services can be used to reduce packet losses during a vertical handover and to reduce the AP discovery time and energy consumption of mobile nodes.
