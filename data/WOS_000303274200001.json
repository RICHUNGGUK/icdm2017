Due to the fact that these agents are self-interested, they may jeopardize mutual trust by not performing actions as they are expected to do. To this end, different models of trust have been proposed to assess the credibility of peers in the environment. These frameworks fail to consider and analyze the multiple factors impacting the trust. In this paper, we overcome this limit by proposing a comprehensive trust framework as a multi-factor model, which applies a number of measurements to evaluate the trust of interacting agents. First, this framework considers direct interactions among agents, and this part of the framework is called online trust estimation. Furthermore, after a variable interval of time, the actual performance of the evaluated agent is compared against the information provided by some other agents (consulting agents). This comparison in the off-line process leads to both adjusting the credibility of the contributing agents in trust evaluation and improving the system trust evaluation by minimizing the estimation error. What specifically distinguishes this work from the previous proposals in the same domain is its novelty in after-interaction investigation and performance analysis that prove the applicability of the proposed model in distributed multi-agent systems. In this paper, the agent structure and interaction mechanism of the proposed framework are described. A theoretical analysis of trust assessment and the system implementation along with simulations are also discussed. Finally, a comparison of our trust framework with other well-known frameworks from the literature is provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
