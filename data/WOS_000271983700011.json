The eddy-current problem was approximated using the commercial FE package, Comsol Multiphysics, and the numerical techniques employed were validated using a benchmark test. Mesh convergence for the head model was investigated for first- and second-order elements. MIT signals were computed for strokes of different sizes and locations in the brain to judge the sensitivity of the MIT configuration. The results revealed that for a large peripheral stroke (volume 50 cm(3)), 27% of the signals were above the phase noise level achievable in our current data-collection hardware (a parts per thousand 20 mA degrees). In order to detect the same percentage of the signals due to a centrally located small stroke, a reduction in phase noise to 1 mA degrees was necessary.", "paper_title": "Forward modelling of magnetic induction tomography: a sensitivity study for detecting haemorrhagic cerebral stroke", "paper_id": "WOS:000271983700011"}
