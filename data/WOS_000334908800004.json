In specific, the study measured discrete movement task time and accuracy. It was hypothesized that texturing would increase task times but improve accuracy by providing users with tactile references. A variable representing the frictional potential of pads was introduced into an established model of discrete movement performance (Fitts' Law) in an attempt to accurately model user performance under experimental task conditions. Results revealed touchpad texturing to degrade task performance. However, accuracy in pointing tasks was not significantly affected. Results also revealed that the expanded form of Fitts' Law, including a parameter for representing the frictional potential of pad texturing, was more predictive of actual movement times than the original form of the Law. Results from the study increase understanding of the effects of touchpad texture on human motor control behavior and provide some guidance for future pad design.", "paper_title": "Effects of Laptop Touchpad Texturing on User Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000334908800004"}
