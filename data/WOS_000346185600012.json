The second stage divider consists of a high-speed divide-by-8/9 dual-modulus prescaler, a pulse counter, and a swallow counter. Both the first stage divider (with high speed) and the divide-by-8/9 prescaler employ dynamic current-mode logic (DCML) structure to improve the operating performance. The first stage divider can work from 2 to 40 GHz and the whole divider covers a wide frequency range from 25 to 37 GHz. The input sensitivity is as low as -20 dBm at 32 GHz and the phase noise at 37 GHz is less than -130 dBc/Hz at an offset of 1 MHz. The whole chip dissipates 17.88 mW at a supply voltage of 1.2 V and occupies an area of only 730 mu m x475 mu m.", "paper_title": "A 37 GHz wide-band programmable divide-by-N frequency divider for millimeter-wave silicon-based phase-locked loop frequency synthesizers", "paper_id": "WOS:000346185600012"}
