However, the decoding complexity of existing algorithms is too high for low-complexity devices. In this work we formalize the all-to-all information exchange problem and shows how to optimize the transmission scheme in terms of energy efficiency. Furthermore, we prove by construction that there exists O(1)-complexity network coding algorithms for grid networks which can achieve such optimality. We also present low-complexity heuristics for random-topology networks. Simulation results show that network coding algorithms outperforms forwarding algorithms in most cases.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Network Coding Algorithms for Energy Efficient Information Exchange", "paper_id": "WOS:000262763400004"}
