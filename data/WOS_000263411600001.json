The objective is to achieve proportional fairness amongst the end-to-end sessions in the network. Since the network contains wireless links whose attainable throughput is a (non-convex and non-separable) function of MAC protocol parameters, the problem requires joint optimization at both the transport and the link layers. A dual-based algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve this cross-layer rate optimization problem. It is implemented in the distributed manner, and works at the link layer to adjust scheduling rates for the wireless links in the basic service sets, and at the transport layer to adjust end-to-end session rates. We prove rigorously that the proposed algorithm converges to the globally optimal rates. Simulation results are provided to support our conclusions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
