The current scheme is based on the numerical solution of the gas-kinetic Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model in the flux evaluation across each cell interface. An intrinsic connection between the BGK model and time-dependent, non-linear, non-homogeneous shallow-water equations enables us to solve shallow-water equations automatically with Our kinetic scheme. The analytical solution, experimental measurements, and numerical calculations for problems associated with roll-waves down an inclined open channel and solitary waves incident on a sloped beach are also presented.
