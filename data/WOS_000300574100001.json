Distributed Hash Table (DHT) has been applied to grid systems as a distributed mechanism for providing scalable range-query and multi-attribute resource discovery. Multi-DHT-based approaches depend on multiple DHT networks with each network responsible for a single attribute. Single-DHT-based approaches keep the resource information of all attributes in a single node. Both classes of approaches lead to high overhead. In this paper, we propose a Low-Overhead Range-query Multi-attribute (LORM) DHT-based resource discovery approach. Unlike other DHT-based approaches, LORM relies on a single compound graph-based DHT network and distributes resource information among nodes in balance by taking advantage of the compound graph structure. Moreover, it has high capability to handle the large-scale and dynamic characteristics of resources in grids. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of LORM in comparison with other resource discovery approaches. LORM dramatically reduces maintenance and resource discovery overhead. In addition, it yields significant improvements in resource location efficiency. We also analyze the performance of the LORM approach rigorously by comparing it with other multi-DHT-based and single-DHT-based approaches with respect to their overhead and efficiency. The analytical results are consistent with experimental results, and prove the superiority of the LORM approach in theory.", "paper_title": "Leveraging a Compound Graph-Based DHT for Multi-Attribute Range Queries with Performance Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000300574100001"}
