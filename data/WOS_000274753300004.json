With the motivation of construct reliable topology for wireless sensor networks, a Power-Law Evolving Model (PLEW) of wireless sensor networks by stochastic placement is proposed in this article. In a dynamic evolving process of Wireless Sensor Networks, there are four types of events as follows: adding new nodes, nodes failure, adding new links, and links failure. The dynamics of nodes and links are integrated into the evolving model consequently. By using the continuum theory, the theoretical computing and simulated results show that the degree distribution of this model follows a power law. The scale-free properties revealed in this model can be applied into the scenarios required high dependability, such as national defense or survivability systems.", "paper_title": "Dynamics of Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274753300004"}
