This selection procedure is used by population-based heuristic approaches for multiobjective optimization problems. Given that this procedure is called very often during the run of the heuristic approach, efficient ways of computing the optimal subset are strongly required. In this note, we give a correctness proof of the E-indicator subset selection algorithm proposed by Ponte et al. (2012) [1] for the bidimensional case as well as several algorithmic improvements in terms of time complexity. Extensions to larger dimension are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
