No single laboratory can develop these resources in isolation, and the community of users should no longer need to be dependent upon the specific programming environment in which applications have been developed. This work aims at exploiting the power of high-bandwidth communications networks for collaborative research and for shared access to knowledge resources. This platform is developed within a specialist community of renal scientists but will be transferable to any other field of research requiring interaction between published literature and databases, theoretical models and simulations and the formulation of effective experimental design.
