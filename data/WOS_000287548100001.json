Therefore, in this paper. the experimental identification of inertial parameters and friction coefficients are dealt with for an electro-hydraulic motion simulator, normally consisting of the Stewart platform. The model with arbitrary geometry, inertia distribution and frictions are obtained based on a structured Boltzmann-Hamel-d'Alembert formulation, and then the estimation equations are explicitly expressed in terms of a linear form with respect to the base parameters of minimal dimension to be identified. The identified parameters are obtained through solving the estimation equations by simple least square method. Moreover, exciting trajectories are also designed respectively in the actuating space and task space. Finally, the identified parameters are used to validate the developed model by comparing the predicted forces with respect to the actuating forces for a random trajectory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
