To satisfy the high reliability and low delivery-latency requirements for safety applications in VANETs, broadcasting becomes an essential operation for route establishment and repair. However, high node mobility causes constantly changing traffic and topology, which creates great challenges for broadcasting. Therefore, there is much interest in better understanding the properties of broadcasting in VANETs. In this paper we perform stochastic analysis of broadcasting delays in VANETs under three typical scenarios: freeway, sparse traffic and dense traffic, and utilize them to analyze the broadcasting delays in these scenarios. In the freeway scenario, the analytical equation of the expected delay in one connected group is given based on statistical analysis of real traffic data collected on freeways. In the sparse traffic scenario, the broadcasting delay in an n-vehicle network is calculated by a finite Markov chain. In the dense traffic scenario, the collision problem is analyzed by different radio propagation models. The correctness of these theoretical analyses is confirmed by simulations. These results are useful to provide theoretical insights into the broadcasting delays in VANETs.
