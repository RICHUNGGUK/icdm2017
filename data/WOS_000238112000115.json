The proposed FRFNN is based on the Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN) with the extended structure of fuzzy rules being formed within the networks. In the consequence part of the fuzzy rules, three different forms of the regression polynomials such as constant, linear and modified quadratic are taken into consideration. The structure and parameters of the FRFNN are optimized by the dynamic search-based GAs. The proposed model is contrasted with the performance of conventional FNN models in the literature.", "paper_title": "Design of fuzzy neural networks based on genetic fuzzy granulation and regression polynomial fuzzy inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000115"}
