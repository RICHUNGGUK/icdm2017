We consider the hybridization of BE with evolutionary algorithms endowed with tabu search. The resulting memetic algorithm (MA) uses BE as a mechanism for recombining solutions, providing the best possible child from the parental set. This MA is applied to the maximum density still life problem. Experimental tests indicate that the MA provides optimal or near-optimal results at an acceptable computational cost.", "paper_title": "A memetic algorithm with bucket elimination for the still life problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228000007"}
