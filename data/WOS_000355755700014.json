Parametric images obtained by combining dynamic FMT with compartmental modeling can provide quantitative physiological information for biological studies and drug development. However, images obtained with conventional indirect methods suffer from poor image quality because of failure in utilizing the temporal correlations of boundary measurements. Besides, FMT suffers from low spatial resolution due to its ill-posed nature, which further reduces the image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method to directly reconstruct parametric images from boundary measurements based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation with structural priors in a Bayesian framework. The proposed method can utilize structural priors obtained from an X-ray computed tomography system to mitigate the ill-posedness of dynamic FMT inverse problem, and use direct reconstruction strategy to make full use of temporal correlations of boundary measurements. The results of numerical simulations and in vivo mouse experiments demonstrate that the proposed method leads to significant improvements in the reconstruction quality of parametric images as compared with the conventional indirect method and a previously developed direct method.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Framework Based Direct Reconstruction of Fluorescence Parametric Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000355755700014"}
