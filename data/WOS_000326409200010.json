In this letter, a new construction method of symmetric orthogonal arrays of strength t is proposed, which is a concatenation of two orthogonal partitions according to a latin square. As far as we know, this is a new construction of symmetric orthogonal arrays of strength t, where t is a given integer. Based on the different latin squares, we also study the enumeration problem of orthogonal partitions, and a lower bound on the count of orthogonal partitions is derived.", "paper_title": "New Construction of Symmetric Orthogonal Arrays of Strength t", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409200010"}
