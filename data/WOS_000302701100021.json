Based on the proposed model, we formulate frame estimation scheme using the previous and the next frames. Unlike other shot boundary detection algorithms, instead of properties of frames, frame transition parameters and frame estimation errors based on global and local features are used for boundary detection and classification. Local features include scatter matrix of edge strength and motion matrix. Finally, the frames are classified as no change (within shot frame), abrupt change, or gradual change frames using a multilayer perceptron network. The proposed method is relatively less dependent on user defined thresholds and is free from sliding window size as widely used by various schemes found in the literature. Moreover, handling both abrupt and gradual transitions along with non-transition frames under a single framework using model guided visual feature is another unique aspect of the work.", "paper_title": "A Model-Based Shot Boundary Detection Technique Using Frame Transition Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000302701100021"}
