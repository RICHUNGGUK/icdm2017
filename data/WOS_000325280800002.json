Currently available smart mobile phones are capable of storing enormous amounts of personal information/data. The smart mobile phone is also capable of connecting to other devices, with the help of different applications. Consequently, with these connections comes the requirement of security to protect personal information. Nowadays, in many applications, a biometric fingerprint recognition system has been embedded as a primary security measure. To enable a biometric fingerprint recognition system in smart mobile phones, without any additional costs, a built-in high performance camera can be utilized. The camera can capture the fingerprint image and generate biometric traits that qualify the biometric fingerprint authentication approach. However, the images acquired by a mobile phone are entirely different from the images obtained by dedicated fingerprint sensors. In this paper, we present the current trend in biometric fingerprint authentication techniques using mobile phones and explore some of the future possibilities in this field.", "paper_title": "AUTHENTICATION OF FINGERPRINT BIOMETRICS ACQUIRED USING A CELLPHONE CAMERA: A REVIEW", "paper_id": "WOS:000325280800002"}
