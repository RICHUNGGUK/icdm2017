Design/methodology/approach - The authors examine Urquhart and Urquhart's critique and provide responses to their concerns and cautionary remarks against cross-disciplinary contributions. The authors reiterate the central claim. Findings - The authors argue that Mann and Thompson's (1987, 1988) Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) offers valuable insights into computer-mediated health communication and deserves further discussion of its methodological strength and weaknesses for application in library and information science. Research limitations/implications - While the authors agree that some methodological limitations pointed out by Urquhart and Urquhart are valid, the authors take this opportunity to correct certain misunderstandings and misstatements. Originality/value - The authors argue for continued use of innovative techniques borrowed from neighbouring disciplines, in spite of objections from the researchers accustomed to a familiar strand of literature. The authors encourage researchers to consider RST and other computational linguistics-based discourse analysis annotation frameworks that could provide the basis for integrated research, and eventual applications in information behaviour and information retrieval.", "paper_title": "Differences over discourse structure differences: a reply to Urquhart and Urquhart", "paper_id": "WOS:000352716700003"}
