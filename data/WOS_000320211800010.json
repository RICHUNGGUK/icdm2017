In this paper, a new linear programming formulation for dummy fill synthesis is proposed, which takes more consideration to the density gradient besides the pattern density. Based on the covering linear programming (CLP), a fast iterative approximation scheme is designed to solve this newly formulated problem. The complexity of the new method is proved to be O(n(2) log(n)). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new formulation, and show good accuracy and time efficiency of the proposed method. Compared with the ordinary LP method, speedup over magnitude is achieved with the acceptable overfill amount. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
