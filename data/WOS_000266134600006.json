Aerodynamic and aeroelastic analyses are reproduced numerically in order to demonstrate the applicability of CFD techniques in the field of wind engineering. A major topic in this paper is referred to one of the first attempts to simulate the aeroelastic behavior of a tall building employing complex CFD techniques. Numerical results obtained in this work are compared with numerical and wind tunnel measurements and some important concluding remarks about the present simulation are also reported.
