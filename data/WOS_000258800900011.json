As the paradigm continues to increase in popularity, a systematic and objective approach to verify the design of a pattern is increasingly important. The intent session in a design pattern indicates the problem the design pattern wants to resolve, and the solution session describes the structural model for the problem. When the problem in the intent is a quality problem, the structure model should provide a Solution to improve the relevant quality. In this work we provide an approach, based on object-oriented quality model, to validate if a design pattern is well-designed, i.e., it answers the question of the proposed structural model really resolves the quality problems described in the intent. We propose it validation approach to help pattern developers check if a design pattern is well-designed. In addition, a quantitative method is proposed to measure the effectiveness of the quality improvement of a design pattern that pattern users can determine which design patterns are applicable to meet their functional and quality requirements.
