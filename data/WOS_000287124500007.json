Using the martingale property of the modified price under the risk neutral measure, we derive the arbitrage free model for the spot and futures prices. As the futures price formula is based on the arithmetic average of the unobservable spot prices, it is highly nonlinear. We use the particle filtering methodology for estimating the model parameters. The main advantage of the new model is that it avoids the inclusion of artificial noise to the observation equation for the implementation of the particle. filter. The extra noise is built within the model in an arbitrage free setting.", "paper_title": "IDENTIFICATION OF ELECTRICITY SPOT MODELS BY USING CONVOLUTION PARTICLE FILTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500007"}
