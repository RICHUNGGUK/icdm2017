In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm for deforming geometric textures with dynamic effects. The algorithm consists of two steps. First, it computes a deformed shell space by optimizing a material related energy function, Which is then used to evaluate the equilibrium position of the geometric texture. Second, an explicit time integration scheme is applied for vibrating the geometric texture around its equilibrium position. Users can deform the geometric textures by dragging its vertices directly, and the dynamic behavior of the geometric textures can be changed by adjusting several material parameters. The dynamic simulation of geometric textures can be easily implemented on GPU and runs at real-time rates.
