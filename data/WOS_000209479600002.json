We consider binary domains and employ a three-valued characterization of domains with sensing actions to define the regression function. We prove the soundness and completeness of our regression formulation with respect to the definition of progression. More specifically, we show that (i) a plan obtained through regression for a planning problem is indeed a progression solution of that planning problem, and that (ii) for each plan found through progression, using regression one obtains that plan or an equivalent one.", "paper_title": "A STATE-BASED REGRESSION FORMULATION FOR DOMAINS WITH SENSING ACTIONS AND INCOMPLETE INFORMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000209479600002"}
