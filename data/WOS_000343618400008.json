The soil layers surrounding the pile are modeled as a set of viscoelastic continuous media in three-dimensional axisymmetric space, and a simplified model, i.e., the distributed Voigt model, is proposed to simulate the dynamic interactions of the adjacent soil layers. Meanwhile, the pile is assumed to be a Rayleigh-Love rod with material damping and can be divided into several pile segments allowing for soil layers and pile defects. Both the vertical and radial displacement continuity conditions at the soil-pile interface are taken into account. The potential function decomposition method and the variable separation method are introduced to solve the governing equations of soil vibration in which the vertical and radial displacement components are coupled. On this basis, the impedance function at the top of the pile segment is derived by invoking the force and displacement continuity conditions at the soil-pile interface as well as the bottom of pile segment. The impedance function at the pile head is then obtained by means of the impedance function transfer method. By means of the inverse Fourier transform and convolution theorem, the velocity response in the time domain can also be obtained. The reasonableness of the assumptions of the soil-layer interactions have been verified by comparing the present solutions with two published solutions and a set of well-documented measured pile test data. A parametric analysis is then conducted using the present solutions to investigate the influence of the transverse inertia effect on the dynamic response of an intact pile and a defective pile for different design parameters of the soil-pile system.
