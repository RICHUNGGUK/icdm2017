For dense DAGs, this is an improvement over the previous best result of O(min{m(3/2) log n, m (3/2) + n(2) log n}) by Katriel and Bodlaender [2006]. We also provide an empirical comparison of our algorithm with other algorithms for incremental topological sorting.", "paper_title": "An O(n(2.75)) Algorithm for Incremental Topological Ordering", "paper_id": "WOS:000265882200001"}
