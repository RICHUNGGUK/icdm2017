(2003). First, we look at tensor circuits, a natural generalization of tensor formulas; we show that the problem to determine whether the circuit output over a certain semiring is non-zero is complete for NE = NTime(2(O(n))) over the Boolean semiring, for circle plus E over the field F(2), and for analogous classes over other semirings. Moreover, common-sense restrictions such as imposing bounds on circuit and/or tensor depth, are shown to elegantly capture the classes P, NTime(2(O(logkn))), NTimeSpace(2(O(logkn)), n(O(1))), for k >= 1, PSPACE, and their counting counterparts. The proofs of these results use a model of algebraic Turing machines over a semiring together with a predicate-based approach on counting, which is similar to that of Toda (1991). This allows characterizations of the classes circle plus P, NP, co-NP, co-DP, C(=)P, SPP, USP, and UP, and their exponential time counterparts, in a single framework. Finally, we show that a number of natural problems concerning tensor formulas and circuits, such as asking whether the output of a formula/circuit is a diagonal matrix, or the identity matrix, or a permutation matrix, capture the classes Pi(p)(2) for formulas and Pi(e)(2) for circuits over the Boolean semiring; other semirings are also discussed.", "paper_title": "The complexity of tensor circuit evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000246582600003"}
