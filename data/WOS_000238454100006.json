In particular, we give a formula which permits to compute in an exact way the number of Sturmian palindromes of any length. Moreover, an interesting characterization of Sturmian palindromes is obtained.", "paper_title": "Combinatorial properties of Sturmian palindromes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238454100006"}
