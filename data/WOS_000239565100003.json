Our method uses a linear stiffness-warping scheme to achieve simulation speeds which are within a factor 10 of real-time rates at the expense of a small loss in accuracy. Muscle activations are produced by an arrangement of forces acting along selected edges of the FEM geometry. The model's dynamics are integrated using an implicit Euler formulation, which can be solved using either the conjugate gradient method or a direct sparse solver. To assess the utility of this model, we compare its accuracy against slower, but less approximate, simulations of a reference tongue model prepared using the FEM simulation package ANSYS.", "paper_title": "Efficient 3D finite element modeling of a muscle-activated tongue", "paper_id": "WOS:000239565100003"}
