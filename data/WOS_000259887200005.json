Many types of ligand molecules such as phthalate and adipate esters control these physiological functions. In the present Study, to elucidate the dependence of PPAR alpha properties on ligand binding, we investigated stable structures and electronic properties for the complexes of PPAR alpha and phthalate as well as adipate esters, which are used as a plasticizer, by Molecular simulations based on molecular mechanics and molecular orbital methods. Furthermore, to elucidate the influence of these esters in vivo, we injected them into male mice and observed the change in the expression of PPAR alpha-related enzymes. The comparison between the calculated and observed results indicates that the change in the expression has a correlation with the size of energy gaps between highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the complexes with mouse PPAR alpha and esters.
