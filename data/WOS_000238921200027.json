The power allocation is across the parallel channels and, within each channel, across the users. In both cases, there is a single constraint on the total power used. First, the allocation for the parallel MACs is determined, in a simple form, using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and a simple Lagrangian argument. Using this result, the allocation for the parallel BCs is derived using recent findings on the duality of the MAC and BC.", "paper_title": "Power allocation over parallel Gaussian multiple access and broadcast channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000238921200027"}
