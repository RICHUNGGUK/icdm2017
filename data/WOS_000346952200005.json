The proposed CAD system employs MRI data features and applies a Lattice Computing (LC) scheme. To this end feature extraction methods are adopted from the literature, toward distinguishing healthy people from Alzheimer diseased ones. Computer assisted diagnosis is pursued by a k-NN classifier in the LC context by handling this task from two different perspectives. First, it performs dimensionality reduction over the high dimensional feature vectors and, second it classifies the subjects inside the lattice space by generating adaptively class boundaries. Computational experiments using a benchmark MRI dataset regarding AD patients demonstrate that the proposed classifier performs well comparatively to state-of-the-art classification models.
