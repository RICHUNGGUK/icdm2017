A Relay Boost (RL.Boost) algorithm is proposed to solve this imbalanced data problem by fusing multiple features extracted from the multimedia data. As a modified RankBoost algorithm, RL.Boost directly minimizes the ranking loss, rather than the classification error. RL.Boost also iteratively samples positive/negative pairs for a more balanced data set to get diverse weak ranking with different features, and combines them in a ranking ensemble. Experiments on the standard TRECVID 2005 benchmark data set show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Relay boost fusion for learning rare concepts in multimedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500028"}
