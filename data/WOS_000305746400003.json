Due to the prevalence of wired and wireless access to Internet, it would be a trend to integrate present isolated video surveillance systems by applying distributed computing environment and to further gestate diversified multimedia intelligent surveillance (MIS) applications in ubiquity. In this paper, we propose a distributed and secure architecture for ubiquitous video surveillance (UVS) services over Internet and error-prone wireless networks with scalability, ubiquity and privacy. As cloud computing, users consume UVS related resources as a service and do not need to own the physical infrastructure, platform, or software. To protect the service privacy, preserve the service scalability and provide reliable UVS video streaming for end users, we apply the AES security mechanism, multicast overlay network and forward error correction (FEC), respectively. Different value-added services can be created and added to this architecture without introducing much traffic load and degrading service quality. Besides, we construct an experimental test-bed for UVS system with three kinds of services to detect fire and fall-incident features and record the captured video at the same time. Experimental results showed that the proposed distributed service architecture is effective and numbers of services on different multicast islands were successfully connected without influencing the playback quality. The average sending rate and the receiving rates of these services are quite similar, and the surveillance video is smoothly played.", "paper_title": "Effective distributed service architecture for ubiquitous video surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000305746400003"}
