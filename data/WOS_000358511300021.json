The transconductor employs local negative feedback for linearization controlling the drain voltage of the input transistors biased in the triode region. The gain boosted feedback amplifier is based on quasi-floating gate MOS transistors and its adjustable biasing current allows tuning the cutoff frequency of the filter. The filter is intended to be used in the baseband section of a zero-IF bluetooth low energy receiver and it has been fabricated in a standard 0.13-mu m CMOS technology with a nominal cutoff frequency of 500 kHz. The power consumption of the overall filter is 450 mu W with a supply voltage of 1.2 V. The measurement results show a third-order intermodulation distortion of -46.4 dB for two input tones located at the passband of the filter. The filter occupies a silicon area of 0.08 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A 1.2-V 450-mu W G(m)-C Bluetooth Channel Filter Using a Novel Gain-Boosted Tunable Transconductor", "paper_id": "WOS:000358511300021"}
