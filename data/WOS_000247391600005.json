At the origin of Holland's work, LCSs were seen as a model of the emergence of cognitive abilities thanks to adaptive mechanisms, particularly evolutionary processes. After a renewal of the field more focused on learning, LCSs are now considered as sequential decision problem-solving systems endowed with a generalization property. Indeed, from a Reinforcement Learning point of view, LCSs can be seen as learning systems building a compact representation of their problem thanks to generalization. More recently, LCSs have proved efficient at solving automatic classification tasks. The aim of the present contribution is to describe the state-of- the-art of LCSs, emphasizing recent developments, and focusing more on the sequential decision domain than on automatic classification.", "paper_title": "Learning classifier systems: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000247391600005"}
