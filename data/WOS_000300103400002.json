In the longer run, it is also intended as a hub for integrated use of enterprise and information system (IS) models expressed in different languages. To achieve this, UEML provides a common ontology that interrelates the semantics of many existing modelling languages. This paper presents the motivation and background for the UEML work. It then presents the structure and contents of UEML's evolving common ontology, the Unified Enterprise Modelling Ontology (UEMO), which has been established through analyses of 130 modelling constructs from a selection of 10 enterprise-and IS-modelling languages. It goes on to discuss the current state of UEMO and its further evolution. Finally, conclusions and paths for further work are offered.", "paper_title": "An ontology for enterprise and information systems modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000300103400002"}
