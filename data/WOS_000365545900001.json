With the long term goal of designing fault-tolerant IoT systems, this paper proposes a fault detection framework for WSNs with the perspective of energy efficiency to facilitate the design of fault detection methods and the evaluation of their energy efficiency. Following the same design principle of the fault detection framework, the paper proposes a classification for fault detection approaches. The classification is applied to a number of fault detection approaches for the comparison of several characteristics, namely, energy efficiency, correlation model, evaluation method, and detection accuracy. The design guidelines given in this paper aim at providing an insight into better design of energy-efficient detection approaches in resource-constraint WSNs.", "paper_title": "A Framework and Classification for Fault Detection Approaches in Wireless Sensor Networks with an Energy Efficiency Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000365545900001"}
