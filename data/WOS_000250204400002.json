We prove that there exists a constant k(d), 1 < k(d) < infinity, such that the k-nearest neighborhood graph of P has an infinite connected component with probability 1 when k >= k(d). In particular, we prove that k(2) <= 213. Our analysis establishes and exploits a close connection between the k-nearest neighborhood graphs of a Poisson point set and classical percolation theory. We give simulation results which suggest k(2) = 3. We also obtain similar results for finite random point sets.", "paper_title": "k-nearest-neighbor clustering and percolation theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000250204400002"}
