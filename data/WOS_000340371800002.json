The lung geometry is derived from 4D CT scan data of real patients. The spatially varying Young's modulus for the patient is obtained from a previous study that used inverse deformation of the lung. The compact-impact analysis is implemented using the finite element method. The predicted lung deformation is compared with the results based on linear elasticity. The results are consistent with physiology, indicating large deformations near the diaphragm and smaller values at remote locations on the lobe. The effect of non-linearity of elastic property is most significant at the remote locations where the diaphragm-induced deformation is significantly attenuated.", "paper_title": "Patient-specific model of lung deformation using spatially dependent constitutive parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000340371800002"}
