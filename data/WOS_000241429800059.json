In order to implement a fast classification system, we select simple features that can be obtained from non-intensive computation. We also introduce the new SVM_2K classifier that can achieve improved performance over a standard SVM by combining two types of motion feature vector together. After learning, classification can be implemented very quickly because SVM_2K is a linear classifier. Experimental results demonstrate the method to be efficient and may be used in real-time human action classification systems.", "paper_title": "Human action classification using SVM_2K classifier on motion features", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800059"}
