Therefore, device-independent approaches are aimed at hiding the differences among the distinct mobile devices in the market. This work proposes DIMAG, a software framework to generate connected mobile applications for multiple software platforms, following a declarative approach. DIMAG provides transparent data and state synchronization between the server and the client side applications. The proposed platform has been designed making use of existing standards, extending them when a required functionality is not provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
