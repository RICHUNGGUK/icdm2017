The approach is constructive, based on a part relation on elements within a sort, which enables the recognition of emergent information. The use of data functions as a sort provides for the embedding of data queries within a representational structure. We discuss the application of sorts to supporting alternative data views, illustrating this through a case study in building construction.", "paper_title": "Sortal structures: Supporting representational flexibility for building domain processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000243368500003"}
