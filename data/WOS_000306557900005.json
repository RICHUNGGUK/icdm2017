Our unified approach is based on the idea of axiomatizing access control in general terms. We show how multiple access control and privacy models and policies can be uniformly represented as particular logical theories in our axiom system. We show that our approach translates into different practical languages for implementation and we give some performance measures for some candidate implementations of our approach.", "paper_title": "Access Control with Privacy Enhancements a Unified Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000306557900005"}
