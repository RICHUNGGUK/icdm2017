This is the best result known and for the equations that feature #(x) < n/logn it yields time complexity of O(n) which is optimal. Additionally it is proven here that the set of solutions of any one-variable word equation is either of the form F or of the form F boolean OR(uv)(+) u where F is a set of O(log n) words and u, v are some words such that uv is a primitive word.", "paper_title": "On Word Equations in One Variable", "paper_id": "WOS:000290267000006"}
