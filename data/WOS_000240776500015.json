Each equalizer filter is constrained to lie in a Krylov subspace, and can be implemented as a reduced-rank multistage Wiener filter (MSWF). Both reduced-rank linear and decision-feedback equalizers (DFEs) are considered. Our results are asymptotic as the filter length goes to infinity. For SISO channels, the output mean-squared error (MSE) is expressed in terms of the moments of the channel spectrum. For MIMO channels, both successive and parallel interference cancellation are considered. The asymptotic performance in that case requires the computation of moments, which depend on shifted versions of the channel impulse response for different users. Those are also expressed in terms of the MIMO channel frequency response. Numerical results are presented, which show that near full-rank performance can be achieved with relatively low-rank equalizers.", "paper_title": "Performance of reduced-rank equalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500015"}
