For several more complex notions of boundedness, as well as for the covering problem, we show NP-completeness. In the last part, we use our results for cf-PNs to give linear time algorithms for related problems of context-free (commutative) grammars, and, in turn, use known results for such grammars to give a coNEXPTIME-upper bound for the equivalence problem of cf-PNs.", "paper_title": "Complexity Results for Problems of Communication-Free Petri Nets and Related Formalisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000351750200004"}
