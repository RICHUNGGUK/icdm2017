In this context, a practical realisation of a secure passive (battery-less) RFID tag is presented. The tag consists of an off the shelf front end combined with a bespoke 0.18 mu m Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) assembled as a -sized prototype. The ASIC integrates the authors' ultra low power novel Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) design together with a novel random number generator and a novel protocol, which provides both security and privacy. The analysis presented shows a security of 64-bits against many attack methods. Both modelled and measured power results are presented. The measured average core power consumed during continuous normal operation is 1.36 mu W.", "paper_title": "A holistic approach examining RFID design for security and privacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500002"}
