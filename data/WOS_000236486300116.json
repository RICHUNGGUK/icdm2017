Such a problem is ill-posed and may arise e.g. in imaging through semireflective media, in separation of an illumination image from a reflectance image, in imaging with diffraction phenomena, etc. In this work we study regularization of this problem in spirit of Total Variation and general sparsifying transformations.", "paper_title": "On separation of semitransparent dynamic images from static background", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300116"}
