The emphasis on the product post-sale life is common for these models. The most popular model is product lifecycle management (PLM), for manufacturing companies, or service engineering (SE), for service-oriented companies, and, for both, common paradigms are in maintenance, with conformance-to-use certification. This paper introduces basic research results achieved in application of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), and suggests considering maintenance as a cross section of the two business paradigms.
