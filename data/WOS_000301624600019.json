Such data are important diagnostics of activity conditions, with utility in forecasting measures. This code is made user friendly to enable volcanologists, who are not experts in the underlying physics of spectroscopy, to perform their own measurements. The program provides considerable reduction in errors and far greater operating flexibility than existing analogous code, which, unlike UVolc, can only interface with hardware no longer in manufacture. UVolc will be described here, including a presentation of data collected with this program in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
