Some solutions lead to operation conditions that are more hazardous, more costly or more difficult to implement and control. Therefore, it is useful for the analyst or decision-maker to use a criterion that can capture solutions evenly distributed along the so-called Pareto frontier. To provide information about criteria's working ability to depict Pareto frontiers, four optimization criteria built on different approaches were evaluated. Results show differences in criteria's performance. In particular, a consistent performance of a global criterion and limitations of the widely used desirability-based criterion is stated.
