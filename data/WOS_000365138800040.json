A variable reactance model for SVC is presented in steady state studies and implemented in the load flow program with embedded Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices. The continuation power flow method is used to determine optimal location of SVC and steady state stability margin, based on closing to point of voltage collapse. As an important result in this paper, we obtained an optimal location of SVC devices on wind farm by calculating the new indices such as maximum loading point (MLP) and mega watt margin (MWM). A case study and simulation are done on modified IEEE14 bus test system.", "paper_title": "An approach to optimal allocation of SVC in power systems connected to DFIG wind farms based on maximization of voltage stability and system loadability", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800040"}
