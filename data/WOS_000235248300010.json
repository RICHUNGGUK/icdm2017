We view (G,p) as a straight line realization of G in R(2). Two realizations of G are equivalent if the corresponding edges in the two frameworks have the same length. A pair of vertices {u,v} is globally linked in G if the distance between the points corresponding to u and v is the same in all pairs of equivalent generic realizations of G. The graph G is globally rigid if all of its pairs of vertices are globally linked. We extend the characterization of globally rigid graphs given by the first two authors [13] by characterizing globally linked pairs in M-connected graphs, an important family of rigid graphs. As a byproduct we simplify the proof of a result of Connelly [6] which is a key step in the characterization of globally rigid graphs. We also determine the number of distinct realizations of an M-connected graph, each of which is equivalent to a given generic realization. Bounds on this number for minimally rigid graphs were obtained by Borcea and Streinu in [3].", "paper_title": "Globally linked pairs of vertices in equivalent realizations of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235248300010"}
