Selection of a right technology is a critical stage in a successful technology transfer process. However, technology selection is a complex multi-dimensional problem including both qualitative and quantitative factors, such as human resources, operational and financial dimensions, which may be in conflict and may also be uncertain. In addition, interdependent relationships exist among various dimensions as well as criteria of technology selection. The identified problems could be solved by combining multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods of different nature and fuzzy set theory. The objective of the current paper is to develop a complex approach to evaluate technologies and to rank their appropriateness for a company. A hybrid model is proposed, based on Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS). A real-life case study is presented to validate the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid MCDM Approach Based on Fuzzy ANP and Fuzzy TOPSIS for Technology Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000363225700001"}
