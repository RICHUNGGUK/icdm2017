We then focus on the cubic problem and illustrate how our class of models compares with the well-known discretizations such as the standard discrete NLS equation, or the integrable variant thereof. We also discuss the conservation laws of the derived generalizations of the cubic case, such as the lattice momentum or mass and the connection with their corresponding continuum siblings.
