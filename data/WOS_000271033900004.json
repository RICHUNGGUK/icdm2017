It is assumed that the robots can exchange only position information according to a pre-specified communication graph. Each node represents a robot. Two robots are neighbours of each other if there is an edge between the two nodes. A feedback controller is performed for each robot by only using its own velocity information and the position information from its neighbours. It is proven that if the graph is connected, then the convergence to the moving formation of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. Several numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the results.", "paper_title": "Moving formation convergence of a group of mobile robots via decentralised information feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033900004"}
