However, because both the network topology and Web access are changed dynamically, whether the pre-fetching can get the stable performance under dynamic environment becomes an important issue. Therefore, this paper talks about the robustness of the pre-fetching algorithm, which has been proposed by us to deliver layered image contents over the Internet. Based on the web access distribution, the request pattern in the scalable imaging delivering system is analyzed in this paper. Furthermore, we check the robustness of our proposal by changing related parameters. Simulation results show that Our proposal is stable against variable conditions even if access patterns are dynamically changed.", "paper_title": "A ROBUST PRE-FETCHING ALGORITHM FOR SCALABLE WEB CONTENTS AND ITS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852600023"}
