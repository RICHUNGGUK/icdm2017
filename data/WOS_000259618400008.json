Therefore, it can let the nodes to communicate with each other efficiently in a large area. Despite several NTDR protocols have been proposed, there still lacks an efficient secure one. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a new method based on ID-based bilinear pairings to overcome the unsolved security problems nowadays. After our analysis, we conclude that our scheme is the first protocol for NTDR network that is not only secure but also very efficient. Crown copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.
