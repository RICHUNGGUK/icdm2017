The target users of The Chinese Room are not bilingual and are not familiar with machine translation technologies. We investigate the ability of our system to assist such users in decoding and correcting faulty, machine translations. We found that by collaborating with our application, end-users can overcome many difficult translation errors and disambiguate translated passages that were otherwise baffling. Vile also examine the utility of our system to machine translation researchers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that The Chinese Room can help such researchers develop better machine translation systems.", "paper_title": "The Chinese Room: Visualization and Interaction to Understand and Correct Ambiguous Machine Translation", "paper_id": "WOS:000268217500044"}
