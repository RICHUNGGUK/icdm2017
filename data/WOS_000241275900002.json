A properly designed multimedia QoS system must reserve requested resources according to user QoS requirements and the available network resources. However, the static resource allocation among priority queues in DiffServ networks leads to insufficient resource usage when a burst occurs in one priority queue while other queues starve. This study presents a User-Oriented QoS Streaming System to achieve perceptible satisfaction based on novel streaming and media differentiation policies in DiffServ networks. This study also proposes that the Dynamic QoS Queue Mapping (DQ(2)M) mechanism dynamically control queue scheduling by adaptively maximizing the utilization of queues and network resources according to the soft states of the DiffServ network. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed DQ(2)M algorithm can improve the fairness and efficiency of resource utilization for low-priority queues. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
