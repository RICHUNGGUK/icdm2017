Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) and molecular docking studies were carried out on a series of substituted 2,2-bisaryl-bicycloheptanes FLAP inhibitors. The docking results provided a reliable conformational alignment scheme for 3-D QSAR model. Based on the docking conformations, highly predictive CoMFA model was performed with a leave-one-out cross-validated q(2) of 0.651. The noncross-validated analysis with four optimum components revealed a conventional r(2) value of 0.972, F= 175.674, and an estimated standard error of 0.169. the predictive ability of this model was validated by the testing set with a conventional r(2) value of 0.920. The analyses may be used to design more potent FLAP inhibitors and predict their activities prior to synthesis.", "paper_title": "Molecular docking and 3-D QSAR studies of substituted 2,2-bisaryl-bicycloheptanes as human 5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Protein (FLAP) inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000259888600001"}
