The energy diagrams are drawn out along both the initial O-H and C-H bond scission pathways via the four sequential dehydrogenation processes, respectively, i.e., CH3OH -> CH2OH -> CH2O -> CHO -> CO and CH3OH -> CH3O -> CH2O -> CHO -> CO, respectively. It is revealed that the reaction kinetics over PtAu2 is significantly different from that over Pt-3. For the Pt-3-mediated reaction, the C-H bond scission pathway, where an ensemble composed of two Pt atoms is required to complete methanol dehydrogenation, is energetically more favorable than the O-H bond scission pathway, and the maximum barrier along this pathway is calculated to be 12.99 kcal mol(-1). In contrast, PtAu2 cluster facilitates the reaction starting from the O-H bond scission, where the Pt atom acts as the active center throughout each elementary step of methanol dehydrogenation, and the initial O-H bond scission with a barrier of 21.42 kcal mol(-1) is the bottom-neck step of methanol decomposition. Importantly, it is shown that the complete dehydrogenation product of methanol, CO, can more easily dissociate from PtAu2 cluster than from Pt-3 cluster. The calculated results over the model clusters provide assistance to some extent for understanding the improved catalytic activity of bimetal PtAu catalysts toward methanol oxidation in comparison with pure Pt catalysts.", "paper_title": "A comparative theoretical study for the methanol dehydrogenation to CO over Pt-3 and PtAu2 clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000305602900016"}
