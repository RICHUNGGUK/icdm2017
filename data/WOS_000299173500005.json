In this paper we present a P2P-based infrastructure that leverages the semantic technologies to support a scalable and accurate service discovery process. The key concept of the presented idea is the creation of an overlay network organized in several semantic groups of peers, each specialized in answering queries pertaining to specific applicative domains. Groups are formed by clustering together peers offering services that are semantically related. A semantic query routing mechanism ensures the delivery of queries to the groups that are semantically \"worth\" to respond. In this paper the architecture details of the proposed solution is presented. A system prototype has also been implemented and validated through a case study deployed on the PlanetLab testbed.", "paper_title": "A P2P BASED ARCHITECTURE FOR SEMANTIC WEB SERVICE DISCOVERY", "paper_id": "WOS:000299173500005"}
