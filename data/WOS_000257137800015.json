The geometry of the channel is measured, a visualization technique is used to measure the actual flow characteristics, and then a numerical flow model is used to represent the flow including unsteady flow characteristics. Numerical model of drifting cup is introduced to investigate an interaction between flow and motion of the cup. Finally, the intention of the channel design is interpreted from the viewpoint of fluid mechanics using observed and calculated results.", "paper_title": "The design secret of Kyokusui-no-En's meandering channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000257137800015"}
