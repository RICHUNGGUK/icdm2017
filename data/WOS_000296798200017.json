Observed data can be considered a mixture of underlying characteristic spectra (endmembers), and estimating the constituents and their abundances requires efficient algorithms for spectral unmixing. We present a Bayesian spectral unmixing algorithm employing a volume constraint and propose an inference procedure based on Gibbs sampling. We evaluate the method on synthetic and real hyperspectral data of wheat kernels. Results show that our method perform as good or better than existing volume constrained methods. Further, our method gives credible intervals for the endmembers and abundances, which allows us to asses the confidence of the results.", "paper_title": "Unmixing of Hyperspectral Images using Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization with Volume Prior", "paper_id": "WOS:000296798200017"}
