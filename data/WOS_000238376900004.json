The significance of the proposed approach is that it can be used to identify, for a given outer high rate code and fixed ISI channel, the precoder that results in the lowest error rate floor. In estimating the bit error performance in the floor region, we use analytical techniques developed for trellis codes to compute the overall system minimum squared Euclidean distance, and then use a semi-analytical approach to find the corresponding multiplicity. We also demonstrate via simulations that the proposed technique may be extended to fading ISI channels with favorable results. We give examples that support our analysis.
