The purpose is the design of dynamic anti-windup fuzzy controllers ensuring convergence of all admissible initial states within the domain of attraction. Delay-dependent conditions for the existence of solutions to this problem are obtained. A simulation example is also presented.", "paper_title": "ROBUST STABILIZATION OF STATE DELAYED T-S FUZZY SYSTEMS WITH INPUT SATURATION VIA DYNAMIC ANTI-WINDUP FUZZY DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500004"}
