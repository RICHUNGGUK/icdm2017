Firstly, the concept, operational laws, score function and accuracy function of dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic element (DHFLE) are defined. For the situation that the attributes are independent, some dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic geometric aggregation operators are proposed. Considering that there exists prioritization among the attributes, we propose several dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic prioritized aggregation operators based on the prioritized average (PA) operator. Moreover, some desirable properties and special cases of these operators are investigated in detail. Based on the proposed operators, two novel approaches to MADM with dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic information are proposed. Finally, a numerical example for investment alternative selection is given to illustrate the application of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic aggregation operators and their applications to multi-attribute decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000343424500032"}
