We introduce a max-min analogue of the tropical rank of a matrix and show that it is equal to the dimension of the associated polytope. We describe the relation between this rank and the notion of strong regularity in max-min algebra, which is traditionally defined in terms of unique solvability of linear systems and the trapezoidal property.
