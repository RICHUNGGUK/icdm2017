The setting is based on a reproducing kernel k for functions on D, a family of non-negative weights gamma(u), where u varies over all finite subsets of N, and a probability measure rho on D. We consider the weighted superposition K = Sigma(u) gamma(u)k(u) of finite tensor products k(u) of k. Under mild assumptions we show that K is a reproducing kernel on a properly chosen domain in the sequence space D-N, and that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space H (K) is the orthogonal sum of the spaces H (gamma(u)k(u)). Integration on H(K) cans be defined in two ways, via a canonical representer or with respect to the product measure rho(N) on D-N. We relate both approaches and provide sufficient conditions for the two approaches to coincide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
