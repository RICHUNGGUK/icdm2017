We develop an approach to simultaneously estimate exponential utility functions and willingness to pay at a low level of cognitive consumer effort The empirical evaluation of our new recommendation system's utility and willingness to pay estimates with the estimates of a system based on linear utility functions indicates that exponential utility functions are better suited for predicting optimal recommendation ranks for products. Linear utility functions perform better in estimating consumers' willingness to pay. Based on our experimental data set, we show how retailers can use these willingness to pay estimates for profit-maximizing pricing decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
