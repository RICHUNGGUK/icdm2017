This paper proposes a process algebraic model targeted at the analysis of both such aspects. The framework includes a probabilistic process calculus and a suite of analytical techniques based on a probabilistic observational congruence and an interference-sensitive preorder. The former enables the verification of behavioural equivalences; the latter makes it possible to evaluate the interference level of behaviourally equivalent networks. The result is a comprehensive and effective framework for the behavioural analysis and a quantitative assessment of interference for wireless networks in the presence of node mobility. We show our techniques at work on two realistic case studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
