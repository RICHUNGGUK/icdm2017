The generalization to several functions leads to Reeb spaces, which are thus able to capture more features of an object. We introduce the layered Reeb graph as a discrete representation for Reeb spaces of 3D solids (embedded three-dimensional manifolds with boundary) with respect to two scalar-valued functions. After that we present an efficient algorithm for computing the layered Reeb graph, which uses only a boundary representation of the underlying three-dimensional manifold. This leads to substantial computational advantages if the manifold is given in a boundary representation, since no volumetric representation has to be constructed. However, this algorithm is applicable only if the defining functions satisfy certain conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
