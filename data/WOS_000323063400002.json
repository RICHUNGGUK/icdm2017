The stability of a linearized dynamic fuzzy control system is then analyzed using stability equations and the parameter plane method, with the assistance of a describing function method. This procedure identifies the amplitude and frequency of limit cycles that are clearly formed by the dynamic fuzzy controller in the parameter plane. Moreover, the suppression of the limit cycle by adjusting control parameters is proposed. Continuous and sampled-data systems are addressed, and the proposed approach can easily be extended to a fuzzy control system with multiple nonlinearities. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Limit-cycle analysis of dynamic fuzzy control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000323063400002"}
