We present new characterizations of the MTTF order in terms of the well-known hazard rate and reversed hazard rate orders. Preservation properties of this order under some reliability operations such as monotonic transformations, mixture, and weighted distributions are investigated. In this context, we provide new results related to the DMTTF class. Finally, the problem of testing exponentiality against such class is discussed, and some numerical results are presented.", "paper_title": "Further Results Involving the Mean Time to Failure Order, and the Decreasing Mean Time to Failure Class", "paper_id": "WOS:000324250300012"}
