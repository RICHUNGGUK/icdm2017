The actions are combined in a Finite State Automaton whose structure is determined by a novel evolutionary algorithm. The actions parameters, or new actions, are evolved alongside the FSA topology. Actions can be combined together in a hierarchical fashion. This approach relies on skills that with which the robot is already provided, like grasping or motion planning. Therefore software reuse is an important advantage of our proposed approach. We conducted several experiments both in simulation and on a real mobile manipulator PR2 robot, where skills of increasing complexity are evolved. Our results show that (i) an FSA generated in simulation can be directly applied to a real robot without modifications and (ii) the evolved FSA is robust to the noise and the uncertainty arising from real-world sensors.
