The top-down approach is composed of three steps: (1) directly obtain the best set of linguistic terms, (2) find the matching rule antecedents and their output values, and (3) visit the neighbor terms. A numerical example is provided along with detailed analysis of the approach. In addition, the approach is applied to a simplified aircraft conflict detection task. The results show that the top-down approach is effective at reducing the amount of computation compared to the classical search approach.", "paper_title": "Top-Down Approach for a Linguistic Fuzzy Logic Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000329154400003"}
