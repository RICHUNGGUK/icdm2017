The principal factors responsible for this phenomenon have remained largely unknown. However, recent experiments suggest that when the virtual environment (VE) is an exact replica of a user's real physical surroundings, the person's distance perception improves. Based on this observation, it sounds reasonable that if subjects feel a high degree of situational awareness in a known VE, their ability for estimating distances may be much better compared to an unfamiliar virtual world. This raises the question, whether starting the virtual reality (VR) experience in such a virtual replica and gradually transiting to a different VE has potential to increase a person's sense of presence as well as distance perception skills in an unknown virtual world. In this case the virtual replica serves as transitional environment between reality and a virtual world. Although transitional environments are already applied in some VR demonstrations, until now it has not been verified whether such a gradual transition improves a user's VR experience. We have conducted two experiments to quantify to what extent a gradual transition to a virtual world via a transitional environment improves a person's level of presence and ability to estimate distances in the VE. We have found that the subjects' self-reported sense of presence shows significantly higher scores, and that the subjects' distance estimation skills in the VE improved significantly, when they entered the VE via a transitional environment.
