The sound pressure at the entrance of the external ear canal was calculated by the solution of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. Furthermore, the Hilbert Huang transformation is used to find the instantaneous frequencies of acoustic signal. Results show that the Interaural Level Difference and the frequencies shifting are eventful cues to perceive the direction and the speed of the moving sound source. in addition, the perceived loudness level will be larger in the motional case than that found in the stationary cases.
