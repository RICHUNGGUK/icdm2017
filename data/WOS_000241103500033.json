However, few studies have dealt with the semantic categorization of classifiers and their semantic relations to nouns, which they quantify and characterize in building ontology. In this paper, we propose the semantic recategorization of numeral classifiers in Korean and present the construction of a classifier ontology based on large corpora and KorLex 1.5 (Korean WordNet). As a result, a Korean classifier ontology containing semantic hierarchies and the relations of classifiers was constructed. This is the first Korean classifier ontology, and its size is appropriate for natural language processing. In addition, each of the individual classifiers has a connection to nouns or noun classes that are quantified by the classifiers.", "paper_title": "Building Korean classifier ontology based on Korean WordNet", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500033"}
