In these new scenarios, heterogeneity and dynamism are inherent properties and applications are built by aggregating distributed information and services that are not under the control of a single entity. The current trend towards distributed computing poses important problems related to the transmission of large amounts of data between the nodes of the computing system; the control over the information; and the flexibility to adapt to heterogeneous client requirements. These characteristics, difficult to manage by traditional computing models, are making the mobile agent paradigm to gain momentum and increasing the interest of researchers and industry in this paradigm. In this paper we present a solution to provide a secure and auto-configurable environment for mobile agents in ubiquitous computing scenarios, based on two main building blocks: trusted platforms and profiles.", "paper_title": "A secure and auto-configurable environment for mobile agents in ubiquitous computing scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600099"}
