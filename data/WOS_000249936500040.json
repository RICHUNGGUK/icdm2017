The limiter is a generalization of the limiter introduced in [R. Biswas, K. Devine, J.E. Flaherty, Parallel adaptive finite element methods for conservation laws, Applied Numerical Mathematics 14 (1994) 255-284]. We present the one-dimensional case and extend it to two-dimensional problems on tensor-product meshes. Computational results for examples with both smooth and discontinuous solutions are shown.
