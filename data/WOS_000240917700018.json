Because a much wider range of physical phenomena are modelled by nonclassical parabolic initial-boundary value problems, theoretical behavior and numerical approximation of these problems have been active areas of research. The radial basis functions (RBF) method is an efficient mesh free technique for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The main advantage of numerical methods which use radial basis functions over traditional techniques is the meshless property of these methods. In a meshless method, a set of scattered nodes are used instead of meshing the domain of the problem. The results of numerical experiments are presented and some comparisons are made with several well-known finite difference schemes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
