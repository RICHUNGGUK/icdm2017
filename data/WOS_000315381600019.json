The modalities of CML evaluate the rates of the exponentially distributed random variables that characterize the duration of the labeled transitions of a CMP. In this paper we present weak and strong complete axiomatizations for CML and prove a series of metaproperties, including the finite model property and the construction of canonical models. CML characterizes stochastic bisimilarity and it supports the definition of a quantified extension of the satisfiability relation that measures the \"compatibility\" between a model and a property. In this context, the metaproperties allows us to prove two robustness theorems for the logic stating that one can perturb formulas and maintain \"approximate satisfaction\".", "paper_title": "CONTINUOUS MARKOVIAN LOGICS AXIOMATIZATION AND QUANTIFIED METATHEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000315381600019"}
