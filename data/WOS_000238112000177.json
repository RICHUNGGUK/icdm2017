By sliding Fourier transform (SFF), the convolutive mixture problem is changed into instantaneous case in time-frequent domain, which can be solved by applying an instantaneous separation method for every frequent bin. A novel cost function for each frequent bill based on joint diagonalization of a set of correlation matrices with multiple time-lags is constructed. Through combination of the proposed double-iteration method with a restriction on the length of inverse filter in time domain, the inverse of transfer channel or separation matrix, which has consistent permutations for all frequencies, call be estimated. Then it is easy to calculate the recovered source signals. The results of simulations also illustrate the algorithm has not only fast convergence performance. but also higher recovered accuracy and output SER (Signal to Error of reconstruction Ratio).", "paper_title": "Convolutive blind separation of non-white broadband signals based on a double-iteration method", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000177"}
