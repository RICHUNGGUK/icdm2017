Subsequently, the biochemical characterizations showed that levofloxacin directly inhibited FABP4 activity in both the in vitro ligand displacement assay and cell-based function assay. Furthermore, levofloxacin did not induce adipogenesis in adipocytes, which is the major adverse effect of FABP4 inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Discovery of FDA-Approved Drugs as Inhibitors of Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 Using Molecular Docking Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000345551000002"}
