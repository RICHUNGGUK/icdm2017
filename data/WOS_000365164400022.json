To solve this problem, an adaptive least square controller is proposed. The uniform stability of the tracking error and parameters error for the aforementioned controller is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov-like analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by on-line simulations.", "paper_title": "Adaptive least square control in discrete time of robotic arms", "paper_id": "WOS:000365164400022"}
