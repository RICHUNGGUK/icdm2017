The number of linear extensions is closely related with the number of minimum comparisons to sort the poset (D.E. Knuth, Sorting and Searching, 2nd ed., The Art of Computer Programming, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1998) [5]. We show that three comparisons suffice to sort any poset having seven linear extensions, and this result may speed up exhaustive computation to derive the lower bound of the minimum number of comparisons in sorting.
