For any poset P, the D-completion exists, and P and its D-completion have the isomorphic Scott closed set lattices. This completion is idempotent. A poser P is continuous (algebraic) if and only if its D-completion is continuous(algebraic). Using the D-completion, we construct the local dcpo-completion of posers, that revises the one given by Mislove. In the last section, we define and study bounded sober spaces. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.
