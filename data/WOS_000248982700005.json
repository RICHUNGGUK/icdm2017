Multiterminal resilience extends this measure to any k vertices; it is the average k-terminal reliability of a network. This generalizes two well-studied network connectedness measures. Calculating multiterminal resilience on general networks encompasses all-terminal reliability and thus is NP-hard. Multiterminal resilience is examined on undirected series-parallel networks, and an efficient (polynomial time) algorithm is developed for calculating the resilience for every k. Applications in mobile ad hoc and sensor networks are outlined.
