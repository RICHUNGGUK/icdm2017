It enables viewing levels of sequence and structure similarity on the aligned structures and performing a variety of evolutionary and bioinformatic tasks, including the construction of structure-based phylogenetic trees and minimal basis sets of structures that best represent the topology of the phylogenetic tree. It is implemented as a plugin for VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics), which is distributed by the NIH Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics at the University of Illinois.", "paper_title": "Multiple Alignment of protein structures and sequences for VMD", "paper_id": "WOS:000235277300020"}
