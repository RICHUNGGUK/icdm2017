The objective of this paper is to develop a framework to quantify the effects of spatial road network data and navigation sensor data on the performance of map matching algorithms. Three map matching algorithms are tested with different spatial road network data (map scale 1:1,250; 1:2,500 and 1:50,000) and navigation sensor data (global positioning system (GPS) and GPS augmented with deduced reckoning) in order to quantify their performance. The algorithms are applied to different road networks of varying complexity. The performance of the algorithms is then assessed for a suburban road network using high precision positioning data obtained from GPS carrier phase observables. The results show that there are considerable effects of spatial road network data on the performance of map matching algorithms. For an urban road network, the results suggest that both the quality of spatial road network data and the type of navigation system affect the link identification performance of map matching algorithms.", "paper_title": "The Effects of Navigation Sensors and Spatial Road Network Data Quality on the Performance of Map Matching Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000262396900004"}
