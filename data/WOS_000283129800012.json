Users may efficiently utilize heterogeneous network infrastructures while moving among different access networks in order to attain better services, everywhere and at any time, following the always best connected concept. In this article enhanced handover functionality is described for integrated Wi-Fi/WiMAX networks, based on the recently established IEEE 802.21 standard that serves to glue together heterogeneous wireless access technologies. Moreover, alternative implementation choices are introduced with an emphasis on the mapping of primitives between the IEEE 802.21 standard and the various underlying access network technologies. As a result, optimized media-independent handover operations are provided alongside highlighted possible improvements to the related standards.", "paper_title": "OPTIMIZED FUSION OF HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS BASED ON MEDIA-INDEPENDENT HANDOVER OPERATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283129800012"}
