By extending the conventional dynamic deviation reduction (DDR) model to the concurrent dual-band mode, we propose two DDR-based concurrent dual-band models, the dual-band DDR (DB-DDR) model and the simplified dual-band DDR (SDB-DDR) model. The performance of these two models is experimentally assessed with two types of wideband PAs (a GaN Class F PA and a GaN Doherty PA) driven by the concurrent dual-band signal, and compared with the prior two-dimensional digital predistortion (2D-DPD) model and the two-dimensional modified memory polynomial (2D-MMP) model. The results prove the good DPD performance and low computational complexity of the proposed models. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
