An innovative data-driven FDD methodology has been presented in this paper on the basis of a distributed configuration of three adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) classifiers for an industrial 440 MW power plant steam turbine with once-through Benson type boiler. Each ANFIS classifier has been developed for a dedicated category of four steam turbine faults. A preliminary set of conceptual and experimental studies has been conducted to realize such fault categorization scheme. A proper selection of four measured variables has been configured to feed each ANFIS classifier with the most influential diagnostic information. This consequently leads to a simple distributed FDD system, facilitating the training and testing phases and yet prevents operational deficiency due to possible cross-correlated measured data effects. A diverse set of test scenarios has been carried out to illustrate the successful diagnostic performances of the proposed FDD system against 12 major faults under challenging noise corrupted measurements and data deformation corresponding to a specific fault time history pattern.
