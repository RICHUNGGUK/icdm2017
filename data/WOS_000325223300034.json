It automatically learns a shape model from cluttered training images without need to explicitly use bounding boxes on objects. Our approach first builds a class-specific codebook of local contour features, and then generates structural feature descriptors by combining context shape information. These descriptors are robust to both within-class variations and scale changes. Through exploring pairwise image matching using fast earth mover's distance, feature weights can be iteratively updated. Those discriminative foreground features are assigned high weights and then selected to build a part-based shape model. Finally, object detection is performed by matching each testing image with this model. Experiments show that the proposed method is very effective. It has achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art shape-based detection methods, but requires much less training information.", "paper_title": "Object Detection via Structural Feature Selection and Shape Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300034"}
