It can cover either a cylinder or a torus. In this paper we compute Padmakar-Ivan index, abbreviated (PI) index, of TUC4 C-8 (R) nanotube where PI index of a graph G is defined as PI(G) = Sigma[n(eu)(e vertical bar G) + n(eu)(e vertical bar G) is the number oflying closer to u than to v, n(ev) (e vertical bar G) is the number of edges of G lying closer to v than to u and summation goes over all edges of G This topological index is developed recently.", "paper_title": "PI index of TUC4C8(R) nanotubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000244490600017"}
