We undertook a conformational analysis of a 2-sulfated, 3-linked U-L-galactan and of a alpha-L-fucan with similar structure. Through comparison between theoretical and NMR derived coupling constants, we observed that the pyranose rings are predominantly in the C-1(4) conformation in these polysaccharides. Additionally, the geometry of the glycosidic linkages was determined based on force field calculations, indicating that the two polysaccharides have similar conformations in solution. Since the sulfated beta-L-galactan, but not the alpha-L-fucan potentiates antithrombin (AT) inhibition of thrombin, the solution conformations of the compounds were docked into AT and the complexes obtained were refined through molecular dynamics calculations. The obtained results indicates extremely different orientations for the two poly saccharides, which well correlates and explain their distinct anticoagulant activities. Finally, the molecular mechanism of a selective 2-desulfation reaction, observed among sulfated fucans, was explained as a consequence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond capable of assisting in the removal of the charged group.
