Two main contributions have been made. First, a 2D version of clustering-based discriminant analysis (CDA) is proposed, which combines the capability to model the multiple cluster structure embedded within a single class with the computational advantage that is characteristic of 2D subspace analysis methods. Second, we extend the applications of 2D subspace methods to the field of 3D head model classification by characterizing these models with 2D feature sets. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society.
