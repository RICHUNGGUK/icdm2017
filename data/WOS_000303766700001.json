A new evolutionary algorithm named Multiobjective free search algorithm (MOFS) is designed for WSN optimization problem based on fitness functions and binary coding schemes. The proposed strategy is used to estimate the number of active nodes because individual nodes cannot have their working state information readily. Simulation shows that MOFS is effective to solve the typical combinatorial optimization problem, and the coverage control strategy can obtain high network coverage and reduce energy consumption effectively by the reasonable selecting parameters, while equilibrium of energy consumption is also considered.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective Coverage Control Strategy for Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303766700001"}
