We use a finite-state tool, MOCHA, which allows specification of protocol properties in a branching-time temporal logic with game semantics. While our analysis does not reveal any errors in the BW protocol, in the GM protocol we discover serious problems with fairness for four signers and an oversight regarding abuse-freeness for three signers. We propose a complete revision of the GM subprotocols in order to restore fairness.", "paper_title": "Formal analysis of multiparty contract signing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241379300003"}
