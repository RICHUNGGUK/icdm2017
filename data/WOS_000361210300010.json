With selective capture, the adversaries strategically capture sensors and turn them into inside attackers. With smart attack, an inside attacker is capable of performing random, opportunistic, and insidious attacks to evade detection and maximize their chance of success. We develop a model-based analysis methodology with simulation validation to identify the best defense protocol settings under which the sensor network lifetime is maximized against selective capture and smart attack.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Network Defense Management for Countering Smart Attack and Selective Capture in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361210300010"}
