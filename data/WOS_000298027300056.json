When the input for a decision process is linguistic, it can be understood that the output should also be linguistic. For that reason, in this paper we propose a modification of the TOPSIS algorithm which develops the above idea and which can also be used as a linguistic classifier. In this new development, modifications to the classic algorithm have been considered which enable linguistic outputs and which can be checked through the inclusion of an applied example to demonstrate the goodness of the new model proposed.
