It is assumed that the tail of the distribution of B-1 is regularly varying, whereas the distribution of A(1) has a suitably light tail. The problem of efficient estimation, via simulation, of quantities such as P{X-n > b} and P{sup(k <= n) X-k > b} for large b and n is studied. Importance sampling strategies are investigated that provide unbiased estimators with bounded relative error as b and n tend to infinity.", "paper_title": "Rare-Event Simulation for Stochastic Recurrence Equations with Heavy-Tailed Innovations", "paper_id": "WOS:000329124400002"}
