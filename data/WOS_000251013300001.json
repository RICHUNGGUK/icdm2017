Design/methodology/approach - A local one-dimensional transient analysis in the thickness direction is adopted for the panel part, which employs finite-difference method. And a three-dimensional, boundary element method is used for the numerical implementation of the heat transfer analysis in the mold region, which is considered as three-dimensional conduction. The Renormalization-Group turbulence model is applied for the jet impinging cooling. The part and mold analyses are coupled so as to match the temperature and heat flux on the glass-mold interface. Findings - The paper provides mathematical model and numerical strategy adapted to the problem, with experimental verification that shows a good agreement. Practical implications - Cooling design in the forming operation of picture tube panel is of great importance because it significantly affects the part quality associated with residual stresses and productivity. The developed simulation package is a tool in the optimization of processing parameters and in-mold cooling system structure design. Originality/value - This paper presents a realistic, integrated, and coupled numerical model for analyzing the panel cooling process that retains important aspects of the problem. The paper could be very valuable to the researchers in this field as a benchmark for their analyses.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of temperature history during the picture tube panel-forming process", "paper_id": "WOS:000251013300001"}
