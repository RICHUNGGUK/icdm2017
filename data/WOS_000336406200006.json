We show how the technique can be used to formulate both global and multi-stage methods with high order of accuracy for both stiff and non-stiff problems. Linear and non-linear stability results, including A-stability, L-stability and B-stability are proven using the energy method for general initial value problems. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
