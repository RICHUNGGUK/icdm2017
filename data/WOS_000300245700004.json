However, most of the modern biomedical scientists are not familiar with the new technology. To overcome the difficulty, an intelligent information system is needed to help scientists in designing and conducting research projects. Previously, we have designed a static knowledge management system for the LARGE-like glycosyltransferase, a novel GlcNAc transferase involved in human diseases such as muscular dystrophy and human meningioma, by integrating data from public databases. According the characteristics of protein structure of LARGE protein family members include an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane region, a coiled-coil motif and a putative catalytic domain with the conserved aspartate-any residue-aspartate motif and a conserved protein structural domain. In this paper, we have described an intelligent information system for the LARGE-like GlcNAc Transferase Database, by setting up an automatic updating databank for genes of the LARGE family and by integrating several bioinformatics tools which can identify characteristics structural domains of the protein family.", "paper_title": "LGTBase: LARGE-like GlcNAc Transferase Database", "paper_id": "WOS:000300245700004"}
