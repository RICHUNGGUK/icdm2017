In this PLL, a VCO with process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) insensitive bias circuit, and a divided-by-7/8 prescaler with improved multi-phase frequency divider are adopted. A novel multi-stage noise shaping (MASH) sigma-delta modulator (SDM) is adopted here. A new combination of low-current-mismatch charge pump (CP) and a phase/frequency detector (PFD) is proposed in this paper. Using Hejian Technology CMOS 0.18 mu m analog and digital mixed-mode process, a fractional-N PLL prototype circuit is designed, the VCO in the prototype circuit can operate at a central frequency of 1.55 GHz, and its phase noise is -121 dBc/Hz at 1.0 MHz, the variety of phase noise is depressed by about 1.4 dB with the help of PVT insensitive bias. Under a 1.8-V supply voltage, the phase noise of the PLL is -113 dBc/Hz at 1.0 MHz.", "paper_title": "A 1.41-1.72 GHz sigma-delta fractional-N frequency synthesizer with a PVT insensitive VCO and a new prescaler", "paper_id": "WOS:000264618400004"}
