In this model, commencing at zero, zonular traction on all lens profiles resulted in central lenticular surface steepening and peripheral surface flattening, with a simultaneous increase in central lens thickness and central optical power. An age-related decline in maximum zonular tension appears to be the most likely etiology for the decrease in accommodative amplitude with age. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
