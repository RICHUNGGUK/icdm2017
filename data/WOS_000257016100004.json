Although it is possible to distribute the load on a server to the users' computers, the distributed services are more vulnerable to cheating such as data theft. We propose a method for concealing the data from a user who is authorized to manage the data. The method makes it possible to carry out various kinds of operations, keeping both data and program codes concealed. We show that the concealed information cannot be figured out with the knowledge of the original programs or encoding keys possessed by the other users. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
