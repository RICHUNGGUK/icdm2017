This paper proposes an efficient motion compensation architecture for AVS-P2 video standard up to the Level 6.2 of the Jizhun Profile. It has a macroblock-level pipelined structure which consists of MV predictor unit, reference fetch unit and pixel interpolation unit. The proposed architecture exploits the parallelism in the AVS motion compensation algorithm to accelerate the speed of operations and uses the dedicated design to optimize the memory access. And it has been integrated in a prototype chip which is fabricated with TSMC 0.18-mu m CMOS technology, and the experimental results show that this architecture can achieve the real time AVS-P2 decoding for the HDTV 1080i (1920 X 1088 4 : 2 : 0 60field/s) video. The efficient design can work at the frequency of 148.5MHz and the total gate count is about 225K.", "paper_title": "An efficient VLSI architecture for motion compensation of AVS HDTV decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000238079200011"}
