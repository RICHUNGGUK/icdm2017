For many interconnection networks, the optimal sets are precisely those induced by a single vertex. It is natural to look for obstruction sets beyond those induced by a single vertex. The conditional matching preclusion number of a graph is the minimum number of edges whose deletion results in a graph with no isolated vertices that has no perfect matchings. In this companion paper of Cheng et al. (Networks (NET 1554)), we find these numbers for a number of popular interconnection networks including hypercubes, star graphs, Cayley graphs generated by transposition trees and hyper-stars.
