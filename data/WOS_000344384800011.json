The test statistics are formulated following the approach of Fourier-type conditional expectations first suggested by Bierens [Consistent model specification tests. J Econometr. 1982;20:105-134]. The proposed procedures are computationally convenient, and under fairly mild conditions lead to consistent tests. Corresponding bootstrap versions are compared with alternative procedures for a wide selection of different estimators of the underlying partial linear model.", "paper_title": "Validation tests for semi-parametric models", "paper_id": "WOS:000344384800011"}
