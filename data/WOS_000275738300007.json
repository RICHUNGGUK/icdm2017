An important goal in the field of third party logistics (3PLs) is to improve the performance of logistics activities to enhance operation efficiency and enterprise competency. However, the employee performance must be determined in order to improve the activity performance of 3PLs. Thus, the aim of this research is to develop an employee performance estimation (EPE) model that includes three modules: direct performance determination (DPD), indirect performance determination (IPD), and performance score analysis (PSA). Moreover, a web-based logistics information management (LIM) platform was established via the EPE model in order to assist the managers in collecting and maintaining shop-floor operation data and to identify low-performance logistics tasks as well as inexperienced employees. In addition, a real-world case was used to demonstrate applicability of the proposed model and platform. As a whole, this paper presents an integrated model with the aims to more accurately calculate employee performance and significantly reduce the workload of 3PL decision makers.
