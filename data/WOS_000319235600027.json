Based on the observation that the effectiveness of P2P resource discovery is determined by the utilization of hints, i.e., a summary of where the resources are, scattered in the network, in this paper we propose the distance-aware bloom filters (DABF) that disseminate hint information to faraway nodes by decaying BFs with different deterministic masks. Based on DABF, we design a novel Collaborative P2P Search (CPS) mechanism, which supports intelligent message behaviors including suspend, resume, terminate, move, reside, dispatch, notify, and order. The effectiveness of our proposals is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, in which we observed a remarkable reduction in search latency over previous approaches.
