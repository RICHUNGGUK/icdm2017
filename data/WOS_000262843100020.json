BSP problems arise in various applications where networks usually consist of large numbers of nodes and arcs. Since obtaining the set of efficient solutions to a BSP problem is more difficult (i.e. NP-hard and intractable) than solving the corresponding single-objective problem there is a need for fast solution techniques. Our aim is to compare different strategies for solving the BSP problem. We consider a standard label correcting and label setting method, a purely enumerative near shortest path approach, and the two phase method, investigating different approaches to solving problems arising in phases 1 and 2. In particular, we investigate the two phase method with ranking in phase 2. In order to compare the different approaches. we investigate their performance oil three different types of networks. We employ grid networks and random networks, as is generally done in the literature. Furthermore, road networks are utilized to compare performance on networks with a structure that is more likely to actually arise in applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
