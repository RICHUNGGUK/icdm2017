The use of the GEH distance metric improves search semantics by reducing the degree of non-determinism of k-NN queries in NDDSs. The generalized form presented here enables the GEN distance to be used for a much greater variety of scenarios than was possible with the original form. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
