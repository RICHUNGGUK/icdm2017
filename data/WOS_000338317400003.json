We first construct an objective deformation energy with the terms including vertex position, edge length, dihedral angle, and gravitation, then we conduct a numerical solution in the least square sense. In order to establish the dynamic cloth deformation solution, we further analyze the corresponding relationship between different weights in front of geometric energy terms and material properties by comparison with the real photographs of typical real fabrics. Establishing a dynamic weight-regulation measure can model similar cloth anisotropic behaviors for virtual fitting applications in digital home. The experiments show that our approach effectively provide more rich cloth deformation results with distinctive material effects.", "paper_title": "Mesh-based anisotropic cloth deformation for virtual fitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000338317400003"}
