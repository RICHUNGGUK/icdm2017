SLEUTH model, situated in Project Gigalopolis, is a powerful tool for description of urban agglomeration and spatial dynamics. In this paper, new applications of this model, other methodological analyses, and sensitivity studies allow us to improve our comprehension of model parameters, taking advantage of this type of synthetic description of reality. Many deductions are possible thanks to the comparison of our studies with other precious databases, already existent, about results of this model.", "paper_title": "Urban sprawl: A case study for project gigalopolis using SLEUTH model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300049"}
