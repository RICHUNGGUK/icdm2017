Further, combination of the proposed algorithm with an adaptive threshold value for image binarization, the least-square method and Bessel curve algorithm are proposed for detection and to fit the lane. The proposed SIP algorithm was evaluated by various tests. The experimental results indicate that the average time consumed for the detection of lane in each frame is 16.7639 ms, and the accuracy of lane detection is 95%. The proposed algorithm demonstrates good robustness, and can be used as the core algorithm for further application in lane departure warning systems.", "paper_title": "Integration of scanning and image processing algorithms for lane detection based on fuzzy method", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200053"}
