The goal is to minimize the total completion times. According to the idea of the Delayed-SPT Algorithm proposed by Hoogeven and Vestjens [Optimal on-line algorithms for single-machine scheduling. In: Proceedings 5th international conference on integer programming and combinatorial optimization (IPCO). Lecture notes in computer science, vol. 1084. Berlin: Springer; 1996. p. 404-14], we give an on-line algorithm for the scheduling problem on m identical parallel machines. We show that this algorithm is 2-competitive and the bound is tight.
