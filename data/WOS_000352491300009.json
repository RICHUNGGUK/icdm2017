While significant advances have been made for 2D cases, so far skeleton extraction for 3D sensor networks has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we conduct the first work of a unified framework providing a connectivity-based and distributed solution for line-like skeleton extraction in both 2D and 3D sensor networks. We highlight its practice as: 1) it has linear time/message complexity; 2) it provides reasonable skeleton results when the network has low node density; 3) the obtained skeletons are robust to shape variations, node densities, boundary noise and communication radio model. In addition, to confirm the effectiveness of the line-like skeleton, a 3D routing scheme is derived based on the extracted skeleton, which achieves balanced traffic load, guaranteed delivery, as well as low stretch factor.", "paper_title": "A Unified Framework for Line-Like Skeleton Extraction in 2D/3D Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352491300009"}
