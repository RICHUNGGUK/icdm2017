Such alternate structures can either be a set of suboptimal foldings, or distinct stable folding states, or variants within an RNA family. We provide several such examples and propose an efficient algorithm to search for RNA multistructures within a genomic sequence.", "paper_title": "Modeling Alternate RNA Structures in Genomic Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000350883400002"}
