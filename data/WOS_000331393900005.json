In this paper, we propose a novel component based method to recover the full 3D face shape from a set of sparse feature points. We use a local linear fitting (LLF) scheme so that reconstruction of each subregion depends on both its own vertices and adjacent subregions. This method results in a separate set of shape coefficients each emphasizing the quality of one subregion and improves the model expressiveness. Experiments show that the LLF strategy significantly reduces the model residual error, and thus reduces the sparse reconstruction error under pose variations. Moreover, the problem of estimating pose parameters is revisited, and we use a joint optimization method to improve the reconstruction quality under unknown pose. We evaluate the sensitivity of our method to the selection of feature points. Simulation results show that our method is more robust than prevailing methods.", "paper_title": "3D face sparse reconstruction based on local linear fitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000331393900005"}
