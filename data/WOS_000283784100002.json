The discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of P and B frames are estimated to reconstruct DC + 2AC image using their motion vectors and the DCT coefficients in I frames, which can be directly extracted from MPEG-2 compressed domain. Initial optical flow is estimated with Black's optical flow estimation framework, in which DC image is substituted by DC ? 2AC image to provide more intensity information. A high confidence measure is exploited to generate dense and accurate motion vector field by removing noisy and false motion vectors. Global motion estimation and iterative rejection are further utilized to separate foreground and background motion vectors. Region growing with automatic seed selection is performed to extract accurate object boundary by motion consistency model. The object boundary is further refined by partially decoding the boundary blocks to improve the accuracy. Experimental results on several test sequences demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve compressed-domain video object extraction for MPEG-2 video stream in CIF format with real-time performance.", "paper_title": "Optical flow approximation based motion object extraction for MPEG-2 video stream", "paper_id": "WOS:000283784100002"}
