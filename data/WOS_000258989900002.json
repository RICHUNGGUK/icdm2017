The objective of the present study is to determine the optimal material properties (via the material volume fractions) and the structural topology to maximize the performance of the structure in a given application. In the proposed method, the volume fraction and the structural boundary are considered as the design variables. with the former being discretized a,; a scalar field and the latter being implicitly represented by the level set method. To perform simultaneous optimization, the two design variables are integrated into a common objective functional. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to obtain the descent directions. The optimization process is, then expressed as the solution to a coupled Hamilton-Jacobi equation and diffusion partial differential equation. Numerical results are provided for the problem of mean compliance optimization ill two dimensions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
