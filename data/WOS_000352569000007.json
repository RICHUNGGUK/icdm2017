An important requirement of such applications is timely delivery. However, the intermittent connectivity of DTNs may significantly delay content exchange, and cannot guarantee timely delivery. The state-of-the-arts capture mobility patterns or social properties of mobile devices. Such solutions do not capture patterns of delivered content in order to optimize content delivery. Without such optimization, the content demanded by a large number of subscribers could follow the same forwarding path as the content by only one subscriber, leading to traffic congestion and packet drop. To address the challenge, in this paper, we develop a solution framework, namely Ameba, for timely delivery. In detail, we first leverage content properties to derive an optimal routing hop count of each content to maximize the number of needed nodes. Next, we develop node utilities to capture interests, capacity and locations of mobile devices. Finally, the distributed forwarding scheme leverages the optimal routing hop count and node utilities to deliver content towards the needed nodes in a timely manner. Illustrative results verify that Ameba achieves comparable delivery ratio as Epidemic but with much lower overhead.", "paper_title": "Towards Maximizing Timely Content Delivery in Delay Tolerant Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352569000007"}
