Many methods to deal with this problem related to clustering. For underdetermined blind source separation model, this paper gives a new plane clustering algorithm to estimate the mixture matrix based on sparse sources information. Good performance of our method is shown by simulations.", "paper_title": "Mixture matrix identification of underdetermined blind source separation based on plane clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400009"}
