However, although social software is used widely for business support, its relationship with Business Process Management has not been analysed. The results of the workshop on Business Process Management and Social Software (BPMS2'08), as part of the International Conference on Business Process Management in Milano, show the manifold possibilities of combining concepts from Business Process Management and social software. Social software provides a better integration of all stakeholders into the business process life cycle and offers new possibilities for a more effective and flexible design of business processes. The modelling of business processes may profit particularly from using social software techniques by alleviating the integration of process knowledge from all stakeholders. In addition, the implementation and deployment phase of the business process life cycle may profit from social software by collecting valuable information for continuous process improvement from a larger set of sources than before. Furthermore, social software environments may be used to provide workflow support. Moreover, the use of social software also requires new considerations about the digital identity and reputation in business processes.
