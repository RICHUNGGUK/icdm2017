The 3D model has allowed the identification of several residues that are predicted to play a crucial role in structural integrity, substrate recognition and catalysis. In particular, the model of the catalytic domain can be useful for designing site-directed mutagenesis experiments and for developing inhibitors of Gas1p enzymatic activity.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of the yeast beta-(1,3)-glucan transferase Gas1: a molecular modeling investigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000234444400014"}
