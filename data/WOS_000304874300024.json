The sample rate is dynamically varied based on signal activity determined by the 2nd derivative of the input voltage. The derivative is realized with high-pass filters having 647 Hz cut-off frequency. A digital circuit generates the time-stamps and the trigger for an external analog-to-digital converter. Measured results of a 0.35 mu m CMOS implementation show a sample rate variation of 7:1 and a system power advantage compared to conventional front-ends. The circuit dissipates 48 mu W from +/- 1.5 V supplies and consumes an active area of 0.068 mm(2).", "paper_title": "Integrated control circuit for adaptive sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000304874300024"}
