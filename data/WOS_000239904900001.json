In this article Gentzen systems are defined for these logics by means of a special mix rule that combines calculi for various substructural logics with a hypersequent calculus for Meyer and Slaney's Abelian logic. Cut-elimination is established for all these systems, and as a consequence, a positive answer is given to an open problem on the decidability of the basic comparative logic.", "paper_title": "Proof theory for Casari's comparative logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000239904900001"}
