Computationally, this process can be supported by multi-objective optimization methods that produce numerical solutions to an optimization task. Since a variety of comparable multi-property solutions are usually obtained further prioritization is required. However, the underlying multi-dimensional property spaces are typically complex and difficult to rationalize. Herein, an approach is introduced to visualize multi-property landscapes by adapting the concepts of star and parallel coordinates from computer graphics. The visualization method is designed to complement multi-objective compound optimization. We show that visualization makes it possible to further distinguish between numerically equivalent optimization solutions and helps to select drug-like compounds from multi-dimensional property spaces. The methodology is intuitive, applicable to a wide range of chemical optimization problems, and made freely available to the scientific community.", "paper_title": "Visualization of multi-property landscapes for compound selection and optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000359535600002"}
