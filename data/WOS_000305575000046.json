The treewidth of a linear code is the least constraint complexity of any of its cycle-free graphical realizations. This notion provides a useful parameterization of the maximum-likelihood decoding complexity for linear codes. In this paper, we show the surprising fact that for maximum distance separable codes and Reed-Muller codes, treewidth equals trelliswidth, which, for a code, is defined to be the least constraint complexity (or branch complexity) of any of its trellis realizations. From this, we obtain exact expressions for the treewidth of these codes, which constitute the only known explicit expressions for the treewidth of algebraic codes.", "paper_title": "The Treewidth of MDS and Reed-Muller Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000046"}
