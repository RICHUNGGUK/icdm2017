In contrast to most studies that focus on determining only sentiment orientation (positive versus negative), the proposed method performs fine-grained analysis to determine both the sentiment orientation and sentiment strength of the reviewer towards various aspects of a movie. Sentences in review documents contain independent clauses that express different sentiments toward different aspects of a movie. The method adopts a linguistic approach of computing the sentiment of a clause from the prior sentiment scores assigned to individual words, taking into consideration the grammatical dependency structure of the clause. The prior sentiment scores of about 32,000 individual words are derived from SentiWordNet with the help of a subjectivity lexicon. Negation is delicately handled. The output sentiment scores can be used to identify the most positive and negative clauses or sentences with respect to particular movie aspects.", "paper_title": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis of movie reviews on discussion boards", "paper_id": "WOS:000285087200011"}
