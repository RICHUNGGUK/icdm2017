While many de novo assembly software packages are available, comparatively little attention has been paid to assisting the user with the assembly. Results: This article addresses the practical aspects of de novo assembly by introducing new ways to perform quality assessment on a collection of sequence reads. The software implementation calculates per-base error rates, paired-end fragment-size distributions and coverage metrics in the absence of a reference genome. Additionally, the software will estimate characteristics of the sequenced genome, such as repeat content and heterozygosity that are key determinants of assembly difficulty.", "paper_title": "Exploring genome characteristics and sequence quality without a reference", "paper_id": "WOS:000336095100006"}
