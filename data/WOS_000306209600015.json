Because these models or algorithms have high computational demands, however, the requirement of expensive technical computing software is unavoidable. This study presents a rule-based decision support system (RBDSS) to analyze and generate a set of sensor placement locations and compares the performance against 10 optimization models based on four indexes. Our findings show that the RBDSS demands relatively lower computational time and still exhibits outstanding performance in terms of all our indexes when dealing with a large-scale complex drinking water network.
