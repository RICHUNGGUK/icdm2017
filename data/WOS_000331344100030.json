Two main issues are addressed in this paper: the matched points and the denoising algorithm based on an adaptive spatial temporal filter. Unlike previous algorithms, our method adaptively selects reference pixels within spatially and temporally neighboring frames. Our method uses more information about matched pixels on neighboring frames than other methods. Therefore, the proposal enhanced the accuracy of video denoising. Simulation results show that the proposed method produces cleaner and sharper images.", "paper_title": "Movement Awareness-Adaptive Spatio Temporal Noise Reduction in Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100030"}
