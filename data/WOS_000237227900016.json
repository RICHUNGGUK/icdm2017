Nevertheless, the original definition of this measure contains several limitations. This paper points out some of those limitations, presents a new and more relevant definition of the negative slope coefficient and empirically shows the suitability of this new definition as a hardness measure for some genetic programming benchmarks, including the multiplexer, the intertwined spirals problem and the royal trees.", "paper_title": "Negative slope coefficient: A measure to characterize genetic programming fitness landscapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000237227900016"}
