This article presents a graphbased approach to WSD in the biomedical domain. The method is unsupervised and does not require any labeled training data. It makes use of knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System ( UMLS) Metathesaurus which is represented as a graph. A state-of-the-art algorithm, Personalized PageRank, is used to perform WSD. Results: When evaluated on the NLM-WSD dataset, the algorithm outperforms other methods that rely on the UMLS Metathesaurus alone.", "paper_title": "Graph-based Word Sense Disambiguation of biomedical documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000283919800013"}
