The construction component adds a novel optimization to a parallel bisimulation algorithm implemented on a multi-core graph processing framework. We show that for several large, disk resident, real world graphs, full summary construction can be completed in roughly the same time as the data load. The query translation component supports Extended Property Paths (EPPs), an enhancement of SPARQL 1.1 property paths that can express a significantly larger class of navigational queries. EPPs are implemented via rewritings into a widely used SPARQL subset. The optimization component can (transparently to users) translate EPPs defined on instance graphs into EPPs that take advantage of bisimulation summaries. S+ EPPs combines the query and optimization translations to enable summary-based optimization of graph traversal queries on top of off-the-shelf SPARQL processors. The demonstration showcases the construction of bisimulation summaries of graphs (ranging from millions to billions of edges), together with the exploration benefits and the navigational query speedups obtained by leveraging summaries stored alongside the original datasets.", "paper_title": "S+EPPs: Construct and Explore Bisimulation Summaries, plus Optimize Navigational Queries; all on Existing SPARQL Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800093"}
