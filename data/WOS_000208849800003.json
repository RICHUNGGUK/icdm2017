We call any subset C subset of V an (r, <= k)-identifying code if the sets {c is an element of C vertical bar d(c, v) <= r, v is an element of F} are distinct for all subset F subset of V with at most k vertices. Here, V denotes the vertex set of graph and d(c, v) the number of edges on any shortest path from c to v. We prove a new lower bound 5/12 on the density of (1, <= 2)-identifying codes and construct a (2, <= 2)-identifying code with density 2/7 in the infinite king grid.", "paper_title": "New bounds for (r, <= 2)-identifying codes in the infinite", "paper_id": "WOS:000208849800003"}
