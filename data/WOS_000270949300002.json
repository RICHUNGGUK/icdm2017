It is of particular interest since there are currently no reported case studies or implementations of the explicit parametric controller/estimator for batch and polymerization processes. In this paper we aim at achieving tight offset-free tracking of a desired reactor temperature profile, making accurate states estimation despite of the possible perturbations, and demonstrating the practical applicability to a case with industrially relevant complexity.", "paper_title": "Robust Explicit Moving Horizon Control and Estimation: A Batch Polymerization Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000270949300002"}
