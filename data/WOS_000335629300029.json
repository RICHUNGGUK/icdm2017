And now many efforts are putting emphasis on developing distributed mobility management schemes. This paper discusses the advantages of multiple Home Address (HoA) allocating, which is considered as an important character of distributed mobility schemes, by a flow duration based model for the first time as we know. We think that most Internet flows are very short and the best way of forwarding them is using local HoA instead of tunneling to a home link as described in the context of centralized mobility management schemes. We summarize the two cases of distributed mobility management schemes, called the multiple-level tunnel and the direct tunnel and propose a new flow duration based model to evaluate their performance. For the purpose of analysis, we study the cumulative distribution function of Internet flow duration based on our campus real data. Numerical results show that the relatively low velocity and short online time scenario is more suitable for distributed mobility management, and the direct tunnel scheme can always get better performance than the multiple-level tunnel case and the centralized mobility management scheme.
