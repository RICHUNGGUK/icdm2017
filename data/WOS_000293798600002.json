Computer vision is an essential part of building context-aware environments that adapt and anticipate their human users by understanding their behavior. This thematic issue explores state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for ambient intelligence applications.", "paper_title": "Computer vision for ambient intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000293798600002"}
