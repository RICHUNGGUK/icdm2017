In this paper, we first characterize the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks with adjustable transmission ranges through theoretical analysis. Based on this result, we propose a deployment strategy with T as the required minimum network lifetime. We come up with three interventions: (A) in order to achieve an evenly balanced energy consumption among all nodes, the node density in different areas of the network should be a continuous varying function of the distance from the sink; (B) if there are insufficient nodes to achieve a balanced energy consumption over the whole network, our proposed node deployment strategy can be used to achieve the required lifetime threshold T with minimum number of nodes; and (C) when there are sufficient nodes to ensure the network connectivity and coverage with the node density of tau, we design an algorithm to identify the optimal transmission radius r and the corresponding achievable maximum network lifetime. Our conclusions are verified by extensive simulation results. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
