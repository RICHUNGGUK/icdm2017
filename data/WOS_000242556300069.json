This paper proposes an improved estimation of distribution algorithm (HEDA) based on histogram probabilistic model. By utilizing both historical and current population information, a novel learning method - accumulation strategy - is introduced to update the histogram model. In the sampling phase, mutation strategy is used to increase the diversity of population. In solving some well-known hard continuous problems, experimental results support that HEDA behaves much better than the conventional histogram-based implementation both in convergence speed and scalability. Compared with UMDA-Gaussian, SGA and CMA-ES, the proposed algorithms exhibit excellent performance in the test functions.", "paper_title": "Optimizing continuous problems using estimation of distribution algorithm based on histogram model", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300069"}
