Consolidated techniques of interaction design (scenario-based design) had to be revisited to capture the richness and complexity of intelligent interactive systems. We, show that the design of intelligent systems requires methodologies (faceted scenarios) that support the investigation of intelligent features and usability factors simultaneously Interaction designers become mediators between intelligent technology and users mid have to facilitate reciprocal understanding.", "paper_title": "Mediating between AI and Highly Specialized Users", "paper_id": "WOS:000273146800011"}
