While in the past wireless communication (as well as mobility) was largely limited to the first and last transmission hops, today's wireless networks are starting to offer purely wireless, often mobile, and even opportunistically connected operation. The purpose of this article is to examine security and privacy issues in some new and emerging types of wireless networks, and attempt to identify directions for future research.", "paper_title": "SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN EMERGING WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283448700005"}
