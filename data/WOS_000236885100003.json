The method uses oriented probabilistic models of the measurement noise and combines them with feature-enhancing prior probabilities over 3D surfaces. When applied to surface reconstruction, the method simultaneously smooths noisy regions while enhancing features such as corners. When applied to surface decimation, it finds models that closely approximate the original mesh when rendered. The method is applied in the context of computer animation where it finds decimations that minimize the visual error even under nonrigid deformations.", "paper_title": "A Bayesian method for probable surface reconstruction and decimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236885100003"}
