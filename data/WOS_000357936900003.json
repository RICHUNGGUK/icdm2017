At its core, SonicAIR instruments kitchen activity sites to produce an always-on real-time aural representation of remote domestic rhythms. This article reports how users in two pilot SonicAIR deployments used the sounds as resources for recognizing comfortable narratives of sociability. Used alongside telecare monitoring, such technologized interaction might enable older people to engage in community-oriented soundscape narratives of shared social responsibility.", "paper_title": "SonicAIR: Supporting Independent Living with Reciprocal Ambient Audio Awareness", "paper_id": "WOS:000357936900003"}
