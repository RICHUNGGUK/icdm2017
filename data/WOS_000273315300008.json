Both single image based modeling and architecture modeling are challenging problems. We handle these difficulties by employing constraints derived from shape symmetries, which are prevalent in architecture. We first present a novel algorithm to calibrate the camera from a single image by exploiting symmetry. Then a set of 3D points is recovered according to the calibration and the underlying symmetry. With these reconstructed points, the user interactively marks out components of the architecture structure, whose shapes and positions are automatically determined according to the 3D points. Lastly, we texture the 3D model according to the input image, and we enhance the texture quality at those foreshortened and occluded regions according to their symmetric counterparts. The modeling process requires only a few minutes interaction. Multiple examples are provided to demonstrate the presented method.", "paper_title": "Symmetric Architecture Modeling with a Single Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000273315300008"}
