We prove a lower bound on the degree of the polynomial g. This bound in particular implies that such a function f is APN on at most a finite number of fields f(2)(m) . Furthermore we prove that when the degree of g is less than 7 such functions are APN only if m a <= 3 where these functions are equivalent to x (3).", "paper_title": "Bounds on the degree of APN polynomials: the case of x(-1)+g(x)", "paper_id": "WOS:000288452200015"}
