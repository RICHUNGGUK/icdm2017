We study matching problems in k-GG graphs. We show that a Euclidean bottleneck matching of P is contained in 10-GG, but 8-GG may not have any Euclidean bottleneck matching. In addition we show that 0-GG has a matching of size at least n-1/4 and this bound is tight. We also prove that 1-GG has a matching of size at least 2(n-1)/5 and 2-GG has a perfect matching. Finally we consider the problem of blocking the edges of k-GG. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
