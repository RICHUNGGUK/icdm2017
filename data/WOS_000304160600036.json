To cope with this challenge, a relatively comprehensive system scheme which supports complex product real-time collaborative interactive assembly is proposed. To get high performance, the technologies such as parallel rendering for complex scene based on pc-cluster, high-efficient collision detection method, the mechanism of event synchronization based on HLA/RTI (High level Architecture/Run-time Infrastructure) are applied. A prototype system named Distributed Parallel Virtual Assembly Environment (DPVAE) is developed. With DPVAE, users at different location can do assembly operation collaboratively by hand or by tool, to conduct the component model verification and assembly process evaluation at the same time. Through a case study of RA750 car assembly, the validity of system functions has been demonstrated successfully.", "paper_title": "A virtual environment for complex products collaborative assembly operation simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600036"}
