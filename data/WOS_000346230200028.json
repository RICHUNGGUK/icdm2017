When we transmit the video signal in the MC-CDMA, the allocation of the SVC layer scheme is the most important to improve video quality, because the SVC signal is composed of several video layers having different priorities that can determine the video quality. To improve the quality of video, we proposed the transmission block selection (TBS) for SVC signal allocation using partial channel state information (PCSI). The proposed system supports the unequal protection (UEP) depending on video layer priorities. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed system provides superior performance compared to those of conventional systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
