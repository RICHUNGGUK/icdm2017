It uses clock-controlled non-linear feedback registers filtered by a highly non-linear output function and was claimed to prevent any existing attacks. However, as we will show in this paper, there are some serious security weaknesses in COSvd (2,128). The poorly designed S-box generates biased keystream and the message could be restored by a ciphertext-only attack in some broadcast applications. Besides, we launch a divide-and-conquer attack to recover the secret keys from O(2(26))-byte known plaintext with high success rate and complexity O(2(113)), which is much lower than 2(512), the complexity of exhaustive search.", "paper_title": "Weaknesses of COSvd (2,128) stream cipher", "paper_id": "WOS:000238283000021"}
