Previous Java-based implementations assume a fixed topology for the representative parental data. cBrother is a novel C language implementation that capitalizes on reduced computational time to relax the fixed tree assumption. We show that cBrother is 19 times faster than its predecessor and the fixed tree assumption can influence estimates of recombination in a medically-relevant dataset.", "paper_title": "cBrother: relaxing parental tree assumptions for Bayesian recombination detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000244259200020"}
