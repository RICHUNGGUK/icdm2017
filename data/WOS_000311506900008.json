The Cr1-xAlxC films exhibited some excellent characteristics, such as low friction coefficient, high hardness, and large contact angle. In this study, a GRNN model is applied for predicting the friction coefficient of Cr1-xAlxC films on high-speed steel substrates instead of complex practical experiments. The results exhibit good prediction accuracy of friction coefficient since about +/- 0.97% average errors and show the feasibility of the prediction model. Compared to the conventional back propagation model, the GRNN model is more suitable to predict the friction coefficient of Cr1-xAlxC films. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
