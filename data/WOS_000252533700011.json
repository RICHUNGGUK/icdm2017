The TWIN architecture possesses interesting properties, which may offer solutions for next-generation optical networks, Besides, better Quality of Service (QoS) could be achieved in TWIN by minimizing two parameters: queueing delay and delay variance. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the existing scheduling algorithms in TWIN ignored consideration of QoS and focused mainly on maximizing the throughput. In this paper, we formulate the scheduling problem into an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and propose a novel heuristic - Destination Slot Set (DSS) algorithm to solve it fast and efficiently. Besides, we derive an analytical model for TWIN and investigate the performance of DSS in it. By means of simulations, we demonstrate that our analytical model approximates the TWIN network very well; moreover, DSS incurs smaller queueing delay and delay variance, which ensures better QoS.
