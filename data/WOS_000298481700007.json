Specifically, in the LPA protocol, we propose a top-down security system: the top authority (TA) authorizes the roadside units (RSUs) to issue group certificates to the onboard units (OBUs). In addition, we also introduce RSU neighbor set to enhance security and efficiency. We demonstrate the merits of the proposed scheme through extensive analysis and performance evaluation.
