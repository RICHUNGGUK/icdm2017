A power-efficient, range-unlimited, and accuracy-enhanced CSADC, designed mainly with a new delay-interleaving and -recycling technique that mitigates operating frequency limitations while keeping overhead costs low, is proposed in this paper. Our preliminary research results prove the feasibility of the proposed technique and show that the operating frequency ranges from 110 MHz to 1.75 GHz, with the corrected duty cycle varying from 51.2% to 48.9% based on 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. Meanwhile, the lock-in time, static phase error, and power consumption are, respectively, 26 clock cycles, 4.2 ps, and 5.58 mW at 1.75 GHz.", "paper_title": "Range Unlimited Delay-Interleaving and -Recycling Clock Skew Compensation and Duty-Cycle Correction Circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000355212000006"}
