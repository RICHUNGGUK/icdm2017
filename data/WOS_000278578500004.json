A new concept of Clique is proposed in this paper. Based on that concept, a new distributed node scheduling algorithm is designed, which can allocate all nodes in the sensor network into k(k <= m) different groups {0.1,...,k-1} without requiring location information. At the same time, it can guarantee that each group will be still connected and maintain the coverage ratio as high as possible. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the newly proposed algorithm has better performance than previous randomized scheduling scheme proposed in Liu et al. (2006), and can prolong the lifetime of the sensor network effectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
