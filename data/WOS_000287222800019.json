The numerical results of a three-dimensional thin-shell model are compared with the measurements performed on a heating device at different working frequencies. Design/methodology/approach - A time-domain extension of the classical frequency-domain thin-shell approach is used for the finite-element analysis of a shielded pulse-current induction heater. The time-domain interface conditions at the shell surface are expressed in terms of the average flux density vector in the shell, as well as in terms of a limited number of higher-order components. Findings - A very good agreement between measurements and simulations is observed. A clear advantage of the proposed thin-shell approach is that the mesh of the computation domain does not depend on the working frequency anymore. It provides a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy. Indeed, adding a sufficient number of induction components, a very high accuracy can be achieved. Originality/value - The method is based on the coupling of a time-domain 1D thin-shell model with a magnetic vector potential formulation via the surface integral term. A limited number of additional unknowns for the magnetic flux density are incorporated on the shell boundary.", "paper_title": "Finite-element analysis of a shielded pulsed-current induction heater Experimental validation of a time-domain thin-shell approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000287222800019"}
