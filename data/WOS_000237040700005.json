This paper defines classes of interaction (sequential and multi-agent, direct and indirect) and environments (physical and virtual, persistent and amnesic, dynamic and static). These notions provide an underpinning for proper acknowledgement of the roles of MAS environments and for powerful MAS design techniques that use indirect interaction. We explore the limitations of MAS models that are restricted to message passing and suggest research directions for constructing more powerful models.", "paper_title": "Indirect interaction in environments for multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237040700005"}
