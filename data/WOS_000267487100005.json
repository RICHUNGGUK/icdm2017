Traditional cryptographic encryption can achieve provable security but is unfortunately sensitive to a single bit error, which will cause an unreliable packet to be dropped creating packet loss. In order to achieve robust media encryption, the requirement of error resilience can be achieved with error-resilient media transmission. This study proposes a video joint encryption and transmission (video JET) scheme by exploiting media hash-embedded residual data to achieve motion estimation and compensation for recovering lost packets, while maintaining format compliance and cryptographic provable security. Interestingly, since video block hash preserves the condensed content to facilitate search of similar blocks, motion estimation is implicitly performed through robust media hash matching - which is the unique characteristic of our method. We analyze and compare the performance of resilience to (bursty) packet loss between the proposed method and forward error correction (FEC), which has been extensively employed to protect video packets over error-prone networks. The feasibility of our packet loss-resilient video JET approach is further demonstrated through experimental results.", "paper_title": "Video JET: packet loss-resilient video joint encryption and transmission based on media-hash-embedded residual data", "paper_id": "WOS:000267487100005"}
