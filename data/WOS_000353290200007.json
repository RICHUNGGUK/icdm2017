These composites, generated from witness descriptions, are posted in public places and media with the hope that some viewers will provide tips about the identity of the suspect. This method of identifying suspects is slow, tedious, and may not lead to the timely apprehension of a suspect. Hence, there is a need for a method that can automatically and efficiently match facial composites to large police mugshot databases. Because of this requirement, facial composite recognition is an important topic for biometrics researchers. While substantial progress has been made in nonforensic facial composite (or viewed composite) recognition over the past decade, very little work has been done using operational composites relevant to law enforcement agencies. Furthermore, no facial composite to mugshot matching systems have been documented that are readily deployable as stand-alone software. Thus, the contributions of this paper include: 1) an exploration of composite recognition use cases involving multiple forms of facial composites; 2) the FaceSketchID System, a scalable, and operationally deployable software system that achieves state-of-the-art matching accuracy on facial composites using two algorithms (holistic and component based); and 3) a study of the effects of training data on algorithm performance. We present experimental results using a large mugshot gallery that is representative of a law enforcement agency's mugshot database. All results are compared against three state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf face recognition systems.", "paper_title": "The FaceSketchID System: Matching Facial Composites to Mugshots", "paper_id": "WOS:000353290200007"}
