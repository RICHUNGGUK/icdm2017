Many researchers search for parameter values from incomplete data using EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm. It is well-known that EM approach has a drawback-local optimal solution, so we propose a novel hybrid algorithm of the DPSO (Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization) and the EM approach to improve the global search performance. We then apply the approach to 4 real-world data sets from UCI repository and compare the performance of clustering by the new algorithm with by EM algorithm. In the comparison, the hybrid DPSO+EM algorithm exhibits more effectively and outperforms the EM approach.", "paper_title": "Discrete particle swarm optimization and EM hybrid approach for naive Bayes clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100127"}
