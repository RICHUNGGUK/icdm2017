After years of study, it remains challenging when there exists large irregularity and variations in the hand drawn sketch shapes. While most existing works exploit topology relations and graph representations for this problem, they are usually limited by the coarse topology exploration and heuristic (thus suboptimal) similarity metrics between graphs. We present a new sketch matching method with two novel contributions. We introduce a comprehensive definition of topology relations, which results in a rich and informative graph representation of sketches. For graph matching, we propose topology product graph that retains the full correspondence for matching two graphs. Based on it, we derive an intuitive sketch similarity metric whose exact solution is easy to compute. In addition, the graph representation and new metric naturally support partial matching, an important practical problem that received less attention in the literature. Extensive experimental results on a real challenging dataset and the superior performance of our method show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art.", "paper_title": "Sketch Matching on Topology Product Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000357591900015"}
