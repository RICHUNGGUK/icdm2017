It does not only save words of format but also accurately transfers semantic data between human users and the computers. Hence, the usefulness of resources in IOT system depends on whether the domain ontology can be constructed effectively and correctly. In this paper we propose an automated method to construct the IOT ontology. First, we explain the necessity of introducing ontology automatic construction in IOT system and summarize the major challenges in existing approaches. Secondly, we introduced the existing ontology construction methods and summarize their issues. Thirdly, we give a framework of our ontology construction and research the key algorithms in detail: (1) knowledge-tuple extraction algorithm which contains contextual information; (2) concept semantic similarity algorithm which is based on the structure of tuple; (3) knowledge-tuple extraction model which is based on the structured information. Then we build a prototype and evaluate the ontology. Finally, we make conclusions and suggest directions for future research.", "paper_title": "An Upper-Ontology-Based Approach for Automatic Construction of IOT Ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000334230800001"}
