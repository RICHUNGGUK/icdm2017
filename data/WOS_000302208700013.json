Ontology alignment is the task of identifying such equivalence relations between concepts across ontologies. Its application to the biomedical domain should address two open issues: (1) determining the equivalence of concept-pairs which have overlapping terms in their names, and (2) the high run-time required to align large ontologies which are typical in the biomedical domain. To address them, we present a novel approach, named the Biomedical Ontologies Alignment Technique (BOAT), which is state-of-the-art in terms of F-measure, precision and speed. A key feature of BOAT is that it considers the informativeness of each component word in the concept labels, which has significant impact on biomedical ontologies, resulting in a 12.2% increase in F-measure. Another important feature of BOAT is that it selects for comparison only concept pairs that show high likelihoods of equivalence, based on the similarity of their annotations. BOATs F-measure of 0.88 for the alignment of the mouse and human anatomy ontologies is on par with that of another state-of-the-art matcher, AgreementMaker, while taking a shorter time.
