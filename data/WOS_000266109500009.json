In a typical shotgun proteomics experiment, it is assumed that all proteins are equally likely to be present. However, there is often other information available, e. g. the probability of a protein's presence is likely to correlate with its mRNA concentration. Results: We develop a Bayesian score that estimates the posterior probability of a protein's presence in the sample given its identification in an MS/MS experiment and its mRNA concentration measured under similar experimental conditions. Our method, MSpresso, substantially increases the number of proteins identified in an MS/MS experiment at the same error rate, e. g. in yeast, MSpresso increases the number of proteins identified by similar to 40%. We apply MSpresso to data from different MS/MS instruments, experimental conditions and organisms ( Escherichia coli, human), and predict 19-63% more proteins across the different datasets. MSpresso demonstrates that incorporating prior knowledge of protein presence into shotgun proteomics experiments can substantially improve protein identification scores.", "paper_title": "Integrating shotgun proteomics and mRNA expression data to improve protein identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000266109500009"}
