In this respect the problem of defining a mapping associating a quantified facial attribute and the overall typical facial appearance is addressed. In particular the applicability of formulating a mapping function using neural network-based methods like Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Radial Basis Functions (RBFs), Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) and a latent variable method, the General Topographic Mapping (GTM) is investigated. Quantitative and visual results obtained during the experimental investigation, suggest that for one-to-many problems, where the entire variance of the distribution is not required, the RBFs are the best options when compared to MLPs, MDNs and GTM. The proposed techniques can be applied to applications involving face image synthesis and other applications that require one-to-many mapping transformations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
