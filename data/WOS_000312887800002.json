The dynamics of the system are modeled using measure-valued processes, to keep track of the residual service and patience times of each customer. Deterministic fluid models are established to provide a first-order approximation for this model. The fluid model solution, which is proved to uniquely exist, serves as the fluid limit of the many-server queue, as the number of servers becomes large. Based on the fluid model solution, first-order approximations for various performance quantities are proposed.", "paper_title": "Fluid models of many-server queues with abandonment", "paper_id": "WOS:000312887800002"}
