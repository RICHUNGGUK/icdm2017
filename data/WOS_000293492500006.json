This paper presents an extension to this algorithm for topology design of three-dimensional continuum structures. The topology and the shape of the design depend on an iterative algorithm, which continually adds and removes material depending on the shape and distribution of the contour isosurfaces for the required structural behaviour. In this study the von Mises stress was investigated. Several examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm, which produces final designs with very detailed surfaces without the need for interpretation. The results demonstrate how the ITD algorithm can produce realistic designs by using the design criteria contour isosurface. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
