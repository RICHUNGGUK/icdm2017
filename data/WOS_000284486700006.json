This entails a need for expressive, high-level languages for querying composite events. Emphasizing language design and formal semantics, we describe the rule-based composite event query language XChange(EQ). XChange(EQ) is designed to completely cover and integrate the four complementary querying dimensions: event data, event composition, temporal relationships, and event accumulation. Semantics are provided as a model theory with accompanying fixpoint theory, an approach that is established for rule languages but has not been applied to event queries so far. Because they are highly declarative, thus easy to understand and well suited for query optimization, such semantics are desirable for event queries.", "paper_title": "Rule-based composite event queries: the language XChange(EQ) and its semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000284486700006"}
