By designing some appropriate measurement bases, two separate parties can jointly prepare a three-qubit state for a remote receiver. The receiver may be assigned during the remote preparation progress. This scheme is extended to M > 2 senders for special two-qubit state. Our scheme succeeds with unit probability and is applicable to a certain realistic situation.", "paper_title": "FLEXIBLE DETERMINISTIC JOINT REMOTE STATE PREPARATION OF SOME STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000324407200009"}
