Whatever the goal (e.g., hiring, firing, promoting or funding), such analyses may inform research agencies on directions for funding policies. In this article, we perform a data-driven assessment of the performance of top Brazilian computer science researchers considering three central dimensions: career length, number of students mentored, and volume of publications and citations. In addition, we analyze the researchers' publishing strategy, based upon their area of expertise and their focus on venues of different impact. Our findings demonstrate that it is necessary to go beyond counting publications to assess research quality and show the importance of considering the peculiarities of different areas of expertise while carrying out such an assessment.", "paper_title": "Assessing the profile of top Brazilian computer science researchers", "paper_id": "WOS:000354489600006"}
