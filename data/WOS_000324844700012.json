Autonomous helicopter is a typical CPS application and its flight presents challenges in flight control system design with scalability. In this paper, we present the integration architecture of hardware and software for the flight control system based TREX 600 helicopter. In order to enhance scalability, the flight control system uses the PC104 and the ARM which is exerted to process the measurement data, including the position, attitude, height etc. The flight control is developed based multi-loop decoupling PI control which is easy to be implemented. Finally, the flight control system is successfully verified in the actual autonomous flight control experiment.", "paper_title": "Scalable Architecture for CPS: A Case Study of Small Autonomous Helicopter", "paper_id": "WOS:000324844700012"}
