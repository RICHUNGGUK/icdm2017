Unfortunately, few studies have proposed effective solutions for equipment shutdown planning in response to economic downturns. Taking into consideration the product mix, corresponding output target, excessive capacity, production performance impact and the variable cost savings, this paper presents a new mechanism for equipment shutdown planning using a developed integer programming model. The proposed mechanism effectively provides valuable recommendations for the managements of wafer fabs regarding the type and quantity of equipment to shut down.
