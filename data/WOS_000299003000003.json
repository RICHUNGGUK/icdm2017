The care of such patients requires the definition of specially tailored treatments and their delivery involves the coordination of a team of professionals from different institutions, requiring the management of many kinds of knowledge (medical, organizational, social and procedural). The K4Care project aims to assist the HC of elderly patients by proposing a standard HC model and implementing it in a knowledge-driven e-health platform aimed to support the provision of HC services. This paper focuses on two knowledge-based personalization aspects incorporated in the platform that aim to overcome the difficulties of HC delivery. The first one is the assistance to medical practitioners in the process of defining a customized treatment adjusted to the medical and social conditions of a particular patient in order to consider multiple co-morbidities. The second one is the possibility of tailoring the profiles of the care professionals according to the medical and organizational daily requirements in order to allow a flexible care delivery. Those two aspects, guided by the knowledge explicitly represented in the platform, play a crucial role in the medical and social acceptance of this kind of e-health systems. The paper also includes a real case study designed and tested by healthcare professionals and includes encouraging results from the test of the platform in a real health care environment in the city of Pollenza (Italy).", "paper_title": "Knowledge-driven delivery of home care services", "paper_id": "WOS:000299003000003"}
