This phenomenon is even serious in some situation which brings a big challenge to the applications of sensor data. However, the traditional data estimation methods can not be directly used in wireless sensor network and existing estimation algorithms fail to provide a satisfactory accuracy or have high complexity. To address this problem, Temporal and Spatial Correlation Algorithm (TSCA) is proposed to estimate missing data as accurately as possible in this paper. Firstly, it saves all the data sensed at the same time as a time series, and the most relevant series are selected as the analysis sample, which improves efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm significantly. Secondly, it estimates missing values from temporal and spatial dimensions. Different weights are assigned to these two dimensions. Thirdly, there are two strategies to deal with severe data loss, which improves the applicability of the algorithm. Simulation results on different sensor datasets verify that the proposed approach outperforms existing solutions in terms of estimation accuracy.", "paper_title": "A Missing Sensor Data Estimation Algorithm Based on Temporal and Spatial Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000364681000001"}
