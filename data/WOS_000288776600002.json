The first variant is simple while the other is enhanced, as it implements additional operators. The algorithms are utilized for the identification of a Bouc-Wen hysteretic system that represents a full scale bolted-welded steel connection. The purpose of this work is to assess their comparative performance against other evolutionary algorithms in a highly non-linear identification problem on various levels of computational budget. The enhanced PSO algorithm outperforms its competitors in terms of both accuracy and robustness. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
