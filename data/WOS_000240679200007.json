A geographic information systems workflow approach can use semantic and syntactic service descriptions to form service chains that can integrate service discovery, composition, and reuse. Service chaining links remote geographic services to help expert users form complex geoprocessing services and perform timely analysis of geodata. This method facilitates the use of XML-based service description languages to build a geoservice-reuse architecture based on common ontologies and shared service descriptions.", "paper_title": "Integrating semantic and syntactic descriptions to chain geographic services", "paper_id": "WOS:000240679200007"}
