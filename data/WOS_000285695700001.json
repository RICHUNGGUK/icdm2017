In this article we consider the implications of group deployment for the connectivity and resilience of a key predistribution scheme. We propose a flexible scheme, based on the structure of a resolvable transversal design. We demonstrate that this scheme permits effective trade-offs between resilience, connectivity and storage requirements within a group-deployed environment as compared with other schemes in the literature, and show that group deployment can be used to increase network connectivity, without increasing storage requirements or sacrificing resilience.", "paper_title": "Key Predistribution for Homogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks with Group Deployment of Nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000285695700001"}
