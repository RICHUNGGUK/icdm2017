Existing methods are mainly focus on the process of linearization. However, in this process, precision decreasing is obviously unavoidable and even filter divergence will be occur so as to losing the target. Therefore a new algorithm is proposed in the paper. The state of the target is approximately estimated by least squares at first which is taken as pseudo measurements for kalman filter, and then IMM algorithm is employed for maneuvering target tracking.", "paper_title": "Least squares interacting multiple model algorithm for passive multi-sensor maneuvering target tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600066"}
