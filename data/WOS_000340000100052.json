In conventional research on acoustic levitation, small objects are trapped in the acoustic beams of standing waves. We expand this method by changing the distribution of the acoustic-potential field (APF). Using this technique, we can generate the graphics using levitated small objects. Our approach makes available many expressions, such as the expression by materials and non-digital appearance. These kinds of expressions are used in many applications, and we aim to combine them with digital controllability. In the current system, multiple particles are levitated together at 4.25-mm intervals. The spatial resolution of the position is 0.5 mm. Particles move at up to 72 cm/s. The allowable density of the material can be up to 7 g/cm(3). For this study, we use three options of APF: 2D grid, high-speed movement, and combination with motion capture. These are used to realize floating screen or mid-air raster graphics, mid-air vector graphics, and interaction with levitated objects. This paper reports the details of the acoustic-potential field generator on the design, control, performance evaluation, and exploration of the application space. To discuss the various noncontact manipulation technologies in a unified manner, we introduce a concept called \"computational potential field\" (CPF).", "paper_title": "Pixie Dust: Graphics Generated by Levitated and Animated Objects in Computational Acoustic-Potential Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000340000100052"}
