A new discrete-time multi-agent consensus model is considered in which each agent can only receive the delayed quantized information from its neighbors. In the presence of quantization and communication delays, it is shown that the multi-agent network can achieve consensus under the connectivity network topology. Simulation examples are also provided to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Discrete-time multi-agent consensus with quantization and communication delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000332204100007"}
