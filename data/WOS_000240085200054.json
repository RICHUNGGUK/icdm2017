In this paper, a combination of ontology with statistical method is presented for linguistic knowledge representation and acquisition from training data. In this study, linguistic knowledge representaiton is firstly defined using ontology theory, and then, linguistical knowledge is automatically acquired by statistical method. In document processing, the semantic evaluation value of the document can be get by linguistic knowledge. The experimention in Chinese information retrieval and text classification shows the proposed method improves the precision of nature language processing.", "paper_title": "Linguistic knowledge representation and automatic acquisition based on a combination of ontology with statistical method", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200054"}
