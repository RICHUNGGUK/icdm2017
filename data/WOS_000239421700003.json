We present our algorithm for finding all such co-reference sets in a large corpus. Our algorithm involves three steps: morphological similarity detection, contextual similarity analysis, and clustering. Finally, we present experimental results on over large corpus of real news text to analyze the performance our techniques.", "paper_title": "Identifying co-referential names across large corpora", "paper_id": "WOS:000239421700003"}
