To this aim, a contour data structure for representing visual hull, which is different from that for CT/MRI, is introduced. In this paper, we (1) solve the \"branching structure\" problem by introducing some additional \"directed edge\", and (2) extract a triangle/quadrangle closed mesh from the contour structure with an algorithm based on dynamic programming. Both theoretical demonstration and real world results show that our proposed method has sufficient robustness with respect to the complex topology of the object, and the extracted mesh is of high quality.", "paper_title": "Extracting surface representations from rim curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200073"}
