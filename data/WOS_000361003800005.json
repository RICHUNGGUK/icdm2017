This paper presents a new approach of hybrid auditory feedback, which converts frequently used speech instructions to non-speech (i.e., spearcons), based on users' travelled frequency and sound repetition. Using a within-subject design, twelve participants (i.e., blind people) carried out a task, using a mobility assistant application in an indoor environment. As surfaced from the study results, the hybrid auditory feedback approach is more effective than non-speech and it is pleasant compared with repetitive speech-only. In addition, it can substantially improve user experience. Finally, these findings may help researchers and practitioners use hybrid auditory feedback, rather than using speech- or non-speech-only, when designing or creating accessibility/assistive products and systems.", "paper_title": "Right mix of speech and non-speech: hybrid auditory feedback in mobility assistance of the visually impaired", "paper_id": "WOS:000361003800005"}
