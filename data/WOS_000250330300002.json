Instead of selecting better paths in the same overlay, IOO constructs efficient paths using peers in different overlays so as to 1) improve global resource utilization of peer-to-peer ( P2P) streaming networks, 2) assign resources based on their locality and delay, 3) guarantee streaming service quality by using the nearest peers, even when such peers might belong to different overlays, and 4) balance the load among the group (streaming overlay) members. We compare the performance of IOO with existing approaches through trace-driven simulations. Results show that IOO outperforms previous schemes in terms of resource utilization and the quality of service (QoS) of streaming services. The IOO scheme has been implemented in an Internet-based live streaming system, called AnySee. AnySee was successfully released in the summer of 2004 in the China Educational Research Network (CERNET). More than 60,000 users enjoy massive entertainment programs, including TV programs, movies, and academic conferences videos.", "paper_title": "Scalable live streaming service based on interoverlay optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000250330300002"}
