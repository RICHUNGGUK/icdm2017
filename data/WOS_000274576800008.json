The original energy-based finite element was put into the known standard framework of classes and handled in a different manner. The nonlinear properties of material are defined with a modified strain energy density function. The local relaxation procedure proposed as a method used to resolve a nonlinear problem is implemented in C++ language. The hexahedral element with eight nodes as well as the adaptation of the nonlinear finite element is introduced. The chosen numerical model is made of nearly incompressible hyperelastic material. The application of the proposed element is shown on the example of a rectangular parallelepiped with a hollow port. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
