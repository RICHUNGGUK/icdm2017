However, additional performance issues should be faced to deploy a painless catalog service. With this aim, we present a decentralized LFC server configuration, and its performance evaluation compared with the traditional LFC deployment. A performance analysis is shown, including not only the catalog server, but also analysing the client side overhead. We find that the LFC service has in the clients a relevant workload of the overall service. The experimental results show that the proposed LFC deployment for servers and clients, improves the performance of the service.", "paper_title": "A Decentralized Deployment Strategy and Performance Evaluation of LCG File Catalog Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000293973700004"}
