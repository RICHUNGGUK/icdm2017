However, the average user is not aware that his actions leave traces which might cause privacy risks. Within this paper, we discuss the need for privacy-enhancing application design considering eLearning as example. eLearning is an application area that comprises many use cases which are common in the digital world. Since an eLearning application aims at assisting users, they cannot act in full anonymity. We discuss a possible solution which uses privacy-enhancing identity management (PIM) in order to provide as much anonymity as possible while still enabling assistance.", "paper_title": "Towards privacy-aware eLearning", "paper_id": "WOS:000239416100011"}
