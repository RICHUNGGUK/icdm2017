However, already known fault tolerance mechanisms often bring new internal faults (e.g. out-of-power faults and collisions on wireless bandwidth) to the original network and dissipate lots of extra energy and time to reduce data loss. Therefore, we propose a novel Dual Cluster Heads Cooperation (CoDuch) scheme to tolerate external faults while introducing less internal faults and dissipating less extra energy and time. In CoDuch scheme, dual cluster heads cooperate with each other to reduce extra costs by sending only one copy of sensed data to the Base Station; also, dual cluster heads check errors with each other during the collecting data process. Two algorithms are developed based on the CoDuch scheme: CoDuch-l for tolerating link faults and CoDuch-b for tolerating both link faults and node faults; theory and experimental study validate their effectiveness and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Fault Tolerance in Data Gathering Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292127900012"}
