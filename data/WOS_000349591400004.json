This problem follows to optimize the reliability of a system containing s sub-systems under different constraints, including cost, weight, and volume restrictions using redundant components for each sub-system. Various solving methodologies have been used to optimize this problem, including exact, heuristic, and meta-heuristic algorithms. In this paper, an efficient multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing (SA) is developed to solve multi-objective RAP (MORAP). This algorithm is knowledge-based archive multi-objective simulated annealing (KBAMOSA). KBAMOSA applies a memory matrix to reinforce the neighborhood structure to achieve better quality solutions. The results analysis and comparisons demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm for solving MORAP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
