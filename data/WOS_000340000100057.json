Creating such art from scratch using conventional software is time consuming for experts and daunting for novices. We introduce DecoBrush, a data-driven drawing system that generalizes the conventional digital \"painting\" concept beyond the scope of natural media to allow synthesis of structured decorative patterns following user-sketched paths. The user simply selects an example library and draws the overall shape of a pattern. DecoBrush then synthesizes a shape in the style of the exemplars but roughly matching the overall shape. If the designer wishes to alter the result, DecoBrush also supports user-guided refinement via simple drawing and erasing tools. For a variety of example styles, we demonstrate high-quality user-constrained synthesized patterns that visually resemble the exemplars while exhibiting plausible structural variations.", "paper_title": "DecoBrush: Drawing Structured Decorative Patterns by Example", "paper_id": "WOS:000340000100057"}
