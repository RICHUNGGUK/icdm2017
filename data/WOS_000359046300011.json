The aim is to identify the system instabilities not predicted using the existent analysis and design methods based on the simplified average model approach. Design/methodology/approach - This paper starts by investigating the performance of three commonly used PLL schemes: the inverse park-PLL, the second-order generalised integrators (SOGI)-frequency-locked loop and the enhanced-PLL, designed using the simplified average model and will show that following this approach, there is a mismatch between their actual and desired transient performance. A new PLL design method is then proposed based on the DPM approach that allows the development of fourth-order DPM models. The small-signal eigenvalues analysis of the fourth-order DPM models is used to determine the control gains and the stability limits. Findings - The DPM approach is proven to be useful for single-phase PLLs stability analysis and control parameters design. It has been successfully used to design the control parameters and to predict the PLL stability limits, which have been validated via simulation and experimental tests consisting of grid voltage sag, phase jump and frequency step change. Originality/value - This paper has introduced the use of DPM approach for the purpose of single-phase PLL stability analysis and control design. The approach has enabled accurate control gains design and stability limits identification of single-phase PLLs.", "paper_title": "Dynamic phasor analysis and design of phase-locked loops for single phase grid connected converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000359046300011"}
