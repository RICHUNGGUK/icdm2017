People expect that robots will take on tasks to simplify our lives, by working with humans just as other humans do, in normal organizations and societies. This labor specialization, by ubiquitous robots, allows humans more comfort, time or focus to concentrate on higher level desires or tasks. To further this unification of relationships, the defined line between humans and other robots must become somewhat indistinguishable. This ever increasing degree of indistinguishability provides that we care less about who or what executes a task or solves a goal, as long as that entity is capable and available. In this paper, we propose a model and a simple example implementation which minimizes the strict line between humans, software agents, robots, machines and sensors (HARMS) and reduces the distinguishability between these actors.
