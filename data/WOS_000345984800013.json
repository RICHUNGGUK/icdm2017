Specifically, balancing the energy consumption among sensors can prevent losing some critical sensors prematurely due to energy exhaustion so that the WSN's coverage can be maintained. However, the heterogeneous hostile operating conditionsdifferent transmission distances, varying fading environments, and distinct residual energy levelshave made energy balancing a highly challenging task. A key issue in energy balancing is to maintain a certain level of energy fairness in the whole WSN. To achieve energy fairness, the transmission load should be allocated among sensors such that, regardless of a sensor's working conditions, no sensor node should be unfairly overburdened. In this paper, we model the transmission load assignment in WSN as a game. With our novel utility function that can capture realistic sensors' behaviors, we have derived the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the energy balancing game. Most importantly, under the NE, while each sensor can maximize its own payoff, the global objective of energy balancing can also be achieved. Moreover, by incorporating a penalty mechanism, the delivery rate and delay constraints imposed by the WSN application can be satisfied. Through extensive simulations, our game theoretic approach is shown to be effective in that adequate energy balancing is achieved and, consequently, network lifetime is significantly enhanced.
