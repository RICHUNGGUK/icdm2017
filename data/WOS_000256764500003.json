Algorithms for computing the Tukey depth of a point in various dimensions are considered. The running times of these algorithms depend on the value of the output, making them suited to situations, such as outlier removal, where the value of the output is typically small.", "paper_title": "Output-sensitive algorithms for Tukey depth and related problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256764500003"}
