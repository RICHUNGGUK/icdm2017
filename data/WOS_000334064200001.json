However, measuring a user's cognitive load robustly, in real-time is not a trivial task. Many research studies have attempted to assess users' cognitive load using different measurements, but these are often unsuitable for deployment in real-life applications due to high intrusiveness. Relatively novel linguistic behavioral features as potential indices of user's cognitive load is proposed. These features may be collected implicitly and nonintrusively supporting real-time assessment of users' cognitive load and accordingly allowing adaptive usability evaluation and interaction. Results from a laboratory experiment show significantly different linguistic patterns under different task complexities and cognitive load levels. Implications of the research for adaptive interaction are also discussed, that is, how the cognitive load measurement-based approach could be used for user interface evaluation and interaction design improvement.", "paper_title": "Measuring Cognitive Load Using Linguistic Features: Implications for Usability Evaluation and Adaptive Interaction Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000334064200001"}
