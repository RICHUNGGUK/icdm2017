For context-free grammars, a similar property does not hold (S.A. Greibach et al. (1992)[3]). If it is furthermore required that each rule A -> w has a nonempty w, then a substantial subfamily of conjunctive languages can be generated, yet it remains unknown whether such grammars are as powerful as conjunctive grammars of the general form.
