A major challenge in constructing dense sensor networks is to prolong network lifetime as well as to keep sensing coverage loss ratio low. To prolong network lifetime, it is necessary to turn off redundant nodes to save energy. Moreover, obtaining low sensing coverage loss ratio is an important issue in dense sensor networks. We propose a cluster-based algorithm that can present a flexible, adjustable and energy-efficient scheme to identify redundant nodes for different requirements of network lifetime and low sensing coverage loss ratio. This algorithm needs additional GPS and directional antennas support to identify redundant nodes. Our simulation results show that the cluster-based algorithm could save energy consumption in the process of determining redundant nodes for prolonging network lifetime and could achieve low sensing coverage loss ratio.", "paper_title": "A cluster-based algorithm for redundant nodes discovery in dense sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000293724500007"}
