However software reuse has been proven challenging for most organizations. The challenges involve both organizational and technical issues. In this work we concentrate on the technical issues and we propose a new metric facilitating the reuse of object-oriented software based on the popular Chidamber and Kemerer suite for object-oriented design. We derive this new metric using linear regression on a number of OSS java projects. We compare and contrast this new metric with three other metrics proposed in the literature. The purpose of the proposed metric is to assist a software developer during the development of a software system in achieving reusability of classes considered important for future reuse and also in providing assistance during re-architecting and componentization activities of existing systems.
