The conductivity model is derived from artificial bulk and shear viscosities, such that stagnation enthalpy remains constant across shocks. By thus fixing the Prandtl number, more physical shock profiles are obtained, only on a larger scale. The conductivity model does not contain any empirical constants. It increases the net dissipation of a computational algorithm but is found to better preserve symmetry and produce more robust solutions for strong-shock problems. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
