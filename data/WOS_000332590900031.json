The aim of this work is to develop a new recommendation method that effectively adapts and immediately responds to the user's preference. To this end, content-based filtering is judiciously utilized in conjunction with interactive evolutionary computation (IEC). Specifically, a fitness-based truncation selection and a feature-wise crossover are devised to make full use of desirable properties of promising items within the IEC framework. Moreover, to efficiently search for proper items; the content-based filtering is modified in cooperation with data grouping. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, compared with existing methods.", "paper_title": "A New Evolutionary Approach to Recommender Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000332590900031"}
