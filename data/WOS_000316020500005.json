However, the large size of data obtained from database activity monitoring has presented a significant barrier to effective monitoring and analysis of database activities. In this paper, we present database activity monitoring by means of a density-based outlier detection method and a commercial database activity monitoring solution. In order to provide efficient computing of outlier detection, we exploited a kd-tree index and an Approximated k-nearest neighbors (ANN) search method. By these means, the outlier computation time could be significantly reduced. The proposed methodology was successfully applied to a very large log dataset collected from the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI). The results showed that the proposed method can effectively detect outliers of database activities in a shorter computation time.", "paper_title": "Application of density-based outlier detection to database activity monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000316020500005"}
