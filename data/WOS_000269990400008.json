These topology optimization methods generally cannot control the maximum stress levels of the structure; therefore, the smoothened optimum structure is not guaranteed to be ready for immediate use. This can be because it is either unsafe if the maximum stress at this structure exceeds the strength limit, or over designed if the maximum stress is far below the stress limit. Difficult and complex shape optimization must then be done to obtain a minimum-weight structure that meets the maximum stress constraint. This paper proposes an adaptive volume constraint (AVC) algorithm, a heuristic approach, in place of traditional topology optimization methods so that the maximum stress in the optimal structural configuration will be below the predefined stress limit and the smoothened structure will be directly applicable. In order to test the applicability and robustness of the AVC algorithm, topology optimization using both a traditional fixed volume constraint and an AVC are tested on a number of configuration design problems. To further illustrate the usefulness of the AVC algorithm, shape optimizations at the maximum stress constraint are also conducted on the smooth structural models by both optimization approaches on an identical problem set.
