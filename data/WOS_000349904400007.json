The method of applying wavelets, which has already been done, to estimate parameters in univariate stable laws, has been extended to multivariate stable laws. The proposed estimating method is based on a nonlinear regression model on wavelet coefficients of characteristic functions. In particular, two parametric sub-classes of stable laws are considered: the class of multivariate stable laws with discrete spectral measure, and sub-Gaussian laws. Using a simulation study, the proposed method has been compared with well-known estimation procedures.", "paper_title": "Wavelet-based estimation for multivariate stable laws", "paper_id": "WOS:000349904400007"}
