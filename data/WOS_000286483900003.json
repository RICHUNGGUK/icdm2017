And the minimum-weighted connected dominating set (MWCDS) problem is to find a MWDS such that the graph induced by this subset is connected. In this paper, we study these two problems on a unit disk graph. A (4 +epsilon)-approximation algorithm for an MWDS based on a dynamic programming algorithm for a Min-Weight Chromatic Disk Cover is presented. Meanwhile, we also propose a (1 +epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the connecting part by showing a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a Node-Weighted Steiner Tree problem when the given terminal set is c-local and thus obtain a (5 +epsilon)-approximation algorithm for an MWCDS.
