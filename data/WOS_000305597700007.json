Correct implantation requires the proper selection of size and shape among the implant structures. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing a Web-based decision making system that enables the selection of a suitable type of abutment by taking into account the patient's anatomical data and preferences that are based on an expert's knowledge and experience for those patients. After the classification of the types of abutment that can be connected to fixtures of implants, we built a knowledge base and case base library according to the characteristics of osseous tissue and teeth shape to select optimal abutment. Moreover, we introduce a fuzzy cognitive map that takes into consideration expert's knowledge for factors that affect implantation. After the determination of the cause-and-effect relationship among the concepts of the fuzzy cognitive map, an osseointegration factor with the highest conceptual concentration weight is inferred from the decision making system. In addition, the selection process for abutment is expressed as a decision making tree and then, it is applied for the rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning. The optimized selection result is finally extracted based on the fuzzy membership function using fuzzy inference. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
