In this paper, we first introduce two notions of lattice implication n-ordered semigroup, and lattice implication p-ordered semigroup, which induced by lattice implication algebras. Secondly, we study some of their basic properties and prove that a lattice implication n-ordered semigroup is a residuated semigroup, and a lattice implication p-ordered semigroup is an arithmetic lattice ordered semigroup. We also define the homomorphism mapping between lattice implication n-ordered semigroups. Finally, we discuss some properties of filters and sl ideals in lattice implication n-ordered semigroups and lattice implication p-ordered semigroups. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
