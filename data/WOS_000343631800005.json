Employing the fragment molecular orbital method for quantum-chemical calculations, the differences in magnitude and pattern of the interactions between the amino acid residues of avian-type (H7N3) or human-type (H7N9) HA and each saccharide part of avian or human receptor were studied in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of avian-to-human infectious transmission of influenza virus. We have thus confirmed quantitatively that the mutations from the avian HA to the human HA significantly strengthened the binding affinity of human HA to human receptor, while retaining the affinity to avian receptor. In addition to direct effects regarding the changes of interactions between the altered residues and the receptors, we have also found the importance of indirect effects in which structural changes caused by the mutations play vital roles to modify the intermolecular interactions.
