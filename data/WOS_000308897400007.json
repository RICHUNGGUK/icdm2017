Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents an analysis of tweets produced between August and October 2010 by three political leaders, using statistical descriptive analysis and content analysis. Findings - The research shows that the US President tweets more than the other leaders, with the British Prime Minister tweeting the least, and that all three leaders use Twitter for both transparency and outreach. Originality/value - As Twitter has become widespread over the last few years, and several studies have focused on Twitter and its impact on different sectors in our society, it is interesting to focus on political leaders use of Twitter.", "paper_title": "Twitter use by three political leaders: an exploratory analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000308897400007"}
