In this article, we aim at learning an unbiased stochastic edit distance in the form of a finite-state transducer from a corpus of (input, output) pairs of strings. Contrary to the other standard methods, which generally use the Expectation Maximisation algorithm, our algorithm learns a transducer independently on the marginal probability distribution of the input strings. Such an unbiased way to proceed requires to optimise the parameters of a conditional transducer instead of a joint one. We apply our new model in the context of handwritten digit recognition. We show, carrying out a large series of experiments, that it always outperforms the standard edit distance. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
