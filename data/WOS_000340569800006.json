This paper compares diffusion of the research supported by a unique U.S. National Science Foundation program on Human and Social Dynamics (\"HSD\") with a matched group of heavily cited papers. We offer a measure of the distance of cites between the Web of Science Category (\"WoSC\") in which a publication appears and the WoSC of the journal citing it, and find that HSD publications are cited more distantly than are comparison publications. We provide another measure-citation velocity-finding that HSD publications are cited with similar lag times as are the comparison papers. These basic citation distance and velocity measures enrich analyses of research knowledge diffusion patterns.", "paper_title": "Distance and velocity measures: using citations to determine breadth and speed of research impact", "paper_id": "WOS:000340569800006"}
