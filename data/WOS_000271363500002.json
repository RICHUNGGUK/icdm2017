The benefit of PDE-based regularization methods lies in the ability to smooth data in a nonlinear way, allowing the preservation of important image features (contours, corners or other discontinuities). In this article, a selective diffusion approach based on the framework of Extreme Physical Information theory is presented. It is shown that this particular framework leads to a particular regularization PDE which makes the integration of prior knowledge possible within the diffusion scheme. As a proof of feasibility, results of oriented pattern extractions are first presented on ad hoc images and second on a particular medical application: Tagged cardiac MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) enhancement.
