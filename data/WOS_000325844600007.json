Although the majority of neurons form during the embryonic period, neurogenesis continues in restricted regions of the mammalian brain well into adulthood. In rodent brains, neuronal migration is present in the rostral migratory stream (RMS), connecting the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb (OB). The migration in the RMS is characterised by a lack of dispersion of neuroblasts into the surrounding tissues and a highly directed motion towards the OB. This study uses a simple mathematical model to investigate several theories of migration of neuroblasts through the RMS proposed in the literature, including chemo-attraction, chemorepulsion, general inhibition and the presence of a migration-inducing protein. Apart from the general inhibition model, all the models were able to provide results in good qualitative correspondence with the experimental observations.", "paper_title": "Mechanisms of cell migration in the adult brain: modelling subventricular neurogenesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000325844600007"}
