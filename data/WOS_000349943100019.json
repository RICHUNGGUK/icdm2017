In this work we present DOCKTITE, a highly versatile workflow for covalent docking in the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) combining automated warhead screening, nucleophilic side chain attachment, pharmacophore-based docking, and a novel consensus scoring approach. The comprehensive validation study includes pose predictions of 35 protein/ligand complexes which resulted in a mean RMSD of 1.74 angstrom and a prediction rate of 71.4% with an RMSD below 2 angstrom, a virtual screening with an area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of 0.81, and a significant correlation between predicted and experimental binding affinities (rho = 0.806, R-2 = 0.649, p < 0.005).", "paper_title": "DOCKTITE-A Highly Versatile Step-by-Step Workflow for Covalent Docking and Virtual Screening in the Molecular Operating Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000349943100019"}
