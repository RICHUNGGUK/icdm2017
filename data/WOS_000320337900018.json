One of the proposed antenna arrays uses a single laminate layer with a ground plane on one side and radiating elements on the other side, the other one is a double layer structure, where the radiating elements with beam-forming network are placed on the top layer and are fed with the use of the slot coupler. The application of U-slot radiating elements with enlarged inner parasitic patch allows us to achieve reflection coefficient better than 10 dB within the assumed bandwidth of currently developed FMCW radars, which is 23-25 GHz frequency range. The theoretical analysis as well as experimental results of the manufactured 2 x 4 antenna arrays is shown. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
