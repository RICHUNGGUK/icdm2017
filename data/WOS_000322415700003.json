An adaptive domain ontology can satisfy the future requirements of users and promote use value. In developing the system, a domain ontology adaptation model is first designed. Based on the designed adaptation model, a methodology for domain ontology adaptation is developed. Subsequently, a domain ontology adaptation system is implemented with an illustrative example of securities trading. Finally, a system evaluation for user satisfaction and a methodology evaluation are conducted to demonstrate that the developed methodology and system worked efficiently. The results of this research facilitate personalized knowledge search and recommendation. They also promote the accuracy of domain ontology to satisfy the domain knowledge requirements of users, consequently boosting the use value of domain ontology. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
