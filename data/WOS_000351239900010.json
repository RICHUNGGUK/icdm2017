Fine grain performance analysis has not, to our knowledge, received adequate attention thus far. To address this issue we evaluate the thermal comfort and the energy efficiency of a relatively modern HVAC system in a large building based on building-wide high-fidelity environmental data collected via a wireless sensor network over 12 months. Access to fine grain information reveals temporal and spatial dynamics that help quantify the level of (non-) compliance with the system's control objective and the building's thermal comfort standards: we find overconditioning at multiple time scales which offers opportunities for reduced operating cost, and identify building anomalies and ill-conditioned rooms that need maintenance. The paper moreover describes ThermoNet, our hybrid wireless sensor network solution for monitoring a legacy building, which uses duty cycling and adaptive power control to achieve high data yield with low power consumption.", "paper_title": "ThermoNet: fine-grain assessment of building comfort and efficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000351239900010"}
