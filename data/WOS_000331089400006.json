Nowadays, volumes of heterogeneous raw data are continuously generated and captured by trillions of smart devices like sensors, smart controls, readers and other monitoring devices, while various events occur in the physical world. It is hard for users including people and smart things to master valuable information hidden in the massive data, which is more useful and understandable than raw data for users to get the crucial points for problems-solving. Thus, how to automatically and actively extract the knowledge of events and their internal links from the big data is one key challenge for the future Web of Things. This paper proposes an effective approach to extract events and their internal links from large scale data leveraging predefined event schemas in the Web of Things, which starts with grasping the critical data for useful events by filtering data with well-defined event types in the schema. A case study in the context of smart campus is presented to show the application of proposed approach for the extraction of events and their internal semantic links.", "paper_title": "Constructing the Web of Events from raw data in the Web of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000331089400006"}
