The individual processes of these service-disruptive effects are modeled as Markov chains based on cross-layer information locally available at the network nodes. A queuing analysis is conducted and various performance measures are derived regarding the packet loss, throughput, spectral efficiency, and packet delay distribution. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of various system parameters on the system performance, providing insights for cross-layer design and autonomous decision making in decentralized cognitive radio networks.", "paper_title": "Multi-parameter performance analysis for decentralized cognitive radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000334490400018"}
