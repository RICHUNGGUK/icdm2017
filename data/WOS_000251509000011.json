Range arcs combine (and subsume) the distinctive features of inhibitor and activator arcs, and each such arc provides a means of specifying a range (a finite or infinite interval of non-negative integers) for the number of tokens in a place which makes enabling of a given transition possible. We demonstrate that the existing treatment of causality developed for Petri nets with inhibitor arcs based on structures generalising partial orders can also be applied to nets with range arcs.", "paper_title": "Processes of Petri nets with range testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000251509000011"}
