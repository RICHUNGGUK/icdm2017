To discuss such a situation, replicator dynamics for multi-population hypergames has been proposed. However, it is assumed that players' perceptions are given and fixed. In this paper, we consider that each population has various interpretation functions and choose one of them depending on payoffs, and we propose a hybrid system representation of replicator dynamics with changes of interpretation functions. Moreover, we apply our proposed model to a well-known example of a hypergame \"Soccer Hooliganism\" and show that behaviors converging to heteroclinic orbits can appear by the changes of the interpretation functions.", "paper_title": "Multi-population replicator dynamics with changes of interpretations of strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800036"}
