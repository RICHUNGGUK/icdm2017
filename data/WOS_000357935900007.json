First, the control algorithm with absolute damping and communication delay is proposed to achieve the formation control. Then, some sufficient conditions are derived by using the matrix theory, graph theory and the frequency-domain analysis method. Finally, based on the numerical method of predictor-corrector, several simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Distributed formation control of fractional-order multi-agent systems with absolute damping and communication delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000357935900007"}
