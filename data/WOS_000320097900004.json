Three major factors which may affect system stability and stabilisation are concerned: wireless network-induced delays, nonlinearity and model mismatch. First the network-induced delays are characterised by an inverse Gaussian distribution model according to IEEE 802.11b protocol and a model-based compensation method is used to estimate the delayed samples. Then an inverse function of nonlinear part of the identified model is used to attenuate the influence of nonlinearity, while the model mismatch is regarded as disturbance which is then dealt with by H control approach. A sufficient condition for mean-square asymptotic stability is obtained and expressed by a set of linear matrix inequalities, enabling direct controller design. Finally, numerical simulation examples are used to confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Identification and control of Hammerstein systems via wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320097900004"}
