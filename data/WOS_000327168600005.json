This paper proposes a trustworthiness verification and audit mechanism on cloud providers called T-YUN. It introduces a trusted third party to cyclically attest the remote clouds, which are instrumented with the trusted chain covering the whole architecture stack. According to the main operations of the clouds, remote verification protocols are also proposed in T-YUN, with a dedicated key management scheme. This paper also implements a proof-of-concept emulator to validate the effectiveness and performance overhead of T-YUN. The experimental results show that T-YUN is effective and the extra overhead incurred by it is acceptable.", "paper_title": "T-YUN: Trustworthiness Verification and Audit on the Cloud Providers", "paper_id": "WOS:000327168600005"}
