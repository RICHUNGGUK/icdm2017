Due to the high dimensional property of kinetic models, numerical algorithms based on unstructured meshes are not really appropriate since most of numerical methods (semi-Lagrangian, spectral methods) are particularly efficient on structured grids. Here we propose to adapt the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure, which has been recently introduced for conservation laws [21], for kinetic equations. Numerical simulations in 1D x 3D and 2D x 3D based on this approach are proposed for Boltzmann type operators (BGK, ES-BGK models). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
