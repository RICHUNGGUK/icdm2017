Our concepts utilize the phenomenon that the frequency of soliton trains in BEC can be governed by changing interactions within the atom cloud F. Pinsker, N. G. Berloff and V. M. Perez-Garcia, Phys. Rev. A 87, 053624 (2013), arXiv:1305.4097]. We use this property to store numbers in terms of those frequencies for a short time until observation. The properties of soliton trains can be changed in an intended way by other components of BEC occupying comparable states or via phase engineering. We elucidate, in which sense, such an additional degree of freedom can be regarded as a tool for controlled manipulation of data. Finally, the outcome of any manipulation made is read out by observing the signature within the density profile.", "paper_title": "Optical computing with soliton trains in Bose-Einstein condensates", "paper_id": "WOS:000353905500011"}
