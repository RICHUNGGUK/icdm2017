Although this work focuses primarily on shape retrieval, our approach is, however, fairly general and can be used to address other 3D shape analysis problems. In a bid to capture the global and local geometry of 3D shapes, we propose a multiresolution signature via a cubic spline wavelet generating kernel. The parameters of the proposed signature can be easily determined as a trade-off between effectiveness and compactness. Experimental results on two standard 3D shape benchmarks demonstrate the much better performance of the proposed shape retrieval approach in comparison with three state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our approach yields a higher retrieval accuracy when used in conjunction with the intrinsic spatial partition matching.", "paper_title": "A multiresolution descriptor for deformable 3D shape retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000319478400006"}
