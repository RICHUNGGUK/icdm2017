By means of Artificial Intelligence, the system is capable of assessing, diagnosing and suggesting the best operation mode. One important Artificial Intelligence tool for automatic control is the use of fuzzy logic controllers, which are fuzzy rule-based systems comprising the expert knowledge in form of linguistic rules. These rules are usually constructed by an expert in the field of interest who can link the facts with conclusions. However, this way to work sometimes fails to obtain an optimal behavior. To solve this problem, within the framework of Machine Learning, some artificial intelligence techniques could be applied to enhance the controller behavior. In this work, a post-processing method is used to obtain more compact and accurate fuzzy logic. controllers. This method combines a new technique to perform an evolutionary lateral tuning of the linguistic variables with a simple technique for rule selection (that removes unnecessary rules). To do so, the tuning technique considers a new rule representation scheme by using the linguistic 2-tuples representation model which allows the lateral variation of the involved linguistic labels.", "paper_title": "Improving fuzzy rule-based decision models by means of a genetic 2-tuples based tuning and the rule selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000237084600031"}
