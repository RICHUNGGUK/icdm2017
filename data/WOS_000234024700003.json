It is shown that, as in finite dimensional space setting (see [6]), the standard constraint qualification implies bounded linear regularity, which in turn yields the strong conical hull intersection property, and that the collection of closed convex sets {C-1, . . . ,C-n} is bounded linearly regular if and only if the tangent cones of {C-1, . . . ,C-n} has the CHIP and the normal cones of {C-1, . . . ,C-n} has the property (G)(uniformly on a neighborhood in the intersection C). As applications, we study the global error bounds for systems of linear and convex inequalities.", "paper_title": "Bounded linear regularity of convex sets in Banach spaces and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000234024700003"}
