In this work, a method for finding low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data is discussed, specifically conceived to preserve possible clusters in data. It is based on the critical bandwidth, a nonparametric statistic to test unimodality, related to kernel density estimation. Some useful properties of the aforementioned statistic are enlightened and an adjustment to use it as a basis for reducing dimensionality is suggested. The method is illustrated by simulated and real data examples.", "paper_title": "Reducing data dimension for cluster detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000325451100005"}
