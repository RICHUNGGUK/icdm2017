Specifically, the proposed scheme is aimed to control the creation of random individuals by the self-adaptation of the involved parameter. An interaction scheme between random and conventional DE individuals is also proposed and analyzed. The conducted computational experiments show that self-adaptation is profitable, leading to an algorithm that is as competitive as other efficient methods and able to beat the winner of the CEC 2009 competition on dynamic environments.", "paper_title": "Self-adaptive, multipopulation differential evolution in dynamic environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000324110600009"}
