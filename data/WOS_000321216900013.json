Multi-core processors are an answer to these demands, however task interferences make multi-cores more difficult to analyze from a worst-case execution time point of view than single-core processors. We propose a multi-core SMT processor that ensures a bounded maximum delay a task can suffer due to inter-task interferences. Multiple hard real-time tasks can be executed on different cores together with additional non real-time tasks. Our evaluation shows that the proposed MERASA multi-core provides predictability for hard real-time tasks and also high performance for non hard real-time tasks.", "paper_title": "A Hard Real-Time Capable Multi-Core SMT Processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000321216900013"}
