Compressed sensing methods aim to construct a high quality approximation to any given input vector X E RN using only Mx is an element of R'n as input. In particular, we focus herein on instance optimal nonlinear approximation error bounds for M and A, of the form parallel to x A (Mx)parallel to <= parallel to x - x(k)(opt)parallel to + Ck(1/p-1/q) parallel to x - x(k)(opt)parallel to for X is an element of RN, where x(k)(opt) is the best possible k-term approximation to x. In this paper we develop a compressed sensing method whose associated recovery algorithm, A, runs in O ((k log k) log N)-time, matching a lower bound up to a O (log k) factor. This runtime is obtained by using a new class of sparse binary compressed sensing matrices of near optimal size in combination with sublinear-time recovery techniques motivated by sketching algorithms for highvolume data streams. The new class of matrices is constructed by randomly subsampling rows from well-chosen incoherent matrix constructions which already have a sub-linear number of rows. As a consequence, fewer random bits than previously required are needed in order to select the rows utilized by the fast reconstruction algorithms considered herein. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
