The proposed structure is a combination of an adaptive FIR filter, based on the FXLMS algorithm, and the ALIGN algorithm resulting in a decoupled matrix for secondary path transfer function. This structure thus converts a multi-channel ANC system to decoupled systems which results in the reduction in computational load without affecting the convergence behavior of the FXLMS system.", "paper_title": "Design of decoupling active noise control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243117600004"}
