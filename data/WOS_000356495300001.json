We will show that for each fixed alpha > 0 there is a family of alpha 2(n) sets containing (alpha + o(1))n! such chains, and that this is asymptotically best possible. For smaller set systems we conjecture that a 'tower of cubes' construction is extremal. We finish by mentioning briefly a connection to an extremal problem on posets and a variant of our question for the grid graph.", "paper_title": "Set Systems Containing Many Maximal Chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000356495300001"}
