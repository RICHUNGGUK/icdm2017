We consider registration between two sets of lines features (e. g., helices in the proteins) that have undergone not a single, but multiple isometric transformations (e. g., hinge-motions). The problem is further complicated by the presence of symmetry in each set. We formulate the problem as a clique-finding problem in a product graph, and propose a heuristic solution that includes a fast clique-finding algorithm unique to the structure of this graph. When tested on a suite of real protein structures, the algorithm achieved high accuracy even for very large inputs containing hundreds of helices.", "paper_title": "Semi-isometric Registration of Line Features for Flexible Fitting of Protein Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000283159400027"}
