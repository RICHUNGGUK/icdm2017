The new formulation reduces the numerical diffusion with respect to previous formulations dealing with multiple phases, which makes this method to be especially appealing for turbulent flows. In this work we discuss the accuracy and conservation properties of the method in various scenarios with large density and viscosity jumps across the interface including surface tension effects.
