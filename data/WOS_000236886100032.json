We show that this problem can be naturally formulated as a shortest-distance problem over an intersection automaton defined on an appropriate semiring. We describe simple and efficient novel algorithms for its computation and report the results of experiments demonstrating the practicality of our algorithms for very large weighted automata. Our algorithms apply to unambiguous weighted automata, a class of weighted automata that strictly includes deterministic weighted automata. These are also the first algorithms extending the computation of entropy or of relative entropy beyond the class of deterministic weighted automata.", "paper_title": "Efficient computation of the relative entropy of probabilistic automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100032"}
