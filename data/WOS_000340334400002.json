The existing AGVs mainly used a magnetic system or an inductive system as a guidance system. However, those systems have high initial facility cost and are difficult to maintain according to changes of environment, and it can drive only the designated path by sensors which are installed on. The laser guidance system is developed to solve these problems, but it also has limitations which are slow response time and low accuracy. Therefore, we propose a sensor fusion method for the AGV. The sensors used in this paper are encoders, a gyro and the LNS, and they are fused by the UKF and FIS. To analyze the performance of the proposed system, we designed a fork-type AGV for ourselves and performed the experiment that was repeated 10 times under the same working conditions. In experimental results, we verified that the proposed method could improve positioning accuracy of the LNS effectively. In addition, it was appropriate to apply a real AGV system for autonomous driving. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
