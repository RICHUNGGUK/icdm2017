Finding the scalarization parameters that optimally limit the approximation error when generating a single Pareto optimal solution is a nonconvex optimization problem. This problem can be solved by enumerative techniques but at a cost that increases exponentially with the number of objectives. We present an algorithm for solving the Pareto surface approximation problem that is practical with 10 or less conflicting objectives, motivated by an application to radiation therapy optimization. Our enumerative scheme is, in a sense, dual to a family of previous algorithms. The proposed technique retains the quality of the best previous algorithm in this class while solving fewer subproblems. A further improvement is provided by a procedure for discarding subproblems based on reusing information from previous solves. The combined effect of the enhancements is empirically demonstrated to reduce the computational expense of solving the Pareto surface approximation problem by orders of magnitude. For problems where the objectives have positive curvature, an improved bound on the approximation error is demonstrated using transformations of the initial objectives with strictly increasing and concave functions.", "paper_title": "An Algorithm for Approximating Convex Pareto Surfaces Based on Dual Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000317966700014"}
