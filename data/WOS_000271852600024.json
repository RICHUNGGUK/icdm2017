In this scheme, a secret stream is transformed into a secret sequence by using a 3(n)-base notational system and the secret sequence is embedded into a pixel unit containing n neighboring pixels. On average, 10923 bits can be embedded into a cover pixel; therefore, our proposed data embedding scheme outperforms the original LSB replacement technique in hiding capacity. Experimental results present positive data that confirm that our proposed scheme not only provides higher hiding capacity than LSB replacement at the same image distortion levels, but also resists LSB attack and detection.", "paper_title": "LSB-BASED HIGH-CAPACITY DATA EMBEDDING SCHEME FOR DIGITAL IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852600024"}
