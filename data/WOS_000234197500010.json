A two-dimensional (2-D) edge adaptive lifting structure, which is similar to Daubechies 513 wavelet, is presented. The 2-D prediction filter predicts the value of the next polyphase component according to an edge orientation estimator of the image. Consequently, the prediction domain is allowed to rotate +/- 45 degrees in regions with diagonal gradient. The gradient estimator is computationally inexpensive with additional costs of only six subtractions per lifting instruction, and no multiplications are required.", "paper_title": "A 2-D orientation adaptive prediction filter in lifting structures for image coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000234197500010"}
