The cover image is divided into non-overlapping 2x2 sub-blocks, and the basis pixel is selected to calculate three different values of a sub-block. Difference values are replaced by embedding the number of secret bits that are referenced by the range table. For three pixel pairs in the sub-block, the optimal pixel adjustment is preceded to reduce the distortion of visual quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a high capacity and good visual quality.", "paper_title": "Three-Directional Data Hiding Method for Digital Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000333952000006"}
