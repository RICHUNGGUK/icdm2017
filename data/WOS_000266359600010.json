However, the prior work focused on maintaining a DDC by a globally synchronous protocol, which is not flexible for a large-scale sensor network. In this paper, we propose a more general DDC (GDDC), which supports asynchronous DDC updates. BY using the proposed GDDC, only O(root n) nodes need to be visited to compute all aggregate sum (or AVERAGE) query over a rectangular region with n nodes. First, we develop the fundamental semantics for aggregate queries in a system model without a synchronized clock. Second, we define the concept of consistency and derive a set of theorems to guarantee correct query results. we design new distributed algorithms to implement a GDDC. Finally, we evaluate the proposed Third, techniques by extensive experiments. Many interesting impact factors of query accuracy have also been analyzed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
