Unlike existing detectors such as Flexsphere that use preprocessing before MIMO detection to improve performance, the proposed detector instead performs multiple search passes, where each search pass detects the transmit stream with a different permuted detection order. In addition, to reduce the number of multipliers required in the design, we use l(1)-norm in place of the optimal squared l(2)-norm. To ameliorate the BER performance loss due to l(1)-norm, we propose squaring then scaling the l(1)-norm. By changing the number of parallel search passes and using norm scaling, we show that this design achieves comparable performance to Flexsphere with reduced resource requirement or achieves BER performance close to exhaustive search with increased resource requirement.", "paper_title": "Low complexity scalable MIMO sphere detection through antenna detection reordering", "paper_id": "WOS:000310236400004"}
