Since an inappropriate MR decision causes handover or binding renewal to mobile nodes, determining of the optimal MR is important for efficiency. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that decides on the optimal MR using MR QoS information, and we describe how to understand the various structured MLP (Multi-Layered Perceptron) based on the algorithm. In conclusion, we prove the ability of the suggested neural network for a nesting mobile network through the performance analysis of each learned MLP.", "paper_title": "MLP network for optimal MR decision in a large-scale nesting mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289985200004"}
