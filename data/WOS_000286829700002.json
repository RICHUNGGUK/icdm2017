In this paper, we study theoretical limitations of data collection and data aggregation in terms of delay and capacity for a wireless sensor network where n sensors are randomly deployed. We consider different communication scenarios such as with single sink or multiple sinks, regularly-deployed or randomly-deployed sinks, with or without aggregation. For each scenario, we not only propose a data collection/aggregation method and analyze its performance in terms of delay and capacity, but also theoretically prove whether our method can achieve the optimal order (i.e., its performance is within a constant factor of the optimal). Particularly, with a single sink, the capacity of data collection is in order of Theta(W) where W is the fixed data-rate on individual links. With k regularly deployed sinks, the capacity of data collection is increased to Theta(kW) when k = O(n/logn) or Theta(n/logn W) when k = Omega(n/logn). With k randomly deployed sinks, the capacity of data collection is between Theta(k/logk W) and Theta(kW) when k = O(n/logn) or Theta(n/logn W) when k = omega(n/logn). If each sensor can aggregate its receiving packets into a single packet to send, the capacity of data collection with a single sink is also increased to Theta(n/logn W).", "paper_title": "Capacity of data collection in randomly-deployed wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286829700002"}
