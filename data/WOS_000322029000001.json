The existing feature selection methods are usually designed for classification error. In this paper, we propose a generalized sparse regularizer. Based on the proposed regularizer, we present a unified feature selection framework for general loss functions. In particular, we study the novel feature selection paradigm by optimizing multivariate performance measures. The resultant formulation is a challenging problem for high-dimensional data. Hence, a two-layer cutting plane algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, and the convergence is presented. In addition, we adapt the proposed method to optimize multivariate measures for multiple-instance learning problems. The analyses by comparing with the state-of-the-art feature selection methods show that the proposed method is superior to others. Extensive experiments on large-scale and high-dimensional real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms l(1)-SVM and SVM-RFE when choosing a small subset of features, and achieves significantly improved performances over SVMperf in terms of F-1-score.", "paper_title": "A Feature Selection Method for Multivariate Performance Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000322029000001"}
