However, attempts to develop ontologies suffer from a number of problems in practical situations. This paper outlines an approach to ontology development based on multi perspective modeling - that is, dividing a single ontology into multiple ontologies according to the type of knowledge that is addressed. It is argued that this approach is able to resolve some of the common problems that arise in ontology development.
