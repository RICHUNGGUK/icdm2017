We extend their work to reasoning about probabilistic loops in the probabilistic refinement calculus. We apply our algebraic reasoning to derive transformation rules for probabilistic action systems and probabilistic while-loops. In particular we focus on developing data refinement rules for these two constructs. Our extension is interesting since some well known transformation rules that are applicable to standard programs are not applicable to probabilistic ones: we identify some of these important differences and we develop alternative rules where possible.", "paper_title": "Algebraic reasoning for probabilistic action systems and while-loops", "paper_id": "WOS:000257222500001"}
