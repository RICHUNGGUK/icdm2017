If a new user wants to stream multimedia contents in a server through a new kind of terminal device, it should be considered whether the existing transcoders are able to adapt the multimedia contents. However, the existing libraries for multimedia adaptation have heavy transcoder figures which include all adaptive functions in one library. The challenge of universal access is too complex to be solved with these all-in-one solutions. In this paper, an application-independent multimedia adaptation framework which meets the QoS of new and varied mobile devices is suggested. This framework is composed of a group of unit transcoders having only one transcoding function respectively, instead of heavy transcoders. Also, the transcoder manager supporting the dynamic connections of the unit transcoders to satisfy end to end QoS is included.", "paper_title": "An application-independent multimedia adaptation framework for the mobile web", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100004"}
