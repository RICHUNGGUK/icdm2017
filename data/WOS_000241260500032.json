Design/methodology/approach - On the base of concept of equipollent, superior and inferior potential degree, the paper designs determinant rules of interval grey number potential relations, opens out player's decision-making laws in the conditions of finite knowledge and logos. And it designs the grey game decision-making rules which player choices maximum potential degree of grey game value (the most favorableness situation) under the cases of that there are all likely to be minimum potential degree of grey game value (the most disadvantage situation), which is a reliable way for both sides to accept. Findings - The paper recognizes and defines overrated and underrated risk of potential optimal pure strategy in the grey game, designs arithmetic for determining player's overrated and underrated risk under the situation of potential optimal pure strategy. Practical implications - The presents system meets the requirement of judging pure strategy solutions in the grey potential situation. Originality/value - This paper builds up the system of judgment for grey potential.", "paper_title": "Study on venture problem of potential optimal pure strategy solution for grey interval number matrix game", "paper_id": "WOS:000241260500032"}
