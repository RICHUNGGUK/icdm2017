In accordance to this philosophy, scheduling problems involving earliness and tardiness penalties are very critical for the operations manager. In this paper, a new population heuristic based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is presented to solve the single machine early/tardy scheduling problem against a restrictive common due date. This type of scheduling sets costs depending on whether a job finished before (earliness), or after (tardiness) the specified due date. The objective is to minimize a summation of earliness and tardiness penalty costs, thus pushing the completion time of each job as close as possible to the due date. The problem is known to be NP-hard, and therefore large size instances cannot be addressed by traditional mathematical programming techniques. The performance of the proposed PSO heuristic is measured over benchmarks problems with up to 1000 jobs taken from the open literature, and found quite high and promising in respect to the quality of the solutions obtained. Particularly, PSO was found able to improve the 82% of the existing best known solutions of the examined benchmarks test problems.", "paper_title": "A Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Scheduling Against Restrictive Common Due Dates", "paper_id": "WOS:000319191800009"}
