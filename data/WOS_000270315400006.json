The source space is a Sobolev space with nonnegative smoothness order; the target space has negative smoothness order. The optimal order of approximation (in some cases only up to logarithmic factors) is determined. Extensions to Besov and Bessel potential spaces are given and a problem recently posed by Novak and Wozniakowski is partially solved. The results are applied to the complexity analysis of weak solution of elliptic PDE. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
