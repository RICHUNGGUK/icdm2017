In recent years, non-uniform memory access (NUMA) has become the de-facto architecture of multiprocessors on the new generation of enterprise servers. Such new architecture brings new challenges to optimization techniques on traditional operators in BI. Aggregation, for example, is one of the basic building blocks of BI, while its processing performance with existing hash-based algorithms scales poorly in terms of the number of cores under NUMA architecture. In this paper, we provide new solutions to tackle the problem of parallel hash-based aggregation, especially targeting at domains of extremely large cardinality. We propose a NUMA-aware radix partitioning (NaRP) method which divides the original huge relation table into subsets, without invoking expensive remote memory access between nodes of the cores. We also present a new efficient aggregation algorithm (EAA), to aggregate the partitioned data in parallel with low cache coherence miss and locking costs. Theoretical analysis as well as empirical study on an IBM X5 server prove that our proposals are at least two times faster than existing methods.", "paper_title": "NUMA-Aware Scalable and Efficient In-Memory Aggregation on Large Domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000351393500015"}
