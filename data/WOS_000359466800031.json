To increase coding efficiency, the probability of the case that MPM is equal to coding mode of the current block should increase. In this paper we propose an efficient scheme to make MPM which is matched for the spatial direction property of pixels in the current block. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme gives significant coding gains when compared with the conventional techniques.", "paper_title": "Intra Prediction Using an Advanced Most Probable Mode in H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466800031"}
