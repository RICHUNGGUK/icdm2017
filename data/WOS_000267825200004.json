The proposed address generation unit operates with an improved version of the low-order parallel memory access approach. Our design supports data structures of arbitrary lengths and different odd strides. The experimental results show that our address generation unit is capable of generating eight 32 -aEuro parts per thousand bit addresses every 6 ns for different strides when implemented on a VIRTEX-II PRO xc2vp30-7ff1696 FPGA device using only trivial hardware resources.", "paper_title": "High-bandwidth Address Generation Unit", "paper_id": "WOS:000267825200004"}
