The lexicon of hand gestures had eight entries and was demonstrated to be natural and ergonomic with the limited hand motions. A cooperative multi-cue system was proposed for the key hand posture recognition of the proposed hand gestures. We utilized the designed system into a remote smart car control and electric wheelchair control. Experimental a results demonstrated the robustness and potential feasibility of the system in human-computer interaction for the proposed users.", "paper_title": "A NATURAL HAND GESTURE SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE WITH BRACHIAL PLEXUS INJURIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000361869000004"}
