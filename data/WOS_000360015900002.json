The resulting nonasymptotic achievability bounds, when combined with nonasymptotic equipartition properties developed in this paper, can be easily computed. Analytically, these nonasymptotic achievability bounds are shown to be asymptotically tight up to the second order of the coding rate as n goes to infinity with either constant or subexponentially decreasing epsilon in the case of Gallager parity check ensemble, and to imply that low density parity check (LDPC) codes be capacity-achieving in the case of LDPC ensembles. Numerically, they are also compared favorably, for finite n and epsilon of practical interest, with existing nonasymptotic achievability bounds in the literature.", "paper_title": "New Nonasymptotic Channel Coding Theorems for Structured Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900002"}
