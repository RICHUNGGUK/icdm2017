The goal is to provide just-in-time knowledge to users based on their decision-making needs. There are three important factors that can assist in focusing the search: 1) the user's profile, consisting user preferences, biases, and query history, 2) the user's context to focus on the current activity, and 3) the user's information space, in which he may receive the information on specialized hardware with limited bandwidth, implying that the knowledge must be filtered and tailored to the presentation medium.", "paper_title": "Emergent semantics in knowledge sifter: An evolutionary search agent based on semantic Web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000240496900009"}
