In this paper, we explain how normalization alleviates the difficulties caused by non-synonymously redundant encodings in genetic algorithms. We define the encodings with maximally nonsynonymous property and prove that the encodings induce uncorrelated search spaces. Extensive experiments for a number of problems show that normalization transforms the uncorrelated search spaces to correlated ones and leads to significant improvement in performance.", "paper_title": "Normalization for Genetic Algorithms With Nonsynonymously Redundant Encodings", "paper_id": "WOS:000260046900006"}
