For robust reactor analysis, large scale neutron transport simulations require computation of reaction rates for tens of billions of particles involving several hundred isotopes. When employing physical-space domain decomposition, minimizing memory consumption while safely and efficiently exchanging massive amounts of data is a significant challenge. To address this problem, we implement and test several \"memory-aware\", in-place, sparse, all-to-all MPI communication implementations. The algorithms are developed and tested within the open source MADRE (Memory-Aware Data Redistribution) project, which gives application programmers a simple API and set of tools and algorithms for carrying out memory-transparent in-place communication. We explore memory and communication efficiency tradeoffs for a range of in-place algorithms using a simple Monte Carlo communication kernel intended to mimic the behavior of our full Monte Carlo neutronics code.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Memory Constrained Environments in Monte Carlo Nuclear Reactor Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000318356600011"}
