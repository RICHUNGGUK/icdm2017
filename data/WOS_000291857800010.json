The problems of networked control systems (NCSs) such as transmission delays and data-packets dropout, induced by the insertion of data networks in the feedback adaptive control loops are also considered. The novelty of this article consists in the combination of different aspects in NCSs: state tracking control of systems with unknown parameters, unknown actuator failures, network-induced delays and data-packets dropout. Normalised adaptive laws are designed for updating the controller parameters. Sufficient conditions for Lyapunov stability are derived in the case of uncertainty due to actuator failures, delays and data-packets dropout. Simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our design approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive stabilisation of networked control systems tolerant to unknown actuator failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000291857800010"}
