The proposed technique takes advantage that most unknowns are locally clustered after the test compactor. With three novel masking mechanisms [direct row, direct column and linear feedback shift register (LFSR) column masking], RLC masks all unknowns in test responses using a very short LFSR. Experiments on a real design show that the proposed technique is able to mask up to 7.38% unknowns with only 0.61% fault coverage loss. By providing a very high test response compaction ratio, RLC masking technique enables massive parallel testing of many-core system chips.", "paper_title": "Row-linear feedback shift register-column X-masking technique for simultaneous testing of many-core system chips", "paper_id": "WOS:000292591600003"}
