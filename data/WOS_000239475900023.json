However, their proposed scheme only worked for two users and an open question proposed by authors was to provide this property for multi-user systems. In this paper, we give a comprehensive solution to this problem by giving a generic construction for a hybrid traitor tracing scheme that provides full-public-traceability. We follow the Tag KEM/DEM paradigm of hybrid encryption systems and extend it to multi-receiver scenario. We define Tag-Broadcast KEM/DEM and construct a secure Tag-BroadcastKEM from a CCA secure PKE and target-collision resistant hash function. We will then use this Tag-Broadcast KEM together with a semantically secure DEM to give a generic construction for Hybrid Public Key Broadcast Encryption. The scheme has a black box tracing algorithm that always correctly identifies a traitor. The hybrid structure makes the system very efficient, both in terms of computation and communication cost. Finally we show a method of reducing the communication cost by using codes with identifiable parent property.", "paper_title": "Generic construction of hybrid public key traitor tracing with full-public-traceability", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900023"}
