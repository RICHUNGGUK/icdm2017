An approach commonly used in geography and urban growth modelling is based on cellular automata theory and the GIS framework. However, the behaviour of cellular automaton (CA) models is affected by uncertainties arising from the interaction between model elements, structures, and the quality of data sources used as model input. The uncertainty of CA models has not been sufficiently addressed in the research literature. The objective of this study is to analyze the behaviour of a GIS-based CA urban growth model using sensitivity analysis (SA). The proposed SA approach has both qualitative and quantitative components. These components were operationalized using the cross-tabulation map, KAPPA index with coincidence matrices, and spatial metrics. The research focus was on the impacts of CA neighbourhood size and type on the model outcomes. A total of 432 simulations were generated and the results suggest that CA neighbourhood size and type configurations have a significant influence on the CA model output. This study provides insights about the limitations of CA model behaviour and contributes to enhancing existing spatial urban growth modelling procedures. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
