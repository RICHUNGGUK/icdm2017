Special attention will be paid to the solution provided to two important open issues: the definition of a certificate path building and validation algorithm (to ease the trust establishment and negotiation processes) and the definition and negotiation of SLAs in inter-domain secure overlay scenarios. Given a set of already existing domains with certain trust relationships, each overlay network allows the secure sharing of some (or all) of its services. For this, the administrator of each administrative domain will define using a formal information model which services he wants to share with any other domain, and which ones is he expecting from these other domains. Time and other networking conditions can also be indicated allowing secure overlay networks to be dynamically and automatically established and managed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
