Alternatively, optimisation based approaches have been proposed to reason about the large scale dynamics of networks, particularly with regard to congestion and rate control protocols such as TCP. This paper intends to provide a first bridge and explore synergies between these two approaches. We consider a series of discrete approximations to the optimisation based congestion control algorithms. Then we use branching time temporal logic to specify formally the convergence criteria for the system dynamics and present results from implementing these algorithms on a state-of-the-art model checker. We report on our experiences in using the abstraction of model checking to capture features of the continuous dynamics typical of optimisation based approaches.", "paper_title": "Model Checking Optimisation Based Congestion Control Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000283643700007"}
