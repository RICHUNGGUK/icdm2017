A computer network is composed of Internet data centers and delivery mediums and we can regard it as a network topology with vertices and arcs. Virtually, each component (vertex or arc) has multiple capacities/states due to failure, maintenance, etc. Evaluating the reliability of a network with unreliable vertices is a difficult problem because of the disabled of adjacent arcs by vertex failure. Hence the network with unreliable vertices can be called a multi-state unreliable vertex computer network (MUVCN). Concentrating on the MUVCN, this paper addresses the data delivery from the source to the sink through k(k >= 2) disjoint minimal paths simultaneously, and proposes an algorithm to assess system reliability fulfilling demand constraint, tolerable PER, and time threshold. Furthermore, a routing strategy for raising system reliability is established in advance to specify the main and backup minimal paths. Subsequently, such a system reliability named the backup reliability can be computed faster. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
