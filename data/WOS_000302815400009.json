However, their maximum likelihood (ML) and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimators are often difficult to compute, especially when the random effects are correlated; this is because obtaining the likelihood function involves high-dimensional integration. Recently, an h-likelihood method that does not involve numerical integration has been proposed. In this study, we show how an h-likelihood method can be implemented by modifying the existing ML and REML procedures. A small simulation study is carried out to investigate the performances of the proposed methods for HGLMs with correlated random effects.", "paper_title": "Modifications of REML algorithm for HGLMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000302815400009"}
