The study selected the field of electric vehicle technology to explore the phenomenon and examined the characteristics of PCNs in terms of the average BC strength and the average citation time lag. Four PCNs were constructed in this study. The aggregated PCN (APCN) excluded the irrelevant patent citations and added the relevant uncited patent citations, which has brought out significant improvement. The APCN became more concentrated and the information which reserved in the APCN was the most current. Additionally, some invisible technology clusters and relationships were also manifested in the APCN.", "paper_title": "The bibliographic coupling approach to filter the cited and uncited patent citations: a case of electric vehicle technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000313016300005"}
