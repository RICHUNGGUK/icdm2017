Starting with conventional tree models (given as meshes), we convert them into sweep surfaces and deform their branches interactively while detecting and avoiding collisions with many other branches. Multiple tree models (sharing the same topology) can be generated with great ease using this sweep-based approach, and they can serve as a basis for the generation of a multiparameter family of trees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an automatic generation of similar trees, the colonization of trees to form a forest, and the tree growth, aging, and withering simulations.
