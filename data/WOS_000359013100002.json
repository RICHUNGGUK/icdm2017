The transmitting circuit is reconfigurable externally making it able to drive a wide variety of CMUTs. The transmitting circuit can generate several pulse shapes with voltages up to 100 V, maximum pulse range of 50 V, frequencies up to 5 MHz and different driving slew rates. Measurements are performed on the circuit in order to assess its functionality and power consumption performance. The design occupies an on-chip area of 0.938 mm(2) and the power consumption of a 128-element transmitting circuit array that would be used in an portable ultrasound scanner is found to be a maximum of 181 mW.", "paper_title": "Integrated reconfigurable high-voltage transmitting circuit for CMUTs", "paper_id": "WOS:000359013100002"}
