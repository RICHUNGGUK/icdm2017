We apply the proposed algorithm to the progressive transmission and the denoising of 3D graphics, and show its sufficient stability and good performance by some numerical experiments. Since the usual input mesh does not possess the property of subdivision connectivity, while the multiresolution analysis based on subdivision surface requires the processed initial mesh to be semi-regular, we further propose a new rapid algorithm of constructing the initial mesh which not only possesses ternary subdivision connectivity but also approximates the given input mesh.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTION AND APPLICATIONS OF BIORTHOGONAL TERNARY LOOP SUBDIVISION WAVELETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292842200001"}
