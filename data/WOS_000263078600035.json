The derived algorithm is then simplified for computational complexity reduction as well as improved with the use of multiple forgetting factor (MFF) technique to provide a flexible way of keeping track of the parameters with different rates. The effectiveness of the simplified MFF-RGN scheme in sinusoidal parameter tracking is demonstrated via computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Fast Tracking of a Real Sinusoid with Multiple Forgetting Factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078600035"}
