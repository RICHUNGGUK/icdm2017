We combine level-set methods for image segmentation with optical flow estimations based on probability distribution functions (pdfs) calculated at each image position. Unlike most recent level-set methods that, consider exclusively the sign of the level-set function to determine an object. and its background, we introduce a novel interpretation of the value of the level-set function that reflects the confidence in the contour. To this end, in a sequence of consecutive images, the contour of an object is transformed according to the optical flow estimation and used as the initial object hypothesis in the following image. The values of the initial level-set function are set according to the optical flow pdfs and thus provide an opportunity to incorporate the uncertainties of the optical flow estimation in the object contour prediction.", "paper_title": "A PROBABILISTIC PREDICTION METHOD FOR OBJECT CONTOUR TRACKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000271688500011"}
