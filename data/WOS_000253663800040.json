The stability analysis problem is investigated, for the first time, for such kind of neural networks. In the neural network model, the parameter uncertainties are norm-bounded, the neural networks are subjected to stochastic disturbances described in terms of a Brownian motion, and the delay is time-varying. By utilizing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and using some well-known inequalities, we convert the addressed stability analysis problem into the feasibility problem of several linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Different from the commonly used matrix norm theories (such as the M-matrix method), a unified LMI approach is developed to establish sufficient conditions for the neural networks to be globally, robustly, exponentially stable. A numerical example is provided to show the usefulness of the proposed global stability condition. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
