When these codes are generalized to GF(q) for q > 2, their performance approaches the Shannon limit much faster than the usual binary fountain codes. In this paper, we extend binary fountain codes to GF(q). In particular, we generalize binary Luby transform codes to GF(q) to develop a low complexity maximum likelihood decoder. The proposed codes have numerous advantages, including low coding overhead, low encoding and decoding complexity, and good performance over various message block lengths, making them practical for real-time applications.
