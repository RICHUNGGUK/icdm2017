The use of directional antenna in Wireless Mesh Networks is beneficial in constructing backbone networks viewing the properties of directional antenna. The backbone links must be robust to obtain better network performance. In this paper, a simple yet effective topology protocol is presented that performs well compared to its predecessors. Our protocol constructs the topology with the constraints in the number of links per node. The full topology is constructed in two phases. The resultant topology is termed as Web-topology. The topology formed is robust, efficient, and scalable.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Web-Topology for the Wireless Mesh Network with Directional Antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000288500600011"}
