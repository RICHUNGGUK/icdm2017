The construction strategy type is grounded on the theory of computation while data collection is supported by statistical practices. The theory of information is deeply rooted in mathematical statistics and has been developed by Claude Shannon into a data transmission model. I submit that an explicit interaction of information theory with computation theory can bring balance to the epistemic status of computational models.", "paper_title": "Computational models and information theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000308435300009"}
