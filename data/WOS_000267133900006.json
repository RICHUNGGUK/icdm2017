The ability of compressible Large-Eddy Simulations to provide data on the flow around a perforated plate and the associated acoustic damping is demonstrated. In particular, assumptions of existing models of the acoustic effect of perforated plate are assessed thanks to the Large-Eddy Simulations results. The question of modeling the effect of perforated plates is then addressed in the context of thermo-acoustic instabilities of gas turbine combustion chambers. Details are provided about the implementation, validation and application of a homogeneous boundary condition modeling the acoustic effect of perforated plates for compressible Large-Eddy Simulations of the flow in combustions chambers cooled by full-coverage film cooling.
