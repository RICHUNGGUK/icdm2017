A constructive proof for reconstructibility of an extended perfect binary one-error-correcting code from its minimum distance graph is presented. Consequently, inequivalent such codes have nonisomorphic minimum distance graphs. Moreover, it is shown that the automorphism group of a minimum distance graph is isomorphic to that of the corresponding code.", "paper_title": "Reconstructing Extended Perfect Binary One-Error-Correcting Codes From Their Minimum Distance Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000266878500016"}
