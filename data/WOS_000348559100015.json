The equation is considered in the Banach space of real functions defined, continuous and bounded on an unbounded interval. Existence of a control variable provides the extension of some previous results obtains in other studies. We will also include an example in order to indicate the validity of the assumptions.", "paper_title": "STABILITY IN VOLTERRA INTEGRAL EQUATIONS OF FRACTIONAL ORDER WITH CONTROL VARIABLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000348559100015"}
