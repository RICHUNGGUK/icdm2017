Thus, instead of radar or laser sensor, vision/GPS sensing has been introduced not only to recognize lane marking ahead, but also to detect vehicle in front or around while driving, particularly enabling the collision warning or deviation alert. In this paper, a high-performance collision avoidance system (CA S) has realized vision/GPS sensing for active vehicle safety where GPS supplying the localization information to collaborate with vision scanning in a very short time, judges whether or not an impending crash may be caused. Besides, in order to retrieve the information from heterogeneous data collected by both out-of-vehicle and in-vehicle sensing, a two-layer embedded data fusion, which is a quantum-tuned back-propagation neural network (QT-BPNN) plus an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), has implemented in a distributed dual-platform DaVinci+XScale_NAV270 for achieving a fast response to collision warning and event data recording. Finally, based on performance evaluation the experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms two well-known alternative systems, AWS-Mobileye and ACWS-Delphi.", "paper_title": "VEHICLE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM USING EMBEDDED HYBRID INTELLIGENT PREDICTION BASED ON VISION/GPS SENSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800006"}
