This model based on splicing system can solve fuzzy reasoning autonomously by using DNA sequences and human assisted protocols. Its hardware consists of class IIS restriction enzyme and 14 DNA ligase while the software consists of double stranded DNA sequences and transition molecules which are capable of encoding fuzzy rules. Upon mixing solutions containing these components, the automaton undergoes a cascade of cleaving and splicing cycles to produce the computational result in form of double stranded DNA sequence representing automaton's final state. In this work, we have fused the idea of splicing system with the automata theory to develop fuzzy molecular automaton in which 10(18) processors can work in parallel, requires a trillion times less space for information storage, 10(5) times faster than existing super computer and 10(19) power operations can be performed using 1 Joule of energy.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy molecular automaton using splicing theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000308614600006"}
