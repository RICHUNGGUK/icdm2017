The model was developed to be used in threedimensional analyses within the framework of the Finite Element Method and for general loading cases. It was designed using a hierarchical approach by combining what is called the base model, which acts as the skeleton of the model and introduces the basic response under monotonic and reversed loading, and four independent and optional sub-models used to enhance the simulation when needed, by considering the cyclic resistance degradation, the peak stress slip evolution, the reload slip evolution and the radial stress effect. The model implementation within the framework of the Finite Element Method is described and its accuracy is assessed using a series of validation tests. At the end, the main conclusions extracted from this work are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
