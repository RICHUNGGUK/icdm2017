A feasible protocol under which each agent can only obtain the measurements of its position relative to its neighbours is proposed. By applying the graph theory, Lyapunov theory and the homogeneous domination method, some sufficient conditions for finite-time consensus of second-order multi-agent systems are established under the different kinds of communication topologies. Some examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Finite-time consensus of multiple second-order dynamic agents without velocity measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000335668300022"}
