Unlike most numerical methods based on vorticity equations, the current approach provides discrete solutions with mass conservation, divergence-free vorticity, and accurate kinetic energy balance in a simple and natural way. The method is applied to compute buoyancy-driven flows in a differentially heated cubic enclosure in the Boussinesq approximation for Ra is an element of???{104,105,106}. The numerical solutions on a finer grid are of benchmark quality. The computed helical density allows quantification of the three-dimensional nature of the flow.
