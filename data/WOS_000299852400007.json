It gives an exponential compact higher order scheme (ECHOS) for two-dimensional linear convection-diffusion equations (CDE). It uses a compact nine point stencil, over which the governing equations are discretized for both fine and coarse grids. The resulting algebraic systems are solved using a line iterative approach with alternate direction implicit (ADI) procedure. Combining the solutions over tine and coarse grids, initially a sixth order solution over coarse grid points is obtained. The resultant solution is then extended to finer grid by interpolation derived from the difference operator. The convergence of the iterative procedure is guaranteed as the coefficient matrix of the developed scheme satisfies the conditions required to be monotone. The higher order accuracy and better rate of convergence of the developed algorithm have been demonstrated by solving numerous model problems. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
