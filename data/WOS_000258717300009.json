The current-source design strategy is based on an iterative scheme whose variables are adjusted in a simple way, minimizing the area and the power consumption, and meeting the design specifications. A theoretical analysis of static-dynamic requirements and a new layout strategy to attain a small-area current-steering DAC are included. The DAC was designed and implemented in 0.35 mu m CMOS technology, requiring an active area of just 200 mu m x 200 mu m. Experimental results, with a full-scale output current of 700 mu A and a 3.3 V power supply, showed a spurious-free dynamic range of 58 dB for a 1 MHz output sine wave and sampling frequency of 50 MHz, with differential and integral nonlinearity of 0.3 and 0.37 LSB, respectively.", "paper_title": "A small area 8 bits 50 MHz CMOS DAC for Bluetooth transmitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000258717300009"}
