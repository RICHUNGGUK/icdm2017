If both saddles are conveniently situated, they produce a transition flow from a segment of the splitting line to another segment of the same line, and this produces a generalized singular point on the line. This point is a focus or a center and there can be found limit cycles around it. We are going to show that the maximum number of limit cycles that can bifurcate from this focus is two. One of them appears through a Hopf bifurcation and the second when the focus becomes a node by means of the sliding. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
