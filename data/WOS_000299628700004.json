The nonlinear problem subject to a given skin friction at the boundary is solved. Analytic solution is obtained using homotopy analysis method. The velocity, temperature, and stretching velocity is calculated for different values of the rotation parameter (lambda). The obtained results are compared with the well known results of rotating flow induced by a stretching surface by using four sets of boundary conditions.
