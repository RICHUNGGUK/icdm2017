We propose a new type of network - cluster- dense network - characterized by multiple clusters that are highly intra- connected and sparsely inter- connected. Employing two graph- theoretic measures - local density and relative density - we demonstrate that such networks are prevalent in the world of networks.", "paper_title": "Cluster-dense networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291900008"}
