All the while, it is also expected that these mobile processors be power-conscientious as well as of minimal area impact. These devices pose unique usage demands of ultra-portability but also demand an always-on, continuous data access paradigm. As a result, this dichotomy of continuous execution versus long battery life poses a difficult challenge. This article explores a novel approach to mitigating mobile processor power consumption while abating any significant degradation in execution speed. The concept relies on efficiently leveraging both compile-time and runtime application memory behavior to intelligently target adjustments in the cache to significantly reduce overall processor power, taking into account both the dynamic and leakage power footprint of the cache subsystem. The simulation results show a significant reduction in power consumption of approximately 13% to 29%, while only incurring a nominal increase in execution time and area.", "paper_title": "Application-Aware Adaptive Cache Architecture for Power-Sensitive Mobile Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000329136000001"}
