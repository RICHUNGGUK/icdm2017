In this paper we take our understanding of behavioral graphs a step further by showing that an intriguing empirical property of web graphs-their compressibility-cannot be exhibited by well-known graph models for the web and for social networks. We then develop a more nuanced model for web graphs and show that it does exhibit compressibility, in addition to previously modeled web graph properties.", "paper_title": "MODELS FOR THE COMPRESSIBLE WEB", "paper_id": "WOS:000328889100001"}
