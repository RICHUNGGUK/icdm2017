To better understand this emerging type of application, the authors performed a detailed analysis of Second Life, a popular metaverse, and determined that its computational and communication requirements place significant demands on servers, clients, and the network. As virtual worlds evolve to support more users, interaction types, and realism, these demands will increase.", "paper_title": "Second Life and the new generation of virtual worlds", "paper_id": "WOS:000258934500011"}
