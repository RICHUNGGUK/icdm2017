Combined with the micro-mechanism between tool and workpiece during micromachining process, the sources of the micro-cutting force were analyzed, the micro-cutting physical model was constructed, and the microstress model interacted between the cutting arc edge of the tool and the material of the workpiece was analyzed. Combined with the surface friction and elastic extrusion mechanism between the cutting tool and workpiece, the micro-cutting force model was constructed from two aspects. The micro-cutting depth is deeper than the minimum cutting depth and the micro-cutting depth is shallower than the minimum cutting depth, then the minimum cutting depth value was calculated. Combined with the dislocation properties and microcrystal structure of workpiece's material, the internal stress of the micromachining force model based on the gradient plasticity theory was calculated, and the force model of the micro-cutting process was studied too. It is significant to control the precision of micromachining process during the micromachining process by constructing the micromachining process force model through studying the small deformation of the material and the mechanism of micromachining.", "paper_title": "Study on mathematical model of cutting force in micromachining", "paper_id": "WOS:000373487100005"}
