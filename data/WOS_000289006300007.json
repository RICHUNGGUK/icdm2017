We prove that for any such T, the cover modality nabla is a left (and its dual delta is a right) adjoint relative to P-omega. We then consider monotone unary modalities arising from the logical connection and show that they all are left (or right) adjoints relative to P-omega.", "paper_title": "On monotone modalities and adjointness", "paper_id": "WOS:000289006300007"}
