Soundness of the framework rules is proven via a generic PER model on untyped terms. An algorithmic version of the framework is given through an untyped beta eta-equality test and a bidirectional type checking algorithm. Completeness is proven by instantiating the PER model with eta-equality on beta-normal forms, which is shown equivalent to the algorithmic equality.", "paper_title": "Untyped algorithmic equality for with surjective pairs Martin-Lof's logical framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000248423100005"}
