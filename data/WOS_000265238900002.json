The abstract syntax of natural languages, particularly English, and their formal manipulations are described. On the basis of the abstract syntax, a universal language processing model and the deductive grammar of English are developed toward the formalization of Chomsky's universal grammar in linguistics. Comparative analyses of natural and programming languages, as well as the linguistic perception on software engineering, are discussed. A wide range of applications of the deductive grammar of English have been explored in language acquisition, comprehension, generation, and processing in cognitive informatics, computational intelligence, and cognitive computing.", "paper_title": "A Formal Syntax of Natural Languages and the Deductive Grammar", "paper_id": "WOS:000265238900002"}
