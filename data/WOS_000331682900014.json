Additionally, the quality of acquired data could not be assessed immediately during imaging due to the lack of a coherent real-time visualization system. Thus, to eliminate the requisition of close user supervision while providing real-time 3D visualization alongside imaging, we propose and describe an innovative approach to integrate imaging and visualization into a single pipeline called an online incrementally accumulated rendering system. This system is composed of an electronic controller for progressive acquisition, a memory allocator for memory isolation, an efficient memory organization scheme, a compositing scheme to render accumulated datasets, and accumulative frame buffers for displaying non-conflicting outputs. We implement this design using a laser scanning confocal endomicroscope, interfaced with an FPGA prototyping board through a custom hardware circuit. Empirical results from practical implementations deployed in a cancer research center are presented in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
