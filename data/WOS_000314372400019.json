The 100% floor opening case was used as a reference. The turbulence models were evaluated by comparing the numerical results with experimental data at representative points inside the scale model. The RKE and RNG models required less elements for grid-independent results with the predicted airflow patterns agreeing well with the smoke tests. The velocities and concentrations predicted by the RNG model were closer to the measured values with a maximum velocity difference of less than 0.03 m s(-1) (9.3%) and a maximum normalized concentration difference of less than 0.09 (12.3%) for the 100% floor opening. For the 16.7% floor opening, the maximum velocity difference in the main space was less than 0.02 m s(-1) (6.8%) and the maximum normalized concentration difference was less than 0.2 (25%). Thus, the RNG model most accurately predicts the airflow velocities and ammonia concentrations in the scale model swine building enclosure. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
