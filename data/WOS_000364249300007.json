Therefore, several approaches exist for running network measurements, ranging from analyzing live traffic traces from campus or Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks to performing active measurements on distributed testbeds, e.g., PlanetLab, or involving volunteers. However, each method falls short, offering only a partial view of the network. For instance, the scope of passive traffic traces is limited to an ISP's network and customers' habits, whereas active measurements might be biased by the population or node location involved. To complement these techniques, we propose to use (commercial) crowdsourcing platforms for network measurements. They permit a controllable, diverse and realistic view of the Internet and provide better control than do measurements with voluntary participants. In this study, we compare crowdsourcing with traditional measurement techniques, describe possible pitfalls and limitations, and present best practices to overcome these issues. The contribution of this paper is a guideline for researchers to understand when and how to exploit crowdsourcing for network measurements. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
