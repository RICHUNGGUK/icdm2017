These approaches are usually computationally expensive. Our previous experiences in optimizing vaccine or drug protocols using genetic algorithms required the use of a high performance computing infrastructure for a couple of days. In the present article we show that by an appropriate use of a different optimization algorithm, the simulated annealing, we have been able to downsize the computational effort by a factor10(2). The new algorithm requires computational effort that can be achieved by current generation personal computers.", "paper_title": "Optimal vaccination schedules using simulated annealing", "paper_id": "WOS:000257956600016"}
