We propose here to extend this formulation to the adaptive version of the FMM: this requires the conception of a new data structure for the octree, namely the octree with indirections, which is efficient for both uniform and non-uniform distributions, as well as a detection mechanism of the available uniform areas in non-uniform distributions. In comparison with other M2L computation schemes (block FFT, rotations and plane wave expansions) in the case of non-uniform distributions of particles, our BLAS version appears to be the fastest for the common precisions used when one solves the Laplace equation.
