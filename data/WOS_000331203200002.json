This is due to the fact that the moving objects will cause ghosting artifacts to appear in the synthesized HDR image. To prevent such artifacts, a patching algorithm is required to correct motion regions such that all the moving objects are synchronized in the differently exposed images. In this paper, a new optimization problem is formulated to correct the motion regions of the multiple differently exposed images by considering both spatial and temporal consistencies. The resultant scheme is a hybrid patching scheme composed of a correction method which is an intensity mapping function at pixel level, and a hole-filling method that uses block-level template matching. The proposed patching scheme is not only robust to large intensity changes in these input images, but also at regions that are over-or underexposed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to prevent ghosting artifacts from appearing in the final synthesized HDR image.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Patching for a Sequence of Differently Exposed Images With Moving Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000331203200002"}
