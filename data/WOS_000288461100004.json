Key functionalities of the switch are traffic aggregation with time-slot interchanging functionality, optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) to wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) demultiplexing, and multi-wavelength 2R regeneration. Laboratory and field demonstrations show the excellent performance of the new concept with error-free signal transmission and Q-factors above 20 dB.", "paper_title": "An All-Optical Grooming Switch for Interconnecting Access and Metro Ring Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000288461100004"}
