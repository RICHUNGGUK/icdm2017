According to changes of color and camera motion, videos are classified into six types. By using features in compress domain such as DCT coefficients, the type of the MB, HSV color histogram difference, camera motion difference and so on, videos are segmented into three classes, that is, cut shot, gradual shot and non-change, The results of experiment have shown that this algorithm is robust for camera motion and walk-in of large objects in videos, and have better precision of shot boundary detection compared with the classic double-threshold method and the method of presented by Kuo et al.. There is no problem of threshold selection in our algorithm but it exists in most of other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Shot boundary detection algorithm in compressed domain based on Adaboost and fuzzy theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100076"}
