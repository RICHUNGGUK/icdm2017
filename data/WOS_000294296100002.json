This is equivalent to saying that the Laplacian of the sparsifier is a good preconditioner for the Laplacian of the original. We prove that every graph has a spectral sparsifier of nearly linear size. Moreover, we present an algorithm that produces spectral sparsifiers in time O(m log(c) m), where m is the number of edges in the original graph and c is some absolute constant. This construction is a key component of a nearly linear time algorithm for solving linear equations in diagonally dominant matrices. Our sparsification algorithm makes use of a nearly linear time algorithm for graph partitioning that satisfies a strong guarantee: if the partition it outputs is very unbalanced, then the larger part is contained in a subgraph of high conductance.", "paper_title": "SPECTRAL SPARSIFICATION OF GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000294296100002"}
