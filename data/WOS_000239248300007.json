Our purpose is to determine how the structure and thermochemistry (e.g., C-M bond lengths and strengths) of these organoalkali metal compounds depend on the metal atom, and to understand the emerging trends in terms of quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (KS-MO) theory. The C-M bond becomes longer and weaker if one goes from Li to the more electropositive Rb. Also, the polarity of the C-M bond increases along this series but it preserves a strong intrinsic preference to homolytic over ionic dissociation in the gas phase. We show that a description of the bonding mechanism in terms of a polar C-M electron-pair bond between the methyl radical and alkali metal atom is just as natural as an ionic description (i.e., in terms of CH3-+M+) and that it provides a straightforward way of understanding all observed trends.", "paper_title": "Structure and bonding of methyl alkali metal molecules", "paper_id": "WOS:000239248300007"}
