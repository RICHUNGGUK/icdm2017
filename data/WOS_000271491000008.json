Our purpose handled modes which are conceptualized by using multi-model approach. Each mode represents a running part of the system, depending on the requirements to enforce and resources to activate. The resulted framework aims to design each mode independently first, and resolves conflicting connections between them secondly. The proposal carries out a formal way to build the final ready-to-use control laws. A flexible manufacturing system illustrates this approach.", "paper_title": "Formal Approach to Multimodal Control Design: Application to Mode Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000271491000008"}
