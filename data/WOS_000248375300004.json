For this queueing system, we investigate the tail behavior of the queue size and the waiting time distributions. Specifically, we show that if the stationary distribution of DAR(p) input has a tail of regular variation with index -beta-1, then the stationary distributions of the queue size and the waiting time have tails of regular variation with index -beta.", "paper_title": "Regularly varying tails in a queue with discrete autoregressive arrivals of order p", "paper_id": "WOS:000248375300004"}
