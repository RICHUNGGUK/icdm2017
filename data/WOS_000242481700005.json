In this paper, we propose a procedural animation system, called rhythmic character animation playacting (RhyCAP), which allows a designer to interactively direct animated characters by adjusting rhythmic parameters such as tempo, exaggeration, and timing. The motions thus generated reflect the intention of the director and also adapt to environmental obstacle constraints. We use a sequence of martialart steps in the performance of a Chinese lion dance to illustrate the effectiveness of the system. The animation is generated by composition of common motion elements, concisely represented in an action graph. We have implemented an animation control program that allows Chinese lion dance to be choreographed interactively. This authoring tool also serves as a useful means for preserving this part of world cultural heritage.
