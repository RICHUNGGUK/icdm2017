In this note we investigate the line version of this result, that is, we want to find n lines in convex position in a sufficiently large set of lines that are in general position. We prove almost matching upper and lower bounds for the minimum size of the set of lines in general position that always contains n in convex position. This is quite unexpected, since in the case of points, the best known bounds are very far from each other. We also establish the dual versions of many variants and generalizations of the ErdAs-Szekeres theorem.", "paper_title": "Erdos-Szekeres Theorem for Lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000360702400008"}
