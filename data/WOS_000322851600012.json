Two of the major components of CCN are in-network cache functionality and content-based forwarding of user request. In this paper, we propose a pheromone-based cache replacement and forwarding algorithm called P-CCN, which is an interactive design encompassing cache management and request forwarding. The main ideas of the proposed scheme are to cache the content in the local area while avoiding duplicated caching and to utilize information about nearby cached contents in making forwarding decisions. Furthermore, the proposed forwarding algorithm with request redirection mechanism attempts to concentrate contents of a particular category in each node. We evaluate the proposed scheme against existing cache replacement policies and show that it leads to enhanced diversity of local cached content and reduced network load.", "paper_title": "Pheromone-Based Cache Replacement and Forwarding for Content-Centric Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000322851600012"}
