In this Work, we attempt to develop an authoring tool to generate shadow play animations according to user's high-level inputs by utilizing motion planning algorithms. The motion of a character in a shadow play show usually consists of intended primary motion and reactive secondary motion. We propose to use the RRT-Connect algorithm to generate primary motions and design two methods to facilitate the generation of secondary motions. For the character's upper body, we try to bias the search in the planner to prefer some motion pattern. For the lower body of the character, We modify its motion path by a simple pendulum, model and a collision-avoidance correction mechanism in a post-processing step. Through several illustrative examples, we have shown that we are able to generate realistic compliant motions for a character in a shadow play animation.", "paper_title": "An authoring tool for generating shadow play animations with motion planning techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400010"}
