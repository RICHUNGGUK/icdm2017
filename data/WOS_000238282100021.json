However, the confidence measure which is conventionally used for selecting association rules for classification may not conform to the prediction accuracy of the rules. In this paper, we propose a measure called prediction confidence to measure the prediction accuracy of association rules. In addition, a probabilistic-based approach for estimating prediction confidence of association rules is given and its performance is evaluated. The use of prediction confidence helps improve the performance of associative classifiers.", "paper_title": "Associative classification with prediction confidence", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100021"}
