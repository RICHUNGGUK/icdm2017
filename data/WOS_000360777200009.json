Spatial range queries are not only finding objects of interest within a certain range or radius, but feature a wide spectrum: from finding objects of interest to forming the range (or region). Therefore, in this paper, we coin a term \"Region Queries\" to indicate a broad category of spatial range queries. It is imperative to understand the full capabilities of region queries, before starting to work on processing and optimising such queries. The aim of this paper is to show a complete picture of region queries. In this study, we present taxonomy of region queries, comprising of three categories: (i) finding objects of interest, (ii) forming regions, and (iii) determining centroids. These three query types form a comprehensive view of what region queries are about. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
