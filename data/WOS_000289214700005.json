A major challenge in designing such a network is dealing with resource sharing among multiple channels. To achieve the best overall QoS in SON, we devise a new multi-channel live streaming scheme. First, we propose a multi-tree construction algorithm by infrastructure-based overlay multicast. The algorithm employs pre-allocated session degree constraints in overlay nodes to reserve resources for multiple channels, and constructs multiple trees by considering the total resource utilization of overlay nodes. Second, we propose a tree-aware queue scheduling algorithm to reduce the overlay processing delay in view of the entire overlay network. Scheduling priority is identified to trade off session priority with node location in different trees. From simulation and experimental results, the scheme achieves a differentiated control among different sessions, provides load balancing among overlay nodes, and improves the delay performance on SON.", "paper_title": "Multi-channel live streaming in service overlay network", "paper_id": "WOS:000289214700005"}
