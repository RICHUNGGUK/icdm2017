Prud'homme et al. in J. Fluids Eng. 124(1), 70-80, 2002, to the specific context of differential equations with random coefficients. After an elementary presentation of the approach, we review two contributions of the authors: in Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 198(41-44), 3187-3206, 2009, which presents the application of the RB approach for the discretization of a simple second order elliptic equation supplied with a random boundary condition, and in Commun. Math. Sci., 2009, which uses a RB type approach to reduce the variance in the Monte-Carlo simulation of a stochastic differential equation. We conclude the review with some general comments and also discuss possible tracks for further research in the direction.", "paper_title": "Reduced Basis Techniques for Stochastic Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000284330200006"}
