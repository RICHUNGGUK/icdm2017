The proposed scheme is suitable for any number of transmit antennas greater than two, and can achieve the transmit diversity order of two except two special cases. Simulation results are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and the performance of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A Simple Dispersion Matrix Design Method for Generalized Space-Time Shift Keying", "paper_id": "WOS:000359467200038"}
