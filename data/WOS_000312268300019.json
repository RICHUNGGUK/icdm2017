It is shown theoretically that the SNR is increased with the square root of the number of coils in the array if the array signals are properly combined to remove the mutual coupling effect. Based on this, a number of vertically stacked phased coil arrays have been designed and characterized by a numerical simulation method. The performance of these arrays confirms the significant increase of SNR by increasing the number of coils in the arrays. This provides a simple and efficient method to improve the SNR for low-field MRI systems.", "paper_title": "Increasing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio by Using Vertically Stacked Phased Array Coils for Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000312268300019"}
