In this article a catalogue of three generic circuit structures is presented. The first structure uses three passive elements to realize either two different grounded lossless negative inductances or two different lossless grounded frequency-dependent positive resistances, and uses four passive elements to realize two different grounded series connected negative resistance and negative inductance. The second structure uses three passive elements to realize a grounded lossless negative inductance and four passive elements to realize either a grounded series connected negative capacitance and a positive resistance or a grounded positive (or negative) series connected inductance and a positive resistance. The third structure uses three passive elements to realize either a grounded negative inductance in series with a negative resistance or a grounded negative capacitance divider in addition to the classical grounded negative impedance converter. Moreover, some of the previously reported immittance function realizations can be systematically obtained from the proposed generic structures.", "paper_title": "New grounded immittance function simulators using single current feedback operational amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000301376100010"}
