Both methods suffer from drawbacks such as time incoherence and occlusion popping for screen space methods or loss of detailed occlusion effects caused by geometry simplification for object space methods. We present an algorithm that combines both methods to overcome these drawbacks. To avoid over or underestimations during the combination, we use the Spherical Harmonics representation of the directional occlusion information. We therefore combine \"Screen Space Spherical Harmonics Occlusion\" (Herholz et al. in VMV, 2012) with \"Interactive Voxel Cone Tracing\" (CT) (Crassin et al. in Comput. Graph. Forum, 2011). The result is a directional occlusion approximation including both occlusions from distant or not directly visible objects and detailed occlusions effects from fine geometrical structures. To increase the quality of CT for occlusion sampling, we also present several extensions such as view dependent cascaded voxelization and a method for voxel coverage estimation.", "paper_title": "Dual space directional occlusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000322018100007"}
