We address practical and methodological issues, including how much model spin-up time is necessary; whether to run the model in \"site\" or \"regional\" mode; the importance of considering crop rotations; and the contribution of \"background emissions\" (emissions that occur when no crop is grown). We conclude that: 1) Spin-up time of 5-10 years may be sufficient to achieve steady-state N2O fluxes in many cases, 2) results between \"site\" and \"regional\" mode can differ greatly; 3) \"Site\" mode is preferable to \"regional\" mode as its use is more transparent and flexible, 4) Crop rotations have a modest, but observable effect on modeled emissions from US maize, 5) Background emissions, while generally low, can be very high in certain locations and should thus be considered.
