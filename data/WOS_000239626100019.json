In order to analysis mobile computation and understand the essential of mobile computing, in the paper we develop a denotational semantics for mobile computation. Here we take CLAIM, a computational language for autonomous, intelligent and mobile agents, as our object language because it characterizes the essential ingredients in mobile computation. After abstracting the syntax construction of CLAIM, we give its semantics description. This is achieved by structuring the semantics in layers working at three different levels: internal ambient, ambients and programs based on the basic concept: ambient. For each of these three levels, their semantics are defined in detail as well as the relationship between levels. Through our approach, we can also obtain an explicit model of behaviors in mobile computation.", "paper_title": "A layered semantics for mobile computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100019"}
