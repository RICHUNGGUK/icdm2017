Compared with the LIFDFS, the S-LIFDFS can offer us with a considerably reduced computational complexity. We first give a detailed description of its underlying principle. Based on the gradient descent method, an adaptive learning algorithm for the feedback parameters is next derived. We also discuss the application of this S-LIFDFS in time series prediction. Three evaluation examples including prediction of two artificial time sequences and the well-known Box-Jenkins gas furnace data are demonstrated here. Simulation results illustrate that with a compact structure, our S-LIFDFS can still retain the advantage of inherent dynamics of linguistic information feedback and is, therefore, well suited for handling temporal problems like prediction, modeling, and control.", "paper_title": "A simplified linguistic information feedback-based dynamical fuzzy system", "paper_id": "WOS:000281908300009"}
