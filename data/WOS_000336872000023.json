The methods proposed in this paper are supported by the fact that a kernel function can be written as a sum of kernel functions evaluated on each variable separately. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the use of adaptive distances, which are suitable to learn the weights of the variables on each cluster, providing a better performance. Moreover, various partition and cluster interpretation tools are introduced. Experiments with synthetic and benchmark datasets show the usefulness of the proposed algorithms and the merit of the partition and cluster interpretation tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
