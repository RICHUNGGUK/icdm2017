In the proposed approach, a weighted bipartite graph is constructed to model the color similarity between two shots. Then OM based on Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is employed to compute the maximum weight of a constructed bipartite graph as the shot similarity value by one-to-one matching among frames. To improve the speed efficiency of OM, two improved algorithms are also proposed: bipartite graph construction based on subshots and bipartite graph construction based on the same number of keyframes. Besides color similarity, motion feature is also employed for shot similarity measure. A motion histogram is constructed for each shot, the motion similarity between two shots is then measured by the intersection of their motion histograms. Finally, the shot similarity is based on the linear combination of color and motion similarity. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves better performance than other methods in terms of ranking and retrieval capability.", "paper_title": "OM-based video shot retrieval by one-to-one matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000247194700008"}
