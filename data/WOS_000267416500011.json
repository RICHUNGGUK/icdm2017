Sometimes because of incomplete information, the weights can only be estimated subjectively, which leads to an unsatisfactory result. The purpose of this paper is to describe an interactive technique to decide multi-criteria weights by multiple decision makers in the condition of incomplete information by means of virtual environment. Design/methodology/approach - The procedure assumed a problem with n criteria and r decision makers. The algorithms employed are presented. Findings - It was found that the proposed framework is an effective weight-deciding tool; the procedure quickly locates excellent compromise weights in a series of test problems. Originality/value - The methodology helps decision makers determine a most preferred final solution by the virtual environment especially when there is incomplete information. The procedures provide a mechanism to guide the decision makers towards an acceptable compromise solution, without requiring excessive decision maker input. Studies show that the procedure performs well in terms of solution quality, simplicity, computational requirements, convergence and flexibility.", "paper_title": "An interactive algorithm for deciding multi-criteria weights in incomplete information environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000267416500011"}
