The evaluation of our fully automatic retrieval system has been performed on a benchmark database of 10,745 real trademark images, supplied by the United Kingdom Patent Office. Comparative results show that our method actually outperforms other existing whole-image matching techniques, comprising features incorporated in the MPEG-7 standard. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
