We exhibit an example showing that this is no always the case. We also show that if the support of the given polyhedral complex satisfies a Minkowski-Weyl-type condition, then the answer is positive. As a consequence, we obtain a classification theorem for proper toric schemes over a discrete valuation ring in terms of complete strongly convex rational polyhedral complexes.", "paper_title": "When do the Recession Cones of a Polyhedral Complex Form a Fan?", "paper_id": "WOS:000295680100009"}
