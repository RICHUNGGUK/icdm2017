To decode QFHD (3840 x 2160, i.e., four times full HD) ultra high definition video, we minimize number of processing cycles, working frequency and amount of external memory traffic. We propose a novel filtering order and employ a 5-stage pipelined and resource-shared dual-edge filter to generate two filtering results every cycle. Taking advantage of skip modes, our filter takes only 48 cycles to filter a macroblock in the best case and 100 in the worst case. Furthermore, it eliminates most unnecessary off-chip memory traffic with a novel on-chip memory scheme. Our design can support QFHD at 30 fps application by running only at 98 MHz.", "paper_title": "A Two-Result-per-Cycle Deblocking Filter Architecture for QFHD H.264/AVC Decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000266332000010"}
