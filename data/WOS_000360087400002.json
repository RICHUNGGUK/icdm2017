The proposed scheme combines finite-element analysis, dual-corrected model-order reduction, and empirical interpolation. To assure the reliability of the results, improved a posteriori error bounds for the radiated power and directive gain are derived. Both the reduced-order model and the error-bounds algorithm feature offline-online decomposition. A real-world example is provided to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the suggested approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
