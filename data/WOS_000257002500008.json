In this paper, we introduce a multi-layered, middleware-driven, multi-agent, interoperable architecture for distributed sensor networks that bridges the gap between the programmable application layer consisting of software agents and the physical layer consisting of sensor nodes. We adopt an energy-efficient, fault-tolerant approach for collaborative information processing among multiple sensor nodes using a mobile-agent-based computing model. In this model the sink/base-station deploys mobile agents that migrate from node to node following a certain itinerary, either pre-determined or determined on-the-fly, and fuse the information/data locally at each node. This way, the intelligence is distributed throughout the network edge and communication cost is reduced to make the sensor network energy-efficient. We evaluate the performance of our mobile-agent-based approach as well as that of the traditional client/server-based computing model, vis-a-vis energy consumption and execution time, through both analytical study and simulation. We draw important conclusions based on our findings. Finally, we consider a collaborative target classification application, supported by our architectural framework, to illustrate the efficacy of the mobile-agent-based computing model.
