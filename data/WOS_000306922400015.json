Experimental results for the open-source Biquad filter core and the Scheduler module of the Illinois Verilog Model show that the deviations metric is computationally efficient and it correlates well with gate-level coverage for stuck-at, transition-delay and bridging faults. Results also show that functional test sequences reordered based on output deviations provide steeper gate-level fault coverage ramp-up compared to other ordering methods.", "paper_title": "Functional Test-Sequence Grading at Register-Transfer Level", "paper_id": "WOS:000306922400015"}
