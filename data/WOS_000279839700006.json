Based on both modelling and transformation activities it is possible to link models at different levels of abstraction in a classical forward engineering process in order to produce code or, in a reverse engineering process, to produce models from code by a bottom-up approach. But it can also be used to bridge the gap between models belonging to different domains that use different formalisms. This paper therefore focuses mainly on the transformation of decisional models belonging to the Enterprise Modelling domain into UML models used in the Information Technology domain. This kind of transformation is one component of a more general model-driven approach to solve business process interoperability problems or, more widely still, integration problems. More precisely, the paper describes two UML Profile definitions used to transform GRAI Grids into UML Use Case Diagrams or Activity Diagrams. The implementation of these Profiles with the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) is presented and results are compared and discussed.", "paper_title": "Transformation of decisional models into UML: application to GRAI grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000279839700006"}
