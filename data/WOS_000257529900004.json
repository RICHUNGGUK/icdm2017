Past research, however, is inconclusive in the elements that must be in place to achieve the benefits. In this study, we employ the software quality principle of flexibility as a mediator variable to determine if certain design aspects play a key role in achieving the benefits to the project of process standardization. A survey of computer professionals indicates that software flexibility is a positive influence. System designers should apply standard processes but with an eye toward quality design principles.
