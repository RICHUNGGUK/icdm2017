Our research goal is to satisfy scientists' basic information needs by collecting, archiving and providing access to scholarly event information. Furthermore, we aim to satisfy users' in-depth information needs by excavating scholarly meaningful information through reasoning about knowledge. A prerequisite to accomplishing this end is to define a description base for scholarly events to enable software agents to crawl and extract scholarly event data, and to facilitate unified access to this data. The collected data may then be mined for non-obvious knowledge. We present the design and implementation of an ontology for scholarly event description (SEDE) to achieve the research goal, and the application use case scenarios in scholarly event information space. The scenarios presented highlight the characteristics of the SEDE ontology.", "paper_title": "SEDE: An ontology for scholarly event description", "paper_id": "WOS:000276004300006"}
