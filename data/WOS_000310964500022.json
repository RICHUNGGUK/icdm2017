Research programme groups working in Slovenia in the 2004-2008 period in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, biotechnology, and medical science were used for analyses. The results of the analyses show that the effects of the two factors differ among the fields. We discuss possible reasons for this, including the possibility that differences are the result of Slovenia's science policy.", "paper_title": "Effects of international collaboration and status of journal on impact of papers", "paper_id": "WOS:000310964500022"}
