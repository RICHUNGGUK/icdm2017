The linear case has been tackled by many authors during the past few years. However, the polynomial case has not been studied in detail due to its theoretical and computational difficulties. This paper presents an algebraic approach for solving these problems. We propose a methodology based on transforming the polynomial optimization problem to the problem of solving one or more systems of polynomial equations and we use certain Grobner bases to solve these systems. Different transformations give different methodologies that are theoretically stated and compared by some computational tests via the algorithms that they induce. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
