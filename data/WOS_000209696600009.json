The FBS derives its optimal transmission power and radius of neighboring area (NA) according to its own location and the macro mobile station (MMS) distribution to maximize its ergodic capacity under the constraints of maximum FBS transmission power and MMS performance requirement. Moreover, the macro neighboring area is derived, within which the FBS avoids its deployment. Our simulation verifies the applicability and efficiency of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Power Control Based on Subcarrier Exclusion to Mitigate Downlink Cross-Tier Interference in OFDMA Tiered Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696600009"}
