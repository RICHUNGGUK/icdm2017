The proposed scheme is most favorable for overlapping cells where the users are demanding channels for heterogeneous applications such as chatting, web browsing, or voice and video streaming. The spectrum sharing optimization with the QoS guarantee (SSO-QG) is an optimal scheme that can operate in throughput enhancement mode, high reliability mode and collision avoidance mode based on the weight assigned to the corresponding QoS parameters in accordance with the demands of different applications. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of forming the optimal sharing pattern and meeting the stringent QoS requirements fairly enough according to the demands of the cell. Moreover, it reduces collisions with primary users. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
