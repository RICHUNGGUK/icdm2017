The general procedure of leaveone-out CV (LOO-CV) is to exclude one observation from the data set, to construct the fit of the remaining observations and to evaluate that fit on the item that was left out. In classical procedures such as least-squares regression or kernel density estimation, easy formulas can be derived to compute this CV fit or the residuals of the removed observations. However, when high-breakdown resampling algorithms are used, it is no longer possible to derive such closed-form expressions. High-breakdown methods are developed to obtain estimates that can withstand the effects of outlying observations. Fast algorithms are presented for LOO-CV when using a high-breakdown method based on resampling, in the context of robust covariance estimation by means of the MCD estimator and robust principal component analysis. A robust PRESS curve is introduced as an exploratory tool to select the number of principal components. Simulation results and applications on real data show the accuracy and the gain in computation time of these fast CV algorithms. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
