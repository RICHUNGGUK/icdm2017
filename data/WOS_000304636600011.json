This paper proposes a branch and bound for execution plan selection (BB4EPS) algorithm to solve the QSC problem. In the proposed BB4EPS algorithm, a universal QoS model is used to evaluate the QoS parameters for service composition, and the QSC problem is modeled as an extended flexible constraint satisfaction framework, in which the utility function is applied to build the objective function. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible and effective. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.
