The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A multi-scale approach is used to calculate the electromagnetic and thermal field distribution. Findings - The temperature perturbation due to the presence of flaws can be detected at the surface of the composite by an infrared camera. Originality/value - The developed 3D thermomagnetic model can be used to study the efficiency of the thermal inductive method for different kind of flaws, inductors and frequencies.", "paper_title": "Thermo inductive nondestructive testing method applied to CFRP", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500017"}
