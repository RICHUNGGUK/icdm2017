However, it suffers from two problems: (1) small sample size problem and (2) the performance is sensitive to the neighborhood size k. In order to address these problems, we propose an exponential locality preserving projections (ELPP) by introducing the matrix exponential in this paper. ELPP avoids the singular of the matrices and obtains more valuable information for LPP. The experiments are conducted on three public face databases, ORL, Yale and Georgia Tech. The results show that the performances of ELPP is better than those of LPP and the state-of-the-art LPP Improved1. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
