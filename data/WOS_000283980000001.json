Two problems arise: the person seated in a wheelchair must be able to approach an object and then grasp it. The placement of the mobility device has a significant influence on the grasping capabilities. We propose in this paper a unified method for evaluating the accessibility of objects in a domestic environment. The idea is to model the human articulated system and the mobility device and then to evaluate the existence of a global solution of the inverse kinematics. We propose to use our methodology to label a complete environment by checking at each point, whether it is accessible or not to a person, whose joint constraints are known, for moving in an indoor environment with obstacles.
