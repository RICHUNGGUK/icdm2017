It employs an improved transconductance feedback loop that senses the transconductance (gmT) accurately and enforces it to be equal to the conductance of a reference resistor. Experimental results in a 0.13-mu m standard CMOS technology under a 1-V power supply demonstrate a continuous programmable gmT range from 87 to 165 mu A/V with minimum fluctuation of +/- 2.4% and programmable deviation less than 4.5% from the reference value. The OpAmp achieves a unity-gain bandwidth of 3.7 MHz with a 95-pF load while only consuming 187 mu A of quiescent current. The figure of merit of the proposed OpAmp is 1879 MHz.pF/mA.", "paper_title": "1-V Low-Power Programmable Rail-to-Rail Operational Amplifier With Improved Transconductance Feedback Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000324650300013"}
