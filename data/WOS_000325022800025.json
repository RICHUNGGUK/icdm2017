Currently, these systems are moving from multi-core architectures to many-core architectures to enhance their computational capabilities. This trend would eventually cause network interfaces to be a performance bottleneck because these interfaces are few in number and cannot handle multiple network requests at a time. The consequence of such issue would be higher waiting time at the network interface queue and lower performance. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a process mapping algorithm, which attempts to improve inter-node communications in multi-core clusters. Our mapping strategy reduces accesses to the network interface by distributing communication-intensive processes among computing nodes, which leads to lower waiting time at the network interface queue. Performance results for synthetic and real workloads reveal that the proposed strategy improves the performance from 8 % up to 90 % in tested cases compared to other methods.", "paper_title": "Improving inter-node communications in multi-core clusters using a contention-free process mapping algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000325022800025"}
