We review some usual error functions, analyze their mathematical properties for data classification purposes, and introduce a new one, E(Exp), inspired by the Z-EDM algorithm that we have recently proposed. An important property of E(Exp), is its ability to emulate the behavior of other error functions by the sole adjustment of a real-valued parameter. In other words, E(Exp) is a sort of generalized error function embodying complementary features of other functions. The experimental results show that the flexibility of the new, generalized, error function allows one to obtain the best results achievable with the other functions with a performance improvement in some cases.
