The four-dimensional representation also avoids loss of information accompanying alternative 2D and 3D representation in which the curve standing for RNA structure overlaps and intersects itself, and resolves structures' degeneracy. The RNA pseudoknot also can be represented as four-dimensional representations. The examination of similarities/dissimilarities among the secondary structures belonging to different species illustrates the utility of our approach.", "paper_title": "RNA secondary structure mathematical representation without degeneracy", "paper_id": "WOS:000248087300014"}
