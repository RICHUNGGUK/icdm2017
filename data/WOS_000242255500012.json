It is shown that these two robust watermarking schemes have some security problems and are vulnerable to the counterfeiting attack. Specifically, given a watermarked image, one can make a statistical analysis on it to estimate the key parameters used for watermark insertion and forge the corresponding watermark into another image without knowing the secret key and even without explicitly knowing the watermark. In the simulation experiment, we successfully implement the attacks on these two robust watermarking schemes and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed counterfeiting attacking schemes.", "paper_title": "Counterfeiting attacks on two robust watermarking schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255500012"}
