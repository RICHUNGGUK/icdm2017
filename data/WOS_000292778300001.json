As part of the analysis, we introduce the notion of the 'Creativity Effects', which allow for a more precise analysis of the interaction between conscious/attended processing and that of which there is no consciousness. Two such effects are considered, one at a high level, which allows filling in from memory of apparently stimulus-free activity when noisy stimuli are unattended. This leads to increased confidence but also increased error rate. The other is at a lower cortical level, involving as it does increasing the size of relevant neuron receptive fields by removing attention; subsequent attended processing can then lead to increased accuracy in detecting noisy stimuli. These effects are applied to certain experiments [1-3] to explain how apparently attention-free awareness arises through a process in which attention actually plays a crucial role. It also shows that at least in these experiments, consciousness and attention are not independent (as has been claimed in [4, 5] and numerous other places).", "paper_title": "Consciousness Versus Attention", "paper_id": "WOS:000292778300001"}
