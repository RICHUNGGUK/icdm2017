In this paper, we consider a shared wireless medium as employed in a mobile ad hoc wireless network. We present and analyze a random access MAC algorithm that is combined with the use of directional beamforming formed by each transmitting mobile entity. Mathematical equations are derived to characterize the throughput performance of such a directional-ALOHA (D-ALOHA) algorithm. We describe the interferences occurring at each receiving node by considering both distance based and SINR based interference models. The D-ALOHA protocol includes the establishment of a (in-band or out-of-band) control sub-channel that is used for the transmission of location update messages. The latter is used for allowing mobile nodes to track the location of their intended destination mobiles. We present a separation property result that allows us to express the network throughput performance as a product of two factors: (1) a stationary factor that represents the system throughput performance under a perfect receiver location update process, and (2) a mobility factor that embeds the user mobility and location update processes in expressing the level of throughput degradation caused due to location update errors. We employ our derived mathematical equations, as well as carry out simulation evaluations, to present an extensive set of performance results. The throughput performance of such a beamforming based MAC protocol is characterized in terms of the system's traffic loading conditions, the selected beamwidths of the antennas at the transmitting mobiles, the mobility levels of the nodal entities and the bandwidth capacity allocated to the control channel used for location update purposes. We show that the D-ALOHA protocol can provide a significant upgrade of network performance when the transmitting nodes adapt their beamwidth levels in accordance with our presented control scheme. The latter incorporates the involved tradeoff between the attained higher potential spatial reuse factors and the realized higher destination pointing process errors, and consequently uses nodal mobility levels and channel loading conditions as key parameters.
