By utilizing the Lyapunov functional method combined with the inequality techniques, some sufficient conditions ensuring the passivity and global exponential stability are derived. Furthermore, when the parameter uncertainties appear in RDNNs, several criteria for robust passivity and robust global exponential stability are also presented. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.", "paper_title": "Passivity and Stability Analysis of Reaction-Diffusion Neural Networks with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000298051400022"}
