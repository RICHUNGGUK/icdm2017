Although ARMA - GARCH model has been widely used to characterize and model observed financial time series in stock markets at daily and lower frequencies (e.g., weekly, monthly), few studies occur on models which can characterize stock prices at very high sampling frequencies. We aim to improve ARMA-GARCH performance for high frequency data. Here, we attempt to incorporate autoregressive hidden Markov model (HMM) into GARCH style models to generate better backtesting results than existing models. We estimate and test ARMA-GARCH, ARIMA-IGARCH (autoregressive integrated moving average and integrated GARCH model), and FARIMA-FIGARCH (autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average and fractionally integrated GARCH) first and find that the white noise series is not i.i.d. Gaussian. Thus we apply the autoregressive HMM driven model to the white noise series and test it's forecasting effect. The results indicate that the standard ARMA-GARCH and our autoregressive-HMM-noises model can both performs good in daily S&P 500 log returns, while the autoregressive-HMM-noise model can do better in high frequency data.", "paper_title": "Improving ARMA-GARCH forecasts for high frequency data with regime-switching ARMA-GARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558700014"}
