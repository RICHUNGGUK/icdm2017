This article introduces a new strategy to effectively diffuse heat from NoC-based 3D CMPs. Runtime Dynamic Programming Network (DPN) is proposed to optimize routing directions and provide silicon temperature moderation. Both on-chip reliability and computational performance have been improved by 63% and 27%, respectively, with the DPN approach. This work enables a new avenue to explore the adaptability for future large-scale 3D integration.", "paper_title": "Thermal Optimization in Network-on-Chip-Based 3D Chip Multiprocessors Using Dynamic Programming Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341390100022"}
