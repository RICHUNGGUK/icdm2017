The proximity graph is selected to present the urban mrphology. The proximity graph considers the local adjacency among buildings, providing a large degree of freedom in object displacement and aggregation. Then, three principles of Gestalt theories, proximity, similarity, and common directions, are considered to extract potential Gestalt building clusters. Next, the Gestalt features are further characterized with seven indicators, that is, area difference, height difference, similarity difference, orientation difference, linear arrangement difference, interval difference, and oblique degree of arrangement. A support vector machine (SVM)-based approach is employed to extract the Gestalt building clusters. This approach transforms the Gestalt cluster extraction into a supervised discrimination process. The method presents a generalized approach for clustering buildings of a given street block into groups, while maintaining the spatial pattern and adjacency of buildings during the displacement operation. In applications of urban building generalization and three-dimensional (3D) urban panoramic-like view, the method presented in this article adequately preserves the spatial patterns, distributions, and arrangements of urban buildings. Moreover, the final 3D panoramic-like views ensure the accurate appearance of important features and landscapes.", "paper_title": "A spatial cognition-based urban building clustering approach and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000317833100005"}
