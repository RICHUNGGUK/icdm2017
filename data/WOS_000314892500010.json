Like field programmable gate array (FPGA) routing networks, the RIN is used to make reconfigurable interconnections among functional blocks. Unlike FPGAs, the network topology of a RIN is irregular as it is designed for a given set of routing requirements and optimized for the area cost subject to given delay constraints. In this paper, we propose an automatic design scheme for RINs, including routing specification formulation, graph modelings, network topology designs, routing algorithms and multiplexer-based network circuit implementation. The choice of the design scheme is based on the existing routing network design practices and research, which give feasible solutions. Our scheme is to optimize the designs with the choice of design parameters. A computer-aided design (CAD) tool is developed based on the design scheme, which takes a set of routing requirements as input and produces the corresponding RIN network topology and network circuit in hardware description language format. We present the area costs of various RINs generated by the CAD tool subject to delay constraints, and illustrate the RIN design scheme with a reconfigurable multistream video system.", "paper_title": "Design Automation Framework for Reconfigurable Interconnection Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000314892500010"}
