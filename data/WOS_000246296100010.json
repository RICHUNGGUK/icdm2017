The model follows a very basic paradigm: the public administration is composed of an unstructured network of entities that upload and download information objects to/from each other and to/from service repositories in order to deliver client-centered services. The architecture is based on widely available technologies such as HTTP, SSL, XML and PKI and it supports the implementation of life events, single access points, concurrent providers and integrated delivery channels. We argue that the proposed architecture permits the interconnection of almost any kind of government body and that it establishes a common ground upon which new standardization levels can be built. As a starting point, we also define a set of general requirements for one-stop e-government. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
