The subsampling-based watermarking schemes have drawn great attention for their convenience and effectiveness in recent years, but the traditional subsampling-based watermarking schemes are very vulnerable to the permutation attack. In this letter, the watermark information is embedded in the average values of the 1-level DWT coefficients to resist the permutation attack. The concrete embedding process is achieved by the quantization-based method. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can resist not only the permutation attack but also some common image processing attacks.", "paper_title": "A subsampling-based digital image watermarking scheme resistant to permutation attack", "paper_id": "WOS:000254605300031"}
