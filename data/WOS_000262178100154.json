Two input factors were examined with respect to the growth rate as the response factor. D-optimal experimental design technique was performed and the growth rate was characterized by NNets based on the BP algorithm. GAs was then used to search the desired recipes for the desired growth rate on the process. The statistical analysis for those results was then used to verify the fitness of the nonlinear process model. Based on the results, this modeling methodology can explain the characteristics of the thin Him growth mechanism varying with process conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
