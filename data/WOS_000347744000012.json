The phase detection possesses high precision while it suffers the problem of ambiguous integer cycles. We employ code correlation to aid the search of the integer, so the system is capable of ranging with high precision and long distance. Besides, the signal is transmitted with half-duplex mechanism to eliminate the code and phase offset between two transceivers. In our simulation, the measurable distance is up to 2 km, with ranging root mean square error RMSE approximately 10 cm under signal to noise ratio 13 dB.", "paper_title": "Half-Duplex Ranging System by Dual Frequency and Code Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347744000012"}
