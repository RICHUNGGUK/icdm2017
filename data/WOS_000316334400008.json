Under the assumption of short interest rate following uncertain processes, this study investigates the term-structure equation. This equation is first derived for valuing zero-coupon bond. Finally, analytic solutions of the uncertain interest rate equation are given when the process of interest rate is assumed to be the uncertain counterparts of the Ho-Lee model and Vasicek model, respectively.", "paper_title": "Uncertain term structure model of interest rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000316334400008"}
