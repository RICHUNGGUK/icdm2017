Concomitantly there has been substantial growth in theoretic frames, research, and substantive models. However, these approaches have often been fragmentary, dependent on the goals of disparate disciplines that are interested in differing aspects of information behavior. They often have been rooted in the most rational of contexts, libraries, where individuals come with a defined problem, or information technology systems, that have their own inherent logic. Attempts to extend this work to everyday life contexts often run into disquieting findings related to the benefits of ignorance and the seeming irrationality of human information behavior. A broader view of our social world leads us to richer policy implications for our work. We live in exciting times, in an increasingly flattened world, where the ability for people to assimilate information they find into coherent personal strategies is perhaps the critical modern survival skill.
