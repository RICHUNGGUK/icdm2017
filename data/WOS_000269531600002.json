The instability of linear complexity caused by changing a few symbols of sequences can be measured using k-error linear complexity. In their SETA 2006 paper, Fu et al. (SETA, pp. 88-103, 2006) studied the linear complexity and the 1-error linear complexity of 2 (n) -periodic binary sequences to characterize such sequences with fixed 1-error linear complexity. In this paper we study the linear complexity and the k-error linear complexity of 2 (n) -periodic binary sequences in a more general setting using a combination of algebraic, combinatorial, and algorithmic methods. This approach allows us to characterize 2 (n) -periodic binary sequences with fixed 2- or 3-error linear complexity. Using this characterization we obtain the counting function for the number of 2 (n) -periodic binary sequences with fixed k-error linear complexity for k = 2 and 3.", "paper_title": "Characterization of 2 (n) -periodic binary sequences with fixed 2-error or 3-error linear complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000269531600002"}
