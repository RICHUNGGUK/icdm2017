It is known that, despite its interesting features, DDA produces classifiers with high complexity, especially for large datasets. In this Letter a simple method to overcome this problem is proposed, which eliminates redundant units improving generalization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the good performance of our approach compared to previous methods. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
