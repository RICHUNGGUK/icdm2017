In order to handle the permutation-feasibility and precedence-constraint problems when updating the particle-represented sequence or solution for the RCPSP, a hybrid particle-updating mechanism incorporated with a partially mapped crossover of a genetic algorithm and a definition of all activity-move-range is developed. The particle-represented sequence should be transformed to a schedule (including start times and resource assignments for all activities) through a serial method and accordingly evaluated against the objective of minimizing project duration. Experimental analyses are presented to investigate the performances of the permutation-based PSO. The study aims at providing an alternative for solving the RCPSP in the construction field by utilizing the advantages of PSO.", "paper_title": "Permutation-based particle swarm optimization for resource-constrained project scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000235525800008"}
