The sequences in this signal set are given by both multiplicative character and additive character of finite field satisfies(p). Such a signal set consists of p(2) (p - 2) time-shift distinct sequences, the magnitude of the two-dimensional autocorrelation function (i.e., the ambiguity function) in both time and phase of each sequence is upper bounded by 2 root p at any shift not equal to (0, 0). Furthermore, the magnitude of their Fourier transform spectrum is less than or equal to 2. For a subset consisting of p(p - 2) phase-shift distinct sequences in this signal set, the magnitude of the ambiguity function of any pair is upper bounded by 4 root p. A proof is given through finding a new expression of the sequences in the finite harmonic oscillator system. An open problem for directly establishing these assertions without involving the Weil representation is addressed.", "paper_title": "New Sequences Design From Weil Representation With Low Two-Dimensional Correlation in Both Time and Phase Shifts", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500040"}
