Alternatively, a shock spectrum analysis (SSA) approach is presented to efficiently determine the dynamic demand of bridge structures under barge collisions. The shock spectrum is developed analytically based on the interaction analysis of barge-bridge collisions, which agrees with the numerical result. The combinational rules are then discussed for the developed SSA. In the case study, results obtained from the SSA are in agreement with the expected results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
