The polymer chains were approximated by linear sequences of beads on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. The system was athermal and the excluded volume was the only potential. The properties of the model system across the entire range of polymer concentrations were determined by Monte Carlo simulations employing a cooperative motion algorithm (CMA). The scaling behavior and the structure of the percolation clusters are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "The structure of percolated polymer systems: a computer simulation study", "paper_id": "WOS:000294735900011"}
