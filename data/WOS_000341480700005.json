By using the property of M-matrix, we establish a new differential inequality and a new L-operator inequality to be effective for non-autonomous Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems. Based on the inequalities obtained above, sufficient conditions ensuring the global exponential p-stability of the considered system are obtained. In addition, we derive sufficient conditions ensuring the global exponential stability of the corresponding autonomous systems. Our results improve some early results in the literature. One example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
