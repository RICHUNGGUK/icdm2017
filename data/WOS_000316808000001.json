When considering a model with uniform savings in the exchanges, the final distribution is close to the gamma family. In this paper, we implement these exchange rules on networks and we find that these stationary probability distributions are robust and they are not affected by the topology of the underlying network. We introduce a new family of interactions: random but directed ones. In this case, it is found the topology to be determinant and the mean money per economic agent is related to the degree of the node representing the agent in the network. The relation between the mean money per economic agent and its degree is shown to be linear.", "paper_title": "DIRECTED RANDOM MARKETS: CONNECTIVITY DETERMINES MONEY", "paper_id": "WOS:000316808000001"}
