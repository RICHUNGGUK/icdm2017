Existing fuzzy approaches assume that the relationship between a given object and a given property is a matter of degree in a scale L ( generally [0,1]). However, the extent to which \"object o has property a\" may be sometimes hard to assess precisely. Then it is convenient to use a sub-interval from the scale L rather than a precise value. Such formal contexts naturally lead to interval-valued fuzzy formal concepts. The aim of the paper is twofold. We provide a sound minimal set of algebraic requirements for interval-valued implications in order to fulfill the fuzzy closure properties of the resulting Galois connection. Secondly, a new approach based on a generalization of Godel implication is proposed for building the complete lattice of all interval-valued fuzzy formal concepts.", "paper_title": "Interval-Valued Fuzzy Galois Connections: Algebraic Requirements and Concept Lattice Construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000277761200004"}
