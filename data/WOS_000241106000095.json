This algorithm uses the existing fuzzy clustering technique to design function dictionary from a set of training data. The motivation is to enhance the local and quickly searching ability of basic matching pursuit algorithm. As a result, this method reduces computation complexity of matching pursuit algorithm. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm is efficacious for training large size pattern space.", "paper_title": "A new dictionary learning method for kernel matching pursuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000095"}
