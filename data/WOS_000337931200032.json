The beta multifractal wavelet model (beta MWM) recently has been introduced as a good choice to yield long range dependence (LRD) and fractal behavior for a job arrival process for parallel workload analysis. In this paper, based on the Multifractal Wavelet Model (MWM), we choose the three kinds of distributions for the multipliers, namely the symmetric a-distribution, a symmetric point-mass distribution, and a hybrid distribution, the influence which distributed multipliers had on the MWM was analyzed with the analysis and comparison between the real job arrival process and the synthesized one. We find that the choice of a-distribution wavelet multipliers A(j,k) is not necessary. For the job arrival process, we can use different distributed multipliers to control the wavelet energy decay in MWM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
