The mathematical formulation of the Level Set technique was extended and then implemented into a coronal plane model of the proximal femur to simulate the remodelling of internal structure and external geometry of bone into the optimal state. Results indicated that the proposed approach could reasonably mimic the major geometrical and material features of the natural bone. Simulation of the internal bone remodelling on the typical gross shape of the proximal femur, resulted in a density distribution pattern with good consistency with that of the natural bone. When both external and internal bone remodelling were simulated simultaneously, the initial rectangular design domain with a regularly distributed mass reduced gradually to an optimal state with external shape and internal structure similar to those of the natural proximal femur.", "paper_title": "Prediction of shape and internal structure of the proximal femur using a modified level set method for structural topology optimisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306667300007"}
