In this paper, we make use of the label propagation to propose a new weight measure, and present a supervised locality projection analysis (SLPA) method for plant leaf classification. Firstly, we apply Warshall algorithm to label propagation and get the label matrix, then incorporate it into the weight, which has a clear physical meaning. Secondly, multi-class data points in high-dimensional space are to be pulled or pushed by discriminant neighbors to form an optimum projecting to low dimensionality. Finally, the experimental results on two plant leaf databases show that the proposed method is quite effective and feasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
