The multiobjective comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer (MOCLPSO) also integrates an external archive technique. Simulation results (obtained using the codes made available on the Web at http://www.ntu.edu.sa/home/EPNSugan) on six test problems show that the proposed MOCLPSO, for most problems, is able to find a much better spread of solutions and faster convergence to the true Pareto-optimal front compared to two other multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms.
