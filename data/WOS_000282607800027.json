So, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of simulating regime channel treatments using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The process of training and testing of this new model is done using a set of available published filed data (371 data numbers). Several statistical and graphical criterions are used to check the accuracy of the model in comparison with previous empirical equations. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network was used to construct the simulation model based on the training data using back-propagation algorithm. The results show a considerably better performance of the ANN model over the available empirical or rational equations. The constructed ANN models can almost perfectly simulate the width, depth and slope of alluvial regime channels, which clearly describes the dominant geometrical parameters of alluvial rivers. The results demonstrate that the ANN can precisely simulate the regime channel geometry, while the empirical, regression or rational equations can't do this. The presented methodology in this paper is a new approach in establishing alluvial regime channel relations and predicting cross section geometry of alluvial rivers also it can be used to design stable irrigation and water conveyance channels.
