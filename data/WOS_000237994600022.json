We change the scenario environment parameters, such as link delay, speed of User Equipment (UE) and interference traffic rate, to show how diverse services are affected. The results with respect to bandwidth, end-to-end delay, handoff latency, packet loss and delay jitter are presented to provide thorough investigation of UMTS under various services. Additionally, we discuss the impact of co-channel interference and compare the performance in the situation with and without interference. Based on the results from simulations, we have drawn conclusions that (i) end-to-end delay and handoff latency are proportional to link delay so that they are not severely influenced by different services for a high value of link delay, (ii) the number of packet loss is not directly related to link delays or UE's speed, (iii) UE's speed does not affect the performance obviously, (iv) co-channel interference exists in UMTS, and so on.
