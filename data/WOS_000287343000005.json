Therefore, it is a challenging issue for an arriving mobile node to choose the most appropriate MAP to bind. This task must be carried out by considering the issues of load balancing, binding update and packet delivery cost minimization. This paper proposes a novel MAP selection scheme for hierarchical mobile IPv6 networks to allow a mobile node to discover the most appropriate MAP when there are multiple coexisting MAPs. This scheme is an enhancement to the adaptive MAP selection scheme. The proposed scheme improve the overall performance due to the consideration of the movement (direction) pattern of mobile nodes. Simulation results show that this scheme outperforms the existing cost models in terms of total binding update and packet delivery costs, ensuring a level of load balance similar to adaptive MAP selection scheme.
