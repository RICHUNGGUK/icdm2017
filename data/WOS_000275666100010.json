Sleeping care systems for the elderly are rare. In this paper, we propose a visual context-aware-based sleeping-respiration measurement system that measures the respiration information of elderly sleepers. Accurate respiration measurement requires considering all possible contexts for the sleeping person. The proposed system consists of a body-motion-context-detection subsystem, a respiration-context-detection subsystem, and a fast motion-vector-estimation-based respiration measurement subsystem. The system yielded accurate respiratory measurements for our study population.", "paper_title": "A Visual Context-Awareness-Based Sleeping-Respiration Measurement System", "paper_id": "WOS:000275666100010"}
