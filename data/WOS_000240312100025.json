In this paper, we define both a formalism and a methodology which, respectively, allow us to automatically analyse interactions based on specification consistency. For the latter (i.e. the methodology), we take advantage of both specifier expertise and formal methods.", "paper_title": "Feature specification and static analysis for interaction resolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000240312100025"}
