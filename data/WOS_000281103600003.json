This paper uses multi-agent technology to construct a multi-section flexible manufacturing system (FMS) model, and utilizes simulation to build a manufacturing environment based on JADE framework for multi-agent to combine with dispatching rules, such as shortest imminent processing time (SIPT), first come first serve (FCFS) earliest due date (EDD), and Buffer Sequence. This paper finds that using multi-agent technique for multi-section FMS model can enhance the production efficiency in practice. Meanwhile, in this study, multi-agent systems combined with dynamic dispatching can be used to identify the best dispatching rules combination for achieving largest throughput, and thus it can provide the reference for production scheduling in advance.
