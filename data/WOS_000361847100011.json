Also let E(G), LE(G) and LE+(G) be energy, Laplacian energy and signless Laplacian energy of graph G, respectively. In this paper, we obtain a relation between E(G), LE(G) and LE+(G) of graph G. Moreover, we present an upper bound on E(G) of graph G in terms of m and rank r.", "paper_title": "Relation between Energy and (Signless) Laplacian Energy of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000361847100011"}
