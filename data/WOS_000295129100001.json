In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on the Irradiance Caching scheme that allows us (1) to adjust the density of cached records according to illumination changes and (2) to efficiently render the high-frequency illumination changes. To achieve this, a new record footprint is presented. Although the original method uses records having circular footprints depending only on geometrical features, our record footprints have a more complex shape which accounts for both geometry and irradiance variations. Irradiance values are computed using a classical Monte Carlo ray tracing method that simplifies the determination of nearby objects and the pre-computation of the shape of the influence zone of the current record. By gathering irradiance due to all the incident rays, illumination changes are evaluated to adjust the footprint's records. As a consequence, the record footprints are smaller where illumination gradients are high. With this technique, the record density depends on the irradiance variations. Strong variations of irradiance (due to direct contributions for example) can be handled and evaluated accurately. Caching direct illumination is of high importance, especially in the case of scenes having many light sources with complex geometry as well as surfaces exposed to daylight. Recomputing direct illumination for the whole image can be very time-consuming, especially for walkthrough animation rendering or for high-resolution pictures. Storing such contributions in the irradiance cache seems to be an appropriate solution to accelerate the final rendering pass.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Records for Irradiance Caching", "paper_id": "WOS:000295129100001"}
