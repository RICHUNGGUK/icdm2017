A constant time buck-boost mode, which is inserted between buck mode and boost mode, is proposed to achieve smooth transition. With the proposed mode, the output ripple voltage is significantly reduced when the input voltage is approximate to the output voltage. Besides, the novel control scheme minimizes the conduction loss by reducing the average inductor current and the switching loss by making the converter operate like a buck or boost converter. The small signal model of the stepup/step-down DC-DC converter is also derived to guide the compensation network design. The step-up/step-down converter is designed with a 0.5 mu m CMOS n-well process, and can regulate an output voltage within the input voltage ranged from 2.5 V to 5.5 V with a maximum power efficiency of 96%. The simulation results show that the proposed converter exhibits an output ripple voltage of 28 mV in the transition mode.", "paper_title": "Design and Modeling of a High Efficiency Step-Up/Step-Down DC-DC Converter with Smooth Transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600025"}
