In addition, a simulation kernel which is a key component of the proposed simulation framework is implemented according to the concept of the combined discrete event and discrete time simulation. To evaluate the efficiency and applicability of the simulation framework proposed in this study, it is applied to the block erection process in shipbuilding. The result shows that the proposed simulation framework can provide the consistent, integrated development environment for a simulation system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
