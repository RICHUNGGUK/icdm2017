Competencies are improved or gained by executing qualifying tasks. A knowledge market paradigm is introduced to improve the fit between supply and demand of knowledge required by actors performing such qualifying tasks. The eventual work performed by actors can be atomically divided into execution tasks. Discrepancies may exist in the suitability match of actors and the execution tasks that have been allocated to them. Therefore, a knowledge workers market paradigm is introduced as a possible solution to improve the fit between actors and execution tasks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
