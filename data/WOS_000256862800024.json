In this process, the autocustomization of specific instruction set has always been a key part to support the automated design of ASIR The key issue of this problem's how to effectively reduce the huge exponential exploration space in the instruction identification process. To address this issue, we first formulate it as a feasible sub-graph enumeration problem under multiple constraints, and then propose a fast instruction identification algorithm based on a new model called basic convex pattern (BCP). The kernel technique in this algorithm is the transformation from the graph exploration to the formula-based computations. The experimental results have indicated that the proposed algorithm has a distinct reduction in the execution time.", "paper_title": "Fast custom instruction identification algorithm based on basic convex pattern model for supporting ASIP automated design", "paper_id": "WOS:000256862800024"}
