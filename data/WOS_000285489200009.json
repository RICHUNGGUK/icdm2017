This paper proposes a filter-based Boolean matching method, F-BM, which accelerates Boolean matching using lookup tables implemented by Bloom filters storing pre-calculated matching results. To show the effectiveness of the proposed F-BM, a post-mapping re-synthesis minimizing area which employs Boolean matching as the kernel has been implemented. Tested on a broad selection of benchmarks, the re-synthesizer using F-BM is 80X faster with 0.5% more area, compared with the one using a SAT-based Boolean matcher.", "paper_title": "Accelerating Boolean Matching Using Bloom Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000285489200009"}
