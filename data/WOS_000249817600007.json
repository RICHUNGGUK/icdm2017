Pore size distribution (PSD) is like the blueprint of a porous medium; all the hydraulic characteristics of the medium can be determined once it is known. However, the available experimental methods to determine the PSD are usually quite time consuming and expensive, yet they do not always provide accurate results. The porous medium is modeled using a modified capillary approach, where the capillaries are composed of sections with different diameters. The genetic algorithm has been tested for different population sizes and generation numbers, and the best possible combination is selected.", "paper_title": "A novel optimization process for prediction of complex pore geometry via genetic search", "paper_id": "WOS:000249817600007"}
