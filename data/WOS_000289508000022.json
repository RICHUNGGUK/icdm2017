Airlines have been very active in utilizing this form of strategic development. However, the selection of a suitable partner for a strategic alliance is not an easy decision, involving a host of complex considerations by different departments. Furthermore the decision-makers may hold diverse opinions and preferences arising due to incomplete information and knowledge or inherent conflict between various departments. In this study fuzzy preference programming and the analytic network process (ANP) are combined to form a model for the selection of partners for strategic alliances. The effects of uncertainty and disagreement between decision-makers as well as the interdependency and feedback that arise from the use of different criteria and alternatives are also addressed. This generic model can be easily extended to fulfill the specific needs of a variety of companies.
