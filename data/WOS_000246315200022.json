While, the commonly seen methodologies may be effective in solving the production-distribution problem only from supplier- or customer-oriented consideration, those cannot present the interactive relationship between upstream and downstream enterprises. In the competitive semiconductor industry environment, considering the viewpoints of the supplier and consumer simultaneously is particularly required, because multiple manufacturing and demanding steps are performed at separate situations, concurrently. In this paper, we propose an interaction-oriented approach, which bases on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methodology and proportional rule, to solve the semiconductor distribution problem with multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria. The developed approach gives an expected satisfaction for the all participators of the whole chain while the cooperative information is shared perfectly and effectively. Analysis results demonstrate the proposed methodology is efficient and effective through a real world case study. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
