Concentrating on this observation and motivated by the success of dictionary learning (DL) framework, in this paper, we propose to explicitly learn a class-specific dictionary (called particularity) for each category that captures the most discriminative features of this category, and simultaneously learn a common pattern pool (called commonality), whose atoms are shared by all the categories and only contribute to representation of the data rather than discrimination. In this way, the particularity differentiates the categories while the commonality provides the essential reconstruction for the objects. Thus, we can simply adopt a reconstruction-based scheme for classification. By reviewing the existing DL-based classification methods, we can see that our approach simultaneously learns a classification-oriented dictionary and drives the sparse coefficients as discriminative as possible. In this way, the proposed method will achieve better classification performance. To evaluate our method, we extensively conduct experiments both on synthetic data and real-world benchmarks in comparison with the existing DL-based classification algorithms, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
