The term e-science evolved as a new research field that focuses on collaboration in key areas of science using next generation computing infrastructures (i.e. co-called e-science infrastructures) to extend the potential of scientific computing. During the past years, significant international and broader interdisciplinary research is increasingly carried out by global collaborations that often share a single e-science infrastructure. More recently, increasing complexity of e-science applications that embrace multiple physical models (i.e. multi-physics) and consider a larger range of scales (i.e. multi-scale) is creating a steadily growing demand for world-wide interoperable infrastructures that allow for new innovative types of e-science by jointly using different kinds of e-science infrastructures. But interoperable infrastructures are still not seamlessly provided today and we argue that this is due to the absence of a realistically implementable infrastructure reference model. Therefore, the fundamental goal of this paper is to provide insights into our proposed infrastructure reference model that represents a trimmed down version of ogsa in terms of functionality and complexity, while on the other hand being more specific and thus easier to implement. The proposed reference model is underpinned with experiences gained from e-science applications that achieve research advances by using interoperable e-science infrastructures.", "paper_title": "Research advances by using interoperable e-science infrastructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000271723100002"}
