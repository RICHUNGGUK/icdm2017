Wireless multimedia services, such as wireless video streaming, mobile video game, and mobile voice over IP, will become the main applications of the future wireless Internet. To accommodate the growing volume of wireless data traffic and multimedia services, cognitive radio (CR) and Information-Centric Network (ICN) have been proposed to maximize the utilization of wireless spectrum and improve the network performance. Although CR and ICN have high potential significance for the future wireless Internet, few studies have been conducted on collaborative operations of CR and ICN. Due to the lack of infrastructure support in multi-hop ad hoc CR networks, the problem is more challenging for video streaming services. In this paper, we propose a Cross-layer Video Streaming Mechanism (CLISM) for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Information Centric Networks (CRAH-ICNs). The CLISM included two distributed schemes which are designed for the forwarding nodes and receiving nodes in CRAH-ICNs. With the cross-layer approach, the CLISM is able to self-adapt the variation of the link conditions without the central network controller. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLISM efficiently adjust video transmission policy under various network conditions.", "paper_title": "Cross-layer Video Streaming Mechanism over Cognitive Radio Ad hoc Information Centric Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047900008"}
