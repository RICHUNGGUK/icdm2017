However, CRs must form a cognitive radio network (CRN) so that the messages can be forwarded from source to destination, on top of a number of opportunistic links from co-existing multi-radio systems. Unfortunately, appropriate routing in CRN of coexisting multi-radio systems remains an open problem. We explore the fundamental behaviors of CR links to conclude three major challenges, and thus decompose general CRN into cognitive radio relay network (CRRN), CR uplink relay network, CR downlink relay network, and tunneling (or core) network. Due to extremely dynamic nature of CR links, traditional routing to maintain end-to-end routing table for ad hoc networks is not feasible. We locally build up one-step forward table at each CR to proceed based on spectrum sensing to determine trend of paths from source to destination, while primary systems (PSs) follow original ways to forward packets like tunneling. From simulations over ad hoc with infrastructure network topology and random network topology, we demonstrate such simple routing concept known as CRN local on-demand (CLOD) routing to be realistic at reasonable routing delay to route packets through.
