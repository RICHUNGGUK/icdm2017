By using this inequality, we give a convergence analysis result of Mann iteration scheme for approximating the fixed point of contractive mapping in a Frechet space. We also suggest and analyze some algorithms for solving a class of set-valued variational inclusions in Frechet spaces.", "paper_title": "Some algorithms for a class of set-valued variational inclusions in Frechet Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000288575900007"}
