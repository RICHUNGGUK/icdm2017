We utilize wireless sensors as the first layer to detect coordinates of moving objects in a secured area. Cameras are activated to capture image features for object classification and recognition. In order to reduce processing time, a hierarchical image extraction approach is developed. Global object features such as size and motion are acquired for classifying objects into a number of classes. If the moving object is considered suspicious, the cameras will be requested to capture detailed images for object recognition. Experimental results show that our system can achieve a high face recognition rate of 95.4% for the testing images captured by the surveillance system.", "paper_title": "An intelligent sensor network for object detection, classification and recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000250993900020"}
