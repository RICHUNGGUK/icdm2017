It was evaluated by simulating the patterns of action potentials and EEG waveforms observed in electrophysiological experiments. It differs from conventional artificial neural networks in relying on a landscape of chaotic attractors for its memory system and on a high-dimensional trajectory in state space for virtually instantaneous access to any low-dimensional attractor. Here we adapted this novel neural network as a diagnostic tool to classify normal and hypoxic EEGs.", "paper_title": "Normal and hypoxia EEG recognition based on a chaotic olfactory model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300081"}
