Firstly, the operational rules of 2-dimension uncertain linguistic variables are established and the related features are studied, and the distance formula of 2-dimensional uncertain variables is proposed. Then, the attribute weight can be calculated by utilizing the maximum deviation method, and ranking the order of the alternatives is done by TOPSIS method. Finally, an illustrate example is given to show the decision making steps and the effectiveness of this method.", "paper_title": "An extended TOPSIS method for multiple attribute decision making problems with unknown weight based on 2-dimension uncertain linguistic variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000343806200007"}
