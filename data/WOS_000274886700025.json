In the present paper, we investigate how these structure results can be applied to solve the edge-colouring problem in the class. We give computational complexity results for the edge-colouring problem restricted to C and to the subclass C' composed of the graphs of e that do not have a 4-hole. We show that it is NP-complete to determine whether the chromatic index of a graph is equal to its maximum degree when the input is restricted to regular graphs of C with fixed degree Delta >= 3. For the subclass C', we establish a dichotomy: if the maximum degree is Delta = 3, the edge-colouring problem is NP-complete, whereas, if Delta not equal 3, the only graphs for which the chromatic index exceeds the maximum degree are the odd holes and the odd order complete graphs, a characterization that solves edge-colouring problem in polynomial time. We determine two subclasses of graphs in C' of maximum degree 3 for which edge-colouring is polynomial. Finally, we remark that a consequence of one of our proofs is that edge-colouring in NP-complete for r-regular tripartite graphs of degree Delta >= 3, for r >= 3. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
