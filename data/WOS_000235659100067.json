It has the potential to significantly alter how processes occur and how companies operate. Currently, the development of RFID and Grid technologies has opened the door to many new RFID applications, many of which require transaction support. This paper proposes a transaction commit protocol which can ensure reliable execution of RFID applications in Grid environment, and a transaction compensating approach to undo committed sub-transactions. Reliable RFID applications can be realized by the proposed protocol effectively.", "paper_title": "Radio frequency identification (RFID) based reliable applications for enterprise grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100067"}
