We focus on a leapfrog in space and time scheme and the Preissman box scheme. We find that the numerical dispersion relations are monotonic and determine the relationship between the group velocities of the different numerical schemes. The group velocity dispersion is used to explain the qualitative differences in the numerical solutions obtained with the different schemes. Furthermore. the numerical dispersion relation is found to be relevant when determining the ability of the discretizations to resolve nonlinear dynamics. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
