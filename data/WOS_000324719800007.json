With the proposed scheme, the joint torque command is filtered and compared with a filtered torque estimate derived from the nonlinear dynamic model of MRR with joint torque sensing. Common joint actuator faults are considered with fault detection being performed independently for each joint module. The proposed fault detection scheme for each module does not require motion states of any other module making it an ideal modular approach for fault detection of modular robots. Experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection scheme. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
