Quan, D.P. Schmidt, A moving mesh inter-face tracking method for 3D incompressible two-phase flows, J. Comput. Phys. 221 (2007) 761 780] demonstrated the capability to accurately simulate multiphase flows, to handle large deformation, and also to perform interface pinch-off for some specific cases. However, another challenge, i.e. how to handle interface merging (such as droplet coalescence) has not been addressed. In this paper, we present a mesh combination scheme for inter-face connection and a more general mesh separation algorithm for interface breakup. These two schemes are based on the conversion of liquid cells in one phase to another fluid by changing the fluid properties of the cells in the combination or separation region. After the conversion, the newly created interface is usually ragged, and a local projection method is employed to smooth the interface. Extra mesh adaptation criteria are introduced to handle colliding interfaces with almost zero curvatures as the distance between the interfaces diminishes. Simulations of droplet pair collisions including both head-on and off-center coalescences show that the mesh adaptations are capable of resolving very small length scales, and the mesh combination and mesh separation schemes can handle the topological transitions in multiphase flows. The potential of our method to perform detailed investigations of droplet coalescence and breakup is also displayed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
