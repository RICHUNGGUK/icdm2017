In order to drive the OOD algorithm, we first analyze the loss probability of each priority class through class aggregation and iteration method; the analytic results obtained through the proposed algorithm are then validated with results garnered from extensive simulation tests.", "paper_title": "Optimal offset-time decision for QoS in optical burst switching networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249897600011"}
