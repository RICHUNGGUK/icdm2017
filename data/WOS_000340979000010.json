Under this assumption, we show that every fault-free edge of FQ(n) lies on a fault-free cycle of every odd length from n + 1 to 2(n) - 1. In terms of the number of tolerant faulty edges and embedding odd cycles in FQ(n), our result improves not only the result in Xu and Ma (2006) where vertical bar FFe vertical bar = 0, but also the previous best result gotten by Xu et al. (2006) where vertical bar FFe vertical bar <= n - 1. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
