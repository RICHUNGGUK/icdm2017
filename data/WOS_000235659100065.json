Spatial reasoning ought to play a very important role in spatial data mining, but the research combined SR and SDM are very few. This paper describes the conception and implementation of SRSDM, the tool for data mining in spatial databases based on spatial reasoning method. Most spatial data mining systems only support topological relation, nearly all previous GIS and AI researches focused on single spatial aspect. Those were quite inadequate for practical applications. We propose a new spatial knowledge representation which integrates topology, direction, distance and size relations. SRSDM includes three parts: extracting spatial relations, frameworks for traditional or new data mining algorithms.", "paper_title": "Spatial reasoning based spatial data mining for precision agriculture", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100065"}
