The construction of the states of the automaton is similar to the standard construction for LTL, but a different technique must be used to verify the fulfillment of until formulas. The resulting automaton is a Buchi automaton rather than a generalized one. The construction can be done on-the-fly, while checking for the emptiness of the automaton. We also extend the construction to the Product Version of DLTL.", "paper_title": "Tableau-based automata construction for dynamic linear time temporal logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000237823300004"}
