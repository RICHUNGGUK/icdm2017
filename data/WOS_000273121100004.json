Previous methods, either using grid-based method or distance-based method to separate feature from noise, suffer from the parameter choice problem, which may produce different point patterns in terms of shape and area. This paper presents the Collective Nearest Neighbor method (CLNN) to identify features. CLNN assumes that in spatial data clustered points and noise can be viewed as two homogenous point processes. The one with the higher intensity is considered as a feature and the one with the lower intensity is treated as noise. As a result, they can be separated according to the difference in intensity between them. With CLNN, points are first classified into feature and noise based on the kth nearest distance (the distance between a point and its kth nearest neighbor) at various values of k. Then, CLNN selects those classifications in which the separated classes (i.e. features and noise) are homogenous Poisson processes and cannot be further divided. Finally, CLNN identifies clustered points by averaging the selected classifications. Evaluation of CLNN using simulated data shows that CLNN reduces the number of false points significantly. The comparison between CLNN, the shared nearest neighbor, the spatial scan and the classification entropy method shows that CLNN produced the fewest false points. A case study using seismic data in southwestern China showed that CLNN is able to identify foreshocks of the Songpan earthquake (M=7.2), which may help to locate the epicenter of the Songpan earthquake.
