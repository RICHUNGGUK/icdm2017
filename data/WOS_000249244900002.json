We compute the histogram of the local contrast at each pixel and model it as a mixture of two exponential distributions - one for the focused and the other for the defocused region. Unlike the mixture of Gaussian distributions, a mixture of exponential distributions overlaps with same monotonicity over the entire range in [0, infinity) and it is difficult to separate into components. We estimate the parameters of these distributions using the EM algorithm. This is followed by a hypothesis testing which segments the focused region in the low depth of field image. A content-based retrieval scheme is now confined to the detected region for a proper retrieval. Experimental results for both segmentation and image retrieval using a database consisting of 4986 images are presented to show the efficacy of the suggested scheme. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
