Bayesian classifier is usually adopted for image semantic annotation which classifies image features into class labels. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of classifier in image annotation, we propose a combined optimization method which incorporates affinity propagation algorithm, optimizing training data algorithm, and modeling prior distribution with Gaussian mixture model to build Bayesian classifier. The experiment results illustrate that the classifier performance is improved for image semantic annotation with proposed method.", "paper_title": "Image modeling with combined optimization techniques for image semantic annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000294910400010"}
