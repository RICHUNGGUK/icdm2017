Collegial practice transfer aims to offer new models for in-service teacher training. The process included guiding sessions, training materials presenting authentic pedagogical examples, and tryouts in the classroom. The success of practice transfer was examined through comparing the classroom practices of more- and less-experienced teachers applying the Pedagogical Infrastructure Framework, and through analyzing the tutored teachers' self-reported experiences in interviews. The process provided flexible support and gave self-confidence to the less-experienced teachers. Technology use was successful, but the tutored teachers designed less coherent tasks and weaker support for pupils' collaboration, knowledge construction and metacognition than their more-experienced colleagues. When tutoring, underlying educational ideologies and reasons should be explicated in addition to practical issues of classroom orchestration and technology use. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
