In contrast to conventional approaches, fuzzy spatial models induce a substantial degree of individual and collective indifference over alternatives. Hence, existing definitions of the covering relationship return differing results. We develop a definition for a fuzzy covering relation. Our definition results in an uncovered set that is, in most cases, contained within the Pareto set. We conclude by characterizing the exceptions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
