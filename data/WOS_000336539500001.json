Owning to the existence of many missing values, PCM is difficult to produce a good clustering result in real time. The paper proposes a distributed weighted possibillistic c-means clustering algorithm (DWPCM), which works in three steps. First the paper applies the partial distance strategy to PCM (PDPCM) for calculating the distance between any two objects in the incomplete data set. Further, a weighted PDPCM algorithm (WPCM) is designed to reduce the corruption of missing values by assigning low weight values to incomplete data objects. Finally, to improve the cluster speed of WPCM, the cloud computing technology is used to optimize the WPCM algorithm by designing the distributed weighted possibilistic c-means clustering algorithm (DWPCM) based on MapReduce. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can produce an appropriate partition efficiently for incomplete big sensor data.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Weighted Possibilistic c-Means Algorithm for Clustering Incomplete Big Sensor Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000336539500001"}
