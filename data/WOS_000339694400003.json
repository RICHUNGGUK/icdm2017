In many real world scenarios, inputs or outputs may be shared among various activities. This paper proposes a two-stage DEA model with additional input in the second stage and part of intermediate products as final output. We first discuss the non-cooperative condition in order to determine the upper and lower bounds of the efficiencies of sub-DMUs in different stages. A parametric transformation is described to solve the non-linear programming of the overall cooperative efficiency model. An application is provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
