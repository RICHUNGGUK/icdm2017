In this paper an ECG compression/decompression architecture based on the bit-field preserving (BFP) and running length encoding (RLE)/decoding schemes incorporated with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is proposed. Compared to complex and repetitive manipulations in the set partitioning in hierarchical tree (SPIHT) coding and the vector quantization (VQ), the proposed algorithm has advantages of simple manipulations and a feedforward structure that would be suitable to implement on very-large-scale integrated circuits and general microcontrollers.
