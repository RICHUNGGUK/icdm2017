During this time, the relationship between the query frequency and the data production frequency will change, which is an important feature to affect the energy consumption of the event-based ad hoc query processing in sensor networks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data transmission algorithm, which takes the relationship into account. Experiments shows that our adaptive algorithm can save more energy than the traditional data centric storage algorithm.", "paper_title": "Adaptive data transmission algorithm for event-based ad hoe query", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100032"}
