A genetic algorithm is developed in which an effective binary coding based on the problem properties is presented, and a heuristic for sequencing the batches given the hatching structure is proposed. Computational experiments show that the proposed genetic algorithm performs well in solving the problem, and is capable of effectively solving large problems involving 400 jobs.", "paper_title": "A genetic algorithm for the batch scheduling with sequence-dependent setup times", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300147"}
