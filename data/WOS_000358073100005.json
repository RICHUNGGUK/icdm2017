Most studies focus on analyzing the whole network from the perspective of topology or contents. However, there is still no systematic model proposed for multi-dimensional analysis on big social media data. Furthermore, little work has been done on identifying emerging new popular phrases and analyzing them multi-dimensionally. In this paper, the authors first propose an interactive systematic framework. In order to detect the emerging new popular phrases effectively and efficiently, they present an N-Pat Tree model and give some filtering mechanisms. They also propose an algorithm to find and analyze new popular phrases multi-dimensionally. The experiments on one-year Tencent-Microblogs data have demonstrated the effectiveness of their work and shown many meaningful results.", "paper_title": "Identifying and Analyzing Popular Phrases Multi-Dimensionally in Social Media Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000358073100005"}
