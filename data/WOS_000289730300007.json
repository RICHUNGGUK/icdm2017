The design of a spectrum sharing scheme for WSNs to enable coexistence with geographically collocated heterogeneous wireless systems having multiple parallel interfering channels is a persistent challenge. In this context, interference identification and channel ranking in terms of spectrum access opportunities are addressed in this paper. The goal is to develop a low complexity channel ranking algorithm from channel energy measurements at sensors when a packet-reception-ratio to signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (PRR-SINR) interference model is unavailable at network initialization phase. The interference characterizing estimators, temporal occupancy and strength level of a channel, are proposed for interference identification. The effectiveness of the estimators is tested on a sensor platform at 2.4 GHz ISM band under interference from WLAN. Subsequently, the impact of the interference estimators on a channel quality from a receiver perspective is determined with a decision theoretic approach. The estimators are weighted according to their influence on the fitness of a channel and channel ranking is established. The proposed channel ranking achieves a significant gain over heuristic channel ranking (HCR) and gives an accurate interference profile of the channels.", "paper_title": "A decision theoretic approach for channel ranking in crowded unlicensed bands", "paper_id": "WOS:000289730300007"}
