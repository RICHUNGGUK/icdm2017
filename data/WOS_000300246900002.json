This product code improves Donoho's deterministic construction by using a probabilistic approach. More specifically, our construction corrects more errors than the Donoho matrices by allowing a vanishingly small probability of error (with the increase in block size). The problem of decoding the long block code is decoupled into two sets of parallel Linear Programming problems. This leads to a significant reduction in decoding complexity as compared to one-step Linear Programming decoding.", "paper_title": "Analog Product Codes Decodable by Linear Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900002"}
