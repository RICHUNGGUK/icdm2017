Search of similar parts for a given query part is the key to avoid this problem by facilitating design reuse. Most search algorithms convert the CAD model into a shape signature and compute the similarity between two models according to a measure function of their signatures. However, each algorithm defines the shape signature in a different way, and thus has its own limitations in discriminating 3D parts. This paper proposes a search scheme that successfully complements various shape signatures in similarity assessment of 3D mechanical components. It considers form-feature, topological, and geometric information in component comparison. Such an integrated approach can effectively solve the feature intersection problem, inherited in any feature-based approaches, and capture the user's intent more precisely in the search, which geometry-based methods fail to accomplish. We also develop a set of algorithms that performs the component comparison in a polynomial time. The proposed scheme is implemented in a product design environment consisting of commercial CAD and PDM systems. The result demonstrates the practicality of this work in automatic search of similar mechanical components for design reuse. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
