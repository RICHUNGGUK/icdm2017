Applications of model checking in systems biology have revealed that temporal logics should be able to capture both branching-time and fairness properties (needed for specifying multistability and oscillation properties, respectively). At the same time, they should have a user-friendly syntax easy to employ by non-experts. In this paper, we define Computation Tree Regular Logic (CTRL), an extension of CTL with regular expressions and fairness operators that attempts to match these criteria. CTRL subsumes both CTL. and LTL, and has a reduced set of temporal operators indexed by regular expressions. We also develop a translation of CTRL into Hennessy-Milner Logic with Recursion (HMLR), an equational variant of the modal mu-calculus. This has allowed us to obtain an on-the-fly model checker with diagnostic for CTRL by directly reusing the verification technology available in the CADP toolbox. We illustrate the application of the CTRL model checker by analyzing the GRN controlling the carbon starvation response of Escheichia coli. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
