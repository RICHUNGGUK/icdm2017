These proprietary systems make it difficult to extend systems to support new services, integrate new data, and interoperate with other M2M systems. This issue motivated various standard organizations to establish a new partnership project, the \"oneM2M Global Initiative,\" to standardize a common M2M service layer platform for globally applicable and access-independent M2M services. This article presents a snapshot of the latest progress in oneM2M standardization such as the requirements, agreed architecture, candidate protocols, security aspects, and device management and abstraction technologies.", "paper_title": "TOWARD A STANDARDIZED COMMON M2M SERVICE LAYER PLATFORM: INTRODUCTION TO ONEM2M", "paper_id": "WOS:000339167500006"}
