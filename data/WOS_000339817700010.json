With the development of the certificateless public key cryptography (CLPKC), many certificatelss signcryption (CLSC) schemes using bilinear pairing hve been proposed. Comparated other operations, the bilinear pairing operaion is much more compulicated. Therefore, CLSC scheme without bilinear pairing is more suitable for applications. Recently, Jing et al. proposed a CLSC scheme without bilinear pairing and claimed their scheme is secure against two types of adversaries. In this paper, we will show their scheme provide neither unforgeability property nor confidentiality property. To improve security, we also propose a new CLSC scheme without pairing and demonstrate it is provably secure in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis and improvement of a certificateless signcryption scheme without bilinear pairing", "paper_id": "WOS:000339817700010"}
