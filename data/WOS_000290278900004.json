Code runs under the financial responsibility of owners; they must pay to use resources, but may profit by providing them. We provide a proof methodology for processes described in Picost based on bisimulations. The underlying behavioural theory is justified via a contextual characterisation. We also demonstrate its usefulness via examples.", "paper_title": "A CALCULUS FOR COSTED COMPUTATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290278900004"}
