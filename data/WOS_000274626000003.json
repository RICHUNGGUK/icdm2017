Bond formability provides all interesting piece of information that might be used for selecting strategic bonds during a retrosynthesic analysis or for assessing synthetic accessibility in virtual screening. The article describes a graph-mining algorithm called GemsBond that evaluates formability of bonds by mining structural environments contained in several thousand molecular graphs of reaction products. When tested on reaction databases, GemsBond recognizes most formed bonds in reaction products and provides explanations consistent with knowledge in organic synthesis.", "paper_title": "Graph-Mining Algorithm for the Evaluation of Bond Formability", "paper_id": "WOS:000274626000003"}
