The protocol must insure reception and termination. In this paper, we measure the complexity of the protocol in term of header size, i.e., the quantity of information that must be attached to the packets to insure their delivery. We show that headers of Omega(log log tau) bits are required in every network, where tau denotes the treewidth of the network. In planar networks, Omega(log tau) bits are required.
