However, creating and displaying high resolution HDR content on CPUs is a time consuming task. Although some previous work focused on real-time tone mapping, implementation of a full HDR imaging (HDRI) pipeline on the GPU has not been detailed. In this article we aim to fill this gap by providing a detailed description of how the HDRI pipeline, from HDR image assembly to tone mapping, can be implemented exclusively on the GPU. We also explain the trade-offs that need to be made for improving efficiency and show timing comparisons for CPU versus GPU implementations of the HDRI pipeline.", "paper_title": "High dynamic range imaging pipeline on the GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000354715300007"}
