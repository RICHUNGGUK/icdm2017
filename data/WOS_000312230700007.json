Large-scale systems such as computational grids consume a significant amount of energy due to their massive sizes. The energy and cooling costs of such systems are often comparable to the procurement costs over a year period. In this survey, we will discuss allocation and scheduling algorithms, systems, and software for reducing power and energy dissipation of workflows on the target platforms of single processors, multicore processors, and distributed systems. Furthermore, recent research achievements will be investigated that deal with power and energy efficiency via different power management techniques and application scheduling algorithms. The article provides a comprehensive presentation of the architectural, software, and algorithmic issues for energy-aware scheduling of workflows on single, multicore, and parallel architectures. It also includes a systematic taxonomy of the algorithms developed in the literature based on the overall optimization goals and characteristics of applications.", "paper_title": "Energy- and Performance-Aware Scheduling of Tasks on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312230700007"}
