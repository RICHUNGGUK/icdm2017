Individuals in themodel are mobile agentswho are allowed to perform the inter-community (i.e., long-range) motion with the probability p. The mean-field theory is utilized to derive the critical threshold (lambda(C)) of epidemic spreading inside separate communities and the influence of the long-range motion on the epidemic spreading. The results indicate that lambda(C) is only related with the population density within the community, and the long-range motion will make the original disease-free community become the endemic state. Large-scale numerical simulations also demonstrate the theoretical approximations based on our new epidemic model. The current model and analysis will help us to further understand the propagation behavior of real epidemics taking place on social networks.", "paper_title": "SIS model of epidemic spreading on dynamical networks with community", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971100010"}
