In the fluid mechanics setting, these are typically the Stokeslet (the kernel of the single layer potential) or the Stresslet (the kernel of the double layer potential). In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for the rapid evaluation of such fields, using a decomposition into a small number of Coulombic N-body problems, following an approach similar to that of Fu and Rodin [Y. Fu, G.J. Rodin, Fast solution methods for three-dimensional Stokesian many-particle problems, Commun. Numer. Meth. En. 16 (2000) 145-149]. While any fast summation algorithm for Coulombic interactions can be employed, we present numerical results from a scheme based on the most modern version of the fast multipole method [H. Cheng, L. Greengard, V. Rokhlin, A fast adaptive multipole algorithm in three dimensions, J. Comput. Phys. 155 (1999) 468-498]. This approach should be of value in both the solution of boundary integral equations and multiparticle dynamics.
