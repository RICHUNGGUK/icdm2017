We analyze the median aggregation operator for AIFS and IVFS. Different mathematical theories have lead to different definitions of the median operator. We look at the median from various perspectives: as an instance of the intuitionistic ordered weighted averaging operator, as a Fermat point in a plane, as a minimizer of input disagreement, and as an operation on distributive lattices. We underline several connections between these approaches and summarize essential properties of the median in different representations.", "paper_title": "Aggregation for Atanassov's Intuitionistic and Interval Valued Fuzzy Sets: The Median Operator", "paper_id": "WOS:000304905500007"}
