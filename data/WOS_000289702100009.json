The two objectives are generally correlated with each other and usually, they cannot be maximized simultaneously. We adopt a lexicographic method to solve this multi-objective programming problem. First, we recursively induce the Max-Min lifetime for the aggregation cluster. Under the given Max-Min lifetime, we then formulate the problem of maximizing fairness as a convex optimization problem, and derive the optimal rate allocation strategy by iterations. We also present low-complexity algorithms that an aggregation cluster can use to determine the Max-Min network lifetime and the fair rate allocation. Our simulation results validate our analytical results and illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
