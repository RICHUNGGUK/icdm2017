In this article, we present IODetector: a lightweight sensing service that runs on the mobile phone and detects the indoor/outdoor environment in a fast, accurate, and efficient manner. Constrained by the energy budget, IODetector primarily leverages lightweight sensing resources, such as light sensors, magnetism sensors, and cell tower signals. For universal applicability, IODetector assumes no prior knowledge (e.g., fingerprints) of the environment and uses only on-board sensors common to mainstream mobile phones. Being a generic and lightweight service component, IODetector greatly benefits many location-based and context-aware applications. We prototype the IODetector on Android mobile phones and evaluate the system comprehensively with data collected from 34 traces that include 133 different places during a 6-week period, employing different phone models. We further perform a case study where we make use of IODetector to instantly infer the GPS availability and localization accuracy in different indoor/outdoor environments.", "paper_title": "IODetector: A Generic Service for Indoor/Outdoor Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000351443600007"}
