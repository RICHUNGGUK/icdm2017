The approach consists in modeling complex wavelet coefficients of both luminance and chrominance components separately leading to a multi-modeling approach. The copula theory allows to take into account the spatial dependencies which exist within the intra-luminance sub-bands via the luminance model M-L, and also between the inter-chrominance subband coefficients via the chrominance model M-CT The multi-model, i.e. M-L and M-CT, is used to develop a Bayesian classifier based on the softmax principal. To derive the classifier, we propose a closed-form expression for the Rao geodesic distance between two copulas. Experiments on two sub-families of luminance-chrominance color spaces namely Lab and HSV have been carried out for a wide range of color texture databases. The combination of different statistical sub-models show that the multi-modeling performs better than some existing methods in term of classification rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
