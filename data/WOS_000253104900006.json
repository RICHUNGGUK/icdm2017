There are several types of support for users exploring a software package. Animated demonstrations show how experts use an application, and training wheels interfaces offer a secure environment for exploration. To support different types of learners, external help should be adapted according to learner characteristics. The study presented in this article investigates effects of different support types in combination with the computer self-efficacy of learners. Young students (8th graders) were supported with text manuals, animated demonstrations, or animated demonstrations combined with a training wheels interface. In this context, they had to solve problems in physics and mathematics with a spreadsheet program. Results showed that animated demonstrations outperformed text manuals in many cases. Training wheels interfaces seemed to have disadvantages compared to unmodified user interfaces. In addition, motivational aspects have been investigated. Subjects with high computer self-efficacy scores were more motivated than their counterparts. Statistics (analysis of variance) revealed no interaction effects between the treatment and computer self-efficacy. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
