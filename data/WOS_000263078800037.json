In the SDWM CAM, a small pmos has to be used to keep a noise margin, but it degrades performance significantly. To resolve this problem, a conditional driver is introduced in the proposed serial-parallel CAM. Performance is improved by 28.0% without additional power consumption at a cost of about 5.6% increased area when the total bit number is 32 with four series bits and 30% of VDD is allowed as noise.", "paper_title": "Serial-Parallel Content Addressable Memory with a Conditional Driver (SPCwCD)", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078800037"}
