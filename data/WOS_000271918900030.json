The bidirectional option is introduced and option model with single cycle is established in this paper, in the light of fluctuant price and stable price, respectively. While the food price is fluctuation, it is assumed the market demand is correlation with price. For the situation of stable price, we allow retailer to reorder at the third stage to improve the flexibility of the food supply chain. How bidirectional options provide flexibility to a food retailer when market changes in the second period is shown, and the optimal policy for each stage is presented. Besides, the implication of such arrangements between a retailer and a supplier for coordination of the channel is studied. At last, the model is discussed through a numerical example, and the result shows that the supplementary ordering way with bidirectional option is useful to reduce the risk of food supply chain and enhance the profit of the whole supply chain for the food with short life cycle.", "paper_title": "OPTIMIZED ORDERING STRATEGY FOR FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN WITH BIDIRECTIONAL OPTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900030"}
