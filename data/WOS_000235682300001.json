Drawbacks of fluoroscopic guidance are the fact that the presented images are 2D projections and that both the patient and the clinician are exposed to radiation. Image-guided navigation using pre-interventionally acquired 3D MR or CT data is an alternative. However, this often requires invasive anatomical landmark-based, marker-based or surface-based image-to-patient registration. In this paper, a coupling between an image-guided navigation system and an intraoperative C-arm X-ray device with 3D imaging capabilities (313 rotational X-ray (3DRX) system) that enables direct navigation without invasive image-to-patient registration on 3DRX volumes, is described and evaluated. The coupling is established in a one-time preoperative calibration procedure. The individual steps in the registration procedure are explained and evaluated. The acquired navigation accuracy using this coupling is approximately one millimeter.
