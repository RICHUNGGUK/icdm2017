To employ spatio-temporal information, we present a novel histogram representation obtained by statistics on temporal changes of sparse coding coefficients frame by frame in the spatial pyramids constructed from videos. The histograms are further fed into a support vector machine with a spatial pyramid matching kernel for final action classification. We validate our method on two benchmarks, KTH and UCF Sports, and experiment results show the effectiveness of our method in human action recognition.", "paper_title": "Statistics on Temporal Changes of Sparse Coding Coefficients in Spatial Pyramids for Human Action Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422200013"}
