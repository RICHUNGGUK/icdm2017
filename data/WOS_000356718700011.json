Recent proposals are primarily limited to leveraging uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to handle power mismatching, and therefore lack the capability of efficiently handling the irregular peak power mismatches. In this paper we propose hPower, the first heterogeneous energy buffering strategy that incorporates supercapacitors into existing datacenters to handle power mismatch. Our technique exploits power supply diversity and smart load assignment to provide efficiency-aware and emergency-aware power mismatch management. We show that hPower could improve energy efficiency by 30 percent, extend UPS lifetime by 4.3 x, and reduce system downtime by 36 percent. It allows datacenters to adapt themselves to various power supply anomalies, thereby improving operational efficiency and resiliency.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Heterogeneous Power for Improving Datacenter Efficiency and Resiliency", "paper_id": "WOS:000356718700011"}
