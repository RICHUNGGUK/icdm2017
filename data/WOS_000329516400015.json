But to the best of our knowledge, no automatic analysis system was developed to realize the quantitative computer-aided analysis. In this paper, we propose a system to perform the automatic detection of DGR in the ultrasonic image sequences by applying the automatic motion analysis. The motion field is estimated based on image velocimetry. Then, an intelligent motion analysis is applied. For the DGR detection, the motion and structural information is combined to analyze the transploric motion of the fluid. In order to test the performance of the proposed system, we designed the experiment with the real and synthetic ultrasonic data. The proposed system achieved a good performance in the DGR detection. The automatic results were accordant with the gold standard in analyzing the fluid motion. The proposed system is supposed to be a promising tool for the study and evaluation of DGR.", "paper_title": "Automatic Motion Analysis System for Pyloric Flow in Ultrasonic Videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000329516400015"}
