To do this, the paper proposes an innovative modeling method for large scale collaboration. The modeling method identifies the collaborative spaces in the collaboration and describes ways to support the collaboration in cloud environments, including defining knowledge flows across system boundaries.The modeling focuses on the ability to deploy the cloud to quickly create collaborative environments. Common access to the cloud makes it an enhancer of collaboration, especially across large business networks such as outsourcing or co-design and to support the agility needed in such collaboration. The paper proposes that cloud provides an advantage where it can foster the collaboration needed to maintain sustainable communities and defines the support needed from the cloud for collaboration. This is particularly relevant to smart cities and the greater emphasis on the Internet of things.", "paper_title": "CLOUD REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITATING BUSINESS COLLABORATION: A MODELING PERSPECTIVE", "paper_id": "WOS:000335298100005"}
