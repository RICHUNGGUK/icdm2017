In this paper, we propose a family of generalized plaid models for biclustering, where the layer estimation is regularized by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The new models have broadened the scope of ordinary plaid models by specifying the variance function, making the models adaptive to the entire distribution of the noise term. A formal test is provided for finding significant layers. A Metropolis algorithm is also developed to calculate the maximum likelihood estimators of unknown parameters in the proposed models. Three simulation studies and the applications to two real datasets are reported, which demonstrate that our procedure is promising. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
