Our approach is different and motivated by similar considerations to simulated annealing; that is we build a sequence of artificial distributions whose support concentrates itself on the set of maximum likelihood estimates. We sample from these distributions using a sequential Monte Carlo approach. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for several applications of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Particle methods for maximum likelihood estimation in latent variable models", "paper_id": "WOS:000251620300005"}
