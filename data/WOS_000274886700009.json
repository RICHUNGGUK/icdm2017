We address the discrete and continuous models, i.e., the subtrees' boundary points are all vertices, or possibly inner points of an edge, respectively. We consider two different objective functions. If we minimize the overall sum of the minimum weighted distances of the subtrees from the facilities, there exists an optimal solution satisfying a generalized vertex optimality property, e.g., there is an optimal solution Such that all facilities are located at vertices or the boundary points of the subtrees. Based on this property we devise a polynomial time algorithm for the pos/neg-weighted 1-median problem on a tree with subtree-shaped customers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
