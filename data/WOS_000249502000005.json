DECS evolve through evolving clustering method and evolutionary computation for structure learning, Levenberg Marquardt method for parameter learning, learning and accommodate new input data. DECS is created and updated during the operation of the system. At each time moment the output of DECS is calculated through a knowledge rule inference system based on m-most activated fuzzy rules which are dynamically chosen from a fuzzy rule set. An approach is proposed for a dynamic creation of a first order Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy rule set for the DECS model. The fuzzy rules can be inserted into DECS before, or during its learning process, and the rules can also be extracted from DECS during, or after its learning process. It is demonstrated that DECS can effectively learn complex temporal sequences in an adaptive way and outperform some existing models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
