Maximum likelihood estimates, exact and approximate confidence intervals and an exact confidence region for the parameters of the Weibull distribution are discussed for the new censoring scheme. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed censoring scheme. Some simulation results are presented and used to assess the performance of the proposed estimation methods developed here. The expected time required to complete the proposed life test plan is derived. Finally, a numerical study for comparing among different censoring schemes in terms of expected test time is given.
