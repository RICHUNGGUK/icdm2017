We have carried out two navigation experiments: three subjects were required to rotate in a virtual bar room by imagining left or right hand movement, and to walk along a single axis in a virtual street by imagining foot or hand movement. In this paper we focus on the subjective experience of navigating virtual reality \"by thought,\" and on the interrelations between BCI and presence.", "paper_title": "Navigating virtual reality by thought: What is it like?", "paper_id": "WOS:000244149200007"}
