In each mode, the system is governed by continuous dynamics, and different modes correspond to different continuous models. For hybrid systems, model-based fault detection and isolation is a challenging task due to the fact that the system's prevailing dynamical model and its current mode (discrete state) are mutually dependent and intertwined. In this paper, a new energy-based approach is introduced for mode tracking of hybrid systems, and its associated systematic analysis is based on a hybrid bond graph. Each system's mode is characterized by a concise energy relation that allows mode identification in the new mode tracking method.", "paper_title": "Energy-Based Mode Tracking of Hybrid Systems for FDI", "paper_id": "WOS:000317613400002"}
