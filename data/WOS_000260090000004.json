This paper proposes a term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) based method called TDDF (TFIDF direct document frequency of domain) to extract domain keywords from multi-texts. First, we discuss the optimal parameters of TFIDF, which are used to extract textual keywords and domain keywords. Second, TDDF is proposed to extract domain keywords from multi-texts, which takes document frequency of domain into account. Finally, the distribution of domain keywords on scientific texts is studied. Experiments and applications show that TDDF is more effective than the optimal TFIDF in the extraction of domain keywords. Domain keywords accord with normal distribution on a single text after deleting the ubiquitous domain keywords.
