Compared with saving forward modeled wavefield on the disk, RIM via wavefield reconstruction using saved boundaries on device is a more efficient method because computation is much faster than CPU-GPU data transfer. In this paper, we introduce the effective boundary saving strategy in backward reconstruction for RIM. The minimum storage requirement for regular and staggered grid finite difference is determined for perfect reconstruction of the source wavefield. Particularly, we implement RIM using GPU programming, combining staggered finite difference scheme with convolutional perfectly matched layer (CPML) boundary condition. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach and CUDA codes with numerical example and imaging of benchmark models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
