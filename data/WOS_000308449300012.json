Unlike commonly used fault detection methods, the newly proposed approach does not require prior information regarding the fault location, fault severity or data emitted in the presence of a fault to build the model of that fault and recognize it. The new detection mechanism is based only on the models of normal behavior for various portions of the monitored system. The obtained results indicate that the detection and localization of the unwanted heating element (i.e., heat source) can be achieved through distributed GSMMS-based anomaly detection, with multiple anomaly detectors monitoring different parts of each configuration. The results also suggest that fault detection and localization are strongly related to a system's configuration and operational conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
