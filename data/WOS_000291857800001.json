Ensuring the observability of the faults/unknown inputs with respect to the outputs, the faults can be estimated from the sliding surface. Under a Lipschitz condition for the nonlinear part, the high gain observers are designed under some regularity assumptions. In the sliding mode, the convergence of the estimation error dynamics is proven similar to the analysis of high-gain observers.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear sliding mode high-gain observers for fault estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000291857800001"}
