The model was developed to support the operational planning of hydroelectric power plants and is intended to compute natural flow predictions based on meteorological rain forecasts. A recurrent fuzzy system model was employed, with parameters estimated by a genetic algorithm using observed rainfall as input. This work presents the recurrent fuzzy model within a multi-model approach, where the input data are furnished as an envelope, resulting in a prediction envelope that has demonstrated the ability to produce robust results.
