However, its low speed renders it ineffective for many biomedical applications involving real-time data processing. To accelerate FE analysis, we introduce a novel tissue mechanics simulation technique. This technique is suitable for real-time estimation of tissue deformation of specific organs, which is required in computer-aided diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. In this method, principal component analysis is used to describe each organ shape and its corresponding FE field for a pool of patients by a small number of weight factors. A mapping function is developed to relate the parameters of organ shape to their FE field counterpart. We show that irrespective of the complexity of the tissue's constitutive law or its loading conditions, the proposed technique is highly accurate and fast in estimating the FE field. Average deformation errors of less than 2% demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Statistical finite element method for real-time tissue mechanics analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000303560100004"}
