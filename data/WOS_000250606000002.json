Almost all previous studies relied on a method proposed by Dally to capture the effect of virtual channels multiplexing in the performance of interconnection networks. This paper presents a new method to model the effect of virtual channel multiplexing in high-speed wormhole-switched interconnection networks. Dally's method loses its accuracy as the traffic load increases due to blocking nature of wormhole-switched networks. Our new method is based on a finite capacity queue, M / G / 1 / V and comparing to Dally's method achieves a higher degree of accuracy under low, moderate and high traffic loads. Furthermore, its simplicity eases its employment under different network conditions and setup. The presented model is validated by means of an event driven simulator and a detailed comparison with Dally's method is presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
