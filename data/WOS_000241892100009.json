In CSAM, more attention is paid to locate all the peaks (both global and local ones) of multimodal optimization problems. To achieve this purpose, new clonal selection operator is put forward, dynamic population size and clustering radius are also used not only to locate all the peaks as many as possible, but assure no resource wasting, i.e., only one antibody will locate in each peak. Finally, new performances are also presented for multimodal function when there is no prior idea about it in advance. Our experiments demonstrated that CSAM is very effective in dealing with multimodal optimization regardless of global or local peaks.", "paper_title": "A novel clonal selection for multi-modal function optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100009"}
