Their features naturally lead to apply multiagent techniques to ensure both the autonomy of entities and the best whole system organization. We propose a multiagent approach for wireless communication robust management for such physical systems using self-organization mechanisms.", "paper_title": "A self-organized energetic constraints based approach for modelling communication in wireless systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800013"}
