Here, we introduce an upgraded algorithm, EW_dmGWAS, to boost GWAS signals in a node-and edge-weighted PPI network. In EW_dmGWAS, we utilize condition-specific gene expression profiles for edge weights. Specifically, differential gene co-expression is used to infer the edge weights. We applied EW_dmGWAS to two diseases and compared it with other relevant methods. The results suggest that EW_dmGWAS is more powerful in detecting disease-associated signals.", "paper_title": "EW_dmGWAS: edge-weighted dense module search for genome-wide association studies and gene expression profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000359312400029"}
