We investigate the achievable rate region R-opt(X-1, X-2) such that the decoding error probability caused by two encoders and one decoder can be arbitrarily small infinitely often under a certain rate constraint. We give an inner and an outer bounds of R-opt(X-1, X-2), where the outer bound is described by using new information-theoretic quantities. We also give two simple sufficient conditions under which the inner bound coincides with the outer bound.", "paper_title": "On the Achievable Rate Region in the Optimistic Sense for Separate Coding of Two Correlated General Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100002"}
