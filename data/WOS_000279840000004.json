The main results show the MAI effects and PMD constraint at the outage probability. The contribution of these sources of interference is analysed to choose the better design of code parameters in order to increase the performance of networks based on optical code paths. These results could be applied to determine the parameters design in code/wavelength routed networks.", "paper_title": "The effects of polarization mode dispersion on 2D wavelength-hopping time spreading code routed networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279840000004"}
