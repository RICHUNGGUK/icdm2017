A Grunwald-Letnikov approximation is used for the Riemann-Liouville time derivative, and the second order spatial derivatives are approximated by the compact finite differences to obtain a fully discrete implicit scheme. Alternating direction implicit (AD!) method is used to split the original problem into two separate one-dimensional problems. The local truncation error is analyzed and the stability is discussed by the Fourier method. The proposed scheme is suitable when the order of the time fractional derivative gamma lies in the interval [1/2, 1). A correction term is added to maintain high accuracy when gamma is an element of (0, 1/2). Numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
