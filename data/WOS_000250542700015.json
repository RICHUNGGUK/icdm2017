The surface temperature data in these experiments were recorded using infrared thermography at a frequency of 20 Hz along two selected lines on the impingement surface corresponding to geometrically similar and dissimilar regions within the reattachment curtain. The magnitude of temperature oscillations were found to increase with an increase in exit opening for the larger nozzle spacing. The POD analysis results indicate that a majority of the temperature flucutations are well captured by 15 dominant modes. In many cases, the three dominant modes accounted for approximately 60 percent of the variance in surface temperature fluctuation.", "paper_title": "Oscillatory thermal structures in a reattaching jet flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000250542700015"}
