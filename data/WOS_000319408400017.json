In this problem, the demand and location of the existing facilities have a dynamic nature and the relocation is dependent to the location of new facilities in previous period. The objective function of the presented model is to minimize the maximum expected weighted barrier distance between the new facility and the existing facilities during the planning horizon. The optimum solution of small-sized test problems is obtained by the optimization software. For large-size test problems which the optimization software is unable to find the optimum solution in the runtime limitation, two meta-heuristics based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) are applied. To validate the meta-heuristics, a lower bound problem based on the forbidden region instead of the line barrier is generated. Related results of numerical experiments are illustrated and are then compared. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
