Nonuniform background, stains, and variation in the intensity of the printed characters are some examples of challenging document features. In this work, binarization is accomplished by taking advantage of local probabilistic models and of a flexible active contour scheme. More specifically, local linear models are used to estimate both the expected stroke and the background pixel intensities. This information is then used as the main driving force in the propagation of an active contour. In addition, a curvature-based force is used to control the viscosity of the contour and leads to more natural-looking results. The proposed implementation benefits from the level set framework, which is highly successful in other contexts, such as medical image segmentation and road network extraction from satellite images. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated on both recent and historical document images of various types and languages. In addition, this method was submitted to the Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO'09), at which it placed 3rd.", "paper_title": "A local linear level set method for the binarization of degraded historical document images", "paper_id": "WOS:000304399900002"}
