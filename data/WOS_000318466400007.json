The image stretchability is first evaluated based on gradient, saliency and color features, and is used to generate the stretchable space. Then the optimal size of the stretched image is determined under the constraint of stretchable space and the same aspect ratio as the target image. Based on the analysis of image stretchability measures, the original image is partitioned into non-stretchable blocks and stretchable blocks, and their scaling factors are calculated based on their stretchability measures and the stretched image size, in order to possibly preserve non-stretchable blocks without distortion and reasonably resize stretchable blocks. Finally, the stretched image is uniformly scaled to generate the target image. Experimental results on a variety of images and the user study demonstrate that our approach achieves an overall better retargeting performance compared to the state-of-the-art image retargeting approaches.
