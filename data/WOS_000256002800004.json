Whereas the structure of the latter hierarchy is rather simple the structure of the boolean hierarchy of k-partitions over NP for k >= 3 turns out to be much more complicated. We formulate the Embedding Conjecture which enables us to get a complete idea of this structure. This conjecture is supported by several partial results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
