The DQEM uses the differential quadrature to discretize the governing differential eigenvalue equation defined on each element, the transition conditions defined on the inter-element boundary of two adjacent elements and the boundary conditions of the beam. Numerical results solved by the developed numerical algorithm are presented. The convergence of the developed DQEM analysis model is efficient. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
