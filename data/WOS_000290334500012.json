Accurate prediction of transcriptional regulatory networks is critical in providing useful information for biologists to determine what to do next. Currently, there is a substantial amount of fragmented gene regulation information described in the medical literature. However, current related text analysis methods designed to identify protein-protein interactions are not entirely suitable for finding transcriptional regulatory networks. Result: In this article, we propose an automatic regulatory network inference method that uses bootstrapping of description patterns to predict the relationship between a TF and its TGenes. The proposed method differs from other regulatory network generators in that it makes use of both positive and negative patterns for different vector combinations in a sentence. Moreover, the positive pattern learning process can be fully automatic. Furthermore, patterns for active and passive voice sentences are learned separately. The experiments use 609 HIF-1 expert-tagged articles from PubMed as the gold standard. The results show that the proposed method can automatically generate a predicted regulatory network for a transcription factor. Our system achieves an F-measure of 72.60%.", "paper_title": "Inference of transcriptional regulatory network by bootstrapping patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000290334500012"}
