When either schema or conceptual model evolves to accommodate new information needs, the existing mapping must be maintained accordingly to continuously provide valid services. In this paper, the authors examine the mappings specifying \"consistent\" relationships between models. First, they define the consistency of a conceptual-relational mapping through \"semantically compatible\" instances. Next, the authors analyze the knowledge encoded in the standard database design process and develop round-trip algorithms for incrementally maintaining the consistency of conceptual-relational mappings under evolution. Finally, they conduct a set of comprehensive experiments. The results show that the proposed solution is efficient and provides significant benefits in comparison to the mapping reconstructing approach.", "paper_title": "Maintaining Mappings between Conceptual Models and Relational Schemas", "paper_id": "WOS:000280309600002"}
