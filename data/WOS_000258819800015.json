Short-channel effects (SCEs), substrate potential fluctuation effect, and parasitic-resistance-induced excess noises were implemented in analytical formulas to accurately simulate RF noises in sub-100-nm MOSFETs. The intrinsic noise extracted through a previously developed lossy substrate de-embedding method and calculated by the improved noise model can consistently predict gate length scaling effects. For 65- and 80-nm n-channel MOS with f(T) above 160 and 100 GHz, NF(min) at 10 GHz can be suppressed to 0.5 and 0.7 dB, respectively. Drain current noise S(id) reveals an apparently larger value for 65-nm devices than that for 80-nm devices due to SCE. On the other hand, the shorter channel helps reduce the gate current noise S(ig) attributed to smaller gate capacitances. Gate resistance R(g)-induced excess noise dominates in S(ig) near one order higher than the intrinsic gate noise that is free from R(g) for 65-nm devices. The compact RF CMOS modeling can facilitate high-frequency noise simulation accuracy in nanoscale RF CMOS circuits for low-noise design.", "paper_title": "A compact RF CMOS modeling for accurate high-frequency noise simulation in sub-100-nm MOSFETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000258819800015"}
