A novel adaptive and robust non-linear control design for electrical power systems employing thyristor controlled series compensation has been solved by using this methodology. For the case of single machine to infinite bus system with TCSC having internal and external disturbances, storage functions of the system are constructed via adaptive back-stepping design and a novel non-linear L-2 gain disturbance attenuation controller along with the parameter update law were derived. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed control design possesses asymptotic stability with superior performances. The construction of feedback control law via associated storage functions is consistently systematic, which makes the proposed technique appealing for further investigation in order to derive appropriate design scheme for higher-order non-linear models of power systems.", "paper_title": "Adaptive back-stepping design of TCSC robust nonlinear control for power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235413800009"}
