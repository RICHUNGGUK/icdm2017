The structure of the original second order model is preserved in the model reduction procedure and the reduced order models are guaranteed to be stable. The expression of the error and its gradient are explicitly given in terms of the solutions of certain Lyapunov equations. An effective algorithm is derived to obtain the reduced order model. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "OPTIMAL H-2 MODEL REDUCTION FOR MECHANICAL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500006"}
