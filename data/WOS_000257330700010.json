Concerted and stepwise mechanisms, found in the literature, are compared. It is shown, that the stepwise mechanism may be a result of choosing unbalanced active space. Such choice leads to very close singlet and triplet states in the intermediate geometry - an artificial effect, that disappears if properly balanced active space is used (here, we use active space of 12 orbitals and 12 electrons). Conclusions concerning the mechanism and usefulness of the applied methodology are drawn, which might be important for theoretical investigation of stereoselectivity and specificity of catalysts for the HDA reaction.", "paper_title": "Ab initio multireference study of Hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of buta-1,3-diene with alkyl glyoxylates", "paper_id": "WOS:000257330700010"}
