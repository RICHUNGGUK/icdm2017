However, in realistic settings this may not be the case. The routing performance modeling of such realistic scenarios that involve multifariously-featured and egotistic nodes would be interesting and insightful. To this end, in this paper, we analytically model the routing behavior of such nodes using Ordinary Differential Equations for two different routing protocols namely, Epidemic Routing and Two-Hop Routing. Furthermore, we also study the degradation in the routing performance caused by an increase in the fraction of selfish nodes present in the heterogeneous node population. The proposed analytical model is validated via extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Performance modeling of DTN routing with heterogeneous and selfish nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000329321200003"}
