The controller is composed of multiple fixed controller models, a free-running adaptive controller model and a re-initialized adaptive controller model. The fixed controller models are derived from the corresponding fixed system models directly. The adaptive controller models adopt the direct adaptive algorithm to reduce the design calculation. At every instant, the optimal controller is chosen out according to the switching index. The interaction of the system is viewed as the measured disturbance which is eliminated by the choice of the weighing polynomial matrix. The global convergence is obtained. Finally, several simulation examples in a wind tunnel experiment are given to show both effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method. The significance of the proposed method is that it is applicable to a non-minimum phase system, adopting direct adaptive algorithm to overcome the singularity problem during the matrix calculation and realizing decoupling control for a multivariable system.", "paper_title": "Multivariable direct adaptive decoupling controller using multiple models and a case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000268192800011"}
