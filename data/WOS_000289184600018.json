DCPO has caused several thermal explosion and runaway reaction accidents in reaction and storage zone in Taiwan because of its unstable reactive property. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine thermokinetic parameters including 700 J g(-1) of heat of decomposition (Delta H(d)), 110 degrees C of exothermic onset temperature (T(0)), 130 kJ mol(-1) of activation energy (E(alpha)), etc., and to analyze the runaway behavior of DCPO in a reaction and storage zone. To evaluate thermal explosion of DCPO with storage equipment, solid thermal explosion (STE) and liquid thermal explosion (LIE) of thermal safety software (TSS) were applied to simulate storage tank under various environmental temperatures (T(e)). T(e) exceeding the To of DCPO can be discovered as a liquid thermal explosion situation. DCPO was stored under room temperature without sunshine and was prohibited exceeding 67 degrees C of self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT) for a tank (radius = 1 m and height = 2 m). SADT of DCPO in a box (width, length and height = 1 m, respectively) was determined to be 60 degrees C. The TSS was employed to simulate the fundamental thermal explosion behavior in a large tank or a drum. Results from curve fitting demonstrated that, even at the earlier stage of the reaction in the experiments, ambient temperature could elicit exothermic reactions of DCPO. To curtail the extent of the risk, relevant hazard information is quite significant and must be provided in the manufacturing process. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.
