This classification is at the core of the design of the algorithms, presented in Part III, for computing, in all cases of singular intersection, a near-optimal parameterization with polynomial functions, that is a parameterization in projective space whose coordinate functions are polynomial and such that the number of distinct square roots appearing in the coefficients is at most one away from the minimum.
