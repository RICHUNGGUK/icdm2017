This paper proposes the Variable CCA MAC protocol; a new MAC protocol that increases the number of CCAs performed by a node beyond the standard value of two. We develop a Markov-based mathematical model that describes the functionality of this new protocol. We also validate our mathematical model through conducting extensive simulations that focus on a rich set of performance parameters, including the probability of collision, throughput, channel idle time, channel collision time, energy consumption, delay, and reliability.
