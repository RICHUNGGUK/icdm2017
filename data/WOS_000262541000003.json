Owing to the similarity between P2P networks and social networks, where peer nodes can be regarded as people and connections can be regarded as relationships, social strategies are useful for improving the performance of resource discovery by self-organizing autonomous peers on unstructured P2P networks. In this paper, we present an efficient social-like peer-to-peer (ESLP) method for resource discovery by mimicking different human behaviours in social networks. ESLP has been simulated in a dynamic environment with a growing number of peer nodes. From the simulation results and analysis, ESLP achieved better performance than current methods.
