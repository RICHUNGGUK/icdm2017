Our approach has two stages of sensor fusion, each with different algorithms for finding 3D orientation and position. The first stage fusion algorithm, a complementary filter, utilizes MARG sensors to compute 3D orientation relative to the direction of gravity and earth's magnetic field in a quaternion format, which was adjusted with compensations for magnetic distortion. The second stage fusion algorithm, a Kalman filter, utilizes accelerometer data and IR marker velocity to compute 3D position. In order to compute the IR marker linear velocity along the optical axis (the z-axis), we present a simple and efficient image-based technique to find the distance of the object from the camera using blob area pixels in the image. Our fusion (inside-in and outside-in) approach efficiently solves short time occlusion, needs of frequent calibration, and unbounded drift problems involved in numerical integration of inertial sensors data and improves the degrees of freedom at low cost without compromising accuracy. The results are compared with a leading commercial magnetic motion tracking system to demonstrate the performance of the wand.", "paper_title": "6DOF Wireless Tracking Wand Using MARG and Vision Sensor Fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000338055400001"}
