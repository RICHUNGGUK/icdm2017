What makes the problem different in today's information society is the amount of multimedia information in digital form (digital content) that has to be handled, the speed at which it is produced and the ways that it is presented, exchanged, organized and stored. The advent of World Wide Web has tremendously affected all these activities, giving us new tools and ways for harnessing digital art material. Culture organizations have to deal with all the open security challenges that can cause huge data and financial losses, harm their reputation and strictly affect people's trust on them. Here we shall propose a trust preserving approach for handling the increasingly difficult complexity issues of building data management systems suitable for cultural environments. Our model addresses a list of fundamental operational and security requirements. It is designed as a standalone solution but it can be flexibly adapted in broader management infrastructures.
