Compared with a traditional C/S (client/server) network, the probability of peers initiating malicious behavior increases dramatically because of their self-governing and dynamic characteristics, which also make it harder to satisfy the peers' security required by DHT. In this paper, we propose a new secure DHT protocol based on a multidimensional mapping mechanism. This mechanism maps peers to a multidimensional space by dividing the identifiers into groups. Moreover, a series of secure methods and routing algorithms are provided to achieve secure DHT in smaller spaces. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the multidimensional mapping mechanism can effectively improve the average success rate of a resource search by inhibiting malicious behavior.", "paper_title": "Secure P2P topology based on a multidimensional DHT space mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000319531200018"}
