In this paper, we propose a new texture based approach for palmprint feature extraction, template representation and matching. An extension of the SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation), a time series technology, to 2D data is the key to make this new approach effective, simple, flexible and reliable. Experiments show that by adopting the simple feature of grayscale information only, this approach can achieve an equal error rate of 0.3%, and a rank one identification accuracy of 99.9% on a 7752 palmprint public database. This new approach has very low computational complexity so that it can be efficiently implemented on slow mobile embedded platforms. The proposed approach does not rely on any parameter training process and therefore is fully reproducible. What is more, besides the palmprint authentication, the proposed 2D extension of SAX may also be applied to other problems of pattern recognition and data mining for 2D images. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
