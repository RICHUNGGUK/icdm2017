In this paper is presented a theoretical model of an Artificial Immune System inspired by the vertebrate immune system. The objective of the proposed AIS is protection and reaction against known and unknown dysfunctions or attacks in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network that uses IPv6 addresses. This AIS also includes features inspired by Danger Theory, one of the latest immunological findings and a point of hot debate in the area of immunology.", "paper_title": "Securing IPv6-based mobile ad hoc networks through an artificial immune system", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800041"}
