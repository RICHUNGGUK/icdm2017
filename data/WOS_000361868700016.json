The focus is on dynamic control of a batch processor where near-future arrival information is available by predicting the process times on its upstream processor. In a particular decision point, the dynamic control task is to decide whether to start the batch process with one of the available product types immediately or to wait for future arrivals coming from the upstream processor. While considering a wait decision alternative, a re-sequencing approach at the upstream processor is proposed to shorten the arrival time of the desired product. Combining this architecture with a rolling horizon decision making, we propose a new look-ahead batch control strategy. A serial-batch processor system that is typical in wafer fabrication is modeled to demonstrate the approach. Simulation based benchmarking shows promising results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
