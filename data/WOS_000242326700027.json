Using a scalar-relativistic density functional approach, we studied the geometry structures, Mulliken populations and charges of the systems. Structure parameters of the experimental systems are reproduced well with X alpha method. The metallophilic interaction energy is analyzed and decomposed. For the systems with different central atoms and different metal atoms, the nature of the metallophilic attraction interaction is analyzed.", "paper_title": "Density functional study of closed-shell attraction on X(ML)(3)(+)(X = O, S, Se; M = Au, Ag, Cu) systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242326700027"}
