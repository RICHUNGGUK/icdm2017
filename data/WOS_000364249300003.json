Incentive management techniques used in conventional crowdsourcing platforms are not suitable for more intellectually-challenging tasks. Currently, incentives are custom-developed and managed by each particular platform. This prevents incentive portability and cross-platform comparison. In this paper we present PRINGL a domain-specific language for programming and managing complex incentive strategies for socio-technical platforms in general. It promotes re-use of proven incentive logic and simplifies modeling, adjustment and enactment of complex incentives for socio-technical systems. We demonstrate its applicability and expressiveness on a set of realistic use-cases and discuss its properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
