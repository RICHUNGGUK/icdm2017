The mechanism of this robot was designed to fulfill tasks defined by various functions such as gripping character cubes and teacups, playing the Gobang board game, and rotating and stacking character cubes. Further emphasis was placed on load lifting capability, weight reduction, energy conservation, and performance reliability. The serial port of a minicomputer is used as the communication interface between the software and electromechanical components. A custom-made chip serves as the control kernel that controls the motions of servo motors that move the arms and head of the robot, two DC motors which drive the wheels, and also a number of lights. With the integrated artificial intelligence software and the robot control system, this intelligent robot DOC-1 can perform a number of autonomous functions that make it interactive with human beings.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Functional Entertaining and Educational Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000260282400002"}
