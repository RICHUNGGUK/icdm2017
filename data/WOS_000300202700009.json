This study investigates the organisational adoption of an innovation management software. It is based on a case study which incorporates a focus group and sixteen in-depth interviews across R&D, marketing, and administration functions. It contributes to current literature by isolating specific intrinsic characteristics of innovation management software, including communication/information flow, accessibility, and accountability, and how these can jointly shape organisational motivations and capabilities as innovation organisations respond to environmental pressures, including innovation partners' influence, competition, and regulation. Managerial implications for enhancing the adoption of innovation management software are also offered.", "paper_title": "ADOPTING INNOVATION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE IN UNIVERSITY INNOVATION COMMERCIALIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000300202700009"}
