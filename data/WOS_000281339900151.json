Load balancing algorithms are used to share the load of the system fairly among the processors. The developed load balancing algorithm use on demand based approach instead of the periodic load balancing in order to get fast and fair load balancing with minimal computational overhead. It uses the number of threads per processor and total load of the system as inputs. The method is compared to the periodic and another developed on demand based algorithms. The results show that during the load balancing the periodic algorithm causes temporary idle periods in the processors whereas the developed on demand-based algorithms respond faster to the fluctuating load level, stabilize the load more equally among the processors and increase the performance of the system. The results also proof that the fuzzy load balancer achieves the best load balance among the processors as well as the fastest response time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
