Also, an ultra low power comparator is used for further power reduction. This circuit has been simulated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS technology to satisfy EPC Class 1 Generation 2 standard protocol emphasizing on the reduction of power consumption. The proposed circuit can correctly demodulate the minimum input RF signal amplitude of 180 mV for modulation depths of 55-100 % with 40-160 kb/s data rates. A total power consumption of less than 290 nW is achieved at a 1.2 V power supply. Effects of the input signal additive white noise as well as the process and temperature variations on the signal demodulation is also investigated in this paper.", "paper_title": "A novel ultra low power ASK demodulator for a passive UHF RFID tag compatible with C1 G2 EPC standard protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000316016100002"}
