We suppose the answer set semantics of extended disjunctive programs and consider the following problem. Given two programs P-1 and P-2, which have the sets of answer sets AS(P-1) and AS(P-2), respectively; find a program Q which has answer sets as minimal sets S boolean OR T for S from AS(P-1) and T from AS(P-2). The program Q combines answer sets of P-1 and P-2, and provides a compositional semantics of two programs. Such program composition has application to coordinating knowledge bases in multi-agent environments. We provide methods for computing program composition and discuss their properties.", "paper_title": "Combining answer sets of nonmonotonic logic programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506800018"}
