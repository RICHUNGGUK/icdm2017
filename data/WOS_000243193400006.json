An explanation for this capability in terms of a coupling between two hypothetical networks is presented. The simple networks presented here provide alternative, biologically plausible mechanisms for sparse, factorial coding in early primate vision.", "paper_title": "A simple Hebbian/anti-Hebbian network learns the sparse, independent components of natural images", "paper_id": "WOS:000243193400006"}
