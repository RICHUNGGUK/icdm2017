A list of 3,776 Chinese-American faculties are collected. Analysis is made from five aspects, including regional statistics, institution statistics, gender statistics, position statistics, and discipline statistics. New York, California and Pennsylvania have the most Chinese-American scholars, when the top three universities are The Ohio State University-Columbus, Emory University, and Texas A&M University. The number of male faculties is much greater than female, when the ratio is roughly 7:3. For the position statistics, the ratio of Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor is 2.7:3:4.3.
