While traditional algorithms often suffer from either local minima or non-optimality-or a combination of both-we pursue the goal of achieving global solutions of the statistically optimal cost-function. Our approach is based on a hierarchy of convex relaxations to solve non-convex optimization problems with polynomials. These convex relaxations generate a monotone sequence of lower bounds and we show how one can detect whether the global optimum is attained at a given relaxation. The technique is applied to a number of classical vision problems: triangulation, camera pose, homography estimation and last, but not least, epipolar geometry estimation. Experimental validation on both synthetic and real data is provided. In practice, only a few relaxations are needed for attaining the global optimum.", "paper_title": "Globally optimal estimates for geometric reconstruction problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246318800002"}
