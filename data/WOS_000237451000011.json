In addition, debugging industrial programs is hard due to the large search space. A new tool, REDBUG, is introduced. REDBUG is based on an optimal search in structured domain technology. REDBUG supports a reduced coverage criterion rendering the coverage of industrial programs practical. In addition, by using an optimal search algorithm, REDBUG reduces the number of steps required to locate a bug. REDBUG also combines testing and debugging into one process.", "paper_title": "Optimal algorithmic debugging and reduced coverage using search in structured domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451000011"}
