Indeed, forming ad-hoc networks among various UWB enabled devices is considered as an important mobile data exchange operating environment. In our study, we explore the problem of jointly optimizing the power level and data rate used in the devices in such a UWB based ad-hoc network. We propose a practical optimization algorithm based on judicious power control for real-time applications and opportunistic scheduling for non-real-time applications. Simulation results indicate that our proposed techniques are effective under various practical scenarios.", "paper_title": "High performance power control and opportunistic fair scheduling in TH-PPM UWB ad-hoc multimedia networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251972500004"}
