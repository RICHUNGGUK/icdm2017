Recently, the Unify project proposed a multi-layered architecture that, leveraging different levels of abstraction, can orchestrate and deploy generic network services on the physical infrastructure of the telecom operator. In this paper, we exploit such an architecture to deliver end-to-end generic services in presence of multiple concurring players (e.g. network operator, end-users), leveraging a new simple data model. Particularly, we propose a description-based approach allowing the deployment agile, implementation-independent and high-level network services over a distributed set of resources. The resulting data model can abstract generic services, including both middlebox-based (e.g., firewalls, NATs, etc.) and traditional LAN-based ones (e.g., a BitTorrent client). Finally, two distinct prototypes, originated by different design principles, are implemented in order to validate our proposal with the aim of demonstrating the adaptability of our approach to different contexts.
