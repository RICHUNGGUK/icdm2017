Combined with a new proposed ranking and selecting strategy, the algorithm gradually converges to a feasible region from a relatively feasible region. By introduction of an adaptive relaxation parameter it, the algorithm fully takes into account different functions corresponding to different sizes of feasible region. In addition, an adaptive penalty function method is employed, which adaptively adjust the penalty coefficient so as to guarantee a moderate penalty. By solving 11 benchmark test functions and two engineering problems, experiment results indicate that the proposed method is reliable and efficient for solving constrained optimization problems. Also, it has great potential in handling many engineering problems with constraints, even with equations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
