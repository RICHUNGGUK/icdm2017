The fuzzy system consists of J interconnected time-delay discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy subsystems and the decentralised H-infinity filter is designed for each subsystem. It is shown that the stability with H-infinity performance of overall filtering error system can be established if a piecewise Lyapunov-Kroasovskii functional can be constructed, and moreover, the functional can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities that are numerically feasible. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the presented approach.", "paper_title": "Decentralised H-infinity filtering of interconnected discrete-time fuzzy systems with time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000306113900012"}
