In this research, the back propagation is adopted as the approach to multivariate time series prediction. It is traditionally designed for the task with the two models: separated model and combined model. In the proposed version of time series prediction systems, the mid-term estimator is added as the additional module to the traditional version. It is validated empirically that the three VTG (Virtual Term Generation) schemes are effective on using the back propagation for multivariate time series prediction on the four test data sets: three artificial one and a real test one.
