This paper proposes a new type of information pattern, called a typical pattern, which is a small subset of objects selected from a large dataset that provides a compact and Suitable representation of the original dataset. The Typical Patterns Mining (TPM) algorithm is developed to mine typical patterns from databases. Extensive experiments are carried out using a real dataset to demonstrate the usefulness of typical patterns in practical situations. The experimental results indicate that TPM is a computationally efficient method and that typical patterns can provide a compact and suitable representation of the original dataset.
