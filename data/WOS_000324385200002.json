This paper presents an effective solution toward addressing such a problem. The developed iris segmentation approach exploits a random walker algorithm to efficiently estimate coarsely segmented iris images. These coarsely segmented iris images are postprocessed using a sequence of operations that can effectively improve the segmentation accuracy. The robustness of the proposed iris segmentation approach is ascertained by providing comparison with other state-of-theart algorithms using publicly available UBIRIS.v2, FRGC, and CASIA.v4-distance databases. Our experimental results achieve improvement of 9.5%, 4.3%, and 25.7% in the average segmentation accuracy, respectively, for the UBIRIS.v2, FRGC, and CASIA.v4-distance databases, as compared with most competing approaches. We also exploit the simultaneously extracted periocular features to achieve significant performance improvement. The joint segmentation and combination strategy suggest promising results and achieve average improvement of 132.3%, 7.45%, and 17.5% in the recognition performance, respectively, from the UBIRIS.v2, FRGC, and CASIA.v4-distance databases, as compared with the related competing approaches.", "paper_title": "Towards Online Iris and Periocular Recognition Under Relaxed Imaging Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000324385200002"}
