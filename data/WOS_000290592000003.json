In the scheme, one WSN is divided into multiple clusters and the cluster-tree architecture is proposed, and the IPv6 address structure for cluster heads and cluster members are respectively created. According to the proposed IPv6 address structure, the scheme proposes the stateful address configuration algorithm for cluster heads and the stateless address configuration algorithm for cluster members. The IPv6 address configuration for cluster heads in different cluster-tree branches can be carried out at the same time, which shortens the delay time of the IPv6 address configuration. The IPv6 address configuration for cluster members in different clusters can be carried out at the same time and the duplicate address detection of the IPv6 address assigned for a cluster member is performed within the cluster, which shortens the delay time of the IPv6 address configuration and reduces the network overhead. From the perspectives of duplicate address detection cost, address configuration cost and address configuration delay time, the paper analyzes and compares the performance of the proposed scheme and the existing schemes, including Strong DAD and MANETConf. And analytical results show the effectivity and the efficiency of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "An IPv6 Address Configuration Scheme for All-IP Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290592000003"}
