The proposed method is focused on the reduction of operational amplifier noise transfer gain at low frequencies and the reduction of total capacitance. A new SC LPF topology is proposed in order to adapt the correlated double sampling and charge scaling technique at the same time. Design examples show that proposed filter reduces the total capacitance by 65% or more compared to the conventional one without having significant increase in noise transfer gain.", "paper_title": "Implementation of Low-Noise Switched-Capacitor Low-Pass Filter with Small Capacitance Spread", "paper_id": "WOS:000315244800010"}
