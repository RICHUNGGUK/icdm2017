The method combines distributed and shared-memory paradigms to take advantage of the configuration of modern supercomputers that host many cores per shared-memory node. In our approach a domain decomposition technique is applied to a compact scheme using explicit flux formulas at block interfaces. This method offers great improvement in performance over earlier parallel compact methods that rely on the parallel solution of a linear system. A test case is presented to assess the accuracy and parallel performance of the new method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
