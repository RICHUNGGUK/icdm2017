As an emerging field of research, significant interests have been aroused but quantitative studies are rather limited. Traditional systematic approaches for impact studies have been found to be insufficient to deal with this research topic. In order to further explore the relationship between ICT/e-business and the environment, the approach adopted in this study aimed to simulate how ICT/e-business indicators interact with environmental indicators quantitatively. Owing to lack of data and information in the current area in government bodies/councils/research institutes, two questionnaire surveys were conducted. Details of the data collection progress are provided. An artificial neural network (ANN) approach, embedded in a more predictive and empirical model, is suggested herein as a new methodology and possible solution. Furthermore an expert decision support system (EDSS), built around these neural networks with a user-friendly interface and being able to post-process data to information, is developed. The system could be used, for example, by an individual company to analyze how its ICT/e-business adoptions influence its environmental performance.", "paper_title": "A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ICT AND E-BUSINESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000267703000009"}
