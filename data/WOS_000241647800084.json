Unlike traditional IE methods, the Web extraction systems do not label every mention of the target entity or relation, instead focusing on extracting as many different instances as possible while keeping the precision of the resulting list reasonably high. SRES is a self-supervised Web relation extraction system that learns powerful extraction patterns from unlabeled text, using short descriptions of the target elations and their attributes. SIZES automatically generates the training data needed for its pattern-learning component. We also compare the performance of SIZES to the performance of the state-of-the-art KnowItAll system, and to the performance of its pattern learning component, which uses a simpler and less powerful pattern language than SIZES.", "paper_title": "Self-supervised relation extraction from the web", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800084"}
