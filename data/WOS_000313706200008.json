Imperfect estimation of the CFO causes inter-carrier interference (ICI) that severely degrades the performance of the communications system. Although this is a well studied subject at the algorithmic level, more research is needed when considering implementations in real hardware. Translation of an algorithmic specification to a hardware language is a time consuming task for the designer. This task is more difficult when the target technology offers limited resources, as in the case of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Some rapid prototyping tools, as System Generator from Xilinx or Synplify DSP from Synopsys Synplicity, are available for the designer to facilitate this task. However, their performance has not been evaluated in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to present an illustrating example of an implementation methodology using these tools and to evaluate their performance when considering a real design. In particular, several FPGA implementations of a frequency synchronization scheme for the 802.16d (fixed WiMAX) standard using these rapid prototyping tools are studied and evaluated. The results from the different solutions are analyzed and compared to draw conclusions about their advantages and drawbacks.", "paper_title": "EVALUATION OF RAPID PROTOTYPING SOLUTIONS FOR A 802.16D FREQUENCY OFFSET ESTIMATION SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706200008"}
