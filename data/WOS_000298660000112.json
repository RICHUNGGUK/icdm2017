The model considers the major transport phenomena in a fuel cell involving mass, heat and energy transport, electrode kinetics, and potential fields. Two flow patterns including co-current and counter current are considered for all flows in the cell. Oxygen and hydrogen mass fraction distributions, current density and temperature distribution has been determined. The activation overpotential is constant within anode and cathode. Modeling findings showed that profiles differ from those simulations that assume constant activation overpotential. Serpentine flow field shows better distribution of current density and temperature. Simulation results were compared with the experimental data reported in literature and global comparisons showed good agreement between the model and experimental results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
