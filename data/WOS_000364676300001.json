In our proposed CRJS scheme, SNs take advantages of physical layer secure technologies to protect the primary transmission and acquire some interference-free licensed spectrum as a reward. In addition, both decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocols are investigated in our proposed CRJS scheme. Our object is to maximize the transmission rate of SNs by optimal allocating of the relaying power, jamming power, and downlink and uplink transmit power under the target secure transmission rate requirement of the primary system. Moreover, two suboptimal algorithms are proposed to deal with these optimization problems. Furthermore, we analyze the transmission rate of SNs and allocate the relaying power, jamming power, and downlink and uplink transmit power for the asymptotic scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the performance superiority of our developed strategy over conventional jamming scheme in terms of the transmission rate of WSN.", "paper_title": "Downlink and Uplink Cooperative Transmission for Primary Secrecy Based Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364676300001"}
