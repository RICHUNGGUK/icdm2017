Design/methodology/approach - Four LB journals published by Emerald were selected from Thomson Reuters' JCR. The journals' issues from 2005 to 2008 were downloaded directly from the publisher web site and checked in terms of decay and availability of individual cited URLs. Findings - Original accessibility of studied online resources was 64 percent, which improved to 95 percent. The main adopted strategies that returned more results were using the Wayback Machine and Google, which revived online resources by 17 percent and 12 percent respectively. Practical implications - To increase the rate of web citations accessibility, some recommendations, including avoiding long URLs, citing documents found in digital collections availability on the web, working through systematic checking of the web citations before publication, getting backup of cited information, using the more stable file formats and domains, and utilizing tools like WebCite (R)-enhanced reference and a digital object identifier (DOI (R)) system are suggested. Originality/value - A study which examines the accessibility and decay of web citations used by authors of articles published in ISI-ranked LIS journals available in the Emerald database has not been already done. This paper can thus contribute to the knowledge of this field as well as quality of such literature for web content providers and publishers, authors and researchers.", "paper_title": "Accessibility of online resources cited in scholarly LIS journals A study of Emerald ISI-ranked journals", "paper_id": "WOS:000302969800005"}
