In this work, we present an agent-based algorithm which is specifically tailored to detect contours in images. Following a novel movement and communication scheme, the agents are able to position themselves distributed over the entire image to cover all important image positions. To generate global contours, the agents examine the local windowed image information, and based on a set of fitness functions and via communicating with each other, they establish connections. Instead of a centralized paradigm, the global solution is discovered by some principal rules each agent is following. The algorithm is independent of object models or training steps. In our evaluation we focus on boundary detection as a major step towards image segmentation. We therefore evaluate our algorithm using the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) and compare its performance to existing methods via the BSDS benchmark and Pratt's Figure of Merit.
