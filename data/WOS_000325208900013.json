In the proposed method we tried to take into account the features and specific problems experienced in practical applications of speech recognition in the Polish language, reach inflection, a loose word order and the tendency for short word deletion. The LM is created in five stages. Each successive stage takes the model prepared at the previous stage and modifies or extends it so as to improve its properties. At the first stage, typical methods of LM smoothing are used to create the initial model. Four most frequently used methods of LM construction are here. At the second stage the model is extended in order to take into account words indirectly co-occurring in the corpus. At the next stage, LM modifications are aimed at reduction of short word deletion errors, which occur frequently in Polish speech recognition. The fourth stage extends the model by insertion of words that were not observed in the corpus. Finally the model is modified so as to assure highly accurate recognition of very important utterances. The performance of the methods applied is tested in four language domains.", "paper_title": "PIPELINED LANGUAGE MODEL CONSTRUCTION FOR POLISH SPEECH RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000325208900013"}
