It provides image visualization and management in 2D, 3D and 3D+t; data storage (images or operational results) in a PACS (using DICOM); and exploitation of patients' data such as images and pathologies. Further, it provides support for computationally expensive processes with grid technology. In this article we first introduce the platform and present a comparison with existing systems, according to the platform's modules (for cardiology, angiology, PACS archived enriched searching and grid computing), and then RADStation3G is described in detail.
