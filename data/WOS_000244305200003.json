Adaptation, especially self-adaptation, has been found to be highly beneficial for adjusting control parameters, especially when done without any user interaction. This paper presents differential evolution algorithms, which use different adaptive or self-adaptive mechanisms applied to the control parameters. Detailed performance comparisons of these algorithms on the benchmark functions are outlined.", "paper_title": "Performance comparison of self-adaptive and adaptive differential evolution algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000244305200003"}
