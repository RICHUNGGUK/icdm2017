The count of Clar structures of C60 and the associated Clar polynomial and sextet polynomial were already given by W.C. Shin et al. For boron-nitrogen fullerenes, the corresponding problems have not been solved. In this paper we consider three BN-fullerenes (B12N12,B16N16 and B28N28) which are anomalously stable and one type of capped boron-nitride nanotubes. By combinatorial enumeration we obtain the Clar polynomials and the sextet polynomials of B12N12 and B16N16. Furthermore, the results of B28N28 is also enumerated by the usage of computer.", "paper_title": "Clar and sextet polynomials of boron-nitrogen fullerenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000248087300010"}
