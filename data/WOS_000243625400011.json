This paper presents a correction to Ma and Sonka's thinning algorithm, 'A fully parallel 3D thinning algorithm and its applications', which fails to preserve connectivity of 3D objects. We start with Ma and Sonka's algorithm and examine its verification of connectivity preservation. Our analysis leads to a group of different deleting templates, which can preserve connectivity of 3D objects. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
