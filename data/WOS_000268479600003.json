It is therefore of interest to explore which possibilities are available for open source BI and compare the tools. In this survey article, we consider the capabilities of a number of open source tools for BI. In the article, we consider a number of Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tools, database management systems (DBMSs), On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) servers, and OLAP clients. We find that, unlike the situation a few years ago, there now exist mature and powerful tools in all these categories. However, the functionality still falls somewhat short of that found in commercial tools.
