In this paper, we propose a new condensed representation of a Petri net's behaviour called merged processes, which copes well not only with concurrency, but also with other sources of state space explosion, viz sequences of choices and non-safeness. Moreover, this representation is sufficiently similar to the traditional unfoldings, so that a large body of results developed for the latter can be re-used. Experimental results indicate that the proposed representation of a Petri net's behaviour alleviates the state space explosion problem to a significant degree and is suitable for model checking.", "paper_title": "Merged processes: a new condensed representation of Petri net behaviour", "paper_id": "WOS:000241789200002"}
