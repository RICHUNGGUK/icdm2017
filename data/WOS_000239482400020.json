The heterogeneity among competing standard classification schemes makes the problem only harder. However, the classification task is an indispensable part for successful e-commerce applications. In this paper, we present an automated approach for e-catalog classification. We extend the Naive Bayes Classifier to make use of the structural characteristics of e-catalogs. We show how we can improve the accuracy of classification when appropriate characteristics of e-catalogs are utilized. Effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through experiments.", "paper_title": "Modifled Naive Bayes Classifier for e-catalog classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000239482400020"}
