We consider the minimization of both the makespan and energy consumption objectives. The proposed method follows a fully multiobjective approach, applying a Pareto-based dominance search that is executed in parallel by using several threads. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the new multithreading algorithm outperforms a set of fast and accurate two-phases deterministic heuristics based on the traditional MinMin. The new ME-MLS method is able to achieve significant improvements in both makespan and energy consumption objectives in reduced execution times for a large set of testbed instances, while exhibiting a near linear speedup behavior when using up to 24 threads.", "paper_title": "ENERGY EFFICIENT SCHEDULING IN HETEROGENEOUS SYSTEMS WITH A PARALLEL MULTIOBJECTIVE LOCAL SEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000319490600003"}
