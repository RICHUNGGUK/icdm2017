Accordingly, runtime analysis for safe reconfiguration or evaluation is currently a hot topic in the field, whereas information acquisition of external environment is crucial for runtime safety analysis. With the rapid development of web services, mobile networks and ubiquitous computing, abundant realtime information of environment is available on the Internet. To integrate these public information into runtime safety analysis of critical systems, this paper brings forward a framework, which could be implemented with open source and cross platform modules and encouragingly, applicable to various safety-critical systems.", "paper_title": "A Framework to Integrate Public Information into Runtime Safety Analysis for Critical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784100040"}
