A third sensor was fixed to the forehead, and a fourth sensor was used as a stylus pointer to detect several anatomical landmarks in order to embed a local frame on the cranium. Temporomandibular opening/closing, chewing, laterotrusion and protrusion were examined. Results: The prime objective within this study was to rigidly attach electromagnetic minisensors on teeth. The key for a successful affixation was the kevlar interface. The distances between the two mandibular affixed sensors and between the two maxillar affixed sensors were overall smaller than 0.033 cm for position and 0.2A degrees for attitude throughout the temporomandibular motions. The relative motions between a forehead sensor and the maxilla affixed sensor are too big to suggest a forehead sensor as an alternative for a maxilla affixed sensor. Conclusion: The technique using miniaturized electromagnetic trackers furthers on the methods using electromagnetic trackers on external appliances. The method allows full range of motion of the TMJ and does not disturb normal TMJ function.", "paper_title": "In vivo measurement of the 3D kinematics of the temporomandibular joint using miniaturized electromagnetic trackers: technical report", "paper_id": "WOS:000316118900012"}
