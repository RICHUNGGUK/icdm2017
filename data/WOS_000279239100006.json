We present deterministic and stochastic error bounds when different processors of the computing environment run at different speeds. We implement two parameterization methods, both based on randomized quasi-Monte Carlo, and apply them to pricing digital options and collateralized mortgage obligations. Numerical results are used to compare the parameterization methods by their parallel performance as well as their Monte Carlo efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
