PathGen incorporates data from several sources to create transitive connections that span multiple gene interaction databases. Results are displayed in a comprehensible graphical format, showing gene interaction type and strength, database source and microarray expression data. These features make PathGen a valuable tool for in silico discovery of novel gene interaction pathways, which can be experimentally tested and verified. The usefulness of PathGen interaction analyses was validated using genes connected to the altered facial development related to Down syndrome.", "paper_title": "PathGen: a transitive gene pathway generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000274342800025"}
