For m barriers and n sites, our data structure has O((m+n)logn) size. It supports a mixed sequence of O(m) barrier insertions and O(n) site deletions in total time, and answers analogues of standard convex hull queries in time. Our data structure supports a generalization of the sweep line technique, in which the sweep wavefront is a simple closed polygonal curve, and it sweeps a set of n points in the plane by simple moves. We reduce the total time of supporting m online moves of a polygonal wavefront sweep algorithm from the naive to O((m + n) polylog(mn)).", "paper_title": "Relative Convex Hulls in Semi-Dynamic Arrangements", "paper_id": "WOS:000330032200008"}
