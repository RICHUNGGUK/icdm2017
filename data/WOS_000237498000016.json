The contributions of this paper include: (1) introducing a new approach to classify terrorists based on Gene Expression Programming (GEP); (2) analyzing the characteristics of the terrorist organization, and proposing an algorithm called Create Virtual Community (CVC) based on tree-structure to create a virtual community; (3) proposing a formal definition of Virtual Community (VC) and the VCCM Mining algorithm to mine the core members of a virtual community. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VCCM Mining.", "paper_title": "VCCM mining: Mining virtual community core members based on Gene Expression Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000237498000016"}
