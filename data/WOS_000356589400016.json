The target can be localized by means of measuring the shadowing of received signal strength caused by the target. However, the accuracy of RFDFL deteriorates seriously in environment with WiFi interference. State-of-the-art methods do not efficiently solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a dual-band method to improve the accuracy of RFDFL in environment without/with severe WiFi interference. We introduce an algorithm of fusing dual-band images in order to obtain an enhanced image inferring more precise location and propose a timestamp-based synchronization method to associate the dual-band images to ensure their one-one correspondence. With real-world experiments, we show that our method outperforms traditional single-band localization methods and improves the localization accuracy by up to 40.4% in real indoor environment with high WiFi interference.", "paper_title": "Dual-Band Sensor Network for Accurate Device-Free Localization in Indoor Environment with WiFi Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589400016"}
