To seek the optimal parameter combination of g-SVC, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. And then, a intelligent fault diagnosing method based on g-SVC and PSO is put forward. The results of its application to car assembly line diagnosis indicate that the diagnosing method is effective and feasible. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
