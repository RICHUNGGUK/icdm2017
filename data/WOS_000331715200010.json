After image binarization, three types of image features, including geometric feature, grayscale feature and shape feature, are extracted by combining the defect target image and its corresponding binary image. For the classification model based on support vector machine, we utilize Gauss radial basis as the kernel function, determine model parameters by cross-validation and employ one-versus-one method for multiclass classifier. Experiment results show that support vector machine model outperforms the traditional classification model based on back-propagation neural network in average classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Classification of defects in steel strip surface based on multiclass support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000331715200010"}
