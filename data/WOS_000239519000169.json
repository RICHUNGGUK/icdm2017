But, at least in Italy, these solutions are not effective yet in the schools, probably because human, social and organizational aspects have not really been taken into adequate consideration. Here a new method will be proposed, a method which will put forward new technical solutions for editing scientific books and documents but essentially will give adequate answers to operational and practical problems.", "paper_title": "BlindMath a new scientific editor for blind students", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000169"}
