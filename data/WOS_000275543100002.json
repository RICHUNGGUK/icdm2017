Multicasting is an important technology in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical network, and has been studied in many works. In this paper, we consider the multicasting technology on all-optical metropolitan area network (MAN) with maximum power attenuation constraint. The objective is to minimize total cost of a multicasting request. This problem is NP-hard. We propose a heuristic, named Power-Constraint Fix-Destination-Path (PC-FDP) algorithm, to solve this maximal power-loss constrained minimizing cost multicasting problem. It means that, during the process of building a multicasting tree, when a destination is reached and its power satisfies the constraint, the path from source to it would be fixed in the tree. Simulation results show that, all multicasting trees building the proposed algorithm satisfy the power constraint, with slight increasing of the total cost.", "paper_title": "A novel multicast routing algorithm in sparse splitting WDM network with power attenuation constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000275543100002"}
