The proof is constructive and creates an extension of the original network by adding exactly s + 5,m(r - 1) new nodes where, in the original network,,m is the number oftnessages, r is the average number of receiver nodes demanding each source message, and s is the number of messages emitted by more than one source. The construction is then used to create a solvable multiple-unicast network which becomes unsolvable over every alphabet size if all of its edge directions are reversed and if the roles of source-receiver pairs are reversed.", "paper_title": "Nonreversibility and equivalent constructions of multiple-unicast networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700021"}
