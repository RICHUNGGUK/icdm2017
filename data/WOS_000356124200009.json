Here J(3) is a suitable set of (R+)(3) to be defined in Section 2. We study the region of accessibility of fixed points of G by the Picard iteration u(n+1) = G(u(n)), where the starting point u(0) is an element of D-0 is not necessarily x(0). Our convergence theory is applied to the Newton-like iterations in Banach spaces under the center Lipschitz condition parallel to F-x' - F-x0'parallel to <= omega(parallel to x - x(0)parallel to) for a given point x(0) is an element of D-0. Our results extend and improve the previous ones in the sense of the center Lipschitz condition and the region of accessibility of solutions. We apply our results to solve the nonlinear Fredholm operator equations of second kind. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
