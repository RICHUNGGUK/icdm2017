We originally used the graphics processing unit (GPU) to develop a visualized reconstruction algorithm that achieves real-time level. Each newly acquired image was transferred to the memory of the GPU and inserted into the reconstruction volume on the GPU. The partially reconstructed volume was then rendered using GPU-based incremental ray casting. After visualized reconstruction, hole-filling was performed on the GPU to fill remaining empty voxels in the reconstruction volume. We examine the real-time nature of the algorithm using in vitro and in vivo datasets. The algorithm can image incremental reconstruction at speed of 26-58 frames/s and complete 3-D imaging in the acquisition time for the conventional freehand 3-D ultrasound.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Visualized Freehand 3D Ultrasound Reconstruction Based on GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000283982200004"}
