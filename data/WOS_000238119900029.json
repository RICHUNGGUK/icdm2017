The approximation ratio in both cases approaches one with n tending to infinity and the number of synchronous communication rounds is poly-logarithmic in n. Our algorithms are purely deterministic.", "paper_title": "Distributed approximation algorithms for planar graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238119900029"}
