Further, must-fail, might-fail and cannot-fail states are formalized and the relationship among them is established. Moreover, the number of each kind of states is calculated. In addition, the conditions for secure communications based on the new protocol are given. Finally, an application is provided to illustrate how the extended strange planet protocol can be used for secure communication.", "paper_title": "An extended strange planet protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000357045600006"}
