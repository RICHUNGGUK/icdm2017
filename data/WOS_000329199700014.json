In this study, the blood is represented by a micropolar fluid. With such an ideal model, the governing equations are reduced to ordinary ones by introducing suitable similar transformations. Homotopy analysis method is employed to obtain the expressions for velocity and microrotation fields. Graphs are sketched for some Values of parameters such as slip coefficient and expansion ratio, and the associated dynamic characteristics are analysed in detail.", "paper_title": "The effects of slip velocity on a micropolar fluid through a porous channel with expanding or contracting walls", "paper_id": "WOS:000329199700014"}
