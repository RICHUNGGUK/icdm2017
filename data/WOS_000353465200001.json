Sensitivity analysis aims to measure the contributions of the inputs on the code output variability. An efficient tool to perform such analysis is the variance-based methods which have been recently investigated in the framework of dependent inputs. One of their issue is that they require a large number of runs for the complex simulators. To handle it, a Gaussian process (GP) regression model may be used to approximate the complex code. In this work, we propose to decompose a GP into a high-dimensional representation. This leads to the definition of a variance-based sensitivity measure well tailored for non-independent inputs. We give a methodology to estimate these indices and to quantify their uncertainty. Finally, the approach is illustrated on toy functions and on a river flood model.", "paper_title": "ANOVA decomposition of conditional Gaussian processes for sensitivity analysis with dependent inputs", "paper_id": "WOS:000353465200001"}
