Such organizations have occasional need for substantial computing power but may lack the budget and in-house expertise to purchase and maintain such resources locally The case study presented in this paper examines the potential benefits and practical challenges that a medium-sized manufacturing firm faced when attempting to leverage computing resources in a cloud computing environment to do model-based simulation. Results show substantial reductions in execution time for the problem of interest, but several socio-technical barriers exist that may hinder more widespread adoption of cloud computing within engineering.", "paper_title": "Computational Engineering in the Cloud: Benefits and Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000299852100004"}
