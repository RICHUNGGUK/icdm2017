In order to clarify these mechanisms, we investigate the stability characteristics of walking using a five-link planar biped robot with a torso and knee joints that has an internal oscillator with a stable limit cycle to generate the joint motions. Herein we conduct numerical simulations and a stability analysis, where we analytically obtain approximate periodic solutions and examine local stability using a Poincar, map. These analyses reveal (1) stability characteristics due to locomotion speed, torso, and knee motion, (2) stability improvement due to the modulation of oscillator states based on phase resetting using foot-contact information, and (3) the optimal parameter in the oscillator dynamics for adequately exploiting the interactions among the robot dynamics, the oscillator dynamics, and the environment in order to increase walking stability. The results of the present study demonstrate the advantage and usefulness of locomotion control using oscillators through mutual interactions.", "paper_title": "Generation of bipedal walking through interactions among the robot dynamics, the oscillator dynamics, and the environment: Stability characteristics of a five-link planar biped robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000286100300001"}
