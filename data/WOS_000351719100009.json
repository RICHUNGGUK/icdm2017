By improving the performance of mobile devices, it is possible to provide high-transfer-speed broadband and seamless mobile multicasting services between indoor and outdoor environments. Multicasting services support efficient group communications. However, mobile multicasting services have two constraints: tunnel convergence and handoff latency. In order to solve these problems, many protocols and handoff methods have been studied. In this paper, we propose inter local mobility anchor (inter-LMA) optimized handoff model for mobile multicasting services in proxy mobility IPv6 based (PMIPv6-based) networks. The proposed model removes the tunnel convergence issue and reduces the router processing costs. Further, it the proposed model allows for the execution of fast handoff operations with adaptive transmission mechanisms. In addition, the proposed scheme exhibits low packet delivery costs and handoff latency in comparison with existing schemes and ensures fast handoff when moving the inter-LMA domain.", "paper_title": "Global Mobility Management Scheme for Seamless Mobile Multicasting Service Support in PMIPv6 Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351719100009"}
