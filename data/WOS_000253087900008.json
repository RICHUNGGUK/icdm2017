The uncertainty is assumed to be of structured linear fractional form, which includes the norm-bounded uncertainty as a special case. A stability condition is first proposed by using switched Lyapunov function, which is dependent on the minimum and maximum delay bounds. Based on the result, a switched state feedback controller is designed. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the result.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent robust stabilisation of uncertain discrete-time switched systems with time-varying state delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000253087900008"}
