Its main advantage is that it obtains the control actions as explicit functions of the plant measurements. This allows for the control actions to be obtained on-line via simple function evaluations instead of solving repetitively a computationally demanding on-line optimisation. This allows mp-MPC to be implemented on the simplest, low-cost hardware. In this paper we report on recent developments on industrial and experimental applications of mp-MPC where the ability of mp-MPC to be applied on systems with fast dynamics and sampling times is demonstrated, which maybe prohibitive for traditional MPC that relies on on-line optimisation methods.
