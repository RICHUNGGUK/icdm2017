In this article, we propose a data hiding system by means of flexible exploiting modification directions to achieve safer message concealments in image-media. In our scheme, n cover-pixels are flexibly chosen on modulo operations to embed a secret s, where n = inverted right perpendicularlog(3)(s)inverted left perpendicular. The varied pixel values associated with the chosen n pixels are only changed among [-1, 1]. Because the numbers of adjustable pixels are much greater than the pixels in the past scheme, our scheme is able to obtain a higher embedded ratio in response to the capacity requirements of information hiding systems. In addition, we also applied the statistics-steganalyzers to demonstrate that our scheme has accomplishment not only higher capacity but also kept the robustness against the blind steganalyzers.", "paper_title": "Data Embedding in Image-Media Using Weight-Function on Modulo Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000327432400003"}
