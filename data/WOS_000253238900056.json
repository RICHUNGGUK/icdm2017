The proposed algorithm presents an improved variant of PSO, a relatively recently introduced stochastic optimization strategy. This hybrid approach employs both cooperative learning and comprehensive learning along with some additional modifications. Cooperative learning is employed to overcome the \"curse of dimensionality\" by decomposing a high-dimensional swarm into several one-dimensional swarms. The comprehensive learning is then employed to discourage premature convergence in each one-dimensional swarm. The capability of this hybrid PSO (called HCOCLPSO) is further enhanced by cloning of fitter particles, at the expense of worst particles, determined on the basis of their fitness values. The performance of HCOCLPSO algorithm is evaluated vis-A-vis an improved GA-based algorithm [Yin, P.-Y., (1999). A fast scheme for optimal thresholding using genetic algorithms.
