IDEOM provides a user-friendly data processing application that automates filtering and identification of metabolite peaks, paying particular attention to common sources of noise and false identifications generated by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms. Building on advanced processing tools such as mzMatch and XCMS, it allows users to run a comprehensive pipeline for data analysis and visualization from a graphical user interface within Microsoft Excel, a familiar program for most biological scientists.", "paper_title": "IDEOM: an Excel interface for analysis of LC-MS-based metabolomics data", "paper_id": "WOS:000302298900027"}
