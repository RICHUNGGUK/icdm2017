Perhaps surprisingly, firewalls are entirely nonexistent in the wireless domain. Yet, the need to selectively control and block radio communication is particularly high in a broadcast environment since any node may receive and send packets. In this demo, we present WiFire, a system that brings the firewall concept to wireless networks. First, WiFire detects and analyzes packets during their transmission, checking their content against a set of rules. It then relies on reactive jamming techniques to selectively block undesired communication. We show the feasibility and performance of WiFire, which is implemented on the USRP2 software-defined radio platform, in several scenarios with IEEE 802.15.4 radios. WiFire is able to classify and effectively block undesired communication without interfering with desired communication.", "paper_title": "WiFire: A Firewall for Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000302124800068"}
