However, for most diabetic patients, their blood sugar is not under good control, especially in ICUs. Good control of blood sugar may reduce the risk of sepsis to 34% for patients in ICUs. The importance of good blood sugar control for patients in ICUs is manifested by a significant reduction of mortality and morbidity. This study designed a clinical decision support system (CDSS) using a support vector machine (SVM) to predict if a critically ill patient can have good glucose control after insulin administration. A filter method based on logistic regression analysis (LRA) and a wrapper method based on recursive feature elimination (RFE) were adopted to select salient features from 10 variables for CDSS design. Data on 231 patients (2492 records) were collected covering four years from an ICU. Four significant variables (p < 0.05) using LRA in contrast to five ones using RFE algorithm, were selected. The results show that the predictive accuracy under cross-validation was 93.50% for features selected with LRA, and the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with SVM-RFE were 95.75%, 92.71% and 99.81%, respectively. It could predict the outcome quite accurately after having injected a certain dose of insulin. The proposed system may help doctors effectively assess their patients in determining insulin dose for better glucose control in an ICU setting.", "paper_title": "EVALUATION OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEM TO THE CONTROL OF DIABETES", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400019"}
