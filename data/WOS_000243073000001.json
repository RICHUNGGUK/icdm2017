This condition rules out the reliable numerical solution of Helmholtz equation in three dimensions for large wave numbers k greater than or similar to 50. In our paper. we will present a refined finite element theory for highly indefinite Helmholtz problems where the stability of the discretisation can be checked through an \"almost invariance\" condition. As an application, we will consider a one-dimensional finite element space for the Helmholtz equation and apply our theory to prove stability under the weakened condition hk less than or similar to 1 and optimal convergence estimates.", "paper_title": "A refined finite element convergence theory for highly indefinite Helmholtz problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243073000001"}
