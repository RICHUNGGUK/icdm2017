The uncertain robust switched control system model is built. Meanwhile, the methodology of robust optimization is introduced to minimize the bullwhip effect, and the solution of optimal decision serials is explored utilizing H-infinity switched control algorithm. The online decision-making simulation framework structure is developed to demonstrate the switching procedure. The simulation example proves that chain-to-chain inventory transshipment in CSC networks and robust switch control method can effectively weaken the bullwhip effect, reduce stock, dwindle fluctuation of order, and improve response to cluster market.
