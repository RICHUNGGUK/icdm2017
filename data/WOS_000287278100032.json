Current backup techniques produce large volume of backup data. Up till now, there was no efficient indexing method to retrieve a snapshot from updating log in block-level replication system. In this paper, we present a novel indexing method that is capable of querying any version of historical snapshot without introducing additional backup operations. A detailed mathematical model is used to analyze the complexity of our implementation. Under the guide of mathematical analysis, we present Hierarchical Clustering Snapshot Indexing Method (HCSIM). HCSIM includes snapshot query algorithm, version deleting rules and concurrency control policy. Extensive experiments have been carried out to show that the new indexing method can support snapshot query at low cost, both in theory and practice. Performance evaluation of the novel indexing method indicates that the implementation is optimal in current snapshot indexing methods.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT SNAPSHOT INDEXING METHOD FOR BLOCK-LEVEL BACKUP DATA IN REPLICATION SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000287278100032"}
