In this paper, we have proposed an approach based on Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) for the LCMST problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a well-known population-based swarm intelligence algorithm. Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is also proposed by combining the classical PSO philosophy and quantum mechanics to improve performance of PSO. In this paper QPSO has been modified by adding a leaping behavior. When the modified QPSO (MQPSO), falls in to the local optimum, MPSO runs a leaping behavior to leap out the local optimum. We have compared the performance of the proposed method with ML, SCGA, ACO-LCMST, TS-LCMST and ABC-LCMST, which are reported in the literature. Computational results demonstrate the superiority of the MQPSO approach over all the other approaches. The MQPSO approach obtained better quality solutions in shorter time.", "paper_title": "Leaf constrained minimal spanning trees solved by modified quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000278347500001"}
