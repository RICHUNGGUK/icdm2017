A negative rule indicates that if an object does not satisfy the attribute-value pairs in the condition part, then we can exclude the decision part from such object. The proposed rough set model is constructed on the basis of a difference relation. Such difference relation is a binary relation without any constraints. Moreover, to simplify the negative rules generated from the difference relation-based rough approximations, the concepts of lower, upper approximate and rough reducts are also proposed. Some numerical examples are employed to substantiate the conceptual arguments.", "paper_title": "DIFFERENCE RELATION-BASED ROUGH SET AND NEGATIVE RULES IN INCOMPLETE INFORMATION SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000270694900003"}
