The relationship between the lighting conditions and the color of image is non-linear, several neural networks technologies are introduced to make curve fitting. As a result, virtual images of same scene under different lighting conditions can be deduced from known real scene image, and the inherent relations of image color and outside lighting conditions are discovered. Combining techniques of IBMR or panoramic image, the model of scene is recovered. Further, combining the dynamic virtual images obtained by our method, time-sequence dynamic virtual scene can be reconstructed and revisited in virtual reality. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
