A fuzzy controller based on on-line optimization of a zero order Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system (FIS) by a back propagation-like algorithm is successfully applied. It is used to minimize a cost function that is made up of a quadratic error term and a weight decay term that prevents an excessive growth of parameters. Thus, we carried out control for the continuation of simple trajectories such as the follow-up of straight lines, and complex (half circle, corner, and helicoidal) by using the STFIS technique. This permits to prove the effectiveness of the proposed control law. Simulation results and a comparison with a static feedback linearization controller (SFL) are presented and discussed. We studied the robustness of the two controllers used in the presence of disturbances. We presented two types of disturbances, the case of a breakdown of an engine as well as a gust of wind.
