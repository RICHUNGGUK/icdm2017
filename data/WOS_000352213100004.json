In this paper, we present an augmented Lagrangian-based approach that uses a discrete form of the L-1-norm of the mean curvature of the graph of the image as a regularizer, discretization being achieved via a finite element method. When a particular alternating direction method of multipliers is applied to the solution of the resulting saddle-point problem, this solution reduces to an iterative sequential solution of four subproblems. These subproblems are solved using Newton's method, the conjugate gradient method, and a partial solution variant of the cyclic reduction method. The approach considered here differs from existing augmented Lagrangian approaches for the solution of the same problem; indeed, the augmented Lagrangian functional we use here contains three Lagrange multipliers \"only,\" and the associated augmentation terms are all quadratic. In addition to the description of the solution algorithm, this paper contains the results of numerical experiments demonstrating the performance of the novel method discussed here.", "paper_title": "A New Augmented Lagrangian Approach for L-1-mean Curvature Image Denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000352213100004"}
