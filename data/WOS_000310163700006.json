This question was solved in full generality by Rodl and Rucinski [Combinatorics, Paul Erdos is eighty, vol. 1, 1993, 317346; J Am Math Soc 8(1995), 917942]. In this paper we consider a different randomization that was recently suggested by Allen et al. [Random Struct Algorithms, in press]. Let \\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{amsmath,amsfonts} \\pagestyle{empty} \\begin{document}${{\\mathcal R}_F(n,q)}$\\end{document} be a random subset of all copies of F on a vertex set Vn of size n, in which every copy is present independently with probability q. For which functions q = q(n) can we color the edges of the complete graph on Vn with r colors such that no monochromatic copy of F is contained in \\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{amsmath,amsfonts} \\pagestyle{empty} \\begin{document}${{\\mathcal R}_F(n,q)}$\\end{document} ? We answer this question for strictly 2-balanced graphs F. Moreover, we combine bsts an r-edge-coloring of G(n, p)oth randomizations and prove a threshold result for the property that there exi such that no monochromatic copy of F is contained in \\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{amsmath,amsfonts} \\pagestyle{empty} \\begin{document}${{\\mathcal R}_F(n,q)}$\\end{document}.
