The resultant sequences and the employed sequences have the same period, or the former's length is twice as long as the latter's, depending on the differently proposed methods. In addition, the simulation results by a computer show that energy efficiency of the proposed sequences in Construction 2 is higher than that of the employed PTSs. Incidentally, one of our constructions can also produce a family of almost perfect 8-QAM+ sequences with only two nonzero nontrivial autocorrelation values.", "paper_title": "Perfect 8-QAM+ Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200032"}
