The interpolation can approximate the interpolated function very well by selecting suitable parameter and weight coefficient. And what is more, a new method of value control is employed to control the shape of curves, and the optimal solution with minimal strain energy for the value control equation is derived. Also when the weight coefficient is in [0,1], The error estimation formula of this interpolation function is obtained.", "paper_title": "A blending rational spline for value control of curves with minimal energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000300529400008"}
