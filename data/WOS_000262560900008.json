The objective is to maximize the number of requests satisfied by the schedule. In this paper, we focus on an important special case where all the requests have their spans (the difference between release time and deadline) less than 2. We give in optimal online algorithm, i.e.. its competitive ratio matches the lower bound of the problem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
