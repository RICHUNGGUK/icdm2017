This method identifies and delineates individual zones of erosion and deposition as discrete objects. The explicit object representation of erosion and deposition zones is consistent with the perception and cognition of human analysts and geomorphologists. The extracted objects provide ontological and epistemological foundation to localize, represent, and interpret erosion and deposition patches for better coastal resource management and erosion control. The discrete objects are much better information carriers than the grid cells in the field-based representation of source data. A set of spatial and volumetric attributes are derived to characterize and quantify location, area, shape, orientation, depth, volume, and other properties of erosion and deposition objects. Compared with the conventional cell-by-cell differencing approaches, our object-based method gives a concise and high-level representation of information and knowledge about coastal morphological dynamics. The derived attributes enable the discrimination of true morphological changes from artifacts caused by data noise and processing errors. Furthermore, the concise object representation of erosion and deposition zones facilitates overlay analysis in conjunction with other GIS data layers for understanding the causes and impacts of morphological and volumetric changes. We have implemented a software tool for our object-based morphological analysis, which will be freely available for the public. An example is used to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of this new method.", "paper_title": "An object-based conceptual framework and computational method for representing and analyzing coastal morphological changes", "paper_id": "WOS:000278668800004"}
