To this end, we propose a nested transaction model. In this model we define 5 types of transactions each of which is responsible for certain tasks. The tasks and properties of these transactions are characterized in the paper.", "paper_title": "Managing evolution of data warehouses by means of nested transactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200013"}
