This entails the cooperation of enterprise servers using Web services technology. The service exchange between enterprises must be carried out with a determined level of quality, which is usually established in a service level agreement (SLA). However, the fulfilment of SLAs is not an easy task and requires equipping the servers with special control mechanisms which control the quality of the services supplied. The first contribution of this research work is the analysis and definition of the main requirements that these control mechanisms must fulfil. The second contribution is the design of a control mechanism which fulfils these requirements and overcomes numerous deficiencies posed by previous mechanisms. The designed mechanism provides differentiation between distinct categories of service consumers as well as protection against server overloads. Furthermore, it scales in a cluster and does not require any modification to the system software of the host server, or to its application logic.", "paper_title": "A QoS Control Mechanism to Provide Service Differentiation and Overload Protection to Internet Scalable Servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000208240000002"}
