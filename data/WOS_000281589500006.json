Such a decision can be based on packet header fields, packet payload content, statistical characteristics of traffic and communication patterns of network hosts. However, most present techniques rely on some sort of a priori knowledge, which means they require labor-intensive preprocessing before running and cannot deal with previously unknown applications. In this paper, we propose a traffic classification system based on application signatures, with a novel approach to fully automate the process of deriving signatures from unidentified traffic. The key idea is to integrate statistics-based flow clustering with payload-based signature matching method, so as to eliminate the requirement of pre-labeled training data sets. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach using real-world traffic trace, and the results indicate that signature classifiers built from clustered data and pre-labeled data are able to achieve similar high accuracy better than 99%.
