EBEAM supports the evaluation of different architectural design versions for modifiability. In addition, EBEAM supports relative comparison between these design versions and the target design. We develop EBEAM as a generalized technique that is reusable for evaluating other architectural design attributes, apart from modifiability. We discuss EBEAM in detail and report on two case studies that investigate its applicability, and one study that validates the results of the evaluations made using EBEAM.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the Modifiability of Software Architectural Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000267475900007"}
