Pose (heave and pitch) of the platform is achieved by means of two double acting single rod industrial grade hydraulic cylinders. The cylinders are actuated by low cost proportional valves having 15% deadband and 15 Hz natural frequency. The heave motion and the combination of heave and pitch motion of the platform are controlled by a real time controller. Different types of controller, namely proportional integral derivative (PID), hybrid fuzzy-PID, self-tuning fuzzy-PID and self-tuning fuzzy-PID with bias are designed. The real time control performances of the controllers are studied for step and sinusoidal demands of the piston. In order to achieve the required performance of the controller, suitable values for the control parameters are tuned for each controller. It is found that the self-tuning fuzzy-PID with bias controller shows the best control response compared to other controllers for control of the heave, pitch and combined heave and pitch motion.
