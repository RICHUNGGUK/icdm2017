We first derive equations of power gain, noise figure (NF) and input third-order intercept point (IIP3) of the two-stage LNA. A design methodology of the LNA is presented by using graphs based on analytical equations. A I-V 5.4-GHz LNA was implemented in 0.15-mu m fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS technology. Measurement results show a power gain of 23 dB, NF of 1.7 dB and IIP3 of -6.1 dBm with a power consumption of 8.3 mW. These measured results are consistent with calculated results, which ensures the validity of the derived equations and the proposed design methodology.", "paper_title": "Analytical expression based design of a low-voltage FD-SOI CMOS low-noise amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000244547000003"}
