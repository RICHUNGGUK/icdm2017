In this code, each user employs a PCC with M + 1 component codes, where the first component code is a rate-1/q repetition code and the other M component codes are the same rate-1 recursive convolutional (RC) codes. By designing the repetition coding rate and the RC component code, the K-user PCC achieve reliable transmission for a given number of users and noise level. Two decoding schemes are considered: low-density parity-check (LDPC)-like decoding and Turbo-like decoding. For each decoding scheme, a fixed point analysis is given to optimize the parameters: the rate of repetition component code 1/q, the number of RC component codes M, or the RC component codes themselves. The analysis shows that an accumulate code is the optimal RC component code for a K-user PCC, in the sense of achieving the maximum sum rate. The K-user PCC with an accumulate component code achieves a larger sum rate in the high rate region than the conventional scheme of an error correction code serially concatenated with spreading under similar encoding and decoding complexity.", "paper_title": "K-User Parallel Concatenated Code for Multiple-Access Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414000010"}
