Sufficient conditions for the global exponential stability of equilibrium point are established by constructing suitable Lyapunov functional and differential inequality techniques, which complement and improve the main results of Zhang et al. (Adv Differ Equ 8:1-12; 2011) and Gopalsamy (J Math Anal Appl 325: 1117-1132; 2007). Moreover, an example is given to demonstrate the feasibility of our method.", "paper_title": "Global exponential stability of fuzzy BAM neural networks with distributed delays and time-varying delays in the leakage terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100013"}
