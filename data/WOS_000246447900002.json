Based on the Lyapunov functional method, and the relationship between the system states and the derivatives of these states, we present a new asymptotical stability criterion and a new robust stability criterion in terms of only one simple linear matrix inequality (LMI), which guarantees stability for such systems with time-varying delays. This LMI can be easily solved by various convex optimization algorithms. Two examples are given to illustrate the advantages of the proposed methods over the existing ones. (C) 2006 IMACS.
