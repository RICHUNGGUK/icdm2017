By using two integrated VCOs and combining digital and analog tuning techniques, a PLL lock range from 8 to 12 GHz is achieved. Due to a small VCO line tuning gain and optimized charge pump output biasing, the phase noise is low and almost constant over the tuning range. All 16 sub-bands show a tuning range above 900 MHz each, allowing temperature compensation without sub-band switching. This makes the synthesizer robust against variations of the device parameters with process, supply voltage, temperature and aging. The measured phase noise is -87 dBc/Hz and -106 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz and 1 MHz offset, respectively. In integer-N mode, phase noise values down to -98 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz and -111 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, respectively, were measured.", "paper_title": "An integrated 8-12 GHz fractional-N frequency synthesizer in SiGe BiCMOS for satellite communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000282012800003"}
