This paper presents a new approach to detect depth of anaesthesia by using recurrence quantification analysis of electroencephalogram(EEG) and artificial neural network(ANN). The EEG recordings were collected from consenting patient prior to incision during isoflurane anaesthesia of different levels. The four measures of recurrence plot were extracted from each of eight-channel EEG time series. Prediction was made by means of ANN. The system was able to correctly classify purposeful responses in average accuracy of 87.76% of the cases.", "paper_title": "Recurrence quantification analysis of EEG predicts responses to incision during anesthesia", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000007"}
