Our goal is to examine repository users' perceptions of the conditions under which these mechanisms verify knowledge contributions. Qualitative data show that perceived credibility of experts, perceived ownership of content, and experts' (meticulous) execution of governance functions are salient for expert-governance, and the perceived involvement of community members, and community members' (continuous and collective) execution of governance functions are important for community-governance.", "paper_title": "Verification of Knowledge Assets in Electronic Repositories: Expert- and Community-Governance", "paper_id": "WOS:000318164500007"}
