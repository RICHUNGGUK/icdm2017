It aims to accurately map the distribution of relative stopping power. Because protons traverse material media in non-linear paths, pCT requires individual proton processing. Image reconstruction then becomes a time-consuming process. Clinical-use scenarios that require images from billions of protons in less than ten or fifteen minutes have motivated us to use distributed and hardware-accelerated computing methods to achieve fast image reconstruction. Combined use of MPI and GPUs demonstrates that clinically viable image reconstruction is possible. On a 60-node CPU/GPU computer cluster, we achieved efficient strong and weak scaling when reconstructing images from two billion histories in under seven minutes. This represents a significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art in pCT, which took almost seventy minutes to reconstruct an image from 131 million histories on a single-CPU, single-GPU computer.
