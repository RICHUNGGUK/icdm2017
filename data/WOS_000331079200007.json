As the main contribution, a generic construction of ZDB functions is presented, and many new classes of ZDB functions can be generated. This construction is then extended to construct a set of ZDB functions, in which any two ZDB functions are related uniformly. Furthermore, some applications of such sets of ZDB functions are also introduced.", "paper_title": "SETS OF ZERO-DIFFERENCE BALANCED FUNCTIONS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000331079200007"}
