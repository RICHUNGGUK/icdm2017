Barriers to the development of NMES controllers exist because the muscle response to an electrical stimulation is nonlinear and the muscle model is uncertain. Efforts in this paper focus on the development of an adaptive inverse optimal NMES controller. The controller yields desired limb trajectory tracking while simultaneously minimizing a cost functional that is positive in the error states and stimulation input. The development of this framework allows tradeoffs to be made between tracking performance and control effort by putting different penalties on error states and control input, depending on the clinical goal or functional task. The controller is examined through a Lyapunov-based analysis. Experiments on able-bodied individuals are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed controller.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Inverse Optimal Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000327647500017"}
