In this paper, we show that the already proposed encoding scheme is not optimal and we present a new one, proving that it is optimal. Moreover, we compare the two encodings theoretically and we derive a set of conditions which show that, in practical cases, the proposed encoding always offers better compression. In terms of hardware overhead, the new scheme is at least as low-demanding as the old one. The increased compression efficiency, the resulting test-time savings, and the low hardware overhead of the proposed method are also verified experimentally.", "paper_title": "Optimal selective Huffman coding for test-data compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000248083100010"}
