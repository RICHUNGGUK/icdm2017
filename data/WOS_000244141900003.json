Let G(i) be a connected graph with order n(i), minimum degree delta(i) and edge-connectivity lambda(i) for i = 1, 2. This article shows that lambda'(G(1) x G(2)) >= min{n(1) lambda(2), n(2) lambda(1), lambda(1) + 2 lambda(2), 2 lambda(1) + lambda(2)} for n(1), n(2) >= 3 and lambda'(K-2 x G(2)) = min(n(2), 2 lambda(2)), which generalizes the main result of Shieh on the super edge-connectedness of the Cartesian product of two regular graphs with maximum edge-connectivity. In particular, this article determines lambda'(G(1) x G(2)) = min{n(1) delta(2), n(2) delta(1), xi(G(1) x G(2))} if lambda'(G(i)) = xi(G(i)), where xi(G) is the minimum edge-degree of a graph G.
