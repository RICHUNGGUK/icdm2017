The BER contours are presented by extending the results in the literature up to 360km/h. Both physical channel modeling and system reliability are considered to study the high speed railway Cellular system. The cluster size, reuse distance and overlapping areas are determined by BER which is generated by co-channel interference, delayed signals Doppler affect and additive noise. The simulation results show that the cluster smaller than 5 is not available if maximum BER requirement is 10(-3) and the Cluster should be larger than 4 with BER requirement 10(-2). Therefore, it is a powerful tool to design and evaluate the performance of high speed railway cellular system.", "paper_title": "Design of Cells for High Speed Railway System", "paper_id": "WOS:000274703600013"}
