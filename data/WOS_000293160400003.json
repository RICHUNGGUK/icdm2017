Hence, to ease the task of the developers, some automatic techniques have been proposed to design self-stabilizing algorithms. In this paper, we propose an automatic transformer for algorithms in an extended population protocol model. Population protocols is a model that was introduced recently for networks with a large number of resource-limited mobile agents. We use a variant of this model. First, we assume agents having characteristics (e.g., moving speed, communication radius) affecting their intercommunication \"speed\", which is reflected by their cover times. Second, we assume the existence of a special agent with an unbounded memory, the base station. The automatic transformer takes as an input an algorithm solving a static problem (and meeting some additional rather natural requirements) and outputs a self-stabilizing algorithm for the same problem. The transformer is built using a re-execution approach (the technique consisting of executing an algorithm repeatedly in order to obtain its self-stabilizing version). We show that in the model we use, a transformer based on such an approach is impossible without the assumption of an unbounded memory agent. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
