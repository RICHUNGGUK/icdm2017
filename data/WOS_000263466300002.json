One major consideration for virtual construction is the simulation of the operation of construction equipment for a construction project. This research specifically focuses on developing a mathematical model to support the simulation and visualization of cranes, the most critical equipment in terms of project controls. This model is composed of two submodels-a kinematics model and a dynamic model. The kinematics model is to present the crane components controlled by the operators. The dynamic model is to present the dynamic behavior in suspended system (including the cable and rigging object), which cannot be controlled directly by the operators. To verify the feasibility of these methods, a computer program that simulates and visualizes detailed crane activities was developed. This program supports the real-time visualization of crane activities with high degree of reality accuracy and also, enables the detailed simulation of long-term construction projects.", "paper_title": "Numerical Methods to Simulate and Visualize Detailed Crane Activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000263466300002"}
