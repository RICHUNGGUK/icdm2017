First, we show that the validity of a recent conjecture of Nemirovski is actually a direct consequence of the so-called non-commutative Khintchine's inequality in functional analysis. Using this result, we show that an SDP-based algorithm of Nemirovski, which is developed for solving a class of quadratic optimization problems with orthogonality constraints, has a logarithmic approximation guarantee. This improves upon the polynomial approximation guarantee established earlier by Nemirovski. Furthermore, we obtain improved safe tractable approximations of a certain class of chance constrained linear matrix inequalities. Secondly, we consider a recent result of Delage and Ye on the so-called data-driven distributionally robust stochastic programming problem. One of the assumptions in the Delage-Ye result is that the underlying probability distribution has bounded support. However, using a suitable moment inequality, we show that the result in fact holds for a much larger class of probability distributions. Given the close connection between the behavior of sums of random matrices and the theoretical properties of various optimization problems, we expect that the moment inequalities discussed in this paper will find further applications in optimization.", "paper_title": "Moment inequalities for sums of random matrices and their applications in optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000295785100006"}
