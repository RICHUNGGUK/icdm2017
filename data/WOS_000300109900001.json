As a byproduct, we give an alternative (to the algorithm in Ref. 4) O(n log r) algorithm that finds the red-blue boundary for n bichromatic points on the line, where r is the size of this boundary. Another byproduct is an O(n(2) + t) algorithm that finds the intersections of line segments having two red endpoints with those having two blue endpoints defined on a set of n bichromatic points in the plane, where t is the number of these intersections.", "paper_title": "FINDING SIMPLICES CONTAINING THE ORIGIN IN TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300109900001"}
