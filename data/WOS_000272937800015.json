The optimized procedure was subsequently utilized to dock into HDAC8 and into a homology model of HDAC I nearly 40 compounds that had been tested for their inhibitory activity against the two HDAC isozymes. Evaluation of the best binding poses allowed LIS to identify the ligand properties and the protein residues important for activity and selectivity. HDACs are important anticancer drug targets, and their Study is currently being actively pursued. As such, our results could help design new isozyme-selective HDAC inhibitors. Furthermore, this strategy may also be used for the investigation of other HDACs.", "paper_title": "Docking of Hydroxamic Acids into HDAC1 and HDAC8: A Rationalization of Activity Trends and Selectivities", "paper_id": "WOS:000272937800015"}
