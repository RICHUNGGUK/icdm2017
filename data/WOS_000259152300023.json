It has high autonomy and mobility, that is, it can move unbridled in different execution environments and automatically detect its current environment and respond accordingly. The above qualities make the mobile agent very suitable for use in e-commerce. Transfer of confidential information over the Internet is always risky. A mobile agent may be tampered with by a malicious host, or confidential information carried by the mobile agent could be stolen by other agents. Thus, it is essential that a mobile agent is equipped with security measures to guard against these attacks. This paper proposes a security scheme for mobile agents. The scheme includes access control and key management to ensure the security and confidentiality of information and the system. After examining the access control and key management scheme for mobile agents proposed by Volker and Mehrdad, the proposed scheme applies the concepts of polynomial interpolation formula, hierarchy structure, and the superkey to improve Volker and Mehrdad's schemes which needed a large amount of space for the mobile agent. A security and performance analysis proves the proposed scheme can effectively protect the mobile agents.", "paper_title": "Efficient hierarchical key management scheme for access control in the mobile agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300023"}
