In this work we propose a variational approach for estimating multi-valued velocity fields in transparent sequences. Starting from existing local motion estimators, we derive a variational model for integrating in space and time such a local information in order to obtain a robust estimation of the multi-valued velocity field. With this approach, we can indeed estimate multi-valued velocity fields which are not necessarily piecewise constant on a layer-each layer can evolve according to a non-parametric optical flow. We show how our approach outperforms existing methods; and we illustrate its capabilities on challenging experiments on both synthetic and real sequences.", "paper_title": "Variational Multi-Valued Velocity Field Estimation for Transparent Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000293327400005"}
