Respondents may find it even more difficult to assess their actual usage of mobile services as these can be used in highly variable contexts. This paper examines the extent of self-report bias in mobile acceptance and usage studies and suggests countermeasures. We demonstrate that several Type-1 and Type-2 errors are made when relying on self-reports rather than log data. Weighing can partly mitigate self-report bias as older people are more accurate than younger people. Log data replace self-reports in order to reduce self-report bias in mobile acceptance studies.
