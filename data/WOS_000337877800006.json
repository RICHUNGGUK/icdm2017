A control system was developed to apply the quantity of the herbicide based on quantified weed information. The unit consists of a camera for capturing the images of weeds, MATLAB software for image acquisition and processing in a laptop, a serial port communication for communicating between laptop and controller, a microcontroller for controlling the application of herbicide through a relay, and a dc solenoid valve for variable rate application of herbicide on the applicating roller. The captured image was analyzed by the image processing toolbox in the MATLAB software, to extract weed information in the image, which is then transferred to a microcontroller using serial port interface. The microcontroller activates the solenoid valve using a relay according to algorithm for decision of the herbicide amount. Field test results of the machine indicate an average of 50% saving in the amount of herbicide, with weeding efficiency of 90%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
