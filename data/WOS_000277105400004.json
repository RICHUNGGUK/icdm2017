This paper introduces the OO-Method COSMIC Function Points (OOmCFP) procedure, which has been systematically designed to measure the functional size of object-oriented applications generated from their conceptual models by means of model transformations. The OOmCFP procedure is structured in three phases: a strategy phase, a mapping phase, and a measurement phase. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the use of OOmCFP, as well as an analysis of the results obtained. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
