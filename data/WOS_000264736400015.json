In order to take full advantage of the multi-core processor's computing resources (the prevailing current of personal computer) and accelerate the time-consuming algorithms in chemometrics, a novel multi-core computing method is introduced. Leave-one-out cross-validation is taken as an example to show the powerful capability of the multi-core computing. The comparison results show that the execution time drops rapidly with the increasing number of computing cores, which demonstrates that the multi-core computing is a promising tool for solving computing-intensive and data-intensive problems in chemometrics.
