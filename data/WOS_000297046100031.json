The difficulty of developing a theory to deal with nonlinear transformations of white noise has been to interpret the corresponding limits. In this paper, we show that a renormalization and centering of powers of band-limited Gaussian processes is Gaussian white noise, and, as a consequence, homogeneous polynomials under suitable renormalization remain white noises.", "paper_title": "On Powers of Gaussian White Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000297046100031"}
