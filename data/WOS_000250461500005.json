The system includes a programmable microcontroller, a programmable DC/DC converter, a multi output HV interface and electrostatic MEMS actuators. The system produces high output voltages (10-300 V) and can control a large variety of MEMS capacitive loads (1 to 50 pF) by combining diverse semiconductor technologies. This system proves that technologies, such as low voltage CMOS of different processes, high voltage DMOS and MEMS, can interact, communicate and even be integrated as a System In Package (SIP), providing significant size and cost reductions. The system was programmed to control electrostatic MEMS actuator. The DC/DC converter was made from components of different technologies and two addressable high voltage CMOS interfaces were fabricated with DALSA's 0.8 mu m High Voltage process. A prototype of the global system has been built and tested.", "paper_title": "System integration of high voltage electrostatic MEMS actuators", "paper_id": "WOS:000250461500005"}
