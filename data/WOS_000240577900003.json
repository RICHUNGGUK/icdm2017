We develop two distributed algorithms: an enumerative search and an evolutionary algorithm. The former is a simple technique, whose high time complexity is mastered down to acceptable execution times to some extent by the use of a Grid-enabled computing system such Globus. The second algorithm is an extension of PAES, a sequential evolutionary algorithm. The parallel results indicate that using Globus is a promising research line to solve multi-objective problems in Grid computing environments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
