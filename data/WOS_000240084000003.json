However, the IEEE 802.15.3 standard does not specify the scheduling scheme. In this paper, we propose a priority management scheme for the IEEE 802.15.3 HR-WPAN, in which channel time allocations are scheduled, based on priority levels of data frames. We also analyze performance of management scheme by using an M/M/1 with priority queuing model. Our performance model has been validated via simulations.", "paper_title": "A priority management scheme for High Rate Wireless Personal Area Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000003"}
