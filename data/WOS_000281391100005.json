In this paper a thorough evaluation of the performance of MLMINs using an analytical model is presented, as such an evaluation has not previously been developed. The multicasting policy that is used by MLMIN queues is the \"partial multicast\" and all the MLMINs studied use the \"Cell Replication While Routing\" (CRWR) technique. The performance model was applied under different offered loads to various network size MLMINs supporting various proportions of unicast and multicast traffic. The results have been confirmed in some marginal cases by existing work and the study reveals quantitatively the improvement in the performance metrics of MLMINs compared to the corresponding single-layer MINs. The findings of this paper are important as they could be useful in building optimum networks regarding their performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
