The model is based on an uncoupled decomposition of the stored energy function and a generalization of the inversion formula used by Sussman and Bathe. The present extension introduces some approximations that, in all studied cases, do not yield relevant deviations from the experimental data. The isotropic model results in a particular case of the present formulation. Several possibilities of user-prescribed experimental data are addressed. The model is used to predict experiments of calendered rubber and of biological tissues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
