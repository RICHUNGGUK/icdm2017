When the transmission rates of the control signals and the data signals differ, the transmission range of the lower transmission rate is larger than the transmission range of the higher transmission rate. Since a lower transmission rate increases the transmission range, it also increases the nodes in the Network Allocation Vector (NAV) status and decreases the network throughput. However, if a neighbor receiving the control signal of the ongoing communication pair communicates with another node, it may occur signal interference. This study proposes a Space Overlapping MAC (SO-MAC) protocol to increase the communication pairs and avoid interferences in single radio for multi-rate wireless network. The SO-MAC protocol uses a channel division mechanism to avoid interference between the data and control signals. This study also proposes a bandwidth allocation strategy for the sub-channels to maximize the utilization of the bandwidth of the divided sub-channels. To solve the interference between the data signals, SO-MAC allows a neighbor of the sender and the receiver to use the received signal strength to determine whether it can send or receive the data signal to increase the communication pairs. Simulation results show that, compared to the IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol and DCA protocol, the proposed SO-MAC protocol with the bandwidth allocation strategy can increase the communication pairs, achieve better throughput, reduce the number of handshake failures, and decrease the delay of transmitting a packet.
