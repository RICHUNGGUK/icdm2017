A number of techniques have been proposed to address this problem. However, previous research has been largely focused on bulk transfers. This paper investigates the effects of bandwidth asymmetry on Weblike short-lived transfers. Two prediction models, one given in a closed form and the other in a recursive form, are presented for TCP transfers without and with ACK Filtering (AF), a representative optimizing technique for TCP transfers over bandwidth asymmetric links. Ns-2 based experiments show that these models can predict TCP transfer latency with a high degree of accuracy. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
