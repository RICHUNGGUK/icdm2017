In this paper, an efficient multiclass classifier is presented to detect pedestrians and classify their moving style simultaneously. The multiclass classifier composes of three two-class classifiers and each of them is trained with a SVM algorithm. Experiments based on a single camera pedestrian detection system show that the multiclass classifier has an acceptable detection rate; at the same time, it can judge whether a pedestrian is walking along the road or across the road.", "paper_title": "A multiclass classifier to detect pedestrians and acquire their moving styles", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800121"}
