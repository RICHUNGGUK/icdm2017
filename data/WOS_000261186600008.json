That will brings some disadvantages to aggregate the information. For a uniform criterion, the standard linguistic truth value (SLTV) set is proposed. Based on the former hypothesis of transformation models of linguistic truth values, four transformation models are discussed: the model of point to point, the model of fuzzy set to point, the model of point to fuzzy set and the model of fuzzy set to fuzzy set. An example is to analyze it. Using the applicability measure we can choose appropriate SLTV for the different sensory evaluation system.", "paper_title": "A uniform approach of linguistic truth values in sensor evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000261186600008"}
