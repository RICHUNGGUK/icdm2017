It has been shown that when the amplitude of random phase properly increases, two different kinds of chaotic arrays, unsynchronized and synchronized, can be controlled by the criterion of top Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov exponent was computed based on Khasminskii's formulation and the extension of Wedig's algorithm for linear stochastic systems. In particular, it was found that with stronger coupling the synchronized chaotic arrays are more controllable than the unsynchronized ones. The bifurcation analysis, the spatiotemporal evolution, and the Poincare map were carried out to confirm the results of the top Lyapunov exponent on the dynamical behavior of control stability. Excellent agreement was found between these results.", "paper_title": "TAMING CHAOTIC ARRAYS BY PARAMETRIC EXCITATION WITH PROPER RANDOM PHASE", "paper_id": "WOS:000271219200010"}
