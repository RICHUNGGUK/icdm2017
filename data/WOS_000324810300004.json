In realistic sites the temperature of concrete is not isothermal 20 degrees C, so the paper measured adiabatic temperature increases of four different concretes to understand heat emission during hydration at early age. The temperature-matching curing schedule in accordance with adiabatic temperature increase is adopted to simulate the situation in real massive concrete. The specimens under temperature-matching curing are subjected to realistic temperature for first few days as well as adiabatic condition. The mechanical properties including compressive strength, splitting strength and modulus of elasticity of concretes cured under both temperature-matching curing and isothermal 20 degrees C curing are investigated. The results denote that comparing temperature-matching curing with isothermal 20 degrees C curing, the early age concretes mechanical properties are obviously improved, but the later mechanical properties of concretes with pure Portland and containing silica fume are decreased a little and still increased for concretes containing fly ash and slag. On this basement using an equivalent age approach evaluates mechanical properties of early age concrete in real structures, the model parameters are defined by the compressive strength test, and can predict the compressive strength, splitting strength and elasticity modulus through measuring or calculating by finite element method the concreted temperature at early age, and the method is valid, which is applied in a concrete wall for evaluation of crack risking.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of early age mechanical properties of concrete in real structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000324810300004"}
