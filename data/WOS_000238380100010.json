However most scholars may lack knowledge of deploying CPD in current industrial settings, and their research efforts may thus fail to fulfill practical needs. This paper presents a series of empirical case studies on distributed product development in Asia-Pacific Region. Engineering collaborations among brand-owner manufacturer and supplier in six product design chains (desktop PC, IC substrate, LCD monitoy; bicycle, mold design, and CPU cooler) are under investigation. A systematic approach is developed that categorizes CPD into three modes based on the number of engineering BOM items and the difficulty of modularization in product design. It provides a preliminary but structured template for CPD deployment by characterizing the implications and software features of each mode. The cases also reveal values which CPD creates for the downstream supplier of a global value chain and new IT technologies enabling the collaboration process. This work is one of the early studies that analyze collaborative product development from the perspective of a manufacturer The findings complement and corroborate theoretical studies in related research.", "paper_title": "Empirical studies on inter-organizational collaborative product development", "paper_id": "WOS:000238380100010"}
