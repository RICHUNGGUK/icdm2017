In this paper we give reduction rules for a weighted variant of treewidth, motivated by the analysis of algorithms for probabilistic networks. We present two general reduction rules that are safe for weighted treewidth. They generalise many of the existing reduction rules for treewidth. Experimental results show that these reduction rules can significantly reduce the problem size for several instances of real-life probabilistic networks.", "paper_title": "Safe reduction rules for weighted treewidth", "paper_id": "WOS:000244090400002"}
