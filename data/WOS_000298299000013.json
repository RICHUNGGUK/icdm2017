Their occurrences often deteriorate the utilization of resources and may lead to catastrophic results. Finding an optimal supervisor is NP-hard. A computationally efficient method often ends up with a suboptimal one. This paper develops a deadlock prevention method that makes a good tradeoff between optimality and computational tractability for a class of Petri nets, which can model many FMS. The theory of regions guides our efforts toward the development of near-optimal solutions for deadlock prevention. Given a plant net, a minimal initial marking is first decided by structural analysis, and an optimal live controlled system is computed. Then, a set of inequality constraints is derived with respect to the markings of monitors and the places in the model such that no siphon can be insufficiently marked. A method is proposed to identify the redundancy condition for constraints. For a new initial marking of the plant net, a deadlock-free controlled system can be obtained by regulating the markings of the monitors such that the inequality constraints are satisfied, without changing the structure of the controlled system. The near-optimal performance of a controlled net system via the proposed method is shown through several examples.", "paper_title": "Deadlock Prevention Based on Structure Reuse of Petri Net Supervisors for Flexible Manufacturing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298299000013"}
