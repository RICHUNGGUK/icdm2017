In other cases, the estimation of how non-functional requirements, as the quality properties a system should pose, is not perceived useful enough to produce high-quality software. Therefore, in this special issue, we want to highlight the importance and the role of quality requirements for architecting and building complex software systems that in many cases require multidisciplinary engineering techniques, which increases the complexity of the software development process.", "paper_title": "Quality requirements engineering for systems and software architecting: methods, approaches, and tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000314407100001"}
