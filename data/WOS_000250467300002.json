Automatic query rewriting can help user web search, by augmenting a user's query, or replacing the query with one likely to retrieve better results. One example of query-rewriting is spell-correction. We may also be interested in changing words to synonyms or other related terms. For Japanese, the opportunities for improving results are greater than for languages with a single character set, since documents may be written in multiple character sets, and a user may express the same meaning using different character sets. We give a description of the characteristics of Japanese search query logs and manual query reformulations carried out by Japanese web searchers. We use characteristics of Japanese query reformulations to extend previous work on automatic query rewriting in English, taking into account the Japanese writing system. We introduce several new features for building models resulting from this difference and discuss their impact on automatic query rewriting. We also examine enhancements in the form of rules which block conversion between some character sets, to address Japanese homophones. The precision/recall curves show significant improvement with the new feature set and blocking rules, and are often better than the English counterpart.", "paper_title": "Automatically generating related queries in Japanese", "paper_id": "WOS:000250467300002"}
