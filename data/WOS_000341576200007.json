This is mainly due to the fact that these norms provide a method for testing whether the maximum correlation of a function f : F-p(n) -> F-p with polynomials of degree at most d <= p is nonnegligible, while making only a constant number of queries to the function. This is an instance of correlation testing. In this framework, a fixed test is applied to a function, and the acceptance probability of the test is dependent on the correlation of the function from the property. This is an analogue of proximity oblivious testing, a notion coined by Goldreich and Ron, in the high error regime. In this work, we study general properties which are affine invariant and which are correlation testable using a constant number of queries. We show that any such property (as long as the field size is not too small) can in fact be tested by Gowers uniformity tests, and hence having correlation with the property is equivalent to having correlation with degree d polynomials for some fixed d. We stress that our result holds also for nonlinear properties which are affine invariant. This completely classifies affine invariant properties which are correlation testable. The proof is based on higher-order Fourier analysis. Another ingredient is a nontrivial extension of a graph theoretical theorem of Erdos, Lovasz, and Spencer to the context of additive number theory.", "paper_title": "CORRELATION TESTING FOR AFFINE INVARIANT PROPERTIES ON F-p(n) IN THE HIGH ERROR REGIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000341576200007"}
