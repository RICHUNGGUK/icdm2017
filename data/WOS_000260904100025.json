Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was developed in order to satisfy both objectives and the strength of its benchmarking analysis gives DEA a unique advantage over other methodologies of efficiency analysis. This study proposes the use of the Least-Distance Measure in order to obtain the shortest projection from the evaluated Decision Making Unit (DMU) to the strongly efficient production frontier, thus allowing an inefficient DMU to find the easiest way to improve its efficiency. In addition to producing reasonable benchmarking information, the proposed model provides efficiency values which satisfy the general requirements that every well-defined efficiency measure should meet.
