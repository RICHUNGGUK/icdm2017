The design employs a variation-tolerant line-up write-assist scheme where the timing of area-efficient boosted write wordline and negative WBL are aligned and triggered/initiated by the same low-going global WBL to maximize the write-ability enhancement. A 72-kb test chip is implemented in United Microelectronics Corp. 40-nm low-power (40LP) CMOS. Full functionality is achieved for V-DD ranging from 1.5 to 0.32 V without redundancy. The measured maximum operation frequency is 260 MHz (450 kHz) at 1.1 V (0.32 V) and 25 degrees C. At 0.325 V and 25 degrees C, the chip operates at 600 kHz with 5.78 mu W total power and 4.69 mu W leakage power, offering 2x frequency improvement compared with 300 kHz of our previous 72-kb 9T subthreshold SRAM design in the same 40LP technology. The energy efficiency (power/frequency/IO) at 0.325 V and 25 degrees C is 0.267 pJ/bit, a 23.7% improvement over the 0.350 pJ/bit of our previous design.", "paper_title": "A 0.325 V, 600-kHz, 40-nm 72-kb 9T Subthreshold SRAM with Aligned Boosted Write Wordline and Negative Write Bitline Write-Assist", "paper_id": "WOS:000355212000015"}
