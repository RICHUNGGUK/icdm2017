Because expectations are essential in decision making and risk analysis, tractable methods to compute them are crucial in many applications involving imprecise probabilistic models. We concentrate on p-boxes (a simple and popular model), and on the computation of lower expectations of non-monotone functions. This paper is devoted to the univariate case, that is where only one variable has uncertainty. We propose and compare two approaches: the first using general linear programming, and the second using the fact that p-boxes are special cases of random sets. We underline the complementarity of both approaches, as well as the differences. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
