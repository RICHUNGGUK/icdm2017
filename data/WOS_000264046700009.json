In this work, we propose a methodology based on the idea that statistically proven search space reduction is possible in practice. Two clustering models are generated: one corresponding to the full data set and another pertaining to the sampled data set. The resulting empirical distributions were mathematically tested to verify a tight non-linear significant approximation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
