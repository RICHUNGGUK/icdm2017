One of them is based on asymptotic variances estimated using some transformations. Others are based on bootstrap techniques. Two types of recurrent event models are considered: the first one is a model where the inter-event times are independent and identically distributed, and the second one is a model where the inter-event times are associated, with the association arising from a gamma frailty model. Bootstrap and asymptotic confidence intervals are studied through simulation. These methods are applied and compared using two real data sets arising in the biomedical and public health settings, using an available R package. The first example belongs to data from a study concerning small bowel motility where an independent model may be assumed. The second example involves hospital readmissions in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. In this example the interoccurrence times are correlated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
