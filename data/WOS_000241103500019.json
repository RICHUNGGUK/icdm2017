The method has been developed for Czech as a language representing languages with relatively high degree of word-order freedom. The paper introduces important terms, describes a segmentation chart, the data structure used for the description of mutual relationship between individual segments and separators. It also contains a simple set of rules applied for the segmentation of a small set of Czech sentences. The segmentation results are evaluated against a small hand-annotated corpus of Czech complex sentences.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of complex sentences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500019"}
