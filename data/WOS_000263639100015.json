This paper extends our previous work on role transfer. It is the first attempt to formalize the M-M role-transfer problems with real-world management examples, analyze the different cases of M-M problems, design algorithms for all the cases, implement all the algorithms to provide solutions, and discuss the future work. The significant contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that role-transfer problems have definite solutions. The implementations and their results validate the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "M-M Role-Transfer Problems and Their Solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000263639100015"}
