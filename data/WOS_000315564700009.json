It is shown that these properties are possessed, for example, by various scheduling problems, including a number of well known NP-hard problems which play an important role in scheduling theory. For one of these problems the presented optimization procedure is compared with a version of the branch-and-bound algorithm by means of computational experiments.", "paper_title": "Discrete optimization with polynomially detectable boundaries and restricted level sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000315564700009"}
