A particularly useful strategy against jamming attacks in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) entails using cyber-maneuver keys to supplement higher-level cryptographic keys. Such keys can be periodically changed either in a proactive fashion - to defeat cryptanalytic efforts by external attackers - or in a reactive fashion - to exclude compromised internal nodes. In order to enable effective reactive rekeying, it is critical to correctly identify compromised nodes. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for identifying jammers, based on the location of both jammed and non-jammed nodes. We are interested in finding the smallest set of nodes that need to be excluded to stop the attacks in a multi-jammer scenario. We show that this problem is NP-hard, and propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to find approximate solutions. Experiments show that our approach works well in practice, and that the algorithm is efficient and achieves good precision and recall. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
