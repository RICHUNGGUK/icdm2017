This vision remains distant from clinical reality, as no complete methodology exists to apply objective, population-based research evidence to the needs of an individual real-world patient. We describe an approach, based on techniques from machine learning, to bridge this gap between evidence and individual patients in oncology. We examine existing proposals for tackling this gap and the relative benefits and challenges of our proposed, k-nearest-neighbour-based, approach.", "paper_title": "Using artificial intelligence to bring evidence-based medicine a step closer to making the individual difference", "paper_id": "WOS:000244718700004"}
