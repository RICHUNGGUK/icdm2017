We present drexplorer software, which enables biologists to evaluate replicate reproducibility, detect outlier data points, fit different models, select the best model, estimate IC values at different percentiles and assess drug-drug interactions. drexplorer serves as a computation engine within the R environment and a graphical interface for users who do not have programming backgrounds.", "paper_title": "drexplorer: A tool to explore dose-response relationships and drug-drug interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000355672500029"}
