The key motivation of SCF relaying stems from the fact that energy consumption levels can be dramatically reduced by capitalizing on the inherent mobility of nodes and the elasticity of Internet applications. More specifically, we show how the actual mobility of relay nodes can be incorporated as an additional resource in the system to achieve savings in the required communication energy levels. To this end, we provide a mathematical programming formulation on the aforementioned problem and find optimal routing and scheduling policies to achieve maximum energy savings. By investigating structural properties of the proposed mathematical program we show that optimal solutions can be computed efficiently in time. The tradeoffs between energy and delay in the system are meticulously studied and Pareto efficient curves are derived. Numerical investigations show that the achievable energy gains by judiciously storing and carrying information from mobile relays can grow well above 70 percent for the macrocell scenario when compared to a baseline multihop wireless relaying scheme that uses shortest path routes to the base station.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Relaying via Store-Carry and Forward within the Cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000328055300017"}
