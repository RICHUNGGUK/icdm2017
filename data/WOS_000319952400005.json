The nonlinear model of the process is simplified and linearized around several operating points of the input-output static map of the process. Discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models of the processes are derived on the basis of the modal equivalence principle; the rule consequents of these T-S fuzzy models contain the state-space models of the process. Three discrete-time T-S fuzzy models are suggested, compared and validated by simulation results.", "paper_title": "An Approach to Fuzzy Modeling of Electromagnetic Actuated Clutch Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000319952400005"}
