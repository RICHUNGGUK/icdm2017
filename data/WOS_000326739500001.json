In this paper, a joint graph routing algorithm for maximizing the network lifetime (JRMNL) in WirelessHART is proposed. Node communication load factor is approximately estimated by matrix operations for the first time. Then node communication load, the residual energy, and the link transmission power are integrated as a link cost function that is accurately measured in this algorithm. A node chooses the optimal next hop by comparing the link cost function of all its neighbor nodes, which guarantees the energy balancing of the whole network. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can extend network lifetime by a factor of 2 relative to the maximum residual energy selection algorithm and prolong the network lifetime by a factor of 7 relative to the minimum transmission power routing algorithm, but the average energy consumption per route will increase by 2 dBm compared with the minimum transmission power routing algorithm.", "paper_title": "Energy-Balanced Routing for Maximizing Network Lifetime in WirelessHART", "paper_id": "WOS:000326739500001"}
