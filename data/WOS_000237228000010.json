Also, since these distributed algorithms only require communication between few closely arranged individuals, they are very suitable for a parallel implementation. We propose a new kind of cGA, called hierarchical cGA (H-cGA), where the population structure is augmented with a hierarchy according to the current fitness of the individuals. Better individuals are moved towards the center of the grid, so that high quality solutions are exploited quickly, while at the same time new solutions are provided by individuals at the outside that keep exploring the search space. This algorithmic variant is expected to increase the convergence speed of the cGA algorithm and maintain the diversity given by the distributed layout. We examine the effect of the introduced hierarchy by observing the variable takeover rates at different hierarchy levels and we compare the H-cGA to the cGA algorithm on a set of benchmark problems and show that the new approach performs promising.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical cellular genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228000010"}
