Previous studies of SFA on neuronal synchronization were mainly concentrated on the correlated firing between neuron pairs, while the synchronization of neuron populations in the presence of SFA is still unclear. In this study, the influence of SFA on the population synchronization of neurons was numerically explored in electrically coupled networks, with regular, small-world, and random connectivity, respectively. The simulation results indicate that cross-correlation indices decrease significantly when the neurons have adaptation compared with those of nonadapting neurons, similar to previous experimental observations. However, the synchronous activity of population neurons exhibits a rather complex adaptation-dependent manner. Specifically, synchronization strength of neuron populations changes nonmonotonically, depending on the degree of adaptation. In addition, single neurons in the networks can switch from regular spiking to bursting with the increase of adaptation degree. Furthermore, the connection probability among neurons exhibits significant influence on the population synchronous activity, but has little effect on the burst generation of single neurons. Accordingly, the results may suggest that synchronous activity and burst firing of population neurons are both adaptation-dependent.", "paper_title": "ADAPTATION-DEPENDENT SYNCHRONIZATION TRANSITIONS AND BURST GENERATIONS IN ELECTRICALLY COUPLED NEURAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000345514800005"}
