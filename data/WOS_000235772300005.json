In this paper, we present a method which allows the authors of virtual exhibition systems to produce an augmented stereo panorama by interactively integrating stereo object movies into a stereo panorama. When navigating in the augmented stereo panorama with a stereoscopic display, the user can directly browse the stereo object movies that he is interested in. With augmented stereo panoramas, the user can enjoy more persuasive interaction with better depth perception. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first work to integrate stereoscopic image-based scenes with stereo object movies.", "paper_title": "Augmented stereo panoramas", "paper_id": "WOS:000235772300005"}
