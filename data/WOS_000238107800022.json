This paper presents the applicability of A-Prolog to the representation of business process and multiple aspects of reasoning about processes and effects. Finally, based on BPPA system (Business Process Planning based on A-Prolog) which has been applied in CIS development, an example of applying business process reasoning to workflow planning demonstrates that Mbp can simplify and improve business process representation and analysis of CIS reasonably and effectively.", "paper_title": "Building business process description and reasoning meta-model M-bp in A-Prolog", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107800022"}
