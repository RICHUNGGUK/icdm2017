A number of studies on video retrieval have used low-level pixel content related to statistical moments, shape, colour and texture. However, it is well recognised that such information is not enough for uniquely discriminating across different multimedia content. The use of semantic information, especially which derived from spatio-temporal analysis is of great value in multimedia annotation, archiving and retrieval. In this review paper, we detail how the use of spatiotemporal semantic knowledge is changing the way in which modern research the conducted. In this paper we review a number of studies and concepts related to such analysis, and draw important conclusions on where future research is headed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
