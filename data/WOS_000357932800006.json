Computing the clique-width of a graph is an intricate problem, because the exact clique-width is not known even for very small graphs. We present a new method for computing clique-width via an encoding to propositional satisfiability (SAT), which is then evaluated by a SAT solver. Our encoding is based on a reformulation of clique-width in terms of partitions that utilizes an efficient encoding of cardinality constraints. Our SAT-based method is the first to discover the exact clique-width of various small graphs, including famous named graphs from the literature as well as random graphs of various density. With our method, we determined the smallest graphs that require a small predescribed clique-width. We further show how our method can be modified to compute the linear clique-width of graphs, a variant of clique-width that has recently received considerable attention. In an appendix, we provide certificates for tight upper bounds for the clique-width and linear clique-width of famous named graphs.", "paper_title": "A SAT Approach to Clique-Width", "paper_id": "WOS:000357932800006"}
