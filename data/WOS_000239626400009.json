We first present a state/event temporal formalism and define a deontic extension of it. Then, we study the interaction between the temporal dimension and the deontic dimension. We present some logical properties, concerning formulas where deontic and temporal operators are nested, and discuss their intuitive meaning. We focus more particularly on the properties of obligation with deadline and define a specific operator to express this notion.", "paper_title": "A state/event temporal deontic logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626400009"}
