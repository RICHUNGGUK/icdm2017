Alvis combines possibilities of a formal models verification with flexibility and simplicity of practical programming languages. Alvis provides a graphical modelling of interconnections among agents and a high level programming language used for the description of agents behaviour. Its semantic depends on the so-called system layer. The most universal system layer alpha(0), described in the paper, makes Alvis similar to other formal languages like Petri nets, process algebras, time automata, etc.", "paper_title": "Formal Description of Alvis Language with alpha(0) System Layer", "paper_id": "WOS:000330615900013"}
