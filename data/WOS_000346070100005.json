The model is formulated within a mixed-integer nonlinear programming framework where the objective function accounts for the minimization for the total annual cost satisfying energy, mass and property constraints for the water streams involved in the network. To accomplish this task, a new superstructure is proposed, in which a first stage for energy integration before mixing streams was considered, followed by a mass and property integration network, and placing finally a second energy integration network. Within this approach, the optimization model identifies when a stream can be used as a hot or a cold stream as part of the energy integration. The proposed approach was applied to two case studies, and the results show that there are significant advantages for the simultaneous implementation of the energy, mass and property integration strategies.
