For the Grassmann graph, constructions of cyclic optimal codes are given for all parameters. As for the projective-space graph, two constructions for specific parameters are provided, as well some nonexistence results. Furthermore, encoding and decoding algorithms are given for the Grassmannian Gray code, which induce an enumerative-coding scheme. The computational complexity of the algorithms is at least as low as known schemes, and for certain parameter ranges, the new scheme outperforms previously known ones.", "paper_title": "Gray Codes and Enumerative Coding for Vector Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600019"}
