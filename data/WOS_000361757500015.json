Seq2pathway associates the biological significance of genomic loci with their target transcripts and then summarizes the quantified values on the gene-level into pathway scores. It is designed to isolate systematic disturbances and common biological underpinnings from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Seq2pathway offers Bioconductor users enhanced capability in discovering collective pathway effects caused by both coding genes and cis-regulation of non-coding elements.", "paper_title": "Seq2pathway: an R/Bioconductor package for pathway analysis of next-generation sequencing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000361757500015"}
