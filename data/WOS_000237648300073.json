The problem is first formulated as an Integer Programming (IP) model, and then we propose a Tabu Search (TS) and a Genetic algorithms (GA) that utilize the IP constraints. Computational results are provided, showing that the heuristics perform better-than the CPLEX Solver in both small-scale and large-scale test sets. Therefore, we conclude that the heuristic search approaches are efficient for the truck dock assignment problem.", "paper_title": "Truck dock assignment problem with time windows and capacity constraint in transshipment network through crossdocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300073"}
