To achieve this, it is important to stimulate the primary license holders to open up their under-utilized spectrum for sharing and adaptive allocation so as to maximize the secondary user's transmission reliability with the minimum cost. In this paper, we propose a highly available spectrum allocation service model that adopts a parallel mechanism to improve the transmission reliability. A greedy algorithm is presented for minimizing the secondary user's cost with satisfied reliability requirement. Furthermore, a dynamic programming algorithm is developed for maximizing the secondary user's reliability with satisfied cost requirement. Simulation results show that, by using the proposed service model, spectrum utilization can be improved significantly and purchase price from secondary users is relatively stable.
