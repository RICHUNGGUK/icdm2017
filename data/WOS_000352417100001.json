Specifically, mobile applications require the system to respond in a certain manner in order to adequately track the target object. Hybrid algorithms that perform Continuous Monitoring (CntM) and Event-Driven (ED) duties have proven their ability to enhance performance in different environments, where emergency alarms are required. In this paper, several types of environments are studied using mathematical models and simulations, for evaluating the performance of WALTER, a priority-based nonpreemptive hybrid WSN protocol that aims to reduce delay and packet loss probability in time-critical packets. First, randomly distributed events are considered. This environment can be used to model a wide variety of physical phenomena, for which report delay and energy consumption are analyzed by means of Markov models. Then, mobile-only environments are studied for object tracking purposes. Here, some of the parameters that determine the performance of the system are identified. Finally, an environment containing mobile objects and randomly distributed events is considered. It is shown that by assigning high priority to time-critical packets, report delay is reduced and network performance is enhanced.", "paper_title": "QoS Analysis for a Nonpreemptive Continuous Monitoring and Event-Driven WSN Protocol in Mobile Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000352417100001"}
