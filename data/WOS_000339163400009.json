Sufficient conditions of building an observer are obtained by using multiple Lyapunov function. These conditions are worked out in a new way, using cone complementarity technique, to obtain new LMIs with slack variables and multiple weighted residual matrices. The obtained results are applied on a numerical example showing fault detection, localisation of fault and reconfiguration of the control to maintain asymptotic stability even in the presence of a permanent sensor fault.", "paper_title": "Fault tolerant control for switching discrete-time systems with delays: an improved cone complementarity approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000339163400009"}
