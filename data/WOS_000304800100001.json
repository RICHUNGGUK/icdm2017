The spatial scheme consists of the sixth-order compact scheme and 10th-order numerical filter operator for guaranteeing computational stability. The preconditioned pseudo-compressible NavierStokes equations are marched temporally using the implicit lowerupper symmetric GaussSeidel time integration method, and the time accuracy is improved by the dual-time step method for the unsteady problems. The efficiency and reliability of the present procedure are demonstrated by applications to Taylor decaying vortices phenomena, double periodic shear layer rolling-up problem, laminar flow over a flat plate, low Reynolds number unsteady flow around a circular cylinder at Re?=?200, high Reynolds number turbulence flow past the S809 airfoil, and the three-dimensional flows through two 90 degrees curved ducts of square and circular cross sections, respectively. It is found that the numerical results of the present algorithm are in good agreement with theoretical solutions or experimental data.
