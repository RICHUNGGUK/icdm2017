The resulting closed system of ODEs (ordinary differential equations) represents an extension to a recently published method of moments which utilizes least-square approximations of factors of the PDE over orthogonal polynomial bases. An extensive numerical analysis has been carried out for proof-of-concept purposes. The proposed modeling scheme is generally of interest for control and optimization of processes with distributed parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
