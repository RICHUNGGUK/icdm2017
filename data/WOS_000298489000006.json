However, the results obtained by most of the optical flow techniques are affected by motion discontinuities or illumination changes. In this paper, we introduce a brightness correction field combined with a gradient constancy constraint to reduce the sensibility to brightness changes between images to be estimated. The advantage of this brightness correction field is its simplicity in terms of computational complexity and implementation. By analyzing the deficiencies of the traditional total variation regularization term in weakly textured areas, we also adopt a structure-adaptive regularization based on the robust Huber norm to preserve motion discontinuities. Finally, the proposed energy functional is minimized by solving its corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation in a more effective multi-resolution scheme, which integrates the twice downsampling strategy with a support-weight median filter. Numerous experiments show that our method is more effective and produces more accurate results for optical flow estimation.", "paper_title": "Robust optical flow estimation based on brightness correction fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000298489000006"}
