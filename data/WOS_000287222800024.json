Design/methodology/approach - CM is useful for solving coupled problems when the same geometrical discretization can be adopted for different phenomena. In this case, the same geometrical structures and operators can be used, leading to a simplification of the numerical model. Findings - In order to asses the performance of the proposed coupling scheme, results have been compared with values measured on a carbon-fiber specimen heated by an electric current and with an applied the mechanical load. Originality/value - A new dynamic coupling scheme based on the CM has been proposed and assessed with respect to measurements. A good agreement between model results and measurements has been shown, at least until second order effects appears, like the breaking of some fibers of the specimen or high-temperature effects on epoxy resin.", "paper_title": "Experimental validation of a numerical multiphysics technique for electro-thermo-mechanical problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000287222800024"}
