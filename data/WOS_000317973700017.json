We study the problem when the underlying graph is a block-cactus graph, a chordal graph or a Hamming graph. We show that if G is a block-cactus graph, then the Target Set Selection problem can be solved in linear time, which generalizes Chen's result (Discrete Math. 23:1400-1415, 2009) for trees, and the time complexity is much better than the algorithm in Ben-Zwi et al. (Discrete Optim., 2010) (for bounded treewidth graphs) when restricted to block-cactus graphs. We show that if the underlying graph G is a chordal graph with thresholds theta(v)a parts per thousand currency sign2 for each vertex v in G, then the problem can be solved in linear time. For a Hamming graph G having thresholds theta(v)=2 for each vertex v of G, we precisely determine an optimal target set S for (G,theta). These results partially answer an open problem raised by Dreyer and Roberts (Discrete Appl. Math. 157:1615-1627, 2009).", "paper_title": "Some results on the target set selection problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000317973700017"}
