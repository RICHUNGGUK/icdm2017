Adding a scalar homotopy parameter, differential pathfollowing is introduced. The previous sufficient conditions ensure the definiteness and regularity of the path. The role of AD for the implementation of this approach is discussed, and two examples excerpted from quantum and space mechanics are detailed.", "paper_title": "Differential continuation for regular optimal control problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000305292200002"}
