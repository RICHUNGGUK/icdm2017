This paper describes a CBIR algorithm which combines relevance feedback, evolutionary computation concepts and distance-based learning in an attempt to reduce the existing gap between the high level semantic content of the images and the information provided by their low-level descriptors. In particular, a framework which is independent from the particular features used is presented. The effect of different crossover strategies and mutation rates is evaluated, and the performance of the technique is compared to that of other existing algorithms, obtaining considerably better and very promising results.
