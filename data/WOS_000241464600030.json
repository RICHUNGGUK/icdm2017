However, its application to deep submicron technologies leads to suboptimal results if the traditional sizing rules are followed. In the paper the Authors show the behaviour of deep-sub micron devices may differ significantly from the conventional one due to transistor parasitic capacitance. As a consequence, well-exploited assumption as linear relationship between channel width and output conductance of the CMOS gate start to fails, as well as it does optimisation techniques based upon them. A developed formula for buffer sizing is proposed based on a simplified model allowing MOS parasitic to be taken into account. Up to 50% area and leakage power saving can be obtained.", "paper_title": "A simple MOSFET parasitic capacitance model and its application to repeater insertion technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600030"}
