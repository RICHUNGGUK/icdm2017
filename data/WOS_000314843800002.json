Unlike the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, called the naive online R-eg minimization algorithm (NORMA), OLK algorithms are obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem based on the proposed models. By exploiting the techniques of the Lagrange dual problem like Vapnik's support vector machine (SVM), the solution of the optimization problem can be obtained iteratively and the iteration process is similar to that of the NORMA. This further strengthens the foundation of OLK and enriches the research area of SVM. We also apply the obtained OLK algorithms to problems in classification, regression, and novelty detection, including real time background substraction, to show their effectiveness. It is illustrated that, based on the experimental results of both classification and regression, the accuracy of OLK algorithms is comparable with traditional SVM-based algorithms, such as SVM and least square SVM (LS-SVM), and with the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Kernel recursive least square (KRLS) method and projectron method, while it is slightly higher than that of NORMA. On the other hand, the computational cost of the OLK algorithm is comparable with or slightly lower than existing online methods, such as above mentioned NORMA, KRLS, and projectron methods, but much lower than that of SVM-based algorithms. In addition, different from SVM and LS-SVM, it is possible for OLK algorithms to be applied to non-stationary problems. Also, the applicability of OLK in novelty detection is illustrated by simulation results.", "paper_title": "Model-Based Online Learning With Kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000314843800002"}
