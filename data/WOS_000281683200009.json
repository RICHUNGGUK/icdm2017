Through careful construction of these clusters, network resilience is improved, without compromising connectivity or communications overhead. Experimental results show significant improvement in performance over existing schemes based on deployment knowledge.", "paper_title": "Cluster-Based Key Predistribution Using Deployment Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000281683200009"}
