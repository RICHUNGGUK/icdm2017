A new algorithm, APPLE, is proposed for calculating the Approximate Path for Penalized Likelihood Estimators. Both convex penalties (such as LASSO) and folded concave penalties (such as MCP) are considered. APPLE efficiently computes the solution path for the penalized likelihood estimator using a hybrid of the modified predictor-corrector method and the coordinate-descent algorithm. APPLE is compared with several well-known packages via simulation and analysis of two gene expression data sets.", "paper_title": "APPLE: approximate path for penalized likelihood estimators", "paper_id": "WOS:000339380000009"}
