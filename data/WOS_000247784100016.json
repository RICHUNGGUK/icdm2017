Our model numerically simulates contaminant movement in a wool scour bowl using the advection-dispersion equation. This is the first wool scour model to give time-dependent results and to model the transport of contaminants within a single scour bowl. Our aim is to gain a better understanding of the operating parameters that will produce efficient scouring. Investigating the effects of varying the parameters reveals simple, interesting relationships that give insight into the dynamics of a scour bowl.
