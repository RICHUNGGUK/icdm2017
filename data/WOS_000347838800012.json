Hence, a novel gradient-based method is presented, exploiting the discrete gradient concept and the forward Euler discretization under the assumption of the continuous Hamiltonian model is known. It is proven that the proposed discrete-time model structure de fines a symplectic difference system and has the energy-conserving property under some conditions. In order to provide alternate discrete-time models, 3 different discrete-gradient definitions are given. The proposed models are convenient for the design of sampled-data controllers. All of the models are considered for several well-known Hamiltonian systems and the simulation results are demonstrated comparatively.", "paper_title": "Discrete-time modeling of Hamiltonian systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000347838800012"}
