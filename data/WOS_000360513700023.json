It explains the influence of fire position, bridge configuration (vertical clearance, number of spans) and wind speed on the bridge response. Results show that the most damage is caused by tanker fires close to the abutments in single span bridges with minimum vertical clearance and under windless conditions. The paper provides new insights into modeling techniques and proves that bridge response can be predicted by FE models of the most exposed girder, which saves significant modeling and analysis times.
