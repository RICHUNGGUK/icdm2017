This variable, named metric variable, is not a tensor and its domain of variation is a curved manifold. With these premises, we build an intrinsic Lagrangian framework for the statement of constitutive laws, which casts a new, unifying light on geometric aspects of large-strain theory. This approach is always completely consistent with the Eulerian approach. In the obtained new theoretical framework, the relation between this new theory and various classical approaches is studied. We examine the case of the new logarithmic rate. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
