Multiple resource services with similar functional characteristics raise the concern over resource service optimal-selection (RSOS). It is important to select the optimal resource service according to their non-functionality characteristics or quality of service (QoS). However, QoS attributes are not easy to measure due to their complexity and involvement of ill-structured information. In this study, user's feeling is taken into account in RSOS in an MGrid system. The non-functionality QoS evaluation of resource services is based on users' feeling and transaction experiences using intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS). Furthermore, the dynamics of non-functionality QoS is considered, and a time-decay function is introduced into non-functionality QoS evaluation. A new method is proposed for RSOS based on IFS and non-functionality QoS, and the procedures are presented in detail. A practice case study is used to illustrate the proposed method and procedure. The performance and advantage of the proposed method are discussed.", "paper_title": "Resource service optimal-selection based on intuitionistic fuzzy set and non-functionality QoS in manufacturing grid system", "paper_id": "WOS:000282514300009"}
