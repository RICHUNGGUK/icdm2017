We assume the automated machines have scarce time and tool magazine capacities and the tools are available in limited quantities. The aim is to select a subset of operations with maximum total weight. We show that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, develop two heuristics and a Tabu Search procedure. The results of our computational tests have revealed that our Tabu Search procedure produces near optimal solutions very quickly. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
