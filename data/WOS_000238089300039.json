Item analysis method used question analysis for increasing of learners study ability. That is, when compiling the data for local programs, item difficulty, one of item analysis, is used for the Intermediate-Level technology education test. But guessing factor for items in learning results has to be considered to apply the relative item difficulty more precisely. In this paper, I have implemented component based E-learning system which learners are able to select study step by item difficulty. This system was implemented by CBD(Component-Based Development) for efficient development. In this applied result, I have shown efficiency of development in E-learning system by CBD and learning operation in this system by item difficulty.", "paper_title": "Component based e-learning system using item analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300039"}
