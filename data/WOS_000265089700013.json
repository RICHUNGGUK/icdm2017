First, by a fuzzy-basis-dependent and mode-dependent Lyapunov functional, a stochastic stability condition is derived by using the Finsler's lemma. Second, in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), a delay-dependent sufficient condition is presented, under which there exists a fuzzy output feedback controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stochastically stable. A desired controller can be constructed when these LMIs are feasible. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed design method is demonstrated by a simulation example.", "paper_title": "Robust Output Feedback Stabilization for Uncertain Discrete-Time Fuzzy Markovian Jump Systems With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089700013"}
