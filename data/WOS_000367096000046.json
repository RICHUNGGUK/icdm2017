In contrast to the classic message passing based algorithms and matching pursuit based algorithms, our proposed algorithm saves a lot of intermediate process memory, and does not calculate the inverse matrix. Numerical experiments show that MPGAMP algorithm can recover a sparse signal from compressed sensing measurements very well, and maintain good performance even for non-zero mean projection matrix and strong correlated projection matrix.", "paper_title": "A Matching Pursuit Generalized Approximate Message Passing Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000046"}
