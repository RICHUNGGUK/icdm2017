The problem is referred to as the Optimal Traffic Regulation (OTR) problem. Solutions to various cases of the OTR problem are provided. For a customer with a single-homed ISP, we present optimal solutions to the OTR problem based on dynamic programming for the offline case with a known traffic demand pattern. A real-time traffic scheduling algorithm is proposed to deal with the online case where the traffic demands are different from a given demand pattern. We further extend the dynamic programming model to the case of dual-homed ISPs. Experimental results on the data from an Internet trace confirm the effectiveness of our solutions.", "paper_title": "Traffic regulation with single- and dual-homed ISPs under a percentile-based pricing policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000263785100002"}
