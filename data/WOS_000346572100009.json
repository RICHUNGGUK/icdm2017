Although this problem has attracted extensive attention from academy and industry, the existing work can hardly satisfy the stringent real-time requirements. In this paper, a Slot Filter-based Missing Tag Identification (SFMTI) protocol is proposed to reconcile some expected collision slots into singleton slots and filter out the expected empty slots as well as the unreconcilable collision slots, thereby achieving the improved time-efficiency. The theoretical analysis is conducted to minimize the execution time of the proposed SFMTI. We then propose a cost-effective method to extend SFMTI to the multi-reader scenarios. The extensive simulation experiments and performance results demonstrate that the proposed SFMTI protocol outperforms the most promising Iterative ID-free Protocol (IIP) by reducing nearly 45% of the required execution time, and is just within a factor of 1.18 from the lower bound of the minimum execution time.", "paper_title": "Completely Pinpointing the Missing RFID Tags in a Time-Efficient Way", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100009"}
