Computational efficiency is achieved by avoiding discretisation into elements and non-linear analyses, making the method suitable for parametric studies in preliminary aircraft design. Numerical results for longitudinal compressive loading show the level of reduction in buckling load with increasing length and width of delamination. Global buckling strength is increased as the delamination is moved towards the plate surface, but is relatively insensitive to its widthwise and lengthwise location. The results are validated by finite element analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
