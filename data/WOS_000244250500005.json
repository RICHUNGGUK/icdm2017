However, recent research has provided the means by which a network can take advantage of mobile elements. Particularly in the case of wireless sensor networks, mobile elements can be deliberately built into the system to improve the lifetime of the network and act as mechanical carriers of data. The mobile element, whose mobility is controlled, visits the nodes to collect their data before their buffers are full. In general, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the sensed phenomenon may require sensor nodes to collect samples at different rates, in which case, some nodes need to be visited more frequently than others. This work formulates the problem of scheduling the mobile element in the network so that there is no data loss due to buffer overflow. The problem is shown to be NP-complete and an Integer-Linear-Programming formulation is given. Finally, some computationally practical algorithms for a single mobile and for the case of multiple mobiles are presented and their performances compared.", "paper_title": "Mobile element scheduling with dynamic deadlines", "paper_id": "WOS:000244250500005"}
