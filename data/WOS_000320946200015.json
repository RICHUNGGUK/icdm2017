The proposed construction method results in a BC form of a parity-check matrix from a random parity-check matrix for RS-LDPC codes. A decoder architecture and switch network for BC-RS-LDPC code are then developed based on the new BC parity-check matrix. Thus, an efficient decoder architecture dedicated to a promising class of high-performance BC-RS-LDPC codes is presented for the first time. Moreover, a (2048, 1723) BC-RS-LDPC decoder architecture is designed to demonstrate the efficiency of the presented techniques. Synthesis results show that the proposed decoder requires 1.3-M gates and can operate at 450 MHz to achieve a data throughput of 41 Gb/s with eight iterations.", "paper_title": "Block-Circulant RS-LDPC Code: Code Construction and Efficient Decoder Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000320946200015"}
