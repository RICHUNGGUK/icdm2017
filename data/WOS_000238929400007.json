To do this, three steering vectors are introduced. Cohesion is the tendency of boids to stay in the center of the flock, alignment smoothes their velocities to similar values, and separation helps them to avoid mutual collisions. If no impetus is introduced the boids wander somewhat randomly so apt external leading force is necessary for the correct flock behavior. As call be observed during the bird flocking in the fall, birds sometimes move in a Way that is not captured by the above described framework. Some of the birds, typically the ones on the edge of the flock, suddenly shoot-off. The flock then pursues this leader. In the original Work by Reynolds the cohesion and separation are two complementary steers. We introduce a complementary force to the alignment that we call the change of leadership. This steer defines the chance of the boid to become a leader and try to escape. The leadership is derived from the boid position and the flock eccentricity. If a boid is oil the front edge of the flock it has a higher chance to escape. Escaping from the flock is simulated as a sequence of velocity increases that are added to the current velocity of the boid. The entire system is easy to implement, is efficient, and runs simulations of hundreds of holds oil a standard computer at 30 frames per second. Our system is aimed to real-time simulations and has the potential to be used in games, crowd simulations, etc. Copyright (c) 2006 Joint Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Autonomous boids", "paper_id": "WOS:000238929400007"}
