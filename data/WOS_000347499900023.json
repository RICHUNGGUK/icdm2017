To achieve better low-velocity motion performance, an effective friction identification approach based on the dual-relay feedback configuration is presented for a typical low-velocity servo system, an inertially stabilized platform (ISP). An improved piecewise friction model derived from Tustin model is used to describe the frictional behaviors including static, Coulomb, viscous friction and especially Stribeck effect, so that the frictional behaviors can be appropriately formulated through describing functions. The dual-relay feedback configuration is designed to excite limit cycles in a velocity feedback loop, rather than in the position loop, so as to avoid noise arisen from the derivative of the position response signal. Properties of the limit cycle oscillations are analyzed for proper selections of dual-relay gains, based on which a systematic procedure for friction identification is proposed. Simulations and experiments on a servomechanism of ISP verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
