Toward this end, we develop an H(infinity)-optimal control formulation for allocating rates to devices on multiple access networks with heterogeneous time-varying characteristics. H(infinity) analysis and design allow for the coupling between different devices to be relaxed by treating the dynamics for each device as independent of the others. Thus, the distributed end-to-end rate control scheme proposed in this work relies on minimum information and achieves fair and robust rate allocation for the devices. An efficient utilization of the access networks is established through an equilibrium analysis in the static case. We perform measurement tests to collect traces of the available bandwidth on various WLANs and Ethernet. Through simulations, our approach is compared with AIMD and LQG schemes. In addition, the efficiency, fairness, and robustness of the H(infinity)-optimal rate controller developed are demonstrated via simulations using the measured real-world network characteristics. Its favorable characteristics and general nature indicate applicability of this framework to a variety of networked systems for flow control.", "paper_title": "Robust Rate Control for Heterogeneous Network Access in Multihomed Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000260889600004"}
