Results reveal that (a) low friction material makes users spend more time on each task, and (b) although low friction material benefits the smoothness of trajectory, it causes more trajectory errors, and (c) users apply less force or pressure with slippery materials during the tasks. These findings are the more significant because they demonstrate that the common glass surface of most tablet surfaces is not the best kind of surface for optimum accuracy or for user satisfaction. The results suggest that users should be free to change the surface texture of the device in order to get natural and realistic haptic feedback according to different tasks and personal preferences.", "paper_title": "An Investigation Into the Relationship Between Texture and Human Performance in Steering and Gesture Input Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337576600005"}
