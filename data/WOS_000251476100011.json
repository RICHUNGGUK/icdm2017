Appropriate use of computers could be of primary importance for communication and education of those subjects which could not move, speak, see or hear properly. The aim of our study was to develop a reliable, low-cost and easy-to-use HCI based on electrooculography signal analysis, to allow physically impaired patients to control a computer as assisted communication. Twenty healthy subjects served as volunteers: eye movements were captured by means of four electrodes and a two-channel amplifier. The output signal was then transmitted to an \"Analog to Digital\" (AD) converter, which digitized the signal of the amplifier at a rate of 500Hz, before being sent to a laptop. We designed and coded a specific software, which analyzed the input signal to give an interpretation of eye movements. By means of a single ocular movement (up, down, left and right) the subjects were then able to move a cursor over a screen keyboard, passing from one letter to another; a double eye blink was then necessary to select and write the active letter. After a brief training session, all the subjects were able to confidently control the cursor and write words using only ocular movements and blinking. For each subject we presented three series of randomized words: mean time required to enter a single character was about 8.5 s, while input errors were very limited (less than 1 per 250 characters). Our results confirm those obtained in previous studies: eye-movement interface can be used to properly control computer functions and to assist communication of movement-impaired patients.
