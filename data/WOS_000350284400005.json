Within the proposed collaborative appearance model, we develop a sparse discriminative classifier (SDC) and sparse generative model (SGM) for object tracking. In the SDC module, we present a classifier that separates the foreground object from the background based on holistic templates. In the SGM module, we propose a histogram-based method that takes the spatial information of each local patch into consideration. The update scheme considers both the most recent observations and original templates, thereby enabling the proposed algorithm to deal with appearance changes effectively and alleviate the tracking drift problem. Numerous experiments on various challenging videos demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs favorably against several state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Robust Object Tracking via Sparse Collaborative Appearance Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000350284400005"}
