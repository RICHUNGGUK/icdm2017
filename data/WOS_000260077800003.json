The present study is based on the actor-network theory and illustrates the process during which a decision support system (DSS), provided via the Internet, is part of public policy implementation, with a focus on pension policy and the choice of premium pension funds. The idea of supporting choice via a DSS was supported by many actors-albeit to a lesser degree by citizens'-active use. Technology has developed from providing information and facilities for changing funds online into offering a DSS for advanced financial decisions. A final conclusion is that there are two ways of supporting citizens in choosing funds: the provision of a DSS and simplifying the available options.", "paper_title": "Decision Support Systems for Public Policy Implementation The Case of Pension Reform", "paper_id": "WOS:000260077800003"}
