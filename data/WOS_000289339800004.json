The fKenzo system provides the user interface itself, an XML intermediary generator-translator and, finally the Kenzo kernel. We describe in this paper the main points of fKenzo, and we explain also the advantages and limitations of fKenzo with respect to Kenzo itself. The text is separated into two parts, trying to cover both the user and the developer perspectives. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
