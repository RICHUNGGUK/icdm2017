By using a descriptor model transformation of the system, an improved sufficient condition is given within the framework of linear matrix inequalities. A convex optimization procedure is proposed to obtain the least conservative estimation of the domain of attraction. Two examples are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed method.", "paper_title": "On enlarging the domain of attraction for linear systems subject to actuator saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254131300006"}
