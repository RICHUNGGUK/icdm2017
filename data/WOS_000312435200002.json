Sufficient conditions of building an observer are obtained by using multiple Lyapunov function. These conditions are worked out in a new way to obtain new LMIs with slack variables and multiple weighted residual matrices. The obtained results are applied on a numerical example with all the entries of the same sizes.", "paper_title": "FAULT DETECTION FOR UNCERTAIN DELAYED SWITCHING DISCRETE-TIME SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312435200002"}
