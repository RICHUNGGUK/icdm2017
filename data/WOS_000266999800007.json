The model presented is developed to reflect the actual market microstructure. The players constitute a non-uniform continuum, differing, among others, by the planning horizon, the external flow of money which can be invested, formation of expectations about future prices, which, briefly, divides the investors into five substantially different groups. Prices are determined by orders and the equilibrating mechanism of the stock exchange. The mechanism presented is the actual single-price auction system used, in particular, at Warsaw Stock Exchange. One of the main issues are self-verifying beliefs. Results of numerical simulations of stock exchange based on the model are also included.", "paper_title": "Stock market as a dynamic game with continuum of players", "paper_id": "WOS:000266999800007"}
