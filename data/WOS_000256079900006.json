In this paper three things are done. First, we analyze the population vector code as a purely geometric construct, focusing attention on its universality. Second, we generalize the algorithm on the basis of its geometrical realization so that the same construct that responds to sensation can function as an actuator for behavioral output. Third, we suggest at least a partial answer to the question of what many maps, neuronal representations of the outside sensory world in space-time, are good for: encoding vectorial input they enable a direct realization of the population vector code.", "paper_title": "Population vector code: a geometric universal as actuator", "paper_id": "WOS:000256079900006"}
