In such a network, the cluster headers gather the network coding and routing messages from multiple M2M devices and forward them to the cellular network. We propose a novel discriminatory user-based utility mechanism for network coding users and routing users. The price of anarchy (PoA), which is used to characterize the worst-case efficiency bounds, is analyzed. The simulation results show that network coding could promote the efficiency to a certain extent.", "paper_title": "A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Multiple Protocol Data Flows in Hierarchical M2M Communication Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327653800001"}
