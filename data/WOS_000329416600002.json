Today, designers must consider building systems that achieve the requisite functionality and performance using components that may be unreliable. In order to do so, it is crucial to understand the close interplay between the different layers of a system: technology, platform, and application. This will enable the most general tradeoff exploration, reaping the most benefits in power, performance and reliability. This paper surveys various cross layer techniques and approaches for power, performance, and reliability tradeoffs are technology, circuit, architecture and application layers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
