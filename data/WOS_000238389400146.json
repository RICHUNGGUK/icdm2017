Several optimization schemes have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, none of them offers a complete solution and has their own limitations, such as, lack of reliability, high latency or excessive control packet overhead. In this paper, we propose the FONIAH (Flooding based on One-hop Neighbor Information and Adaptive Holding) scheme to overcome these limitations.", "paper_title": "An efficient neighbor knowledge based broadcasting for mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400146"}
