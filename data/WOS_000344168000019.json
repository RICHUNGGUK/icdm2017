The power amplifier adopts transformer and transmission line matching topology which achieves small area of die and wide bandwidth. A new lumped transformer model is proposed to facilitate the optimization. The measured 3 dB bandwidth is 20 GHz (from 47 to 67 GHz), the measured maximum gain is about 8.6 dB, output 1 dB compression power is 9.36 dBm and consumes 90 mA current from DC supply 1.2 V. Including GSG and DC pads, the PA occupies a compact chip area of 0.318 mm(2), and without pads, the PA occupies 0.141 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A broadband, high isolation millimeter-wave CMOS power amplifier using a transformer and transmission line matching topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000344168000019"}
