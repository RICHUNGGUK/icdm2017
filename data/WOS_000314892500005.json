This application paradigm is enforced with the users' tendency to associate social behavior with their daily demands. As this paradigm can be utilized in all communication environments (wired and wireless), there is a need to eliminate the opportunistic aggravation of the resource-sharing process in wireless communication and enable a mechanism that will consider the problem of content distribution by these devices. As wireless devices experience intermittent connectivity, resource exchange by these devices can rarely be successful due to the frequent variations in the communication and the dynamic changes in the topology. This work takes into account the proposed socio-technical model in order to strengthen the interactions among devices for enabling reliability and availability of the requested resources. In addition, the scheme considers the users' modeled interaction metrics and their location profiling based on social parameters and allows on-demand resource sharing through the opportunistic socially oriented caching. Different concepts of social centralities are introduced and modeled in order to meet the improvements of resource sharing considering the temporal centrality characteristic of each node and the social interactions among users. The proposed model enables one, via the users' social and location-aware interactions, and the introduced aging factor, to strengthen or weaken the diffusion process of highly ranked requested resources. The proposed collaborative opportunistic resource-sharing scheme is thoroughly evaluated through experimental simulation for the effectiveness of the resource-sharing efficiency as well as for the accuracy of end-to-end reliability and resource-sharing completeness.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of Opportunistic Resource-Sharing Scheme Using Socially Oriented Outsourcing in Wireless Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000314892500005"}
