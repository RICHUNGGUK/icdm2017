The maximization of service coverage and minimization of cost are considered as conflicting objectives by satisfying inequality constraints such as handover, traffic demand and overlap. For the purpose of simulation, a 15 x 15 Km(2) synthetic test system is discretized as hexagonal cell structure and necessary simulations are carried out to calculate receiving field strength at various points. The path loss is calculated using Hata model. To improve the diversity and uniformity of the obtained nondominated solutions, controlled elitism and dynamic crowding distance operators are introduced in non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and are designated as modified NSGA-II (MNSGA-II). The optimal placement for BS is determined using MNSGA-II and NSGA-II. The effect of maximum number of function evaluations, handover and overlap on the performances of the algorithms is studied. A better distributed Pareto-front is obtained in MNSGA-II when compared with NSGA-II. The results reveal that, increasing of overlap percentage not only increases the coverage but also increases the overlap and handover error. The coverage percentage is indirectly proportional to the number of antennas involved in the handover constraint. The simulation results reveal that the proposed technique is more suitable for real-world BS placement problem.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary multiobjective optimization of cellular base station locations using modified NSGA-II", "paper_id": "WOS:000288555100003"}
