However, the computational cost when using kernel functions is high, except when using linear kernels. To realize fast and robust recognition, we apply normalized linear kernels to local regions of a recognition target, and the kernel outputs are integrated by summation. This kernel is referred to as a local normalized linear summation kernel. Here, we show that kernel-based methods that employ local normalized linear summation kernels can be computed by a linear kernel of local normalized features. Thus, the computational cost of the kernel is nearly the same as that of a linear kernel and much lower than that of radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernels. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in face detection and recognition problems, and we confirm that our kernel provides higher accuracy with lower computational cost than RBF and polynomial kernels. In addition, our kernel is also robust to partial occlusion and shadows on faces since it is based on the summation of local kernels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
