The very simple idea is that when we want to aggregate two values a and b we are looking for a value A that is as similar to a as to b or, in a more logical language, the degrees of equivalence of A with a and b must coincide. Interesting aggregation operators on the unit interval are obtained from natural indistinguishability operators associated to t-norms that are ordinal sums.
