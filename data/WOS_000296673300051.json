Based on the linear complexity and the number of the sequences which have the same connection integer, we conclude that the 2-adic complexity of the self-shrinking sequence constructed by a binary m-sequence of order n has a lower bound 2(n-2) - 1. Furthermore, it is shown that its 2-adic complexity has a bigger lower bound under some circumstances.", "paper_title": "2-Adic Complexity of Self-Shrinking Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300051"}
