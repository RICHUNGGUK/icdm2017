To derive the algorithms, we employ a technique consisting in approximating the conditional distributions of the signal given the observations by Gaussian distributions, taking successive approximations of the mixtures of normal distributions. The expectation of these approximations provides us with the suboptimal estimators. In a numerical simulation example, the performance of the proposed estimators is compared with that of linear ones, via the sample mean square values of the corresponding estimation errors.", "paper_title": "Recursive smoothing algorithms for the estimation of signals from uncertain observations via mixture approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000278010100004"}
