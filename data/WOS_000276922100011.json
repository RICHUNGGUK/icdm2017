Regularized Stokeslets are fundamental solutions to the Stokes equations with a regularized point-force term that are used to represent forces generated by a rigid or elastic object interacting with the fluid. Due to the linearity of the Stokes equations, the velocity at any point in the fluid can be computed by summing the contributions of regularized Stokeslets, and the time evolution of positions can be computed using standard methods for ordinary differential equations. Rigid or elastic objects in the flow are usually treated as immersed boundaries represented by a collection of regularized Stokeslets coupled together by virtual springs which determine the forces exerted by the boundary in the fluid. For problems with boundaries modeled by springs with large spring constants, the resulting ordinary differential equations become stiff, and hence the time step for explicit time integration methods is severely constrained. Unfortunately, the use of standard implicit time integration methods for the method of regularized Stokeslets requires the solution of dense nonlinear systems of equations for many relevant problems. Here, an alternate strategy using an explicit multirate time integration scheme based on spectral deferred corrections is incorporated that in many cases can significantly decrease the computational cost of the method. The multirate methods are higher-order methods that treat different portions of the ODE explicitly with different time steps depending on the stiffness of each component. Numerical examples on two nontrivial three-dimensional problems demonstrate the increased efficiency of the multi-explicit approach with no significant increase in numerical error.
