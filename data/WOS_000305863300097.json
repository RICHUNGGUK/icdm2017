To successfully establish the new market demand chain for the luxury industry in Taiwan, it is essential to understand customer preferences. Thus, this study uses an association rules approach and clustering analysis for data mining to mine knowledge among luxury product-buying customers in Taiwan. The results of knowledge extraction from data mining, illustrated as knowledge patterns, rules and knowledge maps, are used to make recommendations for future developments in the luxury products industry.
