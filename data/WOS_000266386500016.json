The algorithm estimates the coordinate and the orientation of mobile sensor using projected references on visual image. The proposed method considers the lens non-linearity of the camera and compensates the distortion by using a calibration table. The method determines the coordinates and orientations with iterative process, which is very accurate with low computational demand. We identify various sources of error on the coordinate and orientation estimations, and present both static sensitivity analysis of the algorithm and dynamic behavior of the mobile sensor. The algorithm can be utilized in mobile robot navigation as well as positioning application where accurate self localization is necessary.", "paper_title": "Self Localization Method Using Parallel Projection Model for Mobile Sensor in Navigation Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000266386500016"}
