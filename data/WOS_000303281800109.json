The HAMAN model has been structured in layers in which each of the components and interfaces has been formally defined. HAMAN uses a hierarchical routing strategy through subsets of nodes or clusters. In order to improve the hierarchical routing and the convergence of the clusters and of the network it is proposed to use a backup cluster head. The use of a event discrete simulator is used for the implementation of a hierarchical routing protocol called the Backup Cluster Head Protocol (BCHP). Finally it is shown that the BCHP protocol, part of the proposed management model, improves the convergence and availability of the network through a comparative analysis with the Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) (Perkins, Belding-Royer, & Das, 2003) routing protocol and Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) (Jiang, Li, & Tay, 1999).
