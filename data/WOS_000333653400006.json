Based on the Lucas algorithm previously developed for J(a)(rho x)J(b)(tau x) only, IIPBF recasts each product as the sum of two functions whose oscillatory behavior is exploited in the three-step procedure of adaptive integration, summation, and extrapolation. The toolbox uses customised QUADPACK and IMSL functions from a MATLAB conversion of the SLATEC library. In addition, MATLAB's own quadgk function for adaptive Gauss-Kronrod quadrature results in a significant speed up compared with the original algorithm. Usage of IIPBF is described and eighteen test cases illustrate the robustness of the toolbox; five additional ones are used to compare IIPBF with the BESSELINT code for rational and exponential forms of f (x) with J(a)(rho x)J(b)(tau x). Reliability for a broad range of values of rho and tau for the three different product types as well as different orders in one case is demonstrated. An electronic appendix provides a novel derivation of formulae for five cases.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 935: IIPBF, a MATLAB Toolbox for Infinite Integral of Products of Two Bessel Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000333653400006"}
