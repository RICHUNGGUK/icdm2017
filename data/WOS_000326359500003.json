Design/methodology/approach - Based on the valid responses collected from a. survey questionnaire, structural equation modeling technology was employed to examine the research model. Findings - The results indicated that both perspectives of technological perceptions and flow experience have effects on satisfaction, which in turn affects continuance usage. Technological perceptions include system quality and information quality, whereas flow experience includes perceived enjoyment and attention focus. Among them, perceived enjoyment has the largest effect on satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - This research is conducted in China, where mobile internet is still in its early stage. Thus, the results need to be generalized to other countries that had developed mobile internet. Originality/value - Previous research has focused on the effects of instrumental beliefs such as perceived usefulness on mobile user continuance. However, user behavior may be also affected by intrinsic motivations such as flow. This research tries to fill the gap.", "paper_title": "Understanding continuance usage of mobile sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000326359500003"}
