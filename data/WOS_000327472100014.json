A sequence of probability distributions is computable if and only if the corresponding sequence of characteristic functions is computable. As for the onvergence problem, the effectivized Glivenko's theorem holds. Effectivizations of Bochner's theorem and de Moivre-Laplace central limit theorem are also proved.", "paper_title": "COMPUTABILITY OF PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327472100014"}
