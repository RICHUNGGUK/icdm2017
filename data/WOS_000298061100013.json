Block matrix multiplication on finite fields and secure addition with randomly generated input and output transformation generates a set of tables that hide the key. Thus, the algorithm is a countermeasure against the threat that could compromise the key in a white-box attack context and provides secure data encryption by computing with encrypted functions. The size of implementation of this algorithm is small and suitable for migrating from one host to another as a part of a mobile agent.", "paper_title": "A White-Box Encryption Algorithm for Computing with Mobile Agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000298061100013"}
