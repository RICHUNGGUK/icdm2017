In particular, the performance of content distribution networks mainly relies on the awareness of content sources topology information. It is commonly admitted nowadays that, in order to ensure either path redundancy or efficient content replication, topological similarities between sources is evaluated by exchanging raw traceroute data, and by a hop by hop comparison of the IP topology observed from the sources to the several hundred or thousands of destinations. In this paper, based on real data we collected, we advocate that path similarity comparisons between different Internet entities can be much simplified using lossy coding techniques, such as Bloom filters, to exchange compressed topology information. The technique we introduce to evaluate path similarity enforces both scalability and data confidentiality while maintaining a high level of accuracy. In addition, we demonstrate that our technique is scalable as it requires a small amount of active probing and is not targets dependent. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
