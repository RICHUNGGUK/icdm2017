In this paper we present two methods for transcranial TAT: Kirchhoff migration (KM) and reverse-time migration (RTM). The two methods' imaging qualities are verified and compared based on both synthetic and experimental data. RTM proves to have better velocity variance and imaging quality, and little noise with spatial aliasing. RTM is a promising approach for achieving transcranial TAT in further studies.", "paper_title": "Transcranial Thermoacoustic Tomography: A Comparison of Two Imaging Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000314367100014"}
