A collection of autonomous agents is searched, assembled, and coordinated in a grid middleware system to produce desirable grid services. An effective communication mechanism is vital to the effectiveness of the step to build a novel grid middleware system. In this study, we provide our grid middleware with a flexible communication solution to implement the complicated behaviors among different agents. We propose a transport mechanism of grid middleware, named as ecological network communication language (ENCL) and ecological network interaction protocol (ENIP) respectively from a low-level to a high-level implementation strategy of a communication mechanism. A series of experiments demonstrate that a service with some of the desired properties can emerge from interacting agents via the proposed solution. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
