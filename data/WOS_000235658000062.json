However, most of them can not work well in data intensive environment. This paper provides an infrastructure layer in data intensive environment for the effectively providing spatial information services by using the web services over the Internet. We extensively investigate and analyze the overhead of web services in data intensive environment, and propose some new optimization techniques which can greatly increase the system's efficiency. Our experiments show that these techniques are suitable to data intensive environment. Finally, we present the requirement of these techniques for the information of web services over the Internet.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the data intensive mediator-based Web services composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000062"}
