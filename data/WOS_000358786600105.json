Some of these tools are easy to understand but offer a limited range of expressiveness. Other more powerful tools are time consuming for experts and inscrutable to novices. Researchers have described a variety of more sophisticated methods but these are typically not interactive, which is crucial for creative exploration. This paper introduces a simple, intuitive and interactive tool that allows non-experts to recolor an image by editing a color palette. This system is comprised of several components: a GUI that is easy to learn and understand, an efficient algorithm for creating a color palette from an image, and a novel color transfer algorithm that recolors the image based on a user-modified palette. We evaluate our approach via a user study, showing that it is faster and easier to use than two alternatives, and allows untrained users to achieve results comparable to those of experts using professional software.", "paper_title": "Palette-based Photo Recoloring", "paper_id": "WOS:000358786600105"}
