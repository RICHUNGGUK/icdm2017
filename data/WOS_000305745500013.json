In this paper, we present two characterizations of such polarities among all dualities. Firstly, we prove that, if a duality theta of Delta never maps a point to a neighbouring symp, and maps some element to a non-opposite element, then theta is a symplectic duality. Secondly, we show that, if a duality theta never maps a chamber to an opposite chamber, then it is a symplectic polarity. The latter completes the programme for dualities of buildings of type E (6) of determining all domestic automorphisms of spherical buildings, and it also shows that symplectic polarities are the only polarities in buildings of type E (6) for which the Phan geometry is empty.", "paper_title": "Symplectic polarities of buildings of type E-6", "paper_id": "WOS:000305745500013"}
