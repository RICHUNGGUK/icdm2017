Firstly docking methods were used to study the enantiorecognition in chiral electrophoresis. The molecular dynamics simulations of the two diastereoisomer complexes were then performed in order to understand how these antibiotics recognize the enantiomers. Another approach was applied in this study to establish a quantitative structure-enantioselectivity relationship (QSER) model, able to describe the resolution of a series of chiral compounds in capillary electrophoresis using vancomycin as the resolving agent.", "paper_title": "Elucidation of chiral recognition processes of macrocyclic antibiotic vancomycin", "paper_id": "WOS:000239501300001"}
