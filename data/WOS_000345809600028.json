Inspired by the successful use of sparse coding for noise reduction, we choose to give new L-1-norm formulation of Laplacian regularization for graph-based semi-supervised learning. Since our L-1-norm Laplacian regularization is explicitly defined over the eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian matrix, we formulate graph-based semi-supervised learning as an L-1-norm linear reconstruction problem which can be efficiently solved by sparse coding. Furthermore, by working with only a small subset of eigenvectors, we develop a fast sparse coding algorithm for our L-1-norm semi-supervised learning. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm in noise-robust image classification. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
