Thus, a perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary condition is set to avoid the instability caused by velocity and density gradients between vacuum and plasma. A splitting method is used to first decompose governing equations to time-dependent nonlinear and linear equations. Then, a proper complex variable is used for the spatial derivative terms of the time-dependent nonlinear equation. Finally, with several auxiliary function equations, the governing equations of the absorbing boundary condition are derived by rewriting the frequency domain PML in the original physical space and time coordinates. Numerical examples in one-and two-dimensional domains show that the PML boundary condition is valid and effective. PML stability depends on the absorbing coefficient and thickness of absorbing layers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
