In this paper, we present a self-adaptive semantic web service matching method, which improves the precision and recall of service discovery. In this method, requirement document and service profile ontology of OWL-S are transformed into ontology trees respectively. Conception similarity, attribute similarity and structure similarity of corresponding nodes in trees are calculated through taxonomic and hierarchical methodology. Then a serial of constraints are defined according to the relationship between conception similarity and structure similarity, to get the corresponding restructure rules. By restructuring requirement ontology tree in self-adaptive way, we achieve more accurate destination service collections. In the end, we propose matching algorithm of semantic web service and implement prototype system of OWLS-CPS. We prove the feasibility and effectiveness through evaluating and comparing to the OWLS-M4. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
