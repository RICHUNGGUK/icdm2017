We study it formally in the setting of a small calculus with transactions. We provide a precise formulation of dynamic separation and compare it with other programming disciplines. Furthermore, exploiting dynamic separation, we investigate some possible implementations of the calculus and we establish their correctness. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
