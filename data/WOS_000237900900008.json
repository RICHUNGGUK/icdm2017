In this new method, we make use of higher-even-order derivatives including the eighth-order to increase the accuracy. On the other hand, we adopt a special structure to reduce the computational complexity of high-derivatives. The numerical illustration demonstrate that the new method has advantage in accuracy, periodic stability and efficiency.", "paper_title": "A highly accurate and efficient trigonometrically-fitted P-stable three-step method for periodic initial-value problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237900900008"}
