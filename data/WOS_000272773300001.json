Reordering is understood as the word-order redistribution of the translated words. In original SMT systems, this different order is only modeled within the limits of translation units. Relying only in the reordering provided by translation units may not be good enough in most language pairs, which might require longer reorderings. Therefore, additional techniques may be deployed to face the reordering challenge. The Statistical Machine Translation community has been very active recently in developing reordering techniques. This paper gives a brief survey and classification of several well-known reordering approaches.", "paper_title": "State-of-the-Art Word Reordering Approaches in Statistical Machine Translation: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773300001"}
