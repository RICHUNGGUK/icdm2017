The proposed traitor tracing scheme can identify malicious subscribers (also called traitors) from a pirate decoder, which is collusively made by k or fewer traitors. Further, any malicious subscriber cannot falsify an unintended content for framing the broadcast center and cause all other personal keys to be exposed. We also give formal analyses to discuss the security of the proposed scheme in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "NEW SECRET KEY TRAITOR TRACING SCHEME WITH DISPUTE SETTLEMENT FROM BILINEAR MAPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600037"}
