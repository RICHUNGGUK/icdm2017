We consider acyclic graphs whose vertices are connected by unidirectional edges. The proposed model autonomously finds a path connecting two specified vertices, and the path is represented by a stable solution of the proposed model. The system has a self-recovery property, i.e., the system can find a path when one of the connections in the existing path is suddenly terminated. Further, we demonstrate that the appropriate installation of inhibitory interaction improves the search time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
