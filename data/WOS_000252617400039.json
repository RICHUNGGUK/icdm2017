Based on a worst-case analysis, the problem to derive the discrete interval model is first formulated as multiple mono-objective optimization problems for matrix-value functions associated with the discrete system matrices, and subsequently optimized via a proposed genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the lower and upper bounds of the entries in the system matrices. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, roots clustering of the characteristic equation of the obtained discrete interval model is illustrated for comparison with those obtained via existing methods.", "paper_title": "Discrete modelling of continuous-time systems having interval uncertainties using genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400039"}
