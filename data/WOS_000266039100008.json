Architectural choices employed to achieve high throughput, while granting a limited occupation of resources, are addressed both for the encoder and decoder side, including also the subblock interleaving and symbol selection functions specified in the standard. The complete encoder and decoder architectures, implemented on a 0.13 mu m standard cell technology, sustain a decoded throughput of more than 90Mb/s with a 200 MHz clock frequency. The encoder has the complexity of 9.2 kgate of logic and 187.2 kbit of memory, whereas the complete decoder requires 167.7 kgate and 1163 kbit.", "paper_title": "VLSI IMPLEMENTATION OF WiMax CONVOLUTIONAL TURBO CODE ENCODER AND DECODER", "paper_id": "WOS:000266039100008"}
