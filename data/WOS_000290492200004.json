Recent research in the area highlights the importance of using an explicit architectural model in this context. Since service-oriented architectures have also demonstrated to be adequate to overcome current software needs, the idea of using the model-driven approach to generate service-oriented architectural models has successfully flourished in the last years. However, the emphasis on the Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm has led to the design of architectures lacking some desirable features. Knowing the benefits provided by architectural styles, we have found that their use can help us to overcome those needs. Our goal is to obtain a service-oriented model which satisfies the requirements of the concrete architecture and complies with the constraints and vocabulary defined for a specific architectural style. To achieve this, here, we propose to use a weaving model which merges the concrete architectural model with a model of the architectural style of choice.", "paper_title": "A MODEL-DRIVEN APPROACH TO WEAVE ARCHITECTURAL STYLES INTO SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000290492200004"}
