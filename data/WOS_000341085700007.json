Crowdsourcing allows us to outsource tasks to a number of workers. The results of tasks obtained in crowdsourcing are often low-quality due to the difference in the degree of skill. Therefore, we need quality control methods to estimate reliable results from low-quality results. In this paper, we point out privacy problems of workers in crowdsourcing. Personal information of workers can be inferred from the results provided by each worker. To formulate and to address the privacy problems, we define a worker-private quality control problem, a variation of the quality control problem that preserves privacy of workers. We propose a worker-private latent class protocol where a requester can estimate the true results with worker privacy preserved. The key ideas are decentralization of computation and introduction of secure computation. We theoretically guarantee the security of the proposed protocol and experimentally examine the computational efficiency and accuracy.", "paper_title": "Preserving worker privacy in crowdsourcing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341085700007"}
