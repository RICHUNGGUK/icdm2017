This article concerns the optimization techniques pertinent to packet scheduling to facilitate multimedia content delivery over the satellite with a return channel via a terrestrial network. We propose a novel hierarchical packet scheduling scheme that allocates the resources at different parts of the network in response to network dynamics and link variations while under the system power/resource constraints. Simulations prove that the HPS scheme can effectively improve the end-to-end performance and resource utilization with desirable scalability and fairness features.", "paper_title": "QoS-AWARE ADAPTATION FOR SATELLITE MULTIMEDIA BROADCASTING VIA HIERARCHICAL PACKET SCHEDULING", "paper_id": "WOS:000267268700010"}
