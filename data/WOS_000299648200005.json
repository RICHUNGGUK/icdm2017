The time delay over the communication channel is assumed to be unknown and stochastically time varying. Then, an impedance controller is designed for the master side and an open-loop controller is designed for the slave side. In order to design the slave side controller, the control system is reformulated such that the slave side controller is converted to an equivalent dynamic output feedback controller in a standard control system representation. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is defined for stability analysis. By choosing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. It is shown that the master-slave tele-operation system is stochastically stable under specific LMI conditions. Finally, simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "CONTROL DESIGN FOR TELE-OPERATION SYSTEM WITH TIME-VARYING AND STOCHASTIC COMMUNICATION DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648200005"}
