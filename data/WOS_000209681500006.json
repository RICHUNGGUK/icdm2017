This detector is applicable for general M-DPSK (M >= 2) with arbitrary sequence length N-s >= 1, which includes a single-by-symbol detector as a special case N-s = 1. In contrast to the maximum likelihood detector (MLD) and the best-known diversity combiner (DC), the proposed detector does not require the knowledge of the channel statistics (which are unknown a priori in practice) and yet, still achieving significant performance improvement. Specifically, for N-s = 1, the proposed detector outperforms DC by 1.7 dB and achieves near ML performance. For N-s >= 2, the proposed detector outperforms MLD and the performance gain compared with MLD increases as N-s increases; this performance gain is approximately 1 dB for N-s = 4.", "paper_title": "A Practical Differential Receiver for Amplify-and-Forward Relaying", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681500006"}
