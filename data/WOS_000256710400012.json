This paper presents a method for automatic extraction of SF from a Japanese-English bilingual corpus. The extraction process uses a bilingual dictionary to match Japanese and English nouns in each sentence pair. The experimental results using a Japanese-English bilingual corpus show that this method performs very well in automatically extracting SF for machine translation. In addition, we evaluate the extracted SF in SF based machine translation.", "paper_title": "Automatic super-function extraction for translation of spoken dialogue", "paper_id": "WOS:000256710400012"}
