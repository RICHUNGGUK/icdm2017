We derive a new upper bound and characterize the linear DoF of this network to be 6/5. The converse builds upon our development of a general lemma that shows that, if two distributed transmitters employ linear strategies, the ratio of the dimensions of received linear subspaces at the two receivers cannot exceed 3/2, due to delayed CSIT. As a byproduct, we also apply this general lemma to the three-user interference channel with delayed CSIT, thereby deriving a new upper bound of 9/7 on its linear DoF. This is the first bound that captures the impact of delayed CSIT on the DoF of this network, under the assumption of linear encoding strategies.", "paper_title": "Linear Degrees of Freedom of the X-Channel With Delayed CSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000333099400014"}
