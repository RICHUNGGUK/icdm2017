In this paper, we present a novel approach to recognize the basic player actions in broadcast tennis video where the player is about 30 pixels tall. Two research challenges, motion representation and action recognition, are addressed. A new motion descriptor, which is a group of histograms based on optical flow, is proposed for motion representation. The optical flow here is treated as spatial pattern of noisy measurement instead of precise pixel displacement. To recognize the action performed by the player, support vector machine is employed to train the classifier where the concatenation of histograms is formed as the input features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is promising by integrating with the framework of multimodal analysis in sports video.", "paper_title": "Action recognition in broadcast tennis video using optical flow and support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000238080300009"}
