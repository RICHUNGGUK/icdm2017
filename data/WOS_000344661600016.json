Within this context, this paper explains the key role played by the membership function design (MFD) for an exploratory multifactor multivariate statistical analysis. First, several MFD options are compared using simulated examples, the method used to reach the study objectives being the correspondence analysis (CA). The CA benefits versus principal component analysis are shown. Then, three main taxonomic dimensions are considered for MFD: 1) mathematical/statistical/physical criteria; 2) monovariate/multivariate membership functions; and 3) unadapted/adapted approaches. Some MFD suggestions are then considered with actual studies such as eye movement in advertising, hand movement in tracking, hand position coordination in steering wheel turning, and subjective data in data entry task workplace assessment. The discussion section weighs the pros and the cons of using space windowing to perform a preliminary analysis of a large multifactor and multivariate database and provides some advice for MFD.", "paper_title": "Membership Function Design for Multifactorial Multivariate Data Characterizing and Coding in Human Component System Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000344661600016"}
