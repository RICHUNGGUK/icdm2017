The structure is exposed to random external excitations. A non-linear, two-dimensional, flow model has been developed using the finite-difference method. Unlike most existing flow models, the present model does not include any linearization assumptions; it rather solves the entire nonlinear, moving boundary, flow problem under conditions leading to large interfacial deformations. The free surface has been reconstructed using the volume of fluid method and the donor-acceptor algorithm. The Duhamel integral method has been used to determine the response of the structure. The effectiveness and accuracy of the flow model has been validated using a set of benchmark problems and experimental data. The numerical results of this model have been compared with results of an equivalent TMD model. The present fluid-structure model can be used as a valuable tool for performance evaluation and design of more effective tuned liquid dampers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
