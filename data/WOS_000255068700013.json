Recent research in Chinese word segmentation focuses on tagging approaches with either characters or words as tagging units. In this paper we present a morpheme-based chunking approach and implement it in a two-stage system. It consists of two main components, namely a morpheme segmentation component to segment an input sentence to a sequence of morphemes based on morpheme-formation models and bigram language models, and a lexical chunking component to label each segmented morpheme's position in a word of a special type with the aid of lexicalized hidden Markov models. To facilitate these tasks, a statistically-based technique is also developed for automatically compiling a morpheme dictionary from a segmented or tagged corpus. To evaluate this approach, we conduct a closed test and an open test using the 2005 SIGHAN Bakeoff data. Our system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on different test sets, showing the benefits of choosing morphemes as tagging units. Furthermore, the open test results indicate significant performance enhancement using lexicalization and part-of-speech features. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
