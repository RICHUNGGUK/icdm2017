First, an image is characterized by a set of binary images, which is generated by a simple and effective homogeneous region extraction method with well contour preservation. And the contour confidence map is obtained by a fast contour detection method. Then for each connect homogeneous region in a binary map, surroundedness is defined by the average outer contour confidence. Finally, integrating the background priors, multiscale saliency maps are generated and combined to the final saliency map. The proposed method is evaluated on two widely used public datasets with pixel accurate salient region annotations using both precision and recall analysis and ROC analysis. And the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms 14 alternative methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
