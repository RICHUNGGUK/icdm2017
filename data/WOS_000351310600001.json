We test the optimal FLC obtained by the hybrid PSO-GA method using benchmark control plants. The bio-inspired and the evolutionary methods are used to find the parameters of the membership functions of the FLC to obtain the optimal controller. Simulation results are obtained to show the feasibility of the proposed approach. A comparison is also made among the proposed Hybrid PSO-GA, GA and PSO to determine if there is a significant difference in the results.", "paper_title": "A hybrid optimization method with PSO and GA to automatically design Type-1 and Type-2 fuzzy logic controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000351310600001"}
