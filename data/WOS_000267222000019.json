The approach is to transmit to the user with the \"best\" local channel in each cell. The performance of this suboptimal scheme is investigated in terms of the conventional sum-rate scaling law and the sum-rate offset for an increasing number of users per cell. We term this characterization of the sum-rate for large number of users as high-load regime characterization, and point out the similarity of this approach to the standard affine approximation used in the high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. It is shown that, under an overall power constraint, the suboptimal cooperative multicell ZFBF scheme achieves the same sum-rate growth rate and slightly degraded offset law, when compared to an optimal scheme deploying joint multicell dirty-paper coding (DPC), asymptotically with the number of users per cell. Moreover, the overall power constraint is shown to ensure in probability, equal per-cell power constraints when the number of users per-cell increases.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Multicell Zero-Forcing Beamforming in Cellular Downlink Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000267222000019"}
