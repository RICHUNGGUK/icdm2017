If the Pareto front (PF) shape is not complex, the algorithms can find a set of uniformly distributed Pareto optimal solutions along the PF; otherwise, they might fail. A dynamic weight design method based on the projection of the current nondominant solutions and equidistant interpolation is proposed in this paper. Even if the PF is complex, we can find evenly distributed Pareto optimal solutions by this method. Some test instances are constructed to compare the performance of the MOEA/D using dynamic weight design method with that of MOEA/D. The results indicate that the dynamic weight design method can dramatically improve the performance of the algorithms.", "paper_title": "A MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM USING DYNAMIC WEIGHT DESIGN METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200017"}
