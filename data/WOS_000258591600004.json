The compensation is implemented by using a buffer in the actuator node and a state estimator in the controller node. A Linear Matrix Inequality-based sufficient condition for the stability of the NCS under the designed compensation is proposed. The simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the compensation method.", "paper_title": "Design of a networked control system with random transmission delay and uncertain process parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000258591600004"}
