When multiple standards are in use, models are more readily used and re-used if there exist robust translators between the various accepted formats. Summary: Antimony 2.4 and JSim 2.10 provide translation capabilities from their own formats to SBML and CellML. All provided unique challenges, stemming from differences in each format's inherent design, in addition to differences in functionality.", "paper_title": "SBML and CellML translation in Antimony and JSim", "paper_id": "WOS:000334078300002"}
