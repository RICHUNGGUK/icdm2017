We propose an ASA (Aggressive Sub-channel Allocation) algorithm, which is an intelligent dynamic channel allocation algorithm considering all users' channel state information conditionally to maximize throughput in an OFDMA system. We compare the ASA algorithm with Round-robin, PF (Proportional Fair) and ACG (Amplitude Craving Greedy) in the 2-tier cell environment and then analyze the performance of each algorithm through computer simulation in downlink OFDMA system. Simulation results show that the proposed ASA algorithm gets 24 %, 16 % and 14 % better ring throughput compared with the Round-robin, PF and ACG, respectively.", "paper_title": "Aggressive sub-channel allocation algorithm for intelligent transmission in multi-user OFDMA system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100058"}
