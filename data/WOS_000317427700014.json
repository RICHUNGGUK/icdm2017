Package and board/system designs are usually followed by almost-ready chip designs, which causes long turn-around time communicating with package and system houses. In this article, the realizations of area-array I/O design methodologies are studied. Different from IC-centric flow, we propose a chip-package concurrent design flow to speed up the design time. Along with the flow, we design the I/O-bump (and P/G-bump) tile that combines I/O (and P/G) and bump into a hard macro with the considerations of I/O power connection and electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection. We then employ an I/O-row based scheme to place I/O-bump tiles with existed metal layers. By such a scheme, it reduces efforts in I/O placement legalization and the redistribution layer (RDL) routing. With the emphasis on package design awareness, the proposed methods map package balls onto chip I/Os, thus providing an opportunity to design chip and package in parallel. Due to this early study of I/O and bump planning, faster convergence can be expected with concurrent design flow. The results are encouraging and the merits of this flow are reassuring.", "paper_title": "A Study of Row-Based Area-Array I/O Design Planning in Concurrent Chip-Package Design Flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000317427700014"}
