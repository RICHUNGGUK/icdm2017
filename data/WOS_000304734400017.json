In this work eight supervised multivariate methods based on quite different principles (Discriminant Analysis, Principal Components Analysis combined to Discriminant Analysis, Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy, K-Nearest Neighbours, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), kernel-PLS (radial basis functions-PLS), Counterpropagation Artificial Neural Networks (CPANN) and Support Vector Machines with linear, radial basis function and polynomial kernels) and a 'consensus' approach were used to discriminate between the aliquots of six oil spillages monitored on time by mid-IR spectroscopy. Further, a set of 45 unknowns collected in Galician beaches after a major shipwreck were analyzed by both the IR-chemometric-based method and an international oil fingerprinting standard protocol (the European Guideline CEN/TR 15522-2 guide) to set their 'true' assignations. Classification of the controlled spillages yielded almost 100% successful classification ratios (precision, sensitivity and specificity) whereas less than 5% false positives and false negatives were obtained when the 45 samples were classified. SVM with polynomial kernels had only 1 misclassification and outperformed the other approaches, including the 'consensus' approach. CPANN, radial basis functions-PLS and the consensus approach were the second best models with 93.3% agreement with the standard protocol. On the other hand, linear PLS-DA yielded the worst classification model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
