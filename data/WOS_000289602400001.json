Such properties can be defined in either an adaptive or a selective scenario, which differ on the moment where the attacker chooses the identity/ies that are the target of the attack. There are well-known separations between selective and adaptive semantic security on the one hand, and between selective and adaptive anonymity on the other hand. In this paper we investigate the relations between these selective and adaptive notions, for identity-based encryption schemes enjoying at the same time some security and anonymity properties. On the negative side, we prove that there is a separation between selective and adaptive anonymity even for schemes which enjoy adaptive semantic security. On the positive side, we prove that selective semantic security and adaptive anonymity imply adaptive semantic security. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
