The structural analysis includes the load history and geometry changes due to the construction sequence and the time-dependent effects due to creep, shrinkage and aging of the concrete. An entropy-based approach was used for structural optimization and discrete direct sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the structural response to changes in the design variables. Numerical examples are presented and the results exhibit the importance of considering both the construction stages and the time-dependent effects for adequately predict the bridge behaviour and compute the cable prestressing forces.", "paper_title": "Cable stretching force optimization of concrete cable-stayed bridges including construction stages and time-dependent effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000352705400015"}
