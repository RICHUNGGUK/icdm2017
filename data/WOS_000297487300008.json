In this model, the control strategies by releasing natural enemies and spraying pesticide at different thresholds are considered. The sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of the semi-trivial periodic solution and the positive order-1 periodic solution are given by the Poincare map and the properties of the Lambert W function. In addition, to verify the feasibility of our main results, the numerical simulations are carried out. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
