However, there are some physical limitations when dealing with the creation or such models. In this paper, we provide a brief overview on different gates in billiard ball model and then propose an approach to create a universal Toffoli gate in BBM. We discuss the complexities of building larger Toffoli gates and the ways to have multi-level connected Toffoli gates to represent arbitrary logic functions.", "paper_title": "Toffoli Gate Implementation Using The Billiard Ball Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000305440000010"}
