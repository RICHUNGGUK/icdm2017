In 2010 Lee et al. gave several power analysis attacks on NTRU and three countermeasures, where they argued that only second-order power analysis can break their first countermeasure, and the combination of the first and third countermeasure is secure. In this paper we give efficient first-order collision attacks against all their countermeasures. Besides a gain of 108.4% and 78% in efficiency, our attacks cannot be avoided by any padding scheme. Furthermore, we discuss some countermeasures preventing our attacks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
