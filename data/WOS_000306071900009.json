In this SCVM, the power part is composed of two m(c)-stage SC cells (front) and two n(c)-stage SC cells (rear) in cascade, and these cells are operated by two-phase nonoverlapping clocks for an interleaved operation with voltage gain of m(c) x n(c) at most. This paper presents the VCR control to change the running stage number m; n and topological path for a more flexible and suitable gain level m x n (1 x 1, 2 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 1, 3 x 2, 3 x 3, ..., m(c) x n(c)) according to the desired output so as to improve power efficiency, especially for the lower output. Besides, PWM is adopted not only to enhance output regulation for different outputs, but also to reinforce output robustness to source/loading variation. Further, some theoretical analysis and design include: SCVM model, steady-state analysis, conversion ratio, power efficiency, output ripple, stability, capacitance selection, and control design. Finally, the closed-loop SCVM is simulated, and the hardware is implemented and tested. All the results are illustrated to show the efficacy of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "HIGH-GAIN/EFFICIENCY MULTISTAGE SWITCHED-CAPACITOR-VOLTAGE-MULTIPLIER DC-DC CONVERTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000306071900009"}
