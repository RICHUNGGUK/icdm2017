These selfish managers participate in Grid-Federation to share their resources. Market models could be used to motivate the self-interested participants to share their resources. In this paper, firstly, a market for resource exchange in grid federation environment is established. Then, in order that the market reaches a Walrasian equilibrium, a computationally tractable mechanism is proposed. A Walrasian equilibrium problem consists of finding a set of prices and allocations of resources in such a way that the cluster resource managers could maximize their utilities and the market clears. Market clears when the resource supply equals to the demand. We show that in a Walrasian equilibrium, the Grid Federation market reaches an efficient resource allocation.", "paper_title": "Micro-economics based resource allocation in Grid-Federation environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000297347400009"}
