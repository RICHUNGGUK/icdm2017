We then conduct an experimental study on all Elementary CA and show that some rules exhibit a phase transition, which belongs to the universality class of directed percolation.", "paper_title": "Coalescing Cellular Automata: Synchronization by Common Random Source for Asynchronous Updating", "paper_id": "WOS:000260686800004"}
