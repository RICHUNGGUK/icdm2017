Generic mathematical drivetrain modelling is challenging, as friction elements cause a system to vary its order and structure. Furthermore, adaptive time-step methods are not suitable for real-time simulation. Unfortunately, literature lacks flexible fixed time-step approaches for multiple friction elements. The modelling solution proposed in this article is designed for fixed time-step execution and is applicable to all types of gear transmissions. The approach is verified on an exemplary simplified drivetrain. It is demonstrated on a complex hybrid-electric automatic drivetrain topology and validated via transmission test bench measurement. Finally, the approach is applied to a conventional automatic drivetrain and validated via vehicle measurement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
