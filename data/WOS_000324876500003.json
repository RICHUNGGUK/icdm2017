Raw reactants are diluted in this process to achieve given target concentrations. A bioassay may require several different target concentrations of a reactant. Both the dilution operation count and the reactant usage can be minimized if multiple target concentrations are considered simultaneously during sample preparation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a multitarget sample preparation algorithm that extensively exploits the ideas of waste recycling and intermediate droplet sharing to reduce both reactant usage and waste amount for digital microfluidic biochips. Experimental results show that our waste recycling algorithm can reduce the waste and operation count by 48% and 37%, respectively, as compared to an existing state-of-the-art multitarget sample preparation method if the number of target concentrations is ten. The reduction can be up to 97% and 73% when the number of target concentrations goes even higher.", "paper_title": "Reactant and Waste Minimization in Multitarget Sample Preparation on Digital Microfluidic Biochips", "paper_id": "WOS:000324876500003"}
