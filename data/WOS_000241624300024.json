After an introduction of the definition, subfields, and the characteristics of IIA, this paper reviews IIA-related research that has been recently published at leading digital library conferences. The authors suggest that applying IIA technologies to digital libraries may have the potential to greatly speed up the development of digital libraries and to improve the quality of user services. Digital library developers should consider collaborating with IIA researchers in order to build sustainable digital libraries. The paper concludes with a framework for integrating IIA technologies into digital library development and services.", "paper_title": "The use of intelligent information access technologies in digital libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300024"}
