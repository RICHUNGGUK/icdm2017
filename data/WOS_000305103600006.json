Improved sensitivity allows modeling of difficult systems as deterministic chaos ones. The presented paper starts with a brief introduction to previous works and ideas which allowed to build the presented two abstraction levels system. Then the structure of Genetic Programming Algorithm - Evolutionary Strategy hybrid system is described and analyzed, including such problems as suitability to parallel implementation, optimal set of building blocks, or initial population generating rules. GPA-ES system combines GPA to model development with ES used for model parameter estimation and optimization. Such a hybrid system eliminates many weaknesses of standard CPA. The paper concludes with examples of GPA-ES application to Lorenz and Rosler systems regression and suggests application to Neural Network Model design.", "paper_title": "EVOLUTIONARY SYSTEM TO MODEL STRUCTURE AND PARAMETERS REGRESSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000305103600006"}
