The critical slip surface is found to be divided into two parts when the pile spacing is small, and these two parts gradually get connected with the increase of pile spacing until a clear critical slip surface is formed. The critical slip surface of the piled slope is found to be usually shallower than the corresponding slope without pile, and this result is totally different from the previous results based on the maximum point of shear force where a very deep critical slip surface is obtained. The optimal pile position for slope reinforced with one row of piles is found to be located between the middle of the slope and the middle of the critical slip surface. An optimal design procedure for the pile spacing has also been suggested in the present paper, and the procedure will help to reduce the time required for a piled slope three-dimensional analysis.
