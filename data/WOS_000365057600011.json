In this paper, we study how to achieve perimeter barrier coverage with bistatic radar Sensors. Much different from the binary disk and sector coverage, the coverage area of bistatic radar is dependent on the distance between a pair of radar transmitter and receiver. We first study the minimum cost bistatic transmitter-receiver placement problem. We prove the optimal placement pattern and the structure property of a minimum cost placement sequence. When manually placing radars is not applicable, we study the mobile radar movement problem for perimeter barrier coverage with the objective of minimizing the total moving distance or maximal moving distance. To solve the movement problems, we propose two algorithms to first determine the target locations and then use bipartite graph approach to find the best movement schemes. We also provide performance bounds of our movement solutions to the optimal solutions. Our solutions to the placement and movement problems are also validated via simulation results.
