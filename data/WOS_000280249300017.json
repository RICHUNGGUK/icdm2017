We evaluate five colour normalization techniques using three different local appearance-based classifiers. Our test sets allow us to independently examine the influence of illumination changes due to lighting colour and geometry. We demonstrate that local colour normalization can significantly improve the performance of a local appearance-based classifier. However, we observe that the effectiveness of local colour normalization depends on both the underlying classifier and the type of illumination variation.", "paper_title": "Is local colour normalization good enough for local appearance-based classification?", "paper_id": "WOS:000280249300017"}
