In the first part we consider a simple Markov chain for d-regular graphs on n vertices, where d = d(n) may grow with n. We show that the mixing time of this Markov chain is bounded above by a polynomial in n and d. In the second part of the paper, a related Markov chain for d-regular graphs on a varying number of vertices is introduced, for even constant d. This is a model for a certain peer-to-peer network. We prove that the related chain has mixing time which is bounded above by a polynomial in N, the expected number of vertices, provided certain assumptions are met about the rate of arrival and departure of vertices.", "paper_title": "Sampling regular graphs and a peer-to-peer network", "paper_id": "WOS:000247845900004"}
