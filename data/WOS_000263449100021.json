Unfortunately, the triggered alarms usually are accompanied with huge number of false positives. In this paper, we use root cause analysis to discover the root causes making the IDS triggers these false alarms: most of these root causes are not attacks. Removing the root causes enhances alarms quality in the future. The root cause instigates the IDS to trigger alarms that almost always have similar features. These similar alarms can be clustered together; consequently, we have designed a new clustering technique to group IDS alarms and to produce clusters. Then, each cluster is modeled by a generalized alarm. The generalized alarms related to root causes are converted (by the security analyst) to filters in order to reduce future alarms' load. The suggested system is a semi-automated system helping the security analyst in specifying the root causes behind these false alarms and in writing accurate filtering rules. The proposed clustering method was verified with three different datasets, and the averaged reduction ratio was about 74% of the total alarms. Application of the new technique to alarms log greatly helps the security analyst in identifying the root causes; and then reduces the alarm load in the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
