The objective of the work is to achieve maximum classification accuracy while detecting intrusions by classifying NSL-KDD network traffic data either 'normal' or 'anomaly'. Since RST processes discrete data only, by applying cut operation attributes in training data are discretized. Using indiscernibility concept of RST, reduced attribute sets, called reducts are obtained and among the reducts a single reduct is chosen which provides highest classification accuracy. However, for the test data the same reduct would not provide highest classification accuracy due to change of discretized attribute values. Therefore, to overcome the problem discretization and feature selection processes are dealt in a comprehensive and systematic way in the paper using machine learning approach. The Q-learning algorithm has been modified to learn optimum cut value for different attributes so that corresponding reduct produces maximum classification accuracy while classifying network traffic data. Since, not all attributes but reduct only take part to detect intrusions, the proposed algorithm is faster than Q-learning and reduces complexity of the IDS. Classification accuracy with 98% success rate has been obtained using real time data, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other classifiers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
