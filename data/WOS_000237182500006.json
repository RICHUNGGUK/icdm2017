Since bicircular matroids form a rather restricted subclass of transversal matroids, our results can be seen as a partial strengthening of a result by Colbourn, Provan and Vertigan, namely that the evaluation of the Tutte polynomial for the class of transversal matroids is #P-hard for all points except those in the hyperbola (x-1)(y-1)=1.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of computing the Tutte polynomial of bicircular matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000237182500006"}
