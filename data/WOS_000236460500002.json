In order to quickly respond to the rapidly changing business environment, agility and interoperability are the main requirements for the VEs. This paper suggests a framework for designing the agile and interoperable VEs. Existing approaches, such as enterprise architecture, model driven architecture, domain specific methodology, meta-modeling, framework-based development, etc., are reviewed, revealing that none offers a complete solution that supports all the aspects of the VE modeling in an elegant manner. Thus, this paper develops a systematic modeling framework by harmonizing these approaches and combining the individual advantages of each approach to produce integrated synergy effects. This modeling framework can be used for business managers or business domain experts to build an agile and interoperable VE quickly and systematically with insights. It also supports a coherent enterprise modeling in which various stakeholders having their own aspects and methodology, such as an IT manager and a business manager, can communicate effectively.
