However, because those applications are time dependent, their execution is not deterministic. Thus, measurements can vary from one execution to another. This article proposes a methodology that enforces the starting times of frames so that applications behave deterministically.", "paper_title": "THE PROBLEM OF EVALUATING CPU-GPU SYSTEMS WITH 3D VISUALIZATION APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312020700003"}
