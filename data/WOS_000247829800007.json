This paper concentrates on the impossible differential cryptanalysis of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and presents two methods for impossible differential cryptanalysis of 7-round AES-192 and 8-round AES-256 combined with time-memory trade-off by exploiting weaknesses in their key schedule. This attack on the reduced to 7-round AES-192 requires about 2(94.5) chosen plaintexts, demands 2(129) words of memory, and performs 2(157) 7-round AES-192 encryptions. Furthermore, this attack on the reduced to 8-round AES-256 requires about 2(101) chosen plaintexts, demands 2(201) words of memory, and performs 2(228) 8-round AES-256 encryptions.", "paper_title": "Impossible differential cryptanalysis of advanced encryption standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000247829800007"}
