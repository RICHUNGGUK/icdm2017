Thus understanding multiple adoption is important. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to propose and examines antecedents of user intention to adopt another online auction site. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilized a cross-sectional design and an online survey, obtaining 495 valid responses. Findings - Analytical results indicate that self-efficacy and inherent novelty seeking contribute to the intention to adopt another auction site. Moreover, transaction opportunities enhance the intention. Perceived network externality also increases the intention. However, perceived relational switching costs reduce such intention. Originality/value - This study is new in investigating why users intend to use another auction site and identifying the antecedents.", "paper_title": "Antecedents for user intention to adopt another auction site", "paper_id": "WOS:000332998600004"}
