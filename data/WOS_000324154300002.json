In this paper we discuss the method on 2-parametric families of graphs. The method is illustrated on the family of carbon nanocones CNCk[n] and on four distance based topological indices: the Wiener index, the edge Wiener index, the reverse Wiener index, and the Szeged index. Closed formulas are presented and several exceptions are pointed out for small values of k. For larger values of k, parity cases must be usually consider to obtain desired polynomials.", "paper_title": "Interpolation Method and Topological Indices: 2-Parametric Families of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000324154300002"}
