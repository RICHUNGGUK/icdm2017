In this paper, a novel approach to the reuse of freeform features with NURBS representation is proposed. Firstly, the conditions for preserving differential properties of reused freeform features are derived, and a reuse-oriented representation of freeform features is put forward. Based on them, a reuse algorithm of freeform features is developed, which adopts Poisson equation, knots insertion and degree elevation to achieve the preservation of the differential geometry properties and the adaptability. The approach is implemented and some examples are given. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
