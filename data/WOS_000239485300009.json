The proposed system is evaluated using real-world signal datasets as well as two conventional methods. Compared with them, approach based on rough neural network achieves high performance improvement. Furthermore, the purposed system is extended for multi-channel sensor data fusion directly. Since the experiment results are attractive, an algorithm based on rough neural network is believed to have potential for applications of recognition and data fusion in wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Vehicle classification in wireless sensor networks based on rough neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300009"}
