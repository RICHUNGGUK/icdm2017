HMM allocates parallel tasks by exploiting the information embedded in the parallelism forms used to implement an application. Moreover, it uses a local search technique together with the tabu search meta-heuristic. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs well promising a significant potential to develop efficient mapping solutions for metacomputers.", "paper_title": "HMM: A static mapping algorithm to map parallel applications on grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100088"}
