The first Method is based oil applying a projection directly to the second-order system using a second-order Krylov subspace. To increase the number of matching parameters, in the second approach. it is proposed to reduce the equivalent state space model by a onesided Krylov method and to extract the second-order matrices by applying a similarity transformation to the reduced system.", "paper_title": "Passive reduced order modelling of second-order systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259639800003"}
