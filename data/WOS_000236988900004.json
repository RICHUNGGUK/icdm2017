And 10-round 256-bit Camellia with FL function is breakable with the complexity of 2(210) encryptions and 9-round 128-bit Camellia with FL function is breakable with the complexity of 2(122) encryptions. These results are better than any other known results. It concludes that the most efficient attack on Camellia is Square attack.", "paper_title": "New observation on Camellia", "paper_id": "WOS:000236988900004"}
