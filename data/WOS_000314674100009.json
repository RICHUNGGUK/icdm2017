Algorithms such as graph cuts and belief propagation are prominent; however, they are only applicable for specific energy forms. For general optimization, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based simulated annealing can estimate the minima states very slowly. This paper presents a sampling paradigm for faster optimization. First, in contrast to previous MCMCs, the role of detailed balance constraint is eliminated. The reversible Markov chain jumps are essential for sampling an arbitrary posterior distribution, but they are not essential for optimization tasks. This allows a computationally simple window cluster sample. Second, the proposal states are generated from combined sets of local minima which achieve a substantial increase in speed compared to uniformly labeled cluster proposals. Third, under the coarse-to-fine strategy, the maximum window size variable is incorporated along with the temperature variable during simulated annealing. The proposed window annealing is experimentally shown to be many times faster and capable of finding lower energy compared to the previous Gibbs and Swendsen-Wang cut (SW-cut) sampler. In addition, the proposed method is compared with other deterministic algorithms like graph cut, belief propagation, and spectral method in their own specific energy forms. Window annealing displays competitive performance in all domains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
