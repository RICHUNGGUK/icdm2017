However, the coding efficiency only depends on the attribute of sequences, not on the number of reference frames. In this paper, statistical characteristics of the best reference frame with variable block size are studied, and a fast algorithm that takes into account the correlation is proposed. The reference frame of block mode may be chosen based on the computing result of the above block mode. Experimental results show that with similar Distortion performance, the algorithm can efficiently reduce the computational complexity by 19% averagely.", "paper_title": "A fast selection algorithm for multiple reference frames in H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100051"}
