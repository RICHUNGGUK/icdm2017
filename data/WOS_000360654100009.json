The bound is tight for a range of the parameters (m, n, rho, epsilon). The algorithms in the class include Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, Benders' decomposition, Lagrangian relaxation as developed by Held and Karp for lower-bounding TSP, and many others (e.g., those by Plotkin, Shmoys, and Tardos and Grigoriadis and Khachiyan). To prove the bound, we use a discrepancy argument to show an analogous lower bound on the support size of (1 + epsilon)-approximate mixed strategies for random two-player zero-sum 0/1-matrix games.", "paper_title": "ON THE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS FOR DANTZIG-WOLFE OPTIMIZATION AND PACKING-COVERING APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000360654100009"}
