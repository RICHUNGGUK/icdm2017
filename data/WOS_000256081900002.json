The complexity of the algorithm, states more precisely, is (i=0)Sigma(l+2)()(i)(s) k(2o(min(l,s))). For fixed l, the complexity of the algorithm can be expressed as s(l+2)k(2o(l)), which is polynomial in the input parameters s and k. To our knowledge this is the first polynomial time algorithm for computing nontrivial topological invariants of semialgebraic sets in R(k) defined by polynomial inequalities, where the number of inequalities is not fixed and the polynomials are allowed to have degree greater than one. For fixed s, we obtain, by letting l=k, an algorithm for computing all the Betti numbers of S whose complexity is k(2o(s)).", "paper_title": "Computing the top Betti numbers of semialgebraic sets defined by quadratic inequalities in polynomial time", "paper_id": "WOS:000256081900002"}
