This important class of filters includes many well-known examples such as the bilateral filter, nonlocal means, general adaptive moving average filters, and more. (Many linear filters such as linear minimum mean-squared error smoothing filters, Savitzky-Golay filters, smoothing splines, and wavelet smoothers can be considered special cases.) They are frequently used in both signal and image processing as they are elegant, computationally simple, and high performing. The operators that implement such filters, however, are not symmetric in general. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a provably stable method for symmetrizing the smoothing operators. Specifically, we propose a novel approximation of smoothing operators by symmetric doubly stochastic matrices and show that this approximation is stable and accurate, even more so in higher dimensions. We demonstrate that there are several important advantages to this symmetrization, particularly in image processing/filtering applications such as denoising. In particular, (1) doubly stochastic filters generally lead to improved performance over the baseline smoothing procedure; (2) when the filters are applied iteratively, the symmetric ones can be guaranteed to lead to stable algorithms; and (3) symmetric smoothers allow an orthonormal eigendecomposition which enables us to peer into the complex behavior of such nonlinear and shift-varying filters in a locally adapted basis using principal components. Finally, a doubly stochastic filter has a simple and intuitive interpretation. Namely, it implies the very natural property that every pixel in the given input image has the same sum total contribution to the output image.", "paper_title": "Symmetrizing Smoothing Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000326032900010"}
