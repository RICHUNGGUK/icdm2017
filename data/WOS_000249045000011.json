As will be shown, this technique offers an additional downstream channel to an optical access network without increasing the cost and the complexity of its implementation. The results derived by numerical simulations show that the combination of the orthogonal bit streams can stand for several networks' bit rate requirements, providing the ability to support new, highly demanded, broadband technologies as well as rapid increment of the optical access network subscriber's number. Moreover the proposed architecture exhibits better bandwidth utilization, more efficient use of network resources, and cost effectiveness compared with the so-far proposed techniques (WDM, subcarrier multiplexing, etc.).
