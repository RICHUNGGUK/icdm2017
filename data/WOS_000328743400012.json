Here I advocate and demonstrate adaption of the h-index and the g-index to the top video content creators on YouTube. The h-index for Internet video media is based on videos and their view counts. The h-index is defined as the number of videos with >= h x 10(5) views. The g-index is defined as the number of videos with >= g x 10(5) views on average. When compared with a video creator's total view count, the h-index and g-index better capture both productivity and impact in a single metric.", "paper_title": "Bibliometrics for Internet Media: Applying the h-Index to YouTube", "paper_id": "WOS:000328743400012"}
