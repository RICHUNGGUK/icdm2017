The code solves the equations of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the Israel Stewart framework. With the help of ideal viscous splitting, we keep the ability to solve the equations of ideal hydrodynamics in the limit of zero viscosities using a Godunov-type algorithm. Milne coordinates are used to treat the predominant expansion in longitudinal (beam) direction effectively. The results are successfully tested against known analytical relativistic inviscid and viscous solutions, as well as against existing 2 + 1D relativistic viscous code.
