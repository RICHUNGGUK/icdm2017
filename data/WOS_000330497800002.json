However, due to the vibrations from the moving vehicle, watching the screen may cause disturbance, inconvenience or discomfort to the user. For better user experience of mobile access, we designed a multi-stage web page readability control architecture. Futhermore, this research proposes an original display stabilization approach required by this architcture which compensates the vibrations to make the user feel the contents shown on the flat panel display are at the same relative position. By using the front panel camera and the inertial sensors built in a smartphone, the proposed approach detects the relative displacement between the device and the user's face. Kalman filter is adopted to predict and update the positions of the contents, as if they are relatively not moving to the holder's eyes. Limitations are the noise from the sensors and the computing power of the handheld device.", "paper_title": "A Novel Display Content Stabilization Scheme for Mobile Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000330497800002"}
