The splines have C(2) continuity at simple knots and include the cubic non-uniform B-spline as a special case. Based on the given splines, piecewise quartic spline curves with three local shape parameters are given. The given spline curves can be C(2) boolean AND G(3) continuous by fixing some values of the curve's parameters. Without solving a linear system, the spline curves can also be used to interpolate sets of points with C(2) continuity. The effects of varying the three shape parameters on the shape of the quartic spline curves are determined and illustrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
