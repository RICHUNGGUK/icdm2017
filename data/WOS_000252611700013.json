By constructing a new stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions for delay-dependent guaranteed cost control are obtained which do not require system transformation or relaxation matrices. Conditions for the existence of an optimal guaranteed cost controller. are presented in the linear matrix inequality format. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in this paper.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent guaranteed cost control for uncertain Stochastic fuzzy systems with multiple tire delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000252611700013"}
