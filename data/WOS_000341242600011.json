The proposed technique implementation is simple and helps to achieve very low power consumption. This technique is based on the using of a simple reference comparator which is synchronized by one of sub-channels in each cycle of calibration. Also the detection and correction are implemented by a simple LMS loop that guarantee the convergence of algorithm. Finally, simulation results show that the new approach method can effectively correct timing errors for a specified input signal, and achieves a low power consumption, low computational complexity and high convergence speed and also verify theoretical equations for it.", "paper_title": "A LOW-POWER DIGITAL CALIBRATION OF SAMPLING TIME MISMATCHES IN TIME-INTERLEAVED A/D CONVERTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000341242600011"}
