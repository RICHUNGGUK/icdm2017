Numerous previous works showed that this flow presents more similarities with a mixing-layer flow than with the standard boundary-layer flow. In this paper, this problem was studied for homogeneous canopies, using large eddy simulation (LES). The numerical results reproduced correctly the various steps of development of this flow: the appearance of a first generation of coherent structures resulting from the development of a primary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, the reorganization of these structures, by vortex pairing and kinking, the development of a secondary instability and the formation of horseshoe vortices. Then, the process of transport of a passive scalar from a forest canopy into a clear atmosphere was studied in two cases, i.e., when the passive scalar concentration at the surface foliage is either constant or time-varying. Even though this small difference has little influence on the concentration patterns, the results showed that it can significantly affect the concentration magnitude as well as the dynamics of the total concentration in the atmosphere.
