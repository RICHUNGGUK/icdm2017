Let either H = H-d(n, m) or H = H-d(n, p), where m/n and ((n)(-1)(d)(-1))p need to be bounded away from (d - 1)(-1) and 0 respectively. We determine the asymptotic probability that H is connected. This yields the asymptotic number of connected d-uniform hypergraphs with given numbers of vertices and edges. We also derive a local limit theorem for the number of edges in H-d(n, p), conditioned on H-d(n, p) being connected.", "paper_title": "The Asymptotic Number of Connected d-Uniform Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000338294000003"}
