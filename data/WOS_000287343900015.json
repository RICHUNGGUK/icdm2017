To better understand this possible association, this study used data from the 2006 administration of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA 2006) to determine the extent to which scientific literacy is predicted by a host of ICT-related variables, after adjusting for student demographic characteristics. The findings suggest that, once demographic characteristics have been accounted for, students with prior experience with ICT, who browse the Internet more frequently, and who are confident with basic ICT tasks earned higher scientific literacy scores. Gender differences existed with respect to types of productivity and entertainment software used; this difference may be attributed to personal choice and initiative to learn ICT. Furthermore, the way in which students are using computers in schools, towards attaining learning outcomes, may have a stronger effect on scientific literacy than how often computers are accessed.
