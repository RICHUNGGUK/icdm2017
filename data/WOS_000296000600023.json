An appropriate PM strategy can extend the life of equipment and reduce variable costs. A power generation company in Taiwan that has a fixed-period PM strategy is studied. However, a fixed-period PM strategy is usually not an optimal solution for maintaining equipment those ages gradually. An age-related dynamical model is designed for creating a timely maintenance schedule that extends the life of equipment and improves its efficiency. A recursive mathematical programming model that considers regular maintenance, emergent maintenance, and maintenance improvement factors is used to obtain the optimal equipment PM schedule. An empirical experiment with the nonperiodic PM schedule computed using the proposed method was conducted. Results show a significant reduction in the PM cost and an extension of the life of equipment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
