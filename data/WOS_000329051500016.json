However, due to the static identification information exchange among the access cards and access control clients, it is very challenging to fight against access control system breaches due to reasons such as loss, stolen or unauthorized duplications of the access cards. Although advanced biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint and iris identification can further identify the user who is requesting authorization, they incur high system costs and access privileges cannot be transferred among trusted users. In this work, we introduce a dynamic authentication with sensory information for the access control systems. By combining sensory information obtained from onboard sensors on the access cards as well as the original encoded identification information, we are able to effectively tackle the problems such as access card loss, stolen, and duplication. Our solution is backward-compatible with existing access control systems and significantly increases the key spaces for authentication. We theoretically demonstrate the potential key space increases with sensory information of different sensors and empirically demonstrate simple rotations can increase key space by more than 1,000,000 times with an authentication accuracy of 90 percent. We performed extensive simulations under various environment settings and implemented our design on WISP to experimentally verify the system performance.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Authentication with Sensory Information for the Access Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329051500016"}
