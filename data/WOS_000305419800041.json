However, typical MS-based proteomics datasets have substantial proportions of missing observations, due at least in part to censoring of low intensities. This complicates intensity-based differential expression analysis. Results: We outline a statistical method for protein differential expression, based on a simple Binomial likelihood. By modeling peak intensities as binary, in terms of 'presence/absence,' we enable the selection of proteins not typically amenable to quantitative analysis; e.g. 'one-state' proteins that are present in one condition but absent in another. In addition, we present an analysis protocol that combines quantitative and presence/absence analysis of a given dataset in a principled way, resulting in a single list of selected proteins with a single-associated false discovery rate.", "paper_title": "A hybrid approach to protein differential expression in mass spectrometry-based proteomics", "paper_id": "WOS:000305419800041"}
