To overcome the challenges in this scenario, substantial effort is required to analyse the characteristics of vehicular traffic profiles oil motorways around a base station (BS). For this purpose, we first perform detailed analysis of real vehicular traffic data taken from inductive loops on a motorway, and then develop our own vehicular simulator to study real-time vehicular traffic scenarios where a main BS is responsible for multimedia communication. To address the issue of maintaining QoS for different traffic classes in reservation-based medium access control (MAC) protocols in high-speed vehicles, a novel medium access control, PC-MAC (pico cellular medium access control) protocol is introduced. The proposed PC-MAC protocol is a combination of carrier sense Multiple access (CSMA) and slotted time division multiple access (S-TDMA) for multimedia communication with optimal utilization for a motorway environment. Finally, the access to the BS is managed by our proposed PC-MAC protocol that we have integrated into the vehicular simulator. The results of this configuration have been compared with other protocols.
