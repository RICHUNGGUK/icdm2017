This paper proposes an energy efficient routing algorithm based on a two-layer Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) architecture to maximise the lifetime. The proposed scheme takes advantage of the geographic deployment knowledge to build routing protocols. Linear Programming (LP) formulations are developed to maximise the lifetime of WSNs. A Hybrid Energy-efficient Routing Scheme (HERS) is proposed to incorporate both max-min residual energy and min-max communication energy consumption information. Simulation results show that the proposed routing algorithms can prolong the lifetime of a WSN compared to the existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Geographic and energy-aware routing in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000265716500001"}
