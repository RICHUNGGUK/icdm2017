We consider two families of functions: M-Lipschitz functions (functions which change by at most M along edges) and integer-homomorphisms (functions which change by exactly 1 along edges). We prove that such functions typically exhibit very small fluctuations. For instance, we show that a uniformly chosen M-Lipschitz function takes only M + 1 values on most of the graph, with a double exponential decay for the probability of taking other values.", "paper_title": "Lipschitz Functions on Expanders are Typically Flat", "paper_id": "WOS:000320193700005"}
