As RFID middleware takes an important role in entire RFID systems, its performance should be carefully evaluated under various business conditions. In general, evaluation of the RFID middleware requires a huge cost because the numerous RFID readers and tags need to be deployed to acquire the tag event stream. To facilitate low-cost testing of the middleware, we propose the RSN Tool which provides means of designing a virtual RFID infrastructure and generates a tag event stream automatically for the virtual infrastructure. Using the RSN Tool, we can easily obtain a semantically valid dataset, which captures both physical characteristics of RF communications and business activities of tags' movements. This is a major differentiation point of our work compared from previous works, which merely create the randomized dataset based on a set of virtual RFID readers. We also discuss a step-by-step usage of the RSN Tool from the creation of a virtual infrastructure to the generation of tag events. The experimental analysis shows that the RSN Tool can create the near-real dataset, which closely reflects business activities of the real RFID infrastructure.", "paper_title": "Generation of RFID test datasets using RSN tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000324878400012"}
