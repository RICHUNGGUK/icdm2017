A few studies hypothesised that the hydraulic resistance or effective permeability of the VEP could be dependant upon fluid-flow direction. Results were influenced by species, region of interest within the end plate and pathology. Some results were contradictory. We propose an analytical model based on steady-state Newtonian flows in capillary media to develop a phenomenological analysis of convective transport through the VEP. This dependence was established using a biquadratic analytical function involving porosities of subchondral bone, capillary bed and cartilage end plate. Discussion of results provided a theoretical justification for variable and/or contradictory experimental results concerning the amount of energy lost by fluid during its course through the end plate. Tissue porosities and, especially, those relative to the capillary bed could strongly influence the dependence of fluid energy loss on flow direction and could potentially modify tissue homeostasis related to the day and night cycle.", "paper_title": "Influence of fluid-flow direction on effective permeability of the vertebral end plate: an analytical model", "paper_id": "WOS:000301596300006"}
