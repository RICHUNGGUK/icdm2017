In this paper, we first propose a square-based coverage and connectivity probability model (SCCP), which reflects the relations among the coverage (connectivity) rate, the number of deployed sensor nodes, the sensing (communication) range of sensor nodes, and the network size. This model can be used to calculate the number of sensor nodes that need to be deployed for maintaining a certain coverage (connectivity) rate. Then, an efficient approximation algorithm for largest cover set (EAA-LCS) is developed to find a largest cover set (LCS). The simulation results have shown that the error rate of node deployment is less than 5%. The proposed model and algorithm are very useful in estimating the coverage and connectivity capacity in a randomly and uniformly deployed sensor network.", "paper_title": "A square-based coverage and connectivity probability model for WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000364814200004"}
