These queries may require data from different locations and the results are not simple to combine due to differences between datasets. A query model was developed to make it simple to distribute queries across different datasets using RDF as the result format. The query model, based on the concept of publicly recognised namespaces for parts of each scientific dataset, was implemented with a configuration that includes a large number of current biological and chemical datasets. The configuration is flexible, providing the ability to transparently use both private and public datasets in any query. A prototype implementation of the model was used to resolve queries for the Bio2RDF website, including both Bio2RDF datasets and other datasets that do not follow the Bio2RDF URI conventions.
