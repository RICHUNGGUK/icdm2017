Dedicated tools are needed for harnessing the large amount of information generated by next-generation sequencing technologies. We introduce new tools implemented in the adegenet 1.3-1 package for handling and analyzing genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) data. Using a bit-level coding scheme for SNP data and parallelized computation, adegenet enables the analysis of large genome-wide SNPs datasets using standard personal computers.", "paper_title": "adegenet 1.3-1: new tools for the analysis of genome-wide SNP data", "paper_id": "WOS:000296099300022"}
