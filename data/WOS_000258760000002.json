More recently there has been an increased emphasis on Probabilistic ILP and the related fields of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and Structured Prediction. The goal of the current paper is to consider these emerging trends and chart out the strategic directions and open problems for the broader area of structured machine learning for the next 10 years.", "paper_title": "Structured machine learning: the next ten years", "paper_id": "WOS:000258760000002"}
