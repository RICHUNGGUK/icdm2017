Up until now, symbolic regression mostly approaches this type of data from an optimization point of view, considering neither the probabilistic aspects of the models nor the nonlinear relationships between the interval response and the interval predictors. In this article, we formulate interval-valued variables as bivariate random vectors and introduce the bivariate symbolic regression model based on the generalized linear models theory which provides much-needed exibility in practice. Important inferential aspects are investigated. Applications to synthetic and real data illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Bivariate symbolic regression models for interval-valued variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000299726700025"}
