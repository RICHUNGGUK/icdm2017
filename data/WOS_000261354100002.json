In this paper, we focus on concept lattices under a multi-adjoint paradigm, which enriches the language providing greater flexibility to the user in that he/she can choose from a number of different connectives. Multi-adjoint concept lattices are shown to embed different fuzzy extensions of concept lattices found in the literature, the main results of the paper being the representation theorem of this paradigm and the embedding of other well-known approaches.
