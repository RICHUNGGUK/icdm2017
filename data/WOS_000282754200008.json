The planning problem is thus suitable for the multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method. The evaluation process and evaluation criteria often involve uncertainties incorporated in quantitative analysis with crisp values and qualitative judgments with linguistic terms; therefore, fuzzy sets techniques are applied in this study. This paper proposes a fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making (FMCGDM) method for PDSP evaluation and applies a fuzzy multi-criteria group decision support system (FMCGDSS) to support the evaluation task. We introduce a PDSP evaluation model, which has evaluation criteria within three levels, based on the characteristics of a power distribution system. A case-based example is performed on a test distribution network and demonstrates how all the problems in a PDSP evaluation are addressed using FMCGDSS. The results are acceptable to expert evaluators.", "paper_title": "Power Distribution System Planning Evaluation by a Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Group Decision Support System", "paper_id": "WOS:000282754200008"}
