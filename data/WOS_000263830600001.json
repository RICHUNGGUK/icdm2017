Some approaches have been developed to reconstruct a tree based on a number of photographs around the tree, typically spanning a wide viewing range. However, due to the environmental restrictions, sometimes it is quite difficult to capture so many acceptable images from so many different viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a tree modeling system which is capable of reconstructing the 3D model of a tree from a few images with very narrow viewing ranges. Because only a few images are required to generate the model, our system has the distinct advantage of fewer environmental restrictions, resulting in the extended usability and flexibility for real applications.", "paper_title": "Image-based tree modeling from a few images with very narrow viewing range", "paper_id": "WOS:000263830600001"}
