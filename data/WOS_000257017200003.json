A single impeller Rushton turbine is positioned at the center of the reactor and air is introduced at the bottom through a circular sparger. Effects of the gas volume flow, stirrer speed and sparger dimension are investigated. The results show that the time averaged liquid velocities in radial and tangential directions decrease with increasing gas volume fraction. In the axial direction, the gas redirects the radial jet upwards, breaking the symmetry of the ring vortices. Especially, for a narrower sparger, a more concentrated tilt upwards is observed with a larger region of negative axial velocity. Although, low aeration number is used, the periodicity from the impeller is decreasing and interfering with the creation of the trailing vortex pair. The gas dispersion increases with decreasing the sparger diameter. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
