The objective of the robot is to autonomously explore and learn about an environment, to detect changes in the environment on a later visit after object disturbances and finally, to move objects back to their original positions. In the implementation, it is assumed that the robot does not have any prior knowledge of the environment and the positions of the objects. The system exploits Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous exploration techniques to achieve the task. These techniques allow the robot to perform localisation and mapping which is required to perform the object rearrangement task autonomously. The system includes an arrangement change detector, object tracking and map update that work with a Polar Scan Match (PSM) Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) SLAM system. In addition, a path planning technique for dragging and pushing an object is also presented in this paper. Experimental results of the integrated approach are shown to demonstrate that the proposed approach provides real-time autonomous object rearrangements by a mobile robot in an initially unknown real environment. Experiments also show the limits of the system by investigating failure modes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
