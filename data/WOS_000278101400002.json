We assume that the surface is deformed by an area preserving deformation, and we look for an area preserving map which is as close to an isometry as possible. We also suggest a gradient descent flow for obtaining the optimal map.", "paper_title": "Incompressible, Quasi-Isometric Deformations of 2-Dimensional Domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101400002"}
