However, it has been proved by Kang and Shang that e.g. Runge-Kutta (RK) methods can not preserve volume for all linear source-free ODEs (let alone nonlinear ODEs). On the other hand, certain so-called Exponential Runge-Kutta (ERK) methods do preserve volume for all linear source-free ODEs. Do such ERK methods perhaps also preserve volume for all nonlinear ODEs? Here we prove that the answer to this question is negative; B-series methods (which include RK, ERK and several more classes of methods) cannot preserve volume for all source-free ODEs. The proof is presented via the theory of K-loops, which is an extension of the theory of classical rooted trees.", "paper_title": "B-series methods cannot be volume-preserving", "paper_id": "WOS:000247256900008"}
