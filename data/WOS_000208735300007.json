Carpooling is a system by which a person shares his or her private vehicle with one or more people that have similar destinations. A conceptual model for carpooling simulation is presented to study the viability of carpooling clubs in a given region. Based on statistical data from single-occupant commuter trips and using roulette wheel selection, one aims to simulate the behaviour of potential carpooling users. This paper emphasizes the construction process of a Logic Flow Diagram that translates the proposed methodology, allowing organizing the different activities, input parameters and discrete events in a structure that can be used to study any given urban area.", "paper_title": "A conceptual model for carpooling systems simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000208735300007"}
