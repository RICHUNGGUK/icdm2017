This paper proposes an adaptive hashing technique to support the dynamic workload efficiently. The proposed technique maintains two levels of the hashes, one for fast moving objects and the other for quasi-static objects. A moving object changes its level adaptively according to the degree of its movement. We also present the theoretical analysis and experimental results which show that the proposed approach is more suitable than the basic hashing under the dynamic workload. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
