This paper shows some experimental demonstrations to reduce the number of the gray. levels, and shows mainly that there is a necessary analytical relationship between sampling and quantization based oil the equivalence relationship between two kinds of the integral, Riemann and Lebesgue integrals for calculating the volume of the image. Experimental demonstrations are also shown in this paper.", "paper_title": "OK-Quantization Theory and its relationship to sampling theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200048"}
