The identification of new targets of known drugs is a promising approach, which has proven successful in several cases. Here, we describe a database that includes information on 5153 putative drug-target pairs for 150 human pathogens derived from available drug-target crystallographic complexes.", "paper_title": "TiPs: a database of therapeutic targets in pathogens and associated tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000321747800021"}
