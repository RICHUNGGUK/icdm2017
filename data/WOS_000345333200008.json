Therefore, protecting the confidentiality of such data has become a very challenging issue. The conventional way to achieve data confidentiality is to encrypt the data via asymmetric or symmetric encryptions before outsourcing. However, this is computationally inefficient because encryption/decryption operations are time-consuming. In recent years, a few DOC schemes based on secret sharing have emerged due to their low computational complexity. However, Dautrich and Ravishankar pointed out that most of them are insecure against certain kinds of collusion attacks. In this paper, we proposed a novel DOC scheme based on Shamir's secret sharing to overcome the security issues of these schemes. Our scheme can allow an authorized data user to recover all data files in a specified subset at once rather than one file at a time as required by other schemes that are based on secret sharing. Our thorough analyses showed that our proposed scheme is secure and that its performance is satisfactory.", "paper_title": "A Fast and Secure Scheme for Data Outsourcing in the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333200008"}
