Understanding the relationship between these two perspectives and finding ways to improve both is a major challenge of modern molecular biology. Computational approaches for finding DNA motifs are well recognized as useful tools to biologists, which greatly help in saving experimental time and cost in wet laboratories. Over these years, many motif search algorithms and Web-based tools have been developed based on computational intelligence systems and data mining techniques in light of classical electronic computers. In order to use quantum computers in DNA motif model discovering, a related quantum algorithm is necessary. In this paper, based on the quantum adiabatic theorem, an adiabatic quantum algorithm and its application to DNA motif model discovery are obtained in terms of the MISCORE-based motif score. The proposed method can be used to deal with discovering of DNA motif models with big data by a quantum computer, e.g. D-Wave. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
