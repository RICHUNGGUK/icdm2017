The high efficiency detection and location monitoring are critical requirements for multi-target tracking in a WSN. In this paper, we present an indoor tracking model using IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radio frequency and video monitoring system to monitor targets in a special way. Our motivation is to manipulate the erratic or unstable received signal strength indicator (RSSI) signals to deliver the stable and precise position information in the indoor environment. We propose a localization algorithm based on statistical uncorrelated vectors and develop a smoothing algorithm to minimize the noise in RSSI values. We also present a solution combining the WSN with the Ethernet technology to decrease the RSSI interference by buildings. The developed system can realize the functions of multi-target detection and tracking, and specific target inquiries, alarms and monitoring. The system architecture, hardware and software organization, as well as the solutions for multiple targets tracking, RSSI interference and localization accuracy have been introduced in details.
