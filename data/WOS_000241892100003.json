Alice has a few secrets, which she regards as equally valuable. She would like to sell any of them to Bob, with the guarantee that no information about the other secrets will be obtained if he pays for only one secret. Moreover, Bob can freely choose his secret and wants to ensure that Alice can obtain no information about which of her secrets he has picked. In this paper, we present a new quantum ANDOS scheme which achieves the same functionality, but which is of unconditional security and is able to contain arbitrary number of secrets.", "paper_title": "Quantum ANDOS protocol with unconditional security", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100003"}
