The interaction between gas movement and obstacles creates vortex shedding forming a simple flow field recirculation. The presence of the simple turbulent structure within the gas mixture curls the flame front increasing curvature and enhancing burning rate. A novel twin camera Particle Image Velocimetry. PIV, was employed to characterise the flow field recirculation and the interaction with the flame front. The technique allowed the quantification of the flame/vortex interaction. The twin camera technique provides data to define the spatial variation of both the velocity of the flow field and flame front. Experimentally obtained values of local flame displacement speed and flame stretch rate are presented for simple flame/vortex interactions.", "paper_title": "A study of premixed propagating flame vortex interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000236653700013"}
