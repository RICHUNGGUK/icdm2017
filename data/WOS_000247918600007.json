As this condition may not be realizable, we propose a suboptimal design that employs an orthogonal transform and a space-frequency interleayer between the channel coder and the multi-antenna OFDM transmitter. We propose a corresponding receiving method based on block turbo equalization. Attention is paid to some detailed design of the transmitter and the receiver to curtail the computational complexity and yet deliver good performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transmission technique can outperform the conventional coded MIMO OFDM and the MIMO block single-carrier transmission with cyclic prefixing.", "paper_title": "Theory and design of near-optimal MIMO OFDM transmission system for correlated multipath Rayleigh fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000247918600007"}
