Under such a context, the classical VaR estimators are the Weissman-Hill estimators, based on any intermediate number k of top-order statistics. But these VaR estimators do not enjoy the adequate linear property of quantiles, contrarily to the PORT VaR estimators, which depend on an extra tuning parameter q, with 0 <= q < 1. We shall here consider 'quasi-PORT' reduced-bias VaR estimators, for which such a linear property is obtained approximately. They are based on a partially shifted version of a minimum-variance reduced-bias (MVRB) estimator of the extreme value index (EVI), the primary parameter in Statistics of Extremes. Due to the stability on k of the MVRB EVI and associated VaR estimates, we propose the use of a heuristic stability criterion for the choice of k and q, providing applications of the methodology to simulated data and to log-returns of financial stocks.", "paper_title": "A computational study of a quasi-PORT methodology for VaR based on second-order reduced-bias estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000303234800007"}
