In the proposed scheme, any group of more than t out of n members can cooperate to generate the group signature. The message recovery property is also added into the scheme. By employing the public key of the verifier, the transmission of the signature will be secured. Finally, to detect a removal by an eavesdropper, the linkage property between signed ciphertexts of message blocks is also added into the scheme.", "paper_title": "A group-oriented (t, n) threshold signature scheme against replay attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600083"}
