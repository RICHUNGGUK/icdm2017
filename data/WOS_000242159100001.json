In 1988, Yager proposed an ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation method to find the related weights of many criteria. However, the previous aggregation operators (including OWA) and the aggregation situation are independent. For solving the problem, we propose a new aggregation situation and operator model-a dynamic fuzzy OWA model based on the evaluating situation. The OWA can modify associated weights dynamically based on the aggregation situation and work like a \"magnifying lens\" to enlarge and find the most important attribute dependent on the minimal information, or get equal attributes' weights based on maximal information. We also evaluate the risks of software development and compare the results with Chen's (2001) and Lee's (1996) methods.", "paper_title": "Dynamic fuzzy OWA model for evaluating the risks of software development", "paper_id": "WOS:000242159100001"}
