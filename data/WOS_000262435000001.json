The nucleophilicity of crown-4 ethers has been investigated by the Fukui function. Their selectivity trend shows that of all the crown-4 ethers, 14C4 shows the highest cation selectivity for Li+ over Na+, has been achieved on the basis of thermodynamic analysis. In addition, Li+/crown-4 series are more stable than Na+/crown-4 series in the gas phase. The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental observation.", "paper_title": "DFT study of a series of crown-4 ethers and their selectivity trend for alkali metal cations: Li+ and Na+", "paper_id": "WOS:000262435000001"}
