This paper presents a rule-based approach to emotion cause component detection for Chinese micro-blogs. Our research has important scientific values on social network knowledge discovery and data mining. It also has a great potential in analyzing the psychological processes of consumers. Firstly, this paper proposes a rule-based system underlying the conditions that trigger emotions based on an emotional model. Secondly, this paper extracts the corresponding cause events in fine-grained emotions from the results of events, actions of agents and aspects of objects. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to get the proportions of different cause components under different emotions by constructing the emotional lexicon and identifying different linguistic features, and the proposed approach is based on Bayesian probability. Finally, this paper presents the experiments on an emotion corpus of Chinese micro-blogs. The experimental results validate the feasibility of the approach. The existing problems and the further works are also present at the end. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
