The treatment of this pathological problem is one of the biggest challenges to the gynaecologist today. The rate of surgical intervention failure is quite significant. The recurrence of prolapse could be related to inadequate surgical technique or the pathology or/and biomechanical deficiency of the soft tissues. The modelling and simulation of the behaviour of the pelvic cavity could be a major tool for specific evaluation of pelvic status. A first stage of this model is being developed and reported. The computer-aided design model of the organs of the pelvic floor is created using magnetic resonance image data and the ligament boundary conditions are defined. A multi-organ geometric model is thus created and studied.", "paper_title": "Experiments and finite element modelling for the study of prolapse in the pelvic floor system", "paper_id": "WOS:000278314600007"}
