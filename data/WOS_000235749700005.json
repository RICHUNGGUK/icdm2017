The first model excludes, and a second includes, effects of the local electrostatic interactions on the chromophore energies. Special attention is given to the contributions of the aromatic side-chain chromophores, and the mechanisms of generation of rotational strengths are analyzed. The sensitivity of the computational models with respect to the structural changes of the protein are discussed.", "paper_title": "Modeling study of the influences of the aromatic transitions and the local environment on the far-UV rotational strengths in TEM-1 beta-lactamase", "paper_id": "WOS:000235749700005"}
