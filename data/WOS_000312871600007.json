Currently, the major challenges in activity recognition include the domination of major activities over minor activities, their non-deterministic nature and the lack of availability of human-understandable output. In this paper, we introduce a novel Evolutionary Ensembles Model (EEM) that values both minor and major activities by processing each of them independently. It is based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to handle the non-deterministic nature of activities. Our evolutionary ensemble learner generates a human-understandable rule profile to ensure a certain level of confidence for performed activities. To evaluate the EEM, we performed experiments on three different real world datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement of 0.6 % to 0.28 % in the F-measures of recognized activities compared to existing counterparts. It is expected that EEM would be a practical solution for the activity recognition problem due to its understandable output and improved accuracy.", "paper_title": "EEM: evolutionary ensembles model for activity recognition in Smart Homes", "paper_id": "WOS:000312871600007"}
