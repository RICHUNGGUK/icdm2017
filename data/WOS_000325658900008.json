Being one of the largest working wireless sensor networks, CitySee faces several challenges such as hardware design, software development, platforms, network protocols, and, most important, satisfactory services to users. We share some early lessons learned from this project, illustrate the potential benefits and risks of current solutions, and discuss the possible extensions of CitySee applications.", "paper_title": "CitySee: Not Only a Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000325658900008"}
