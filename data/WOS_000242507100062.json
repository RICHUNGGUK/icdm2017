Meanwhile the authors have introduced detailedly represented irregular LDPC code ensembles specified with joint degree distributions between variable nodes and check nodes. In this paper, by using density evolution method [7], [8], we optimize IRA codes specified with joint degree distributions. Resulting codes have higher thresholds than Jin's IRA codes.", "paper_title": "Design of irregular repeat accumulate codes with joint degree distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100062"}
