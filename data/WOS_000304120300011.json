In this paper, a novel transmission scheduling algorithm is proposed to further enhance the performance of MIMO link ad hoc networks. By utilizing the MIMO multi-stream reception capabilities and ordering the nodes' allocation sequence, the proposed algorithm can dramatically shorten the scheduling frame length and more evenly distribute the data streams allocated to the network nodes. Meanwhile, allowing the nodes to transmit multiple streams in a slot, the algorithm can fully exploit the MIMO spatial multiplexing potential. Additionally, we give the theoretical analysis to quantify the throughput and delay performance with respect to this scheme. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently enhance the network throughput and reduce the average and maximum delay.", "paper_title": "Transmission scheduling algorithm for MIMO link ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304120300011"}
