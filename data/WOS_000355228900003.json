These factors have been normally modelled by complex methodologies where the seeking solution process often presents high scale of difficulty. This work presents the fuzzy set theory as a tool to model uncertainty in supply chain planning problems and proposes the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) metaheuristics technique combined with a backward calculation as a solution method. The aim of this combination is to present a simple effective method to model uncertainty, while good quality solutions are obtained with metaheuristics due to its capacity to find them with satisfactory computational performance in complex problems, in a relatively short time period.", "paper_title": "Application of particle swarm optimisation with backward calculation to solve a fuzzy multi-objective supply chain master planning model", "paper_id": "WOS:000355228900003"}
