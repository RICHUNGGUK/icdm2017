A recent conjecture that all fullerenes are centrosymmetric is disproved; in fact, it turns out that most fullerenes are not centrosymmetric. Necessary and sufficient conditions are stated in terms of the 28 possible fullerene automorphism groups: if the group is C-1 or C-3 the fullerene is not centrosymrnetric; for C-3h, C-3v or C-s the fullerene is centrosymmetric unless some vertex is fixed by a mirror plane; for all other groups, the fullerene is centrosymmetric. Most fullerenes have trivial C-1 symmetry and hence are not centrosymmetric.", "paper_title": "Most Fullerenes Have No Centrosymmetric Labelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000331779000007"}
