The task to distinguish among these and to further categorize the families of messenger RNAs and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) is an important step for examining gene expression patterns of an interactive environment and the phylogenetic classification of the constituting species. RESULTS: We present SortMeRNA, a new software designed to rapidly filter rRNA fragments from metatranscriptomic data. It is capable of handling large sets of reads and sorting out all fragments matching to the rRNA database with high sensitivity and low running time.", "paper_title": "SortMeRNA: fast and accurate filtering of ribosomal RNAs in metatranscriptomic data", "paper_id": "WOS:000312105300008"}
