In this paper, we extend the main result of Szlam and Bresson (Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 1039-1046, 2010), which introduced an exact a\"\" (1) relaxation of the Cheeger ratio cut problem for unsupervised data classification. The proposed extension deals with the multi-class transductive learning problem, which consists in learning several classes with a set of labels for each class. Learning several classes (i.e. more than two classes) simultaneously is generally a challenging problem, but the proposed method builds on strong results introduced in imaging to overcome the multi-class issue. Besides, the proposed multi-class transductive learning algorithms also benefit from recent fast a\"\" (1) solvers, specifically designed for the total variation norm, which plays a central role in our approach. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the proposed a\"\" (1) relaxation algorithms are more accurate and robust than standard a\"\" (2) relaxation methods s.a. spectral clustering, particularly when considering a very small number of labels for each class to be classified. For instance, the mean error of classification for the benchmark MNIST dataset of 60,000 data in using the proposed a\"\" (1) relaxation of the multi-class Cheeger cut is 2.4 % when only one label is considered for each class, while the error of classification for the a\"\" (2) relaxation method of spectral clustering is 24.7 %.", "paper_title": "Multi-class Transductive Learning Based on a\"\" (1) Relaxations of Cheeger Cut and Mumford-Shah-Potts Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000333339000011"}
