Because a CR is capable of sensing the previous environmental communication information, CR decision engine plays the role of optimizing the individual transmission parameters. In order to obtain the allowable transmission power of multicarrier based CR system demands interference analysis a priori, for the sake of efficient optimization, a two-dimensional GA structure is proposed in this paper which enhances the computational complexity. Combined with the fitness objective evaluation standard, we focus on two multi-objective optimization methods: The conventional GA applied with the multi-objective fitness approach and the non-dominated sorting GA with Pareto-optimal sorting fronts. After comparing the convergence performance of these algorithms, the transmission power of each subcarrier is proposed as non-interference emission with its optimal values in multicarrier based CR system.", "paper_title": "An Interference Avoidance Method Using Two Dimensional Genetic Algorithm for Multicarrier Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000327723300006"}
