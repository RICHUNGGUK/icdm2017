Compliance is added in a selective compliant assembly robot arm (SCARA) in the form of a two ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) fingers based micro gripper. This micro gripper is integrated at the end effector position of a SCARA robot. Peg-hole interaction is analytically modeled and based on it the force required to correct the lateral and angular errors by IPMC is calculated. A proportional-derivative (PD) controller is designed to actuate the IPMC to get the desired force for correcting the peg position before assembly. Simulations and experiments were carried out by developing an IPMC micro gripper and using it to analyze various cases of peg in hole assembly. The experimental results prove that adding compliance through IPMC helps in peg-in-hole assembly. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
