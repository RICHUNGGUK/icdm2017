The diameter of a graph can be affected by the addition or deletion of edges. In this paper we study how the diameter variability problem arises from change of edges of an m x n diagonal mesh, where m and n are not both even integers. We show that the least number of edges whose deletion from an m x n diagonal mesh will increase the diameter is no more than 2, and that the least number of edges whose addition to an m x n diagonal mesh causes the diameter to decrease is no more than inverted right perpendicularm/2inverted left perpendicularn.", "paper_title": "Changing the Diameter in a Diagonal Mesh Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000316242600001"}
