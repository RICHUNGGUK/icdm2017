The objective is to reduce final product cost and accelerate time to market by providing means of testing the entire transceiver system as well as its major building blocks Without using off-chip analog or RF instrumentation. On-chip test devices fabricated in a standard CMOS process and experimentally evaluated support the proposed test strategy.", "paper_title": "On-chip testing techniques for RF wireless transceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000240023000002"}
