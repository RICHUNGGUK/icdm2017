We adopt a variational method for the reconstruction of 3D non-uniform data to a uniform grid of chosen resolution. We will extend this reconstruction to an efficient multi-resolution uniform representation of the underlying data. Our multi-resolution representation includes a traditional bottom-up approach and a novel top-down hierarchy for adaptive hierarchical reconstruction. Using a hybrid regularization functional we can improve the reconstruction results. Finally, we discuss further application scenarios and show rendering results to emphasize the effectiveness and quality of our proposed framework. By means of qualitative results and error comparisons we demonstrate superiority of our method compared to competing methods.", "paper_title": "On Visualization and Reconstruction from Non-Uniform Point Sets using B-splines", "paper_id": "WOS:000268217500039"}
