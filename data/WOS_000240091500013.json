Decision making in complex systems like e-learning systems requires processing of large amounts of heterogeneous data and information from dispread sources. Moreover, most of the decision parameters are incomplete and uncertain. Lacking of a complete model of learner is the prominent problem of current learning systems. In this paper, a market based method for describing Learner's preferences to the learning system is provided. The proposed approach strives for applying a Dempster-Shafer decision making over a society of self motivated agents. It tries to present a final learner agent with a high degree of similarity to the user for the purpose that it can act as a model of learner through the system. An implicit learning is also implemented by the idea of Stocks in real markets which can improve decision making efficiently.", "paper_title": "Intelligent market based learner modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500013"}
