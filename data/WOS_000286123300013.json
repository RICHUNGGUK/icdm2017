Existing WfMSs provide tools that simplify the workflow composition and enactment actions, while they support the execution of complex tasks on remote computational resources usually through calls to web services (WSs). Nowadays, an increasing number of WfMSs employ pipelining during the workflow execution. In this work, we focus on improving the performance of long-running workflows consisting of multiple pipelined calls to remote WSs when the execution takes place in a totally decentralized manner. The novelty of our algorithm lies in the fact that it considers the network heterogeneity, and although the optimization problem becomes more complex, it is capable of finding an optimal solution in a short time. Our proposal is evaluated through a real prototype deployed on PlanetLab, and the experimental results are particularly encouraging. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
