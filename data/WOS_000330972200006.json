We count the number of empty monochromatic d-simplices determined by S, that is, simplices which have only points from one color class of S as vertices and no points of S in their interior. For 3a parts per thousand currency signka parts per thousand currency signd we provide a lower bound of and strengthen this to Omega(n (d-2/3)) for k=2. On the way we provide various results on triangulations of point sets in . In particular, for any constant dimension da parts per thousand yen3, we prove that every set of n points (n sufficiently large), in general position in , admits a triangulation with at least dn+Omega(logn) simplices.", "paper_title": "Empty Monochromatic Simplices", "paper_id": "WOS:000330972200006"}
