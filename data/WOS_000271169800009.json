Since the work of Kolpakov and Kucherov, it is known that rho(n), the maximum number of runs in a string, is linear in the length n of the string. Lower bounds haven been provided by Franek et al. and Matsubara et al. (0.944n) and upper bounds have been provided by Rytter, Puglisi et al., and Crochemore and Ilie (1.048n). However, very few properties are known for the rho(n)/n function. We show here by a simple argument that lim(nbar right arrow infinity)rho(n)/n exists and that this limit is never reached. We further study the asymptotic behavior of rho(p)(n); the maximal number of runs with period at most p. Finally, we provide the first exact limits for some microruns. For example, we have lim(nbar right arrow infinity)rho(14)(n)/n = 15/17 (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
