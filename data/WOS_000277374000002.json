In academia as well as in industry, fundamental concepts such as image transformations, filtering, noise removal, morphology, convolution/deconvolution among others require extra efforts to be understood. Additionally, algorithms for image reading and visualization in computers are not always easy to develop by inexperienced researchers. This type of environment has lead to an adverse situation where most students and researchers develop their own image processing code for operations which are already standards in image processing, a redundant process which only exacerbates the situation. The research proposed in this article, with the aim to resolve this dilemma, is to propose a user-friendly computer interface that has a dual objective which is to free students and researchers from the learning time needed for understanding/applying diverse imaging techniques but to also provide them with the option to enhance or reprogram such algorithms with direct access to the software code. The interface was thus developed with the intention to assist in understanding and performing common image processing operations through simple commands that can be performed mostly by mouse clicks. The visualization of pseudo code after each command execution makes the interface attractive, while saving time and facilitating to users the learning of such practical concepts.
