Indeed, the collaborations among horizontally specialized value providers are critical for the success of the companies as well as the whole ecosystem. This paper aims to propose a novel index, i.e., Overall Wafer Effectiveness (OWE), to measure wafer productivity and drive various improvement directions for semiconductor ecosystem as a whole. Furthermore, the proposed OWE can be easily extended to incorporate additional attributes such as mask-field-utilization, throughput, and yield for effective management. We conducted a number of case studies in real settings. The results have shown that OWE can be employed as a semiconductor industry standard to drive collaborative efforts among IC designers, equipment vendors, and manufacturers in the ecosystem to enhance total wafer effectiveness. This paper concludes with discussions on value propositions of proposed OWE indices and future research directions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
