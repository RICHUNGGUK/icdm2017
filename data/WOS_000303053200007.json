In this work, an iterative methodology is developed using the concept of an equivalent linear system for the topology synthesis of structures undergoing nonlinear and dynamic response, using minimal nonlinear response evaluations. The approach uses equivalent loads obtained from nonlinear dynamic analysis to perform optimization iterations, during the course of which the nonlinear and dynamic system is continuously approximated. In this process, the optimization is decoupled from the nonlinear dynamic analysis. Results are presented for various kinds of nonlinear and dynamic problems showing the effectiveness of the developed approach.", "paper_title": "Structural topology synthesis with dynamics and nonlinearities using equivalent linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000303053200007"}
