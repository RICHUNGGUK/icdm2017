This kind of fuzzy rule allows us to represent knowledge about patterns of interest in an explanatory and understandable form that can be used by the expert. Experimental evaluation of the algorithm and a comparison with other subgroup discovery algorithms show the validity of the proposal. SDIGA is applied to a market problem studied in the University of Mondragon, Spain, in which it is necessary to extract automatically relevant and interesting information that helps to improve fair planning policies. The application of SDIGA to this problem allows us to obtain novel and valuable knowledge for experts.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary fuzzy rule induction process for subgroup discovery: A case study in marketing", "paper_id": "WOS:000248703700005"}
