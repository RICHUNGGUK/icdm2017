There are three parts to this work. First, using on-line datasets, we test new and existing theories of human color preferences. For example, we test whether certain hues or hue templates may be preferred by viewers. Second, we learn quantitative models that score the quality of a five-color set of colors, called a color theme. Such models can be used to rate the quality of a new color theme. Third, we demonstrate simple prototypes that apply a learned model to tasks in color design, including improving existing themes and extracting themes from images.", "paper_title": "Color Compatibility From Large Datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000297216400037"}
