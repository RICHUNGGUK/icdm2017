With the increasing popularity of social media platforms that connect humans, we propose to portray domestic robots as buddies on the contact list of family members and present a robot management system that employs complementary social media platforms for humans to interact with the vacuuming robot Roomba and a surveillance robot developed on top of iRobot Create. The social media platforms adopted include short message services (SMS), instant messenger (MSN), an online shared calendar (Google Calendar), and a social networking site (Facebook). Hence, we can provide a rich set of user-familiar, intuitive, and highly accessible interfaces, allowing users to flexibly choose their preferred tools in different situations. An in-lab experiment and a multiday field study are conducted to study the characteristics and strengths of each interface and to investigate users' perception to the robots and behaviors in choosing the interfaces.", "paper_title": "Using Social Media Platforms for Human-Robot Interaction in Domestic Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000337576600003"}
