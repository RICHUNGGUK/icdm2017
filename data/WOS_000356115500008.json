To develop hypotheses, we adopted three theoretical lenses: the cognition-to-action loyalty framework, the interactivity theory, and the E-Quality model. The model and measurements were based on the literature. A survey was conducted to validate the research model. The findings illustrate that interactive EWOM systems impart customer satisfaction on the purchase decision and also positively influence the website quality. E-Quality was found to have a significant impact on decision support satisfaction. Several theoretical contributions and managerial implications are discussed.
