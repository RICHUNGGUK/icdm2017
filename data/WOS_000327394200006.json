Such portable systems will allow for early diagnosis of motor function ability and provide new insight into the physical characteristics of ailment condition. This paper introduces a highly mobile and inexpensive monitoring system to quantify upper-limb performance for patients with movement disorders. With respect to the data analysis, we first present an approach to quantify general motor performance using the introduced sensing hardware. Next, we propose an ailment-based analysis which employs a significant-feature identification algorithm to perform cross-patient data analysis and classification. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated using real data collected through a clinical trial. The results show that the system can be utilized as a preliminary diagnostic tool to inspect the level of hand-movement performance. The ailment-based analysis performs an intergroup comparison of physiological signals for cerebral vascular accident (CVA) patients, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) patients, and healthy individuals. The system can classify each patient group with an accuracy of up to 95.00% and 91.42% for CVA and CIDP, respectively.", "paper_title": "A Pervasive Assessment of Motor Function: A Lightweight Grip Strength Tracking System", "paper_id": "WOS:000327394200006"}
