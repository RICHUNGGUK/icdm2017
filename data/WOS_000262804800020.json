This research report seeks to explore the realities of introducing and integrating handheld computers into five Victorian schools in Australia where the initiative is owned and funded by the schools themselves. The research focused on how teachers' attitudes and beliefs evolved over about 6-7 months of implementing the pocket PCs in their teaching. The findings indicated that the effect of pocket PCs on the attitudes of primary teachers were mixed while that on the secondary teachers was uncertainty. However, both primary and secondary teachers shared similar beliefs in the motivational aspect of the technology on student engagement and its capacity to cater for weaker students, particularly in English, but not for the more academic students. Issues such as leadership roles, the time-consuming nature of lesson preparation, the need to integrate higher-order thinking tasks with pocket PC usage and personal ownership for successful integration of the technology are discussed.
