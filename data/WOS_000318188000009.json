The majority of the images circulated over the Internet are coded in the JPEG format. Thus, the present study proposes a novel digital feature retrieval scheme designed to detect unlawful dissemination of pre-selected JPEG images. In the proposed approach, the packet-level features of the target JPEG image are collected in advance and are stored in a feature database. Thereafter, the features of all the packets passing through a nominated router are compared on-the-fly with those in the feature database in order to detect any transmissions of the target images. The experimental results show that the proposed packet-level forensic scheme is far more efficient than existing application-level schemes. As a result, the proposed scheme provides a viable solution for the background monitoring of JPEG streams over large-scale network environments such as the Internet in order to detect unlawful transmissions and to compile digital evidence of such transmissions for possible future legal proceedings.
