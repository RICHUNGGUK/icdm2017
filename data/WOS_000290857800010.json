It is found that the nearest-neighbor concurrence and the block-block entanglement can be generated dynamically from an initial antiferromagnetic (AF) state, and DM interactions will enhance the amplitude of oscillation of concurrence and that of block-block entanglement. Furthermore, dynamics of block-block entanglement S-L in the chain with even number spins is coincident with the dynamics of SN-L for D = 0. However, with the consideration of DM interactions, the evolution of S-L will not be consistent with that of SN-L for the chain with odd number spins. In a given time interval, the maximal value of the generated nearest-neighbor concurrence C-i,i+1(max) will first decrease with the increase of chain's length, then oscillate with the increase of N. The maximal value and the minimal value of the oscillation becomes stable for a large N, and C-i,i+1(max) of the chain with odd spins is larger than that of the chain with even spins for a large N. The influence of DM interaction on the value of C-i,i+1(max) becomes unobvious with the increase of chain's length.", "paper_title": "DYNAMICS OF ENTANGLEMENT IN HEISENBERG CHAINS WITH ASYMMETRIC DZYALOSHINSKII-MORIYA INTERACTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290857800010"}
