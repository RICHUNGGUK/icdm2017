We study the effect to the generative power, if we use instead of arbitrary regular languages only finite, nilpotent, monoidal, combinational, definite, ordered, union-free, star-free, strictly locally testable, commutative regular, circular regular, and suffix-closed regular languages. Essentially, we prove that the hierarchy of language families obtained from conditional Lindenmayer systems with subregular conditions is almost identical to the hierarchy of families of subregular languages.", "paper_title": "CONDITIONAL LINDENMAYER SYSTEMS WITH SUBREGULAR CONDITIONS: THE NON-EXTENDED CASE", "paper_id": "WOS:000333753000008"}
