This article establishes a link between the concept of lean product development and the field of knowledge management. The transfer of knowledge within any organisation is recognised as a challenging task and mastering that challenge is increasingly important. Numerous studies show that common knowledge transfer tools such as post-project reviews are problematic, which calls for improved ways of transferring knowledge. By relating Lean principles and methods to the knowledge creation framework developed by Nonaka and Takeuchi (often referred to as the SECI-model), this article suggests that lean product development offers principles and methods that could provide a way of improving knowledge transfer in product development.", "paper_title": "Practices supporting knowledge transfer - an analysis of lean product development", "paper_id": "WOS:000326353900004"}
