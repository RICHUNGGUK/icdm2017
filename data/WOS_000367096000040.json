Under the assumption that additive noise has a Gaussian distribution, the noise parameters were estimated from an observed degraded image, and were used to define the constraints of a noise detection process that was coupled with a Markov random field (MRF). In addition, an adaptive modified weighted Gaussian filter with variable window sizes defined by the constraints on noise detection was used to control the degree of smoothness of the reconstructed image. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Fast Image Denoising Algorithm by Estimating Noise Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000040"}
