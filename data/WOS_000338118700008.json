We combine a symmetric SPH pressure force and an SPH discretization of the continuity equation to obtain a discretized form of the pressure Poisson equation (PPE). In contrast to previous projection schemes, our system does consider the actual computation of the pressure force. This incorporation improves the convergence rate of the solver. Furthermore, we propose to compute the density deviation based on velocities instead of positions as this formulation improves the robustness of the time-integration scheme. We show that our novel formulation outperforms previous projection schemes and state-of-the-art SPH methods. Large time steps and small density deviations of down to 0.01 percent can be handled in typical scenarios. The practical relevance of the approach is illustrated by scenarios with up to 40 million SPH particles.", "paper_title": "Implicit Incompressible SPH", "paper_id": "WOS:000338118700008"}
