For each case, a novel video completion technique based on the bandlet transform is presented. In the first case, a priority-based exemplar algorithm, which applies the bandlet transform and its generated coefficients along with motion information, is used to fill-in the occluded moving object or the removed region. In the second case, our proposed method is followed by a foreground/background segmentation preprocessing step to generate moving objects and background frames in order to facilitate the video completion task. The technique fills-in the background frames after removing objects by means of a precise optimization in the bandlet transform domain. Then, the occluded part of a moving object is completed by a priority-based algorithm which applies frames' geometry properties using the bandlet transform. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed video completion technique maintains both the spatial and temporal consistency and also demonstrate the effectiveness of the bandlet transform in video completion.", "paper_title": "Video Completion Using Bandlet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000311800400009"}
