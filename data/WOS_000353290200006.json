However, the existing fingerprints are unsuitable for social network tasks, because they fail to represent the social network structure, which incurs inefficient fingerprint coding. In addition, they are infeasible to efficiently trace colluders due to the large scale of social networks. To address these problems, we design a novel fingerprint, which consists of community relationship code and user identification code. Aiming to preserving the social network structure, we propose a kernelized neighborhood preserving hashing method to generate community relationship codes. The proposed method assigns similar community relationship codes to users in the same or close communities, which improves the anticollusion performance. Because the community relationship codes are binary and neighborhood preserving, they can be used for fast indexing and retrieval. To accelerate the collusion fingerprint tracing, we treat the community relationship codes as index keys to construct a hash table and an inverted index table. Based on the tables, we correspondingly propose an efficient fingerprint detection method. Extensive experiments show that the proposed fingerprint is suitable for social network tasks and the real colluders can be efficiently identified by the proposed fingerprint detection approach.", "paper_title": "Kernelized Neighborhood Preserving Hashing for Social-Network-Oriented Digital Fingerprints", "paper_id": "WOS:000353290200006"}
