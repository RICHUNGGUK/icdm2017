In this article, we explore the application of data-driven optimizations to reduce both storage and computation requirements to the problem of signal recognition from a known dictionary. By starting with a high-level mathematical representation of a signal recognition problem, we perform optimizations across the layers of the system, exploiting mathematical structure to improve implementation efficiency. Specifically, we use Walsh wavelet packets in conjunction with a BestBasis algorithm to distinguish between spoken digits. The resulting transform matrices are quite sparse, and exhibit a rich algebraic structure that contains significant overlap across rows. As a consequence, dot-product computations of the transform matrix and signal vectors exhibit significant computation reuse, or repeated identical computations. We present an algorithm for identifying this computation reuse and scheduling of the row computations. We exploit this reuse to derive FPGA hardware implementations that reduce the amount of computation for an individual matrix by as much as 6.35x and an average of 2x for a single dot-product unit. The implementation that exploits reuse achieves a 2x computation reduction compared to three concurrently-executing simpler accumulator units with the same aggregate design area and outperforms software implementations on high-end desktop personal computers.", "paper_title": "Domain-Specific Optimization of Signal Recognition Targeting FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000299337300006"}
