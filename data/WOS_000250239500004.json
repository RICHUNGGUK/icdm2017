Due to insecure wireless channels, group communications are susceptible to various kinds of attacks. Although a number of proposals have been reported to secure group communications, provisioning security in group communications in wireless networks remains a critical and challenging issue. This article presents a survey of recent advances in security requirements and services in group communications in three types of wireless networks, and discusses challenges in designing secure group communications in these networks: wireless infrastructure networks, mobile ad hoc networks, and wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Security services in group communications over wireless infrastructure, mobile Ad Hoc, and wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250239500004"}
