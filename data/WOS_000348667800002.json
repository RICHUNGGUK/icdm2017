Using this result, Gupta, Kamath, Kayal and Saptharishi found an upper bound for the size of a depth three circuit computing f(n). We improve here Koiran's bound. Indeed, we transform an arithmetic circuit into a depth four circuit of size 2((O(root dlog(ds) log(n)))). Then, mimicking the proof in[2], it also implies a 2((O(root dlog(ds) log(n)))) upper bound for depth three circuits. This new bound is almost optimal since a 2(Omega(root d)) lower bound is known for the size of homogeneous depth four circuits such that gates at the bottom have fan-in at most root d. Finally, we show that this last lower bound also holds if the fan-in is at least root d. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
