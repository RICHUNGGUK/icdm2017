In this case a special type of WSN called linear wireless sensor network (LSN) is used. One of the main challenges of using LSN is the reliability of the connections among the nodes. Faults in a few contiguous nodes may cause the creation of holes which will result in dividing the network into multiple disconnected segments. As a result, sensor nodes that are located between holes may not be able to deliver their sensed information which negatively affects the network's sensing coverage. Sensing robots can be used to overcome these faults and enhance the coverage. Sensing robots provide additional sensing coverage and restore the connectivity among disconnected segments. This paper develops a cost-effective design for robot-assisted fault-tolerant LSN. In this design the numbers of fixed sensor nodes and mobile sensing robots are determined such that the required reliability and sensing coverage levels are maintained while the total cost is minimized. The paper covers both uniformly and randomly deployed sensors LSNs.", "paper_title": "A Cost-Effective Design for Combining Sensing Robots and Fixed Sensors for Fault-Tolerant Linear Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332976000001"}
