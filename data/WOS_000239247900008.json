Neuronal model reduction methods provide a means to reduce model complexity while retaining the original model's realism and relevance. Such methods, however, typically include ad hoc components that require that the modeler already be intimately familiar with the dynamics of the original model. We present an automated, algorithmic method for reducing conductance-based neuron models using the method of equivalent potentials (Kelper et al., Biol Cybern 66(5):381-387, 1992) Our results demonstrate that this algorithm is able to reduce the complexity of the original model with minimal performance loss, and requires minimal prior knowledge of the model's dynamics. Furthermore, by utilizing a cost function based on the contribution of each state variable to the total conductance of the model, the performance of the algorithm can be significantly improved.", "paper_title": "An algorithmic method for reducing conductance-based neuron models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239247900008"}
