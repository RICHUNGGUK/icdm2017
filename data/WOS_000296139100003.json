None of them is fully adequate, and their measures are not commensurate. We enumerate the desiderata for a coreference scoring measure, discuss the strong and weak points of the existing measures, and propose the BiLateral Assessment of Noun-Phrase Coreference, a variation of the Rand index created to suit the coreference task. The BiLateral Assessment of Noun-Phrase Coreference rewards both coreference and non-coreference links by averaging the F-scores of the two types, does not ignore singletons - the main problem with the MUC score - and does not inflate the score in their presence - a problem with the B(3) and CEAF scores. In addition, its fine granularity is consistent over the whole range of scores and affords better discrimination between systems.", "paper_title": "BLANC: Implementing the Rand index for coreference evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296139100003"}
