A fundamental and required property of any control system is its stability. In this paper, we investigate the problem of asymptotic stability in the second-order congestion control system with heterogeneous communication delays. A new approach to stability analysis of the second-order congestion control algorithms is proposed, where the free weighting matrix technique is used and the knowledge of the delay interval is also utilized. Several linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based delay-range-dependent stability criteria are proposed. Simulation results show that the stability criteria proposed in this paper are much less conservative than the existing ones in the sense that the larger range of communication delays can be accommodated.
