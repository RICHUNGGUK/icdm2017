First, an explanation is given of the singularity that arises when a motion control law based on a Lyapunov function has an integrated control objective for energy and posture. Then, a fuzzy controller is designed that solves the singularity problem through regulation of a design parameter in the control law. Finally, an additional fuzzy controller is designed that improves the control performance through regulation of another design parameter in the control law. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated fuzzy-control strategy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
