Since not all evolutionary histories for a set of species can be explained by a single tree, it is natural to ask for the minimum number of rooted phylogenetic trees needed such that each tree in R is compatible with at least one tree. This paper shows that it is computationally hard to compute this minimum number. In particular, if R. contains rooted triples (rooted binary phylogenetic trees on three leaves), it is NP-complete to decide whether there exist two rooted phylogenetic trees such that each rooted triple in R is compatible with at least one of the two trees. Furthermore, for a set Sigma of binary characters and a positive integer k, we show that to decide if there exists a set P of k rooted phylogenetic trees such that each character in Sigma is compatible with at least one tree in P is NP-complete for all k >= 3, but solvable in polynomial time for k = 2. This generalizes the result for k = 1, where it is well-known to be polynomial time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
