We also provide formal definitions of what is \"a more specific\" and what is \"the most specific\" signature for a polymorphic worm and show that the most specific exploit-based signature generation is NP-hard. The approach involves three steps: multiple sequence alignment to reward consecutive substring extractions, noise elimination to remove noise effects, and signature transformation to make the SRE signature compatible with current IDSs. Experiments on a range of polymorphic worms and real-world polymorphic shellcodes show that our bioinformatics approach is noise-tolerant and as that because it extracts more polymorphic worm characters, like one-byte invariants and distance restrictions between invariant bytes, the signatures it generates are more accurate and precise than those generated by some other exploit-based signature generation schemes.
