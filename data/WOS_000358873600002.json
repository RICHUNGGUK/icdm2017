The algebraic immunity over F of boolean function f : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1} is defined as the minimal degree of a nontrivial (multilinear) polynomial g(x) is an element of F [x(1),..., x(n)] such that f (x) is a constant (either 0 or 1) for all x is an element of {0, 1}(n) satisfying g(x) = 0. Function f is called k robust immune if the algebraic immunity of f is always not less than k no matter how one changes the value of f (x) for k <= |x| = n - k. For any field F, any integers n, k >= 0, we characterize all k robust immune symmetric boolean functions in n variables. The proof is based on a known symmetrization technique and constructing a partition of nonnegative integers satisfying certain (in) equalities about p-adic distance, where p is the characteristic of the field F.", "paper_title": "Characterization of robust immune symmetric boolean functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000358873600002"}
