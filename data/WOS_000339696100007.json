The proposed method uses hierarchical and parameterizable models requiring minimal amount of information about the implementation technology to meet this goal. The modeling process flow is to: (1) create a block diagram of the design, (2) create a model for each block, and (3) sum up estimates of all sub-blocks by supplying the correct parameters to each sub-model. We discuss the model creation for a few parameterized library blocks as well as three communication blocks and a processor core from real IC projects ranging from 22 to 250 kgates. The average relative estimation error of the proposed method for the library blocks is 3.2% and for the real world examples 4.0%. The best application of this method is early in the design phase when different implementation architectures are compared. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
