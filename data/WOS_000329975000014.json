This fact is motivated by the reason that graphs are general structures able to encode both topological and semantic information in data. While the data modeling properties of graphs are of indisputable power, there are still different concerns about the best way to compute similarity functions in an effective and efficient manner. To this end, suited transformation procedures are usually conceived to address the well-known Inexact Graph Matching problem in an explicit embedding space. In this paper, we propose two graph embedding algorithms based on the Granular Computing paradigm, which are engineered as key procedures of a general-purpose graph classification system. Tests have been conducted on benchmarking datasets relying on both synthetic and real-world data, achieving competitive results in terms of test set classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "A Granular Computing approach to the design of optimized graph classification systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329975000014"}
