Thomas has proposed that the occurrence of a positive regulatory circuit is a necessary condition for the existence of multiple stable states, whereas a negative circuit is necessary to generate stable oscillations. Here, we formulate and prove a theorem establishing these rules in a multilevel discrete framework.", "paper_title": "Positive or negative regulatory circuit inference from multilevel dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400034"}
