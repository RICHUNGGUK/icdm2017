The control objective is satisfied under uncertainties in the force deformation model and disturbances acting at the joints. The unknown nonlinearities that arise owing to the uncertainties in the force deformation model are approximated by a neural network linear in the weights and it is proven that the neural network approximation holds for all time irrespective of the magnitude of the modeling error, the disturbances, and the controller gains. Thus, the controller gains are easily selected, and potentially large neural network approximation errors as well as disturbances can be tolerated. Simulation results on a 6-DOF robot confirm the theoretical findings.", "paper_title": "Neuro-Adaptive Force/Position Control With Prescribed Performance and Guaranteed Contact Maintenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000285053800001"}
