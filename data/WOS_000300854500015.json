By employing the information of probabilistic distribution of networked-induced time-varying delay, nonlinear constraint and the FD filter, nonlinear stochastic delay system model is established. Based on the obtained nonlinear model, utilising FD filter as residual generator, FD of nonlinear NCSs is formulated as nonlinear H-infinity-filtering problem. Especially, the stochastic stability and prescribed H-infinity attenuation level are achieved using the Lyapunov functional approach, the desired FD filter is constructed in terms of certain linear matrix inequalities, which depends on not only nonlinear level but also on delay-interval and delay-interval-occurrence-rate. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Fault detection for nonlinear networked control systems with stochastic interval delay characterisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000300854500015"}
