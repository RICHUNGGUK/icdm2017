Compared with the two given sequence sets, the resultant sequence set not only has larger family size and longer period, but also provides more flexible choices of basic sequences, ZCZ length and family size.", "paper_title": "A General Construction of ZCZ Sequence Set with Large Family Size and Long Period", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300047"}
