Building on prior work on the three constructs (i.e. satisfaction, loyalty and attachment) in both marketing and IS use research, this study makes two key contributions. First, this study conceptually differentiates the three constructs by articulating their distinct properties. Second, based on the conceptual differences identified, this study finds that the three constructs have a differential impact on contributory behaviours with varying levels of behavioural difficulty. The results of the study also offer other important managerial and further research implications.", "paper_title": "Information systems satisfaction, loyalty and attachment: conceptual and empirical differentiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000348571000005"}
