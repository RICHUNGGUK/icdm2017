In this article, we show that an Information Production Process (IPP), traditionally characterized by Lotkaian distributions, can be fruitfully studied using the effort function, a concept introduced in an earlier article to define an Exponential Informetric Process. We thus propose replacing the concept of Lotkaian distribution by the logarithmic effort function. In particular, we show that an effort function defines an Exponential Informetric Process if its asymptotic behavior is equivalent to the logarithmic function beta(.)Log(x) with beta > 1, which is the effort function of a Lotkaian distribution.
