Servicing such data as images to the end-user in a traditional manner and formats is likely going to encounter significant performance fallbacks. We discuss the requirements for extremely large SIDCs, and in this light we analyse the applicability of the approach taken in the JPEG2000 (ISO/IEC 15444) standards. We argue the case for the adaptation of contemporary industry standards and technologies versus the modification of legacy astronomy standards or development of new standards specific to astronomy only.
