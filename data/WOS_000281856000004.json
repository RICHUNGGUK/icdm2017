This paper reviews relevant research work and presents the framework and methods of this approach. To overcome the limitations of these works in structuring argument for effective collaborative negotiation, our approach synthesises a value-focused objective hierarchy with the generic argument structure to specify how the arguments can be generated based on stakeholders' proposals, objectives, criteria and preferences, and then exchanged amongst multiple stakeholders. This synthesis framework also helps us suggest operational methods to evaluate the arguments based on the level of the objectives achievement. In addition, this paper describes a prototype system which implements our approach using the advanced web-based software technologies with the goal of demonstrating how to systematically carry out effective collaborative negotiation of group decisions in manufacturing systems integration.", "paper_title": "Structure arguments for collaborative negotiation of group decisions in manufacturing systems integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000281856000004"}
