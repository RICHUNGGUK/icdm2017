But they are almost taking the place of the traditional phones. It is because of the Speedy development of mobile and wireless communication technologies. Nowadays, the mobile station plays an important role in most people's daily life. Furthermore, the explosion of the Internet has led to an electronic commerce environment such that people can conduct most transactions electronically. To improve the convenience and portability of electronic commerce, the mobile commerce system is proposed. In 2003, Lam et al. proposed a lightweight security mechanism for mobile commerce. Unfortunately, we find that there exists a security weakness in their method. Hence, we provide improvements on their proposed authentication protocol to Make it secure. Besides, we propose a new authentication protocol for the mobile commerce transactions without adopting the public key cryptosystem.", "paper_title": "Secure authentication protocols for mobile commerce transactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300017"}
