So it usually used the item difficulty of item analysis method. But item guessing factor in learning results has to be considered to apply the relative item difficulty more precisely. So, for e-Learning system support to learner considering learning grade, it need item revision difficulty which considered item guessing factor. In this paper, I designed and embodied the learner's tailoring e-learning system on the item revision difficulty. For an efficient design, I use PetriNet and UML modeling. In building this system, I am able to support a variety of learning step choice to learners so that the learner can work in a flexible learning environment.", "paper_title": "Learner's tailoring e-Learning system on the item revision difficulty using PetriNet", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900035"}
