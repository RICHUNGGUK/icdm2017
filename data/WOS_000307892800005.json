In this channel, the transmitter sends a common message to both the legitimate user and the eavesdropper. In addition to this common message, the legitimate user receives a private message, which is desired to be kept hidden as much as possible from the eavesdropper. We obtain the entire capacity-equivocation region of the Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel. This region contains all achievable common message, private message, and private message's equivocation (secrecy) rates. In particular, we show the sufficiency of jointly Gaussian auxiliary random variables and channel input to evaluate the existing single-letter description of the capacity-equivocation region due to Csiszar-Korner.", "paper_title": "Capacity-Equivocation Region of the Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000307892800005"}
