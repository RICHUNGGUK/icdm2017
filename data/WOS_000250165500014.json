The second phase, the computation of non-extreme solutions, can be based on a \"k-best\" algorithm for the single-objective version of the problem or on the branch-and-bound method. A k-best algorithm computes the k-best solutions in order of their objective values. We compare the performance of these two approaches applied to the biobjective minimum spanning tree problem. Our extensive computational experiments indicate the overwhelming superiority of the k-best approach. We propose heuristic enhancements to this approach which further improve its performance.
