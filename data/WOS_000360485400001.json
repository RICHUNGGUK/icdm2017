Therefore, the sensor nodes are vulnerable to failure and malicious attacks. The failed nodes have a heavily negative impact on WSNs' real-time services. Therefore, we propose a task allocation algorithm based on score incentive mechanism (TASIM) for WSNs. In TASIM, the score is proposed to reward or punish sensor nodes' task execution in cluster-based WSNs, where cluster heads are responsible for task allocation and scores' calculation. Based on the task scores, cluster members can collaborate with each other to complete complex tasks. In addition, the uncompleted tasks on failed nodes can be timely migrated to other cluster members for further execution. Furthermore, the uncompleted tasks on death nodes can be reallocated by cluster heads. Simulation results demonstrate that TASIM is quite suitable for real-time task allocation. In addition, the performance of the TASIM is clearly better than that of conventional task allocation algorithms in terms of both network load balance and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "A Task Allocation Algorithm Based on Score Incentive Mechanism for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360485400001"}
