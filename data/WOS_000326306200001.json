We extend it to a two-stage architecture consisting of an initial voting amongst one-versus-all classifiers or single-class recognizers, and a second stage of one-versus-one classifiers or two-class discriminators used for disambiguation. Since our method constructs an ensemble of elementary classifiers, it lends itself very well to parallelization. We describe a static work-load balancing strategy for embarrassingly parallel classifier construction as well as a parallelization of the classification process with the message passing interface. In our experiments, which are evaluated in terms of classification performance and speed-up, we obtained an up to three-fold increase in precision and significantly increased recall values.", "paper_title": "PARALLEL CLASSIFICATION WITH TWO-STAGE BAGGING CLASSIFIERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000326306200001"}
