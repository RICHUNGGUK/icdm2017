While these algorithms are widely used in both industry and academia owing to their simplicity and acceptable level of accuracy, they require a considerable amount of time in finding top-k similar neighbors (items or users) to predict user preferences of unrated items. In this paper, we present Reversed CF (RCF), a rapid CF algorithm which utilizes a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph. One main idea of this approach is to reverse the process of finding k neighbors; instead of finding k similar neighbors of unrated items. RCF finds the k-nearest neighbors of rated items. Not only does this algorithm perform fewer predictions while filtering out inaccurate results, but it also enables the use of fast k-NN graph construction algorithms. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional user-based/item-based CF algorithms in terms of both preprocessing time and query processing time without sacrificing the level of accuracy.
