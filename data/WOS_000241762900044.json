His works, such as The Gates of Hell, The Thinker, and The Burghers of Calais, are famous worldwide. To our knowledge, no art historians have analyzed three-dimensional data of Rodin's work. This paper describes our project to fill this need by digitally archiving the bronze statue, The Burghers of Calais. First, we scanned the geometrical shape of the sculpture by using a laser range sensor. After that, we analyzed the resulting three-dimensional data using expert knowledge in the field of art history and technology developed in the fields of computer vision and graphics.", "paper_title": "3D digital archive of The Burghers of Calais", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900044"}
