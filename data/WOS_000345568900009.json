We propose a novel logic-level leakage estimation model based on the characterization of voltages at the internal nodes of digital cells, in conjunction with the characterization of leakage currents in a single field-effect transistor (FET) device and with the input-dependent Kirchhoff current law expression of the total current in the cell topology. The voltage-based nature of the approach simplifies the inclusion of supply voltage variation/scaling impact, as well as of output voltage drop (loading effect), on leakage currents. The method has been implemented in hardware description language models of a complete cell library. Exhaustive tests report average accuracy below 1% error in 22-nm CMOS and 20-nm FinFET technologies, when compared with SPICE BSIM simulation results.", "paper_title": "A Voltage-Based Leakage Current Calculation Scheme and its Application to Nanoscale MOSFET and FinFET Standard-Cell Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000345568900009"}
