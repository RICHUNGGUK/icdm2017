It is hence desirable to display personalized information about the package. Though popular in web-based applications, personalization as a field of research in the design of generalized software packages is rare. This article develops a semi-Markov model of user navigation and an adaptive dynamic programming formulation to select high-utility software functions (states) for dynamically displaying them to a user. The personalization algorithm considers the interests of the software designers, the past users, and the current user. Frequency of visit to a state and the holding time in the state together determines the utility of the state. The personalization algorithm considers the interests of the software designers, the past users, and the current user. The algorithm is built in a demo package of ActiveX Servers and Controls. Graduate students tested the package. Pareto analysis and tests of hypothesis conducted on the test results indicate that the users did utilize the information on the displayed personalized software functions.", "paper_title": "DYNAMIC DISPLAY OF PERSONALIZED SOFTWARE FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000303887700003"}
