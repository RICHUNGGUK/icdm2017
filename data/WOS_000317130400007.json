For any constant alpha > 0, we give an optimal answer in the following sense: let reg(even)(n, delta) denote the degree of the largest even-regular spanning subgraph one can guarantee in a graph on n vertices with minimum degree delta. Then the number of edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles we find equals reg(even)(n, delta)/2. The value of reg(even)(n, delta) is known for infinitely many values of n and delta. We also extend our results to graphs G of minimum degree delta >= n/2, unless G is close to the extremal constructions for Dirac's theorem. Our proof relies on a recent and very general result of Kuhn and Osthus on Hamilton decomposition of robustly expanding regular graphs.", "paper_title": "Optimal Packings of Hamilton Cycles in Graphs of High Minimum Degree", "paper_id": "WOS:000317130400007"}
