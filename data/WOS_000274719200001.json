In this paper, we present a scalable framework that accurately selects textured objects with only moderate user interaction. Our method applies the active learning methodology, and the user only needs to label minimal initial training data and subsequent query data. An active learning algorithm uses these labeled data to obtain an initial classifier and iteratively improves it until its performance becomes satisfactory. A revised graph-cut algorithm based on the trained classifier has also been developed to improve the spatial coherence of selected texture regions. We show that our system is responsive even with videos of a large number of frames, and it frees the user from extensive labeling work. A variety of operations, such as color editing, compositing, and texture cloning, can be then applied to the selected textures to achieve interesting editing effects.", "paper_title": "Lazy texture selection based on active learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000274719200001"}
