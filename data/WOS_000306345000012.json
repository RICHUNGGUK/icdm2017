Current image annotation models almost used all the training images to estimate joint generation probabilities between images and keywords, which would inevitably bring a lot of irrelevant images. To solve the above problem, we propose a hierarchical image annotation model which combines advantages of discriminative model and generative model. In first annotation layer, discriminative model is used to assign topic annotations to unlabeled images, and then relevant image set corresponding to each unlabeled image is obtained. In second annotation layer, we propose a keywords-oriented method to establish links between images and keywords, and then our iterative algorithm is used to expand relevant image sets. Candidate labels will be given higher weights by using our method based on visual keywords. Finally, generative model is used to assign detailed annotations to unlabeled images on expanded relevant image sets. Experiments conducted on Corel 5K datasets verify the effectiveness of our hierarchical image annotation model.", "paper_title": "A two-level model for automatic image annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306345000012"}
