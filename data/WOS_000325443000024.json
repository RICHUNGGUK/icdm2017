[11] recently presented a novel self-assembly strategy for polypeptide nanostructure design that could lead to significant developments in biotechnology. In the present paper, the underlying mathematical model is developed. A construction of a polypeptide polyhedron is modelled with a stable trace in the corresponding graph of the polyhedra. Here a stable trace is a double trace with two additional conditions having no retracing and no repetition through any vertex. It is proved that the graphs that admit stable traces are precisely graphs with minimum degree 3. Parallel and antiparallel double traces are also introduced and studied. Computational results for several polyhedra are presented.", "paper_title": "Stable Traces as a Model for Self-Assembly of Polypeptide Nanoscale Polyhedrons", "paper_id": "WOS:000325443000024"}
