This new approach can also provide very tight upper and lower bounds (in closed form) for the exact first passage time density in a systematic manner. Unlike previous approximate analytical attempts, this novel approximation scheme not only goes beyond the linear response and weak noise limit, but it can also be systematically improved to yield the exact results. Furthermore, it is straightforward to extend our approach to study the more general case of a deterministically modulated boundary.", "paper_title": "First passage time problem for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck neuronal model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100037"}
