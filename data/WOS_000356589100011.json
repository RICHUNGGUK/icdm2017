We implemented hardware pipelines specialized for the FMM on an FPGA device, the GRAPE-9. An N-body simulation with 1.6 x 10(7) particles ran 16 times faster than that on a CPU. Moreover the particle-to-particle stage of the FMM on the GRAPE-9 executed 2.5 times faster than on a GPU in a limited case.", "paper_title": "Acceleration of the Fast Multipole Method on FPGA Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589100011"}
