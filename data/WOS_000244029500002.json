Typical for these applications is that neither the resource requirements nor the arrival rates of service requests are known or available a priori. It has been shown that feedback control is very effective to support the specified performance of dynamic systems that are both resource insufficient and exhibit unpredictable workloads. To efficiently use feedback control scheduling it is necessary to have a model that adequately describes the behavior of the system. In this paper we experimentally evaluate the accuracy of four linear time-invariant models used in the design of feedback controllers. We introduce a model (DYN) that captures additional system dynamics, which a previously published model (STA) fails to include. The accuracy of the models are evaluated by validating the models with regard to measured data from the controlled system and through a set of experiments where we evaluate the performance of a set of feedback control schedulers tuned using these models. From our evaluations we conclude that second order models (e.g., DYN) are more accurate than first order models (e.g. STA). Further we show that controllers tuned using second order models perform better than controllers tuned using first order models.", "paper_title": "Experimental evaluation of linear time-invariant models for feedback performance control in real-time systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244029500002"}
