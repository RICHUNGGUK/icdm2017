We use and compare different mapping strategies based on Ungerboeck partitioning (UP), block partitioning (BP), mixed partitioning (MP), Gray partitioning (GP), and Ungerboeck-Gray partitioning (UGP) of the siginal constellation of the turbo TCM system. Furthermore, taking 8PSK modulation of turbo TCM as an example, our simulation results show that turbo TCM with UP can obtain better performance than turbo TCM with BP, MP, GP, and UGP in both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive analysis of turbo TCM over two typical channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000245493000002"}
