This makes it possible to predict the correctness and performance of proposed new technology before deploying to Internet. In this paper we present a methodology for evaluating the correctness and performance of applications based on the PARNEM, a parallel discrete event network emulator. PARNEM employs a BSP based real-time event scheduling engine, provides flexible interactive mechanism and facilitates legacy network models reuse. PARNEM allows detailed and accurate study of application behavior. Comprehensive case studies covering bottleneck bandwidth measurement and distributed cooperative web caching system demonstrate that network emulation technology opens a wide range of new opportunities for examining the behavior of applications.", "paper_title": "A parallel network emulation method for evaluating the correctness and performance of applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000242877700010"}
