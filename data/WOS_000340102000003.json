The aim of this paper is to extend one and more than one-way analysis of variance to those situations and show how to compute correct critical values. The interest of this approach lies in avoiding false rejections obtained when using the classical fixed size F-tests. Sample sizes are assumed as random and we then proceed with the application of this approach to a database on cancer.", "paper_title": "Fixed effects ANOVA: an extension to samples with random size", "paper_id": "WOS:000340102000003"}
