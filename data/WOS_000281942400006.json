The decision problem whether such a mapping exists is called the k-ROLE ASSIGNMENT problem. This problem is known to be NP-complete for any fixed k >= 2. In this paper, we classify the computational complexity of the k-ROLE ASSIGNMENT problem for the class of chordal graphs. We show that for this class the problem can be solved in linear time for k = 2, but remains NP-complete for any k >= 3. This generalizes earlier results by Sheng and answers her open problem.
