We introduce two concepts Potential-Optimal Price of Anarchy (POPoA) and Potential-Optimal Price of Stability (POPoS), where POPoA is the ratio between the worst cost of Nash equilibrium with optimal potential and the minimum social cost, and POPoS is the ratio between the best cost of Nash equilibrium with optimal potential and the minimum social cost, and show the following. The POPoA and POPoS for undirected broadcast games with n players are O(root log n). The POPoA and POPoS for undirected broadcast games with vertical bar V vertical bar vertices are O(log vertical bar V vertical bar). There exists an undirected broadcast game with n players such that POPoA, POPoS = Omega(root log log n). There exists an undirected broadcast game with vertical bar V vertical bar vertices such that POPoA, POPoS = Omega(log vertical bar V vertical bar). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
