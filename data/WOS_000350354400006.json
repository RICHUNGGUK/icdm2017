They have attracted significant attention since the sixties, when Wegner conjectured that the duality gap, equal to the ratio between the size of and the size of , is always bounded by a universal constant. An interesting case is when there exists a diagonal line that intersects each of the given rectangles. Indeed, Chepoi and Felsner recently gave a 6-approximation algorithm for in this setting, and showed that the duality gap is between 3/2 and 6. We consider the same setting and improve upon these results. First, we derive an -time algorithm for the when, in addition, every pair of intersecting rectangles have a common point below the diagonal. This improves and extends a classic result of Lubiw, and gives a 2-approximation algorithm for . Second, we show that is NP-hard. Finally, we prove that the duality gap is between 2 and 4. The upper bound, which implies a 4-approximation algorithm for , follows from simple combinatorial arguments, whereas the lower bound represents the best known lower bound on the duality gap, even in the general setting of the rectangles.", "paper_title": "Independent and Hitting Sets of Rectangles Intersecting a Diagonal Line: Algorithms and Complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000350354400006"}
