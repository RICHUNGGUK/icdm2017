The update is then performed according to how well the current model retrospectively predicts the value of the objective function at last iterate. Global convergence to first- and second-order critical points is proved under classical assumptions and preliminary numerical experiments on CUTEr problems indicate that the new method is very competitive.", "paper_title": "A retrospective trust-region method for unconstrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000275161200006"}
