Our approach is based on different qualities of the Delaunay triangles inside and outside the domain. This method is heuristic and does not ensure success in all cases but it is very simple and there is no other method for this problem known to us. The method was derived on real GIS data but experiments show that it could also be used for mechanical engineering data, with positive results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
