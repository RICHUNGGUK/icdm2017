One-sided solutions do not prove to work; they make us think of systems and cybernetics. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative research with application to real-life cases. Findings - While cybernetics is about steering, i.e. influencing, cybernetics of the 1st and 2nd order might be insufficient for solving the problem, and cybernetics of the 3rd order might serve us better, but not enough either. The authors' thesis reads: they might better be put in a new synergy with the (Universal) Dialectical Systems Theory and Cybernetics of Conceptual Systems to make a new kind of systems theory/cybernetics called cybernetics of the 4th order. It should help human beings to attain the requisite holism of the human approach and the requisite wholeness of outcomes of human action. Research limitations/implications - A more holistic concept of cybernetics is suggested. Practical implications - Control of ecological problems of today might be made easier. Originality/value This is the first publication about the concept of the 4th order cybernetics, especially with application to issues of sustainability.", "paper_title": "A new-4th order cybernetics and sustainable future", "paper_id": "WOS:000294884200003"}
