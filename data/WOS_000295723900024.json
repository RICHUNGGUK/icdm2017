The regenerative heat transfer in the kiln wall is described by a new mixed numerical/analytical approach. The model is validated by means of a dynamic test case representing a 15-day period of plant operation. The required process data are captured within a measurement campaign on a kiln run by TRONOX Pigments GmbH, Krefeld-Uerdingen, Germany. The predictive accuracy of the model is estimated by means of a sensitivity analysis considering uncertainties of model parameters and measured input values. The actual agreement between simulation and measurement results is significantly better than indicated by the sensitivity analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
