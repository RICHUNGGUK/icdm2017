The Mahalanobis metric equation is a nonlinear second order differential equation derived from the geometrically local isotropic independence equation, which was proposed to define normal distributions in a manifold. We explain the equations and show experimental results of calculating the Mahalanobis metric by the Newton-Raphson method. We add error to an original probability density function and calculate the Mahalanobis metric to investigate the effect on the solution of error in a probability density function.
