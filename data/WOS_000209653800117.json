They offer promising opportunities in terms of system performance, but they pose unique challenges in terms of source and system technologies. Several academic and industrial teams have proposed a variety of concepts and developed some unique prototypes. We present a broad review of multisource systems. We also discuss X-ray source components and challenges. We close with our perspective on the future prospects of multisource imaging.", "paper_title": "Multisource X-Ray and CT: Lessons Learned and Future Outlook", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800117"}
