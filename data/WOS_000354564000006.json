This enrichment is usually achieved by creating links between datasets using the interlinking tools, which facilitate connecting any kind of data in a semi-automatic manner. This paper evaluates the interlinking results between an e-learning repository and several educational datasets on the Web of Data, which leads to enrichment of the contents. Many related resources were discovered during this experimentation already matched to the GLOBE learning objects. Furthermore, this research presents a data model to find similarity between two datasets and a workflow to identify the duplicate resources by performing a semi-automatic evaluation process. A case study was also assessed by human experts.", "paper_title": "Discovering duplicate and related resources using an interlinking approach: The case of educational datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000354564000006"}
