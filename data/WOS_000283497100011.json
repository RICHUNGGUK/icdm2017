The communication is based on a protocol which makes use of disjoint function decomposition and more precisely of minimal ESCT (Exclusive-or Sum of Complex Terms) expressions in order to perform a secure computation. The complexity of this protocol is directly proportional to the size of the ESCT expression in use, which is much smaller in comparison to other proposed minimal models (e. g., ESOP). Moreover, quantum algorithms are discussed that provide significant speedup to the process of producing the ESCT expressions, when compared to conventional ones. Hence, this paper provides a very useful application of the ESCT expressions in the field of cryptographic protocols.", "paper_title": "USING SIMPLE DISJOINT DECOMPOSITION TO PERFORM SECURE COMPUTATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283497100011"}
