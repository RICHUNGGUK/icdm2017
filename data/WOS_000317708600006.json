The objective of this study is to design and fabricate the twin thermoacoustic heat engine (TAHE) producing the acoustic waves with high resonance frequencies which is used to drive a thermoacoustic refrigerator efficiently by the influence of geometrical parameters and working fluids. Twin TAHE has gained significant attention due to the production of high intensity acoustic waves than single TAHE. In order to drive an efficient thermoacoustic refrigerator, a twin thermoacoustic heat engine is built up and its performance are analysed by varying the resonator length and working fluid. The performance is measured in terms of onset temperature difference, resonance frequency and pressure amplitude of the oscillations generated from twin TAHE. The simulation is performed using free software DeltaEC, from LANL, USA. The simulated DeltaEC results are compared with experimental results and the deviations are found within +10%.
