With the 'mechanostat' model of Frost, genetic variations in bone mechanoresponsiveness are modelled by different mechanostat 'setpoints' - which may also change with age or disease. In this paper, the following setpoints are used: epsilon(min) (strain below which resorption is triggered); epsilon(max) (strain above which deposition occurs); omega(crit) (microdamage-level above which damage-stimulated resorption occurs). To simulate decreased mechanosensitivity, epsilon(max) is increased. Analyses carried out on a simplified model of a trabecula show that epsilon(max) is a critical parameter: if it is higher in an individual (genetics) or increases (with age) the mass deficit each remodelling cycle increases. Furthermore, there is a value of epsilon(max) above which trabecular perforation occurs, leading to rapid loss of bone mass. Maintaining bone cell mechanosensitivity could therefore be a therapeutic target for the prevention of osteoporosis.", "paper_title": "An algorithm for bone mechanoresponsiveness: implementation to study the effect of patient-specific cell mechanosensitivity on trabecular bone loss", "paper_id": "WOS:000260457900003"}
