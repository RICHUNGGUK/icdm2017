The ConceptNet was automatically disambiguated through Normalized Google Distance (NGD) similarity. In this letter, we present several techniques to enhance the performance of the Concept Net disambiguation and use this enriched semantic knowledge in WSD task. We propose to enrich both the Word Net semantic knowledge and NOD to disambiguate the concepts in Concept Net. Furthermore, we apply the enriched semantic knowledge to improve the performance of WSD. From a number of experiments, the proposed method has been obtained enhanced results.", "paper_title": "Enriching Semantic Knowledge for WSD", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784500038"}
