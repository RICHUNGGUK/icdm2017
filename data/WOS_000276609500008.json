However, RDF often consists of high level of lead. To reduce lead emission during combustion, understanding of lead behaviors in flames is required. In this study, we have applied planar laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy to detect lead not only in a non-luminous methane-air flame, but also in a luminous RDF flame. In a methane-air flame, the number density of Pb atoms does not depend on the flame temperature, but also on the combustion environments. In RDF flames, because of acceleration of oxidizing process of Pb, Pb fluorescence profile obtained at 25% O(2) became weaker than that at 20% O(2).", "paper_title": "Measurement of two-dimensional distribution profile of lead in a flame by planar laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000276609500008"}
