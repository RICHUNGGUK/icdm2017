The proposed algorithm consists of three steps: 1) calculating the gradients of three directions (45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 135 degrees) in the local working window; 2) achieving the weights of the neighboring pixels by exploiting the edge information in the pixel gradients; 3) interpolating the missing pixel using the proposed EDWF interpolator. Compared with existing deinterlacing methods on different images and video sequences, the proposed algorithm improves the peak signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) while achieving better subjective quality.", "paper_title": "An Edge Dependent Weighted Filter for Video Deinterlacing", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400046"}
