The algorithm uses a fixed computational domain with flow domain immersed inside the computational domain. Boundary conditions along the edges of the time-dependent flow domain enter the algorithm in the form of internal constraints. Spectral spatial discretization uses Fourier expansions in the stream-wise direction and Chebyshev expansions in the normal-to-the-wall direction. Up to fourth-order implicit temporal discretization methods have been implemented. It has been demonstrated that the algorithm delivers the theoretically predicted accuracy in both time and space. Performances of various linear solvers employed in the solution process have been evaluated and a new class of solver that takes advantage of the structure of the coefficient matrix has been proposed. The new solver results in a significant acceleration of computations as well as in a substantial reduction in memory requirements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
