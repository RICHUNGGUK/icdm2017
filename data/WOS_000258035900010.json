ACRT creates clusters adaptively by real-time apperceiving network scale which can solve the conflict between the expansibility of flat routing protocols and clustering overhead of clustering routing protocols. This mechanism takes the compatibility among different routing mechanisms into account to obtain high routing efficiency. ACRT can eliminate hangovers of flat routing protocol to reduce the occupancy of resources and storage cost by strict transition strategy. Simulation results show that ACRT has good expansibility and adaptive control action. ACRT is a correct and efficient routing mechanism. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
