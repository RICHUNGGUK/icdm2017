In this paper, we use the Fuzzy Min Max technique to boost the performances of the training algorithm. This technique is used to determine the number of the k centers and to initialize correctly these k centers. The k-means algorithm always converges to the same result for all the tests.", "paper_title": "Boosting the Performances of the Recurrent Neural Network by the Fuzzy Min-Max", "paper_id": "WOS:000277059100006"}
