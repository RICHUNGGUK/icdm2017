In the proposed scheme, the cloud verifies the authenticity of the series without knowing the user's identity before storing data. Our scheme also has the added feature of access control in which only valid users are able to decrypt the stored information. The scheme prevents replay attacks and supports creation, modification, and reading data stored in the cloud. We also address user revocation. Moreover, our authentication and access control scheme is decentralized and robust, unlike other access control schemes designed for clouds which are centralized. The communication, computation, and storage overheads are comparable to centralized approaches.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Access Control with Anonymous Authentication of Data Stored in Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000329051500012"}
