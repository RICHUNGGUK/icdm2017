These data comprise flow characteristics as well as the sedimentation trajectory and velocity of the sphere. It was found that the methods are capable of accurately describing the experimentally obtained data and show stable behaviour, even for solid-to-fluid density ratios close to one. Moreover, the proposed no-slip boundary methods produce more accurate results than the adaptive forcing technique. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
