In this paper, we introduce so-called multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) queues, connecting N(P) producers with N(C) consumers, that are symmetric, scalable, and have a high throughput. MIMO queues can be used to perform fine-grained load balancing and are proposed as key building blocks for variation-tolerant architectures. We present and analyze a family of asynchronous MIMO queues.", "paper_title": "Scalable Multi-Input-Multi-Output Queues With Application to Variation-Tolerant Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000267764900007"}
