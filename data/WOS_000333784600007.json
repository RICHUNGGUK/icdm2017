This raises the issue of possible effects this coexistence might have on the performance of these networks. Negative effects are a consequence of contention for network resources (such as free wireless communication frequencies) between different devices, which can be avoided if co-located networks cooperate with each other and share the available resources. This paper presents a self-learning, cognitive cooperation approach for heterogeneous co-located networks. Cooperation is performed by activating or deactivating services such as interference avoidance, packet sharing, various MAC protocols, etc. Activation of a cooperative service might have both positive and negative effects on a network's performance, regarding its high level goals. Such a cooperation approach has to incorporate a reasoning mechanism, centralized or distributed, capable of determining the influence of each symbiotic service on the performance of all the participating sub-networks, taking into consideration their requirements. In this paper, a cooperation method incorporating a machine learning technique, known as the Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI), is proposed and discussed as a novel network cooperation paradigm.
