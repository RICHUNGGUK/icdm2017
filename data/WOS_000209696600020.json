Matlab simulation was employed to support the experimental work and to generate the holographic masks used. Matlab coding is a unique approach which can produce any desired shape on copper or dielectric plates by mean of a commercial routing tool. We believe this is the first reported transmission of 4-Gbps uncompressed video over the 60-GHz OAM wireless channel. Good agreement was achieved between the simulated and measured results. Practical opportunities for multi-gigabit future wireless communications are available.", "paper_title": "4-Gbps Uncompressed Video Transmission over a 60-GHz Orbital Angular Momentum Wireless Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696600020"}
