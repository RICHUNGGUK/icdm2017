The sequence of updates, built using our strategy, is free from redundancies in update operations and produces a near minimal increase in table size. We prove the existence of a consistent update sequence for any given rule table and a cluster of updates. Our experiments validate our methodology and demonstrate a minimal increase in intermediate table size as a cluster of updates is applied.", "paper_title": "Consistent Updates for Packet Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000307119200006"}
