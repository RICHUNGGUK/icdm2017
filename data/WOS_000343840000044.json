It is proposed to use the Laplace transform instead of ordinary weights and a linear activation function of an artificial neuron. This extension allows to use artificial neural networks in new areas. The ordinary description of artificial neural networks is a special case of the description proposed in this paper. Three models of different geological structures based on the LTANN are discussed in this paper. Using these models, it is possible to classify an unknown geological structure as the structure without anomaly, the structure with a sinkhole or the structure with a loose zone.
