The effect of C-60 buffer layer on the performance of the devices was investigated by inserting C-60 buffer layer at the interface between the electrode and organic layers. The device Structures were (1) ITO/C-60 (0.0, 0.4, 0.7 and 1.0 nm)/NPB/Alq3/LiF/Al and (2) ITO/NPB/Alq(3)/C-60 (0.0, 0.4, 0.7 and 1.0 nm)/LiF/Al. The highest brightness and efficiency of the device (1) with 0.7 nm-thick C-60 layer reached 6439 cd/m(2) at 16 V and 1.80 cd/A at 6.4 V, respectively. The enhancements in brightness and efficiency are attributed to an improved balance of hole and electron injections due to C-60 layer blocking parts of the injected holes. On the contrary, the brightness and efficiency of the devices with the Structure (2) had been hardly enhanced.
