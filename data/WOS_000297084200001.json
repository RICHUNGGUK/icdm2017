Considering human auditory cortex has selective attention mechanism, we apply distributed auditory cortex information processing mechanism to energy efficient distributed acoustic sensor network. The Auditory Cortex (AC) is typically defined as that portion of the cortex containing neurons that respond to sound. The distributed AC is a Functional network consisting of neurons with collaborative processing to perform some functions such as selective attention and behavioral inhibition. We show that all the sensed information of each sensor in an acoustic sensor network are self-similar. We propose to use Singular-Value-Decomposition (SVD) with QR to model the collaborative processing of acoustic sensors for selective battery on/off. Examples are given to illustrate the collaborative processing procedure based on the acoustic sensor network data.", "paper_title": "Biologically-Inspired Energy Efficient Distributed Acoustic Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297084200001"}
