It is a non-linear optimization problem with various operational constraints, which includes the constraints of the generators operating characteristics and the system constraints. Its principal aim is to minimize the cost of power production of all the participating generators over a time horizon of 24 h, while satisfying the system constraints. This problem deals with non-convex characteristics if generation unit valve-point effects are taken into account. The paper intends to solve the DED problem with valve-point effects, using our modified form of Localbest variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (Lbest PSO) algorithm. We have tested our algorithm on 5-unit, 10-unit and 110-unit test system with non-smooth fuel cost functions to prove the effectiveness of the suggested method over different state of the art methods.", "paper_title": "Dynamic economic dispatch using Lbest-PSO with dynamically varying sub-swarms", "paper_id": "WOS:000343289900003"}
