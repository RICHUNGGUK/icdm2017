We then use this formalisation to bring together synchronous and asynchronous interactions within the same modelling approach. We see this effort as a first step towards a form of engineering of architectural styles. Our approach adopts transition systems extended with events as a mathematical model of implicit invocation, and a family of logics that support abstract levels of modelling.", "paper_title": "An algebraic semantics of event-based architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000251864200004"}
