We focus on a known research problem particularly in Ambient Networks (ANs), where heterogeneous Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) contained in these wireless networks need to merge or divide as a result of these dynamic (de)composition processes, respectively. We present two novel DHT (de)composition models for ANs, known as absorption and gatewaying, that are designed to handle (de)composition of DHTs in different AN network environments, with minimal disturbance to existing member nodes.", "paper_title": "Towards distributed hash tables (De)composition in ambient networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242406000024"}
