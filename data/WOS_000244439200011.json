The key motivation is to learn the most discriminative regions of a human face and the features in there for person identification, instead of assuming a priori any regions of saliency. We use the subset selection-based formulation and compare three variants of feature selection and genetic algorithms for this purpose. Experiments on frontal face images taken from the FERET dataset confirm the advantage of the proposed approach in terms of high accuracy and significantly reduced dimensionality.
