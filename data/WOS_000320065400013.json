Result: Through examining the connections of RNA epigenome sequencing data with two well-studied data types, ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, we unveiled the salient characteristics of this new data type. The computational strategies were discussed accordingly, and a novel data processing pipeline was proposed that combines several existing tools with a newly developed exome-based approach 'exomePeak' for detecting, representing and visualizing the post-transcriptional RNA modification sites on the transcriptome.", "paper_title": "Exome-based analysis for RNA epigenome sequencing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000320065400013"}
