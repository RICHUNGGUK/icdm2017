For the given stabilization strength, a new switching protocol is designed to stabilize the system with a fast speed. The obtained protocol covers both continuous control and discontinuous one under the framework of Filippov solutions. Some criteria are discussed in detail on how to choose an optimal protocol such that the finite stabilization time can be shortened. Finally, the main theory results are applied to the general neural networks by one numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
