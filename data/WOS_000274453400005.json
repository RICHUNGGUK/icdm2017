The resulting optimal control law is applied to seismically excited linear buildings modeled as lumped mass shear frame structures. Active tendon actuators are considered as control devices. The performance of the proposed control (PC) is investigated when the example structure is subjected to three different seismic inputs and compared to the uncontrolled case and the classical linear optimal control (CLOC), which requires the solution of nonlinear matrix Riccati equation. It is shown by numerical simulation results that the PC is capable of suppressing the uncontrolled seismic vibrations of the linear structures and performs better than the CLOC.", "paper_title": "A Simple Active Control Algorithm for Earthquake Excited Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000274453400005"}
