We propose the use such a logic in studying immune system. A relational system is developed as a semantic of this logic. The relational systems represent the immune system which in its turn is a part of relational biology.", "paper_title": "Multimodal epistemic Aukasiewicz logics with application in immune system", "paper_id": "WOS:000361738400021"}
