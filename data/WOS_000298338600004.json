This paper proposes a novel agent-assisted QoS-based routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks. In the proposed algorithm, the synthetic QoS of WSNs is chosen as the adaptive value of a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to improve the overall performance of network. Intelligent software agents are used to monitor changes in network topology, network communication flow, and each node's routing state. These agents can then participate in network routing and network maintenance. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can ensure better quality of service in wireless sensor networks compared with traditional algorithms.
