In particular, since the case of one rectangular scan has already been treated in a previous paper, we consider two rectangular scans, given as two integer matrices, and we investigate the existence and the possibility of reconstruction of a third binary matrix which is compatible with them. Furthermore, our inspection implies interesting side results about the number of these reconstructed matrices for different choices of the dimensions of two windows used in the input scans.
