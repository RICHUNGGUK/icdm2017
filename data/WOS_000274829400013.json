The platform is the outcome of a research project named FARMA, and is based on the deployment of mobile computing, combined with RFID technology and wireless and mobile networking. The platform apart from using a data repository through which the RFID tag numbers are associated with animal data records. it introduces the use of rewritable tags, for the storage of information that can be used to identify the animal in case it gets lost, or even recognize some basic information about it (e.g. behavior against other animals) without the need of contacting the related database. An implementation in the context of the FARMA project is also given, together with the corresponding details, while the results of the evaluation that took place in the context of the project are discussed.
