Based on the oblique projection, the desired signal subspace and interference-plus-noise subspace are first identified from the received signal. Then the matched filter receiver is used to decode the STBC encoded signals in the desired signal subspace. Simulation results show that the proposed linear receiver obtains significant performance improvement over conventional Capon-type receivers under finite sample-size situations and in the presence of channel estimation errors.", "paper_title": "Robust linear receivers for STBC systems with unknown co-channel interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000266829700016"}
