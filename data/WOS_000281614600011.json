This paper proposes the application of a modified variant, called MQEPS, of the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm based on P systems (QEPS) to the time-frequency atom decomposition for analyzing radar emitter signals. MQEPS is an appropriate combination of P system approaches, quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms and a local search, and is designed by using the hierarchical framework of cell-like P systems, the objects consisting of quantum-inspired bits and classical bits, the rules composed of quantum-inspired gate evolutionary rules and evolution rules in P systems, and tabu search in the skin membrane. Extensive experiments conducted on satisfiability problems and radar emitter signals show the effectiveness and advantages of the presented algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
