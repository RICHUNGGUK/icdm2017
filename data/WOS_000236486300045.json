The equivalence between affine transformation and the source mixture model simplifies the recognition problem. The rotation, scaling, skewing, and translation effects of the affine transformation can be undone by using blind source separation (BSS) techniques to go back to a canonical object view. Then, the problem is reduced from a more involved affine invariant search to a simple shape matching task. Point correspondence between two curves initially related by an affine transformation is obtained with further processing.", "paper_title": "Undoing the affine transformation using blind source separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300045"}
