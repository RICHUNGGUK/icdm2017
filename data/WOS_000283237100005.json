In such a context, the paper presents detailed models of the components and controls forming the thermo-mechanical and electric subsystems of a microturbine power plant. The modeled thermo-mechanical subsystem includes different control loops: a speed controller for primary frequency control (droop control), an acceleration control loop, which limits the rotor acceleration in case of sudden loss of load or in case of start-up, and a controller to limit the temperature of the exhaust gases below the maximum admissible temperature. The modeling of control schemes in the electric subsystem is another key issue of the paper in view of providing efficient energy production from distributed generation: an active power-voltage (PV) control is adopted for the inverter in case of the operation of a microturbine connected to the grid. This control scheme provides an innovative contribution with respect to the usually adopted active power-reactive power (PQ) control scheme. The adoption of the PV control scheme allows to evaluate the contribution of micro-turbines to voltage support in electric distribution grids. In case of isolated operation of the generation source a voltage-frequency (VF) control scheme is proposed. A test grid is set up for model validation and the simulation results are described and discussed.", "paper_title": "Microturbine Control Modeling to Investigate the Effects of Distributed Generation in Electric Energy Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283237100005"}
