Bernardini, M. Gheorghe, Population P systems, Journal of Universal Computer Science 10 (5) (2004) 509-539] by considering bacterium quorum sensing (QS) phenomena as the basis of the new approach. A new computational model called QS P system is introduced. It is proved that QS P systems are able to simulate counter machines, and hence they are equivalent in power to Turing machines. An example of a QS P system modelling the behaviour of Vibrio fischeri bacteria colonies is also presented and the emergence of the QS mechanism is illustrated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
