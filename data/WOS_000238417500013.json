OWL security is a burgeoning and challengeable sub-area of Semantic Web security. We propose a novel approach about OWL security, especially about inference control in OWL retrieval. We define OWL inference control rules (ICRs) to present the aim of inference control. To achieve ICRs. our approach introduces a novel concept \"semantic related view\" (SRView) w.r.t an OWL knowledge base. which describes semantic relations in it. We present a construction process of SRViews from OWL knowledge bases and define pruning operations to rewrite them. Based on pruned SRViews. a query framework to achieve inference control is proposed. followed by analysis of correctness and complexity.", "paper_title": "Secure OWL query", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500013"}
