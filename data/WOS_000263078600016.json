In this paper, we present MceSim, a simulator of MCE systems. MceSim is an open source software available to the public, and it can be used as a common testbed to evaluate different control methods related to NICE systems. MceSim was used in the group controller performance competition: CST Solution Competition 2007. This experience has proven MceSim to be a fully functional testbed for MCE systems.", "paper_title": "MceSim: A Multi-Car Elevator Simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078600016"}
