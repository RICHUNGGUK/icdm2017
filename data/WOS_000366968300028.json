In the face of the large scale deployment requirements of user Ms with various application purposes in the IaaS system, the limited number of VM templates can not support the quickly deploying of all user Ms to be deployed in it. Hence, the optimal caching management of VM template is a challenging work in an IaaS system. In this paper, we propose a mechanism, the Representative Virtual Machine Templates (RMTs), by which the rapid deployments for a large scale of user Ms with different application purposes in an IaaS system can be achieved with limited number of representative virtual machine templates cached, to solve the problem of the optimized caching management of VM templates in an IaaS system. We formulate the finding of RVMTs as an optimization problem with given constraints and introduce the K-medoids Clustering-based RVIVITs finding algorithm to solve it. We also theoretically prove that this algorithm can achieve the optimal result. On the implementation side, we design a TM template caching system, called MTCS, to achieve our VM template caching mechanism based on RVMTs. The simulation experiment results prove the validity of our method.", "paper_title": "Minimizing Average Startup Latency of VMs by an Optimized VM Templates Caching Mechanism Based on K-Medoids Clustering in an IaaS System with Multi-cluster of Servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968300028"}
