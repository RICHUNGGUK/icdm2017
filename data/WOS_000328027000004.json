Recently, a dual-primal algorithm for linear optimization has been proposed by Li [Dual-primal algorithm for linear optimization, Optimiz. Methods Softw. 28 (2013), pp. 327-338]. In the process of implementing the dual-primal algorithms, we found an interesting phenomenon that the phase-1 algorithm developed in [Li (2013)] always terminates in one iteration. This fact does not come by chance. A rigorous proof is given in this paper.", "paper_title": "An interesting characteristic of phase-1 of dual-primal algorithm for linear programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000328027000004"}
