Our existing approach to solve such problems is to build a centralized adaptor which restricts the system's behavior to exhibit only deadlock-free and desired interactions. However, in a distributed environment such an approach is not always suitable. In this paper, we show how to automatically generate a distributed adaptor for a set of black-box components. First, by taking into account a specification of the interaction behavior of each component, we synthesize a behavioral model for a centralized glue adaptor. Second, from the synthesized adaptor model and a specification of the desired behavior that must be enforced, we generate one local adaptor for each component. The local adaptors cooperatively behave as the centralized one restricted with respect to the specified desired interactions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
