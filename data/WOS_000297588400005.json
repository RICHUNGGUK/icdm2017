We present the agents' architecture as well as the team strategies and the coordination and cooperation approaches. Our system was developed using the blackboard style and was implemented in Java. In our approach each agent stores its perception in a shared world model which is called blackboard. Coordination has been implemented through a supervisor. The supervisor uses the stored information in the blackboard and coordinates the agents to achieve a goal. Finally, we outline our observations and discuss the performance of our team.", "paper_title": "Galoan: a multi-agent approach to herd cows", "paper_id": "WOS:000297588400005"}
