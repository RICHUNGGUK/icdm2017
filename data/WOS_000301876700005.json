These systems try to improve the estimation accuracy of the basic and straightforward triangulation method among discovered BT reference base stations at the cost of requiring that the positioning application has access to low level hardware related data (provided by the I-lost Controller Interface) and obtaining information which is in many cases hardware, and therefore device, dependent. In this paper we design, simulate, implement and validate a Bluetooth positioning system that only requires the ability to handle SDP service records at the application level, achieving mean errors around 1 to 3 meters, improving the basic triangulation method among discovered BT reference base stations.", "paper_title": "Using bluetooth to implement a pervasive indoor positioning system with minimal requirements at the application level", "paper_id": "WOS:000301876700005"}
