By this algorithm, for any initial bisymmetric matrix X-0, a solution X* can be obtained infinite iteration steps in the absence of roundoff errors, and the solution with least norm can be obtained by choosing a special kind of initial matrix. Furthermore, in the solution set of the above problem, the unique optimal approximation solution (X) over cap to a given matrix (X) over bar in the Frobenius norm can be derived by finding the least norm bisymmetric solution of a new corresponding minimum Frobenius norm problem. Given numerical examples show that the iterative algorithm is quite effective in actual computation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
