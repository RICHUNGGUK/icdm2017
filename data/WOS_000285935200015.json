We address the computational challenges with the latest techniques developed by the T star AFSM (Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling) in conjunction with the SSTFSI (Stabilized Space-Time Fluid-Structure Interaction) technique. The challenges involved in FSI modeling include the geometric porosity of the ringsail parachutes with ring gaps and sail slits. We investigate the performance of three possible design configurations of the parachute canopy. We also describe the techniques developed recently for building a consistent starting condition for the FSI computations, discuss rotational periodicity techniques for improving the geometric-porosity modeling, and introduce a new version of the HMGP (Homogenized Modeling of Geometric Porosity).
