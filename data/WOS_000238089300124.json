Based on the behaviour of human dermis proposed by Hendriks, we develop a system to draw a specific skin incision shape which consists of four spine curves and two lines. Users can firstly define the two incision points on the skin, our system can superimpose the shape on the surface and show the skin incision cutaway. OBBTree analysis for the skin surface is used to put the incision shape. Followed by shape shown on the surface and finally a cutaway is generated to show the cut. Jittering problem generated by the above steps is also resolved.", "paper_title": "Skin incision using real-time cutaway based on FE analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300124"}
