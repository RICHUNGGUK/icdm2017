We have applied supervised and non-supervised strategies using two recent frameworks related to this task. The obtained results show that, on the one hand, the integration of knowledge from web resources can be useful to generate learning corpora for this task and, on the other hand, the size of the learning corpora should be taken into account in deciding which approach to apply.
