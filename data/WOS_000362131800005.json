We prove that determining the P-3-hull number and the geodetic hull number are APX-hard problems. We prove that the Caratheodory number, the Radon number and the convexity number of both convexities are O (n(1-epsilon))-inapproximable in polynomial time for every epsilon > 0, unless P = NP. We also prove that the interval numbers of both convexities are W[2]-hard and O (logn)-inapproximable in polynomial time, unless P = NP. Moreover, these results hold for bipartite graphs in the P-3-convexity.
