The entire system consists of two stages. At the first stage, a conventional speech enhancement algorithm enhances the input signal while estimating several signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-related parameters. The residual gain, which is estimated by a data-driven method, is applied to further enhance the signal at the second stage. A number of experimental results show that the proposed speech enhancement algorithm outperforms the conventional speech enhancement technique based on soft decision and the data-driven approach using SNR grid look-up table.", "paper_title": "Speech Enhancement Based on Data-Driven Residual Gain Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304900029"}
