This study proposes a new portable medical training platform that integrates the structured text to present the result of doctor's diagnosis, the digital images, and the concept of Problem-Based Learning teaching method, and uses intelligent lecture assistance mechanism in clinical teaching. Furthermore, we built a set of Short Message Service transmission functions used on Personal Handyphone System to remind the instructor for further interaction after class with learners (interns or physicians). As for learners, they can use mobile device to practice remedial courses anytime. The proposed portable learning platform changes the traditional leaching method into an intelligent tutoring mechanism. As a result, the core competencies of medical profession can be cultivated to foster excellent medical personnel.", "paper_title": "Problem Based Learning Theory Oriented Portable Medical Training Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000322851600015"}
