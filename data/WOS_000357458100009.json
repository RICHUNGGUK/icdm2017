In this paper, a CMOS RF receiver with frequency synthesizer and analog baseband is introduced, which was fabricated with a 0.18-A mu m CMOS process for DRM/DAB wideband applications. In the system, a fully differential low noise amplifier with a noise cancelling technology is adopted It has achieved a gain of 11.69 dB. A harmonic rejection mixer was implemented to realize the rejections of 3rd- and 5th-order harmonics. As the local oscillator, a wide-band frequency synthesizer provides a phase noise of -125 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset. The designed RF receiver has achieved a conversion gain of 90 dB. The IIP3 of the receiver is in the range of -25 to -12 dBm, and the noise figure of 5.44-14.72 dB. The core circuits draw a current of 78.35 mA from a 1.8-V power supply and the chip occupies 6.46-mm(2) die area.", "paper_title": "A broadband CMOS RF receiver for digital broadcasting systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000357458100009"}
