We address this problem using suspicion, which we interpret as relevant anomaly, as the measure associated with data records and individuals. For datasets collected about widespread activities in which the signs of adversarial activity are rare, we suggest ways to build predictive models of suspicion. For datasets collected as the result of lawful interception, we suggest a model of suspicion spreading using the social network implied by the intercepted data.", "paper_title": "Computational approaches to suspicion in adversarial settings", "paper_id": "WOS:000288220000003"}
