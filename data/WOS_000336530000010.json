Methods to analyze transcription level variations along the genome from the read count profiles generated by the RNA-Seq protocol are needed. Results: We developed a statistical approach to estimate the local transcription levels and to identify transcript borders. This transcriptional landscape reconstruction relies on a state-space model to describe transcription level variations in terms of abrupt shifts and more progressive drifts. A new emission model is introduced to capture not only the read count variance inside a transcript but also its short-range autocorrelation and the fraction of positions with zero counts. The estimation relies on a particle Gibbs algorithm whose running time makes it more suited to microbial genomes. The approach outperformed read-overlapping strategies on synthetic and real microbial datasets.", "paper_title": "Parseq: reconstruction of microbial transcription landscape from RNA-Seq read counts using state-space models", "paper_id": "WOS:000336530000010"}
