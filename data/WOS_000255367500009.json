This is a relevant biomedical application with good potential market, since heart diseases are responsible for the largest number of yearly deaths. Hence, it is a good target for an application-specific system-on- chip (SoC) and HW/ SW codesign. We investigate a symmetric multiprocessor architecuture based on STMicroelecronics VLIW DSPs that process in real time 12-lead ECG signals. This architecture improves upon state-of-the-art SoC designs for ECG analysis in its ability to analyze the full 12 leads in real time, even with high sampling frequencies, and its ability to detect heart malfunction for the whole ECG signal interval. We explore the design space by considering a number of hardware and software architectural options. Comparing our design with present-day solutions from an SoC and application point-ofview shows that our platform can be used in real time and without failures.", "paper_title": "A multiprocessor system-on-chip for real-time biomedical monitoring and analysis: ECG prototype architectural design space exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000255367500009"}
