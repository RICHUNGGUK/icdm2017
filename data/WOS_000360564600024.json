The analysis involves two different interference scenarios: 1) downlink interference from deployed 60 GHz access points to the associated mobile ad-hoc devices, and 2) uplink interference from randomly deployed 60 GHz ad-hoc mobile devices to their associated access points. With these interference scenarios, the interference impact on the quality of main 1080p@30Hz and 1080p@60Hz wireless high-definition video streaming with various simulation settings are measured and estimated in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio.", "paper_title": "Interference impacts on 60 ghz real-time online video streaming in wireless smart tv platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000360564600024"}
