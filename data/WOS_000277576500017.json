The security of our scheme is based on biometric verification and threshold password authentication. Therefore, the scheme is not only secure against several common attacks, but is also appropriate to be applied to other applications such as entrance guard systems and treasury management systems.", "paper_title": "AN ONLINE BIOMETRICS-BASED SECRET SHARING SCHEME FOR MULTIPARTY CRYPTOSYSTEM USING SMART CARDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500017"}
