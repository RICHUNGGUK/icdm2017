MAgAdI is an adaptive web environment devoted to supporting the learning processes in overall contexts, in which several knowledge fields, courses and teachers are involved. So far, a three-year cyclical evaluation-improvement process has been developed on several subjects and participants (n = 80) of a Computer Science degree programme. This process embraced formative and summative evaluation phases with the aim of: discovering the implications of the blended-learning loop on the satisfaction of teachers and motivation of students confirming improvements in student learning; and testing the usability of the Student Workspace. Experimental data were collected by means of a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Results of this study detect improvements in the students' acquisition of knowledge in the three phases where it was evaluated (Wilcoxon-test, p = 0.02, p = 0.048, p = 0.044), which may be attributable to the use of MAgAdI. In addition, increments in student's motivation and teacher's satisfaction were also perceived. Thus, these results agree with previous findings of related works. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
