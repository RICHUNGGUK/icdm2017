The application level authentication schemes have seriously affected by the absence of effective mechanisms to protect the privacy of a client transactions. We propose a novel Cognitive Agents Based Authentication and Privacy Scheme (CABAPS) for mobile transactions, which integrates procedure of authentication with privacy protection. The authentication challenges and privacy measures are dynamically deployed by cognitive agents based on transaction sensitivity and users behaviors. The method has been successfully simulated using the Agent Factory framework for cognitive agents generation and communication. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
