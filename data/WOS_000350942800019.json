Using data derived from tomographs, this work presents the Volumetric Tomographic Reconstruction Model for agricultural samples, which allows, through the use of parallel processing techniques, a fast 2D and volumetric reconstruction. The model enables the improvement of the quality of X-ray projections based on Wiener filtering, 2D and also 3D visualization tools. The results showed that through this model measurements can be extracted of attenuation coefficient of soil samples as well as viewing and saving tomographic slices of the sagittal, coronal and transverse plane. It also showed that the interaction of the model strongly supports a better understanding of the different soil densities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
