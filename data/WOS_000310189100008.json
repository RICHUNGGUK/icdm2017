The effects of inter-flow and intra-flow interference have often been neglected in existing solutions, which can lead to inaccurate bandwidth estimation and reservation. IABR models both the current inter-flow interference from existing flows and the expected intra-flow interference of the incoming flow to make accurate estimation of the available bandwidth and perform admission control. Moreover, IABR exploits wireless link diversity between neighboring nodes in multi-radio multi-channel mesh networks to improve flow admission ratio and ensure efficient load-balancing. Simulation results show that IABR provides accurate bandwidth estimation, excellent load distribution and high flow admission ratio. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
