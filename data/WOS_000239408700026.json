A conjecture was made for the dimensions of these codes when q is odd. The conjecture is proved in this note. The proof involves the geometry of a four-dimensional (4-D) symplectic vector space and the action of the symplectic group and its subgroups.", "paper_title": "On the dimensions of certain LDPC codes based on q-regular bipartite graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408700026"}
