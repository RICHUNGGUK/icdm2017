We compare the two most commonly used statistical distributions in empirical analysis to capture these features: the I distribution and the generalized error distribution (GED). A Bayesian approach using a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method and a forecasting evaluation method are adopted for the comparison. In the Bayesian evaluation of eight daily market returns, we find that the fitted t error distribution outperforms the GED. In terms of volatility forecasting, models with t innovations also demonstrate superior out-of-sample performance. (c) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
