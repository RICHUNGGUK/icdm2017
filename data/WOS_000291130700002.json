These techniques, when coupled with equally powerful integer relation detection methods, have resulted in the analytic evaluation of many integrals that previously were beyond the realm of symbolic techniques. This paper presents a survey of the current state-of-the-art in this area (including results by the present authors and others), mentions some new results, and then sketches what challenges lie ahead.
