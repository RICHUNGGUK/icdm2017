Numerous memory aware energy optimizations have been proposed. However, both the optimization and the validation are performed in an ad-hoe manner as a coherent optimizing compilation and simulation framework does not exist as yet. In this paper, we present such a framework for performing memory hierarchy aware energy optimization. Both the compiler and the simulator are configured from a single memory hierarchy description. Significant savings of up to 50% in the total energy dissipation are reported.", "paper_title": "Compilation and simulation tool chain for memory aware energy optimizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423500029"}
