Yet the project, a bold adventure into transistorized computers, drove into existence new technologies in circuits, packaging, memory, and I/O upon which IBM built its successful second-generation computer product lines. The architectural, instruction-pipelining, arithmetic, and. software innovations were crucial for IBM's third-generation System/360 product family and even for its later RISC innovation.", "paper_title": "Stretch-ing Is Great Exercise-It Gets You in Shape to Win", "paper_id": "WOS:000275370600003"}
