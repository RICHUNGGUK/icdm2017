However, IoT's influence in the manufacturing sector has yet been fully explored. On the other hand, existing computer-aided software tools are experiencing a bottleneck in dealing with complexity, dynamics, and uncertainties in their applications of modern enterprises. It is argued that the adoption of IoT and cloud computing in enterprise systems (ESs) would overcome the bottleneck. In this paper, the challenges in generating assembly plans of complex products are discussed. IoT and cloud computing are proposed to help a conventional assembly modeling system evolve into an advanced system, which is capable to deal with complexity and changes automatically. To achieve this goal, an assembly modeling system is automated, and the proposed system includes the following innovations: 1) the modularized architecture to make the system robust, reliable, flexible, and expandable; 2) the integrated object-oriented templates to facilitate interfaces and reuses of system components; and 3) the automated algorithms to retrieve relational assembly matrices for assembly planning. Assembly modeling for aircraft engines is used as examples to illustrate the system effectiveness.", "paper_title": "IoT and Cloud Computing in Automation of Assembly Modeling Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800056"}
