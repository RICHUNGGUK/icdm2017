Consequently, conflicts among sources become inevitable. To resolve the conflicts and achieve high quality data, truth discovery and crowdsourcing aggregation have been studied intensively. However, although these two topics have a lot in common, they are studied separately and are applied to different domains. To answer the need of a systematic introduction and comparison of the two topics, we present an organized picture on truth discovery and crowdsourcing aggregation in this tutorial. They are compared on both theory and application levels, and their related areas as well as open questions are discussed.", "paper_title": "Truth Discovery and Crowdsourcing Aggregation: A Unified Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800100"}
