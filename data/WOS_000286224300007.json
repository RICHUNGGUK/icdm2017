In this process, it is difficult for the human operator to scan the target object completely and uniformly. Therefore, an interactive triangulation of the scanned points can assist the operator in this task. In this paper, we describe the technical and implementational details of our real-time triangulation approach for point streams, presented at the 17th International Meshing Roundtable. Our method computes a triangulation of the point stream generated by the laser scanner online, i.e., the data points are added to the triangulation as they are received from the scanner. Multiple scanned areas and areas with a higher point density result in a finer mesh and a higher accuracy. On the other hand, the vertex density adapts to the estimated surface curvature. To guide the operator, the resulting triangulation is rendered with a visualization of its uncertainty and the display of an optimal scanning direction.", "paper_title": "Real-time triangulation of point streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000286224300007"}
