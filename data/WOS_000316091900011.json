Since individual operators might face different constraints such as available spectrum licenses, technologies, cost structures or a low energy footprint, the EU FP7 CARrier grade wireless MEsh Network (CARMEN) project has developed a carrier-grade heterogeneous multi-radio back-haul architecture which may be deployed to extend, complement or even replace traditional operator equipment. To support offloading of live triple-play content to broadcast-optimized, e.g., DVB-T, overlay cells, this heterogeneous wireless back-haul architecture integrates unidirectional broadcast technologies. In order to manage the physical and logical resources of such a network, a centralized coordinator approach has been chosen, where no routing state is kept at plain WiBACK Nodes (WNs) which merely store QoS-aware MPLS forwarding state. In this paper we present our Unidirectional Technology (UDT)-aware design of the centralized Topology Management Function (TMF), which provides a framework for different topology and spectrum allocation optimization strategies and algorithms to be implemented. Following the validation of the design, we present evaluation results using a hybrid local/centralized topology optimizer showing that our TMF design supports the reliable forming of optimized topologies as well as the timely recovery from node failures.
