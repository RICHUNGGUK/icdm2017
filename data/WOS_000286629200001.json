The classical gene selection methods can be classified into three categories: the filters, the wrappers and the embedded methods. In this paper, a novel hybrid gene selection method (HGSM) is proposed by exploring both the mutual information criterion (filters) and leave-one-out-error criterion (wrappers) under the framework of an improved ant algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets and the results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of HGSM.", "paper_title": "A new hybrid method for gene selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000286629200001"}
