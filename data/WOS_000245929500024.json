Existing methods focused on the behavior of individual IP (Intellectual Property) components and neglected the interplay effects among them, resulting in accuracy degradation from the system perspective. On the other hand, our method thoroughly considers such effects and increases the analysis accuracy by adopting control signal modeling and hierarchical stochastic modeling. Furthermore, our method minimizes the additional design time by reusing the simulation results of each IP component and an automated design flow. The experimental results show that the accuracy of our method is over 90% of RTL simulation in a multimedia SoC (System-on-Chip) design.", "paper_title": "Scenario-aware bus functional modeling for architecture-level performance analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000245929500024"}
