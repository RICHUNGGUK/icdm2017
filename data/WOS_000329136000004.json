The sensor typifies the sort of component that engineers regularly integrate into larger systems by writing interface hardware and software. In all, three main models are developed. In the first model, the timing diagram of the sensor is interpreted and modeled as a timed safety automaton. This model serves as a specification for the complete system. A second model that emphasizes the separate roles of driver and sensor is then developed. It is validated against the timing diagram model using an existing construction that permits the verification of timed trace inclusion, for certain models, by reachability analysis (i.e., model checking). A transmission correctness property is also stated by means of an auxiliary automaton and shown to be satisfied by the model. A third model is created from an assembly language driver program, using a direct translation from the instruction set of a processor with simple timing behavior. This model is validated against the driver component of the second timing diagram model using the timed trace inclusion validation technique. The approach and its limitations offer insight into the nature and challenges of programming in real time.", "paper_title": "Analyzing an Embedded Sensor with Timed Automata in Uppaal", "paper_id": "WOS:000329136000004"}
