However, such tasks are not trivial, as they require a substantial amount of training and practices. Although automatic skeleton extraction methods have been proposed, they generally may not guarantee that the resulting skeleton can help produce desired animations according to user intention. In this paper, we present a sketching-based skeleton generation method suitable for use in the mobile environment. This method takes user sketching as an input, and based on the mesh segmentation result of a 3D object, it estimates a skeleton for articulated character animation. In addition, we are currently developing a Web-based mobile platform to support mesh editing by a group of collaborative users and we depict the system architecture of such a platform. Results show that our method can produce better skeletons in terms of joint positions and topological structure.", "paper_title": "A mobile environment for sketching-based skeleton generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000288752100004"}
