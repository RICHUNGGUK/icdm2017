These studies have been performed using a mix of character types, from detailed human models to abstract geometric objects such as spheres. We explore the extent to which character morphology influences user sensitivity to errors in a fixed set of ballistic motions replicated on three different character types. We find user sensitivity responds to changes in error type or magnitude in a similar manner regardless of character type, but that users display a higher sensitivity to some types of errors when these errors are displayed on more human-like characters. Further investigation of those error types suggests that being able to observe a period of preparatory motion before the onset of ballistic motion may be important. However, we found no evidence to suggest that a mismatch between the preparatory phase and the resulting ballistic motion was responsible for the higher sensitivity to errors that was observed for the most humanlike character.", "paper_title": "Effect of character animacy and preparatory motion on perceptual magnitude of errors in ballistic motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000255285500009"}
