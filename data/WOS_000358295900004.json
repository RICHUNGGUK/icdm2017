It is found that the proposed ILR can not only reduce circuit size and but also realize high common mode rejection in differential mode operation frequency. By properly converting the symmetric four-port balanced bandpass filter (BPF) to a three-port device, a balun BPF with high selectivity and compact size are accomplished using ILRs. Then, the balun-diplexer can be realized by combining two well-designed balun filters with two 50 transmission lines. The demonstrated balun-diplexer with operation at 1.8 and 2.45 GHz have been designed, fabricated, and measured. Excellent performances have been observed. Specifically, 0.4 dB in-band amplitude error, 1.8 in-band phase error, more than 50 dB selectivity and 45 dB isolation are obtained. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
