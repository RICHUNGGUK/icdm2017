We apply 10 relevant operations to global/local statistics of visual words. Because the pairwise combination of visual words is large, we apply feature selection methods including fisher discriminant criterion and LI-SVM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through the experiment.", "paper_title": "Extraction of Combined Features from Global/Local Statistics of Visual Words Using Relevant Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000285488900025"}
