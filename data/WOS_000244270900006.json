After having introduced concepts of determinacy and consistency of linguistic terms, the understandable degree and consistence degree of linguistic terms are illustrated by these two concepts. A case study is demonstrated for the proposed decision-making model with an analytical conclusion of both advantages and disadvantages. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
