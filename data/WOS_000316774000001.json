In the search for nonaddictive opioid therapeutics and novel chemical tools to study physiological functions regulated by the KOP receptor, we screened in silico its recently released inactive crystal structure. A selective novel KOP receptor agonist emerged as a notable result and is proposed as a new chemotype for the study of the KOP receptor in the etiology of drug addiction, depression, and/or pain.", "paper_title": "Discovery of a Novel Selective Kappa-Opioid Receptor Agonist Using Crystal Structure-Based Virtual Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000316774000001"}
