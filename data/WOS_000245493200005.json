In this paper we stud), the influence of modifying the weights of a NURPS surface. We describe the relation between the weights associated with a control triangle and the points on the NURPS surface by means of a double volume ratio. We also extend the concept of Farin points for rational Bezier curves to NURPS surfaces, resulting in weight points and weight triangles. They admit a local weight control in a geometrically intuitive way. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
