A good recommender system should be able to not only find out the objects preferred by users, but also help users in discovering their personalized tastes. The former corresponds to high accuracy of the recommendation, while the latter to high diversity. A big challenge is to design an algorithm that provides both highly accurate and diverse recommendation. Traditional recommendation algorithms only take into account the contributions of similar users, thus, they tend to recommend popular items for users ignoring the diversity of recommendations. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm by considering both the effects of similar and dissimilar users under the framework of collaborative filtering. Extensive analyses on three datasets, namely MovieLens, Netflix and Amazon, show that our method performs much better than the standard collaborative filtering algorithm for both accuracy and diversity.", "paper_title": "CAN DISSIMILAR USERS CONTRIBUTE TO ACCURACY AND DIVERSITY OF PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION?", "paper_id": "WOS:000283602700002"}
