In this paper, an evolutionary dynamic enterprise process modeling method was proposed from the concepts of enterprise process evolution to zero-time enterprise modeling and layered complex enterprise modeling. Based on an autonomous agent development platform, an agent-based enterprise collaborative modeling environment has been implemented by integrating several software resource agents that wrap main function modules of EPMS. Scheduling strategies, algorithms, and process-driven cooperative scheduling mechanism are also discussed.", "paper_title": "An approach to enterprise process dynamic modeling supporting enterprise process evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000259569600010"}
