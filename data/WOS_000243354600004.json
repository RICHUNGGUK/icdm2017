We design genetic algorithms for the 2-page drawings, and test them on the benchmark test suits, Rome graphs and Random Connected Graphs. We also test some circulant graphs, and get better results than previously presented in the literature. Moreover, we formalise three conjectures for certain kinds of circulant graphs,supported by our experimental results.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithms for the 2-page book drawing problem of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000243354600004"}
