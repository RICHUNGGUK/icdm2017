Points are labelled by proposition letters and spatial relations are induced by the four cone-shaped cardinal directions. Cone Logic can be seen as a weakening of Venema's Compass Logic. We prove that, unlike Compass Logic and other projection-based spatial logics, its satisfiability problem is decidable (precisely, PSPACE-complete). We also show that it is expressive enough to capture meaningful interval temporal logics - in particular, the interval temporal logic of Allen's relations 'Begins', 'During', and 'Later', and their transposes.", "paper_title": "A DECIDABLE WEAKENING OF COMPASS LOGIC BASED ON CONE-SHAPED CARDINAL DIRECTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000373922900007"}
