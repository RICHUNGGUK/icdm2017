Since fuzzy hierarchies are characterized by decompositions of their domains as opposed to partitions, properties and measures of decompositions are developed. Fuzzy complete and partial evidence resolution is defined and related to the valuation of evidence. Finally a for-and-against analysis is developed for the selection of which concept to choose in the generalization.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Concept Hierarchies and Evidence Resolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000344751200009"}
