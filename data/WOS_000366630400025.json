The library also provides a small number of functions for handling protein sequence and general purpose programming and mathematics. BiopLib transparently handles PDBML (XML) format and standard PDB files. BiopTools provides facilities ranging from renumbering atoms and residues to calculation of solvent accessibility.", "paper_title": "BiopLib and BiopTools-a C programming library and toolset for manipulating protein structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000366630400025"}
