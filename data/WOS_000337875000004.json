In this problem, organizations requesting a set of software applications have to be assigned to computer clusters such that the costs of opening clusters and installing the necessary applications are minimized. This problem is related to known OR problems such as the multiproduct facility location problem and the generalized bin packing problem. We show that APP is NP-hard, and then propose a simple Tabu Search heuristic to solve it. The performance of the Tabu Search heuristic is assessed via extensive computational experiments, which indicate the promise of the proposed Tabu Search. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
