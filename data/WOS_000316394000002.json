To produce functionally graded steels, a spot-welded electrode that consists of two slices of plain carbon steel and austenitic stainless steel was used. Functionally graded steel containing graded layers of ferrite and austenite may be fabricated via diffusion of alloying elements during remelting stage. Vickers microhardness profile of the specimen has been obtained experimentally and modeled with ANFIS. To build the model for graded ferritic and austenitic steels, training, testing and validation using, respectively, 174 and 120 experimental data were conducted. According to the input parameters, the Vickers microhardness of each layer was predicted. The training, testing and validation results in the ANFIS models have shown a strong potential for predicting microhardness profile of both graded ferritic and austenitic steels. It was shown that the Vickers microhardness can be predicted by ANFIS in the range of the examined data.", "paper_title": "Prediction microhardness profile of functionally graded steels by ANFIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000316394000002"}
