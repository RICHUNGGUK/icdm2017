Instead of placing texture images directly on the target surface, as in classic texture mapping/synthesis, this method takes place purely in 2D image space-it generates a 2D texture with projective variation to mimic the effect of the texture being on the surface. It is applicable to arbitrary 3D surfaces. The advantage of PSTS is that it can avoid a considerable amount of operations on the target surface required by the classic texture techniques, thus providing programming simplicity and fast performance. Within PSTS, a new 2D adaptive texture synthesis method is proposed, which is able to generate optimised textures using adaptive neighbourhoods. Experimental results are provided.
