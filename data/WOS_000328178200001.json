The model of each channel is considered as a linear system with equivalent disturbances which contain nonlinear uncertainties, coupling effects, parameter perturbations, and external disturbances. A state-feedback H-infinity, controller is applied to the linear model and a robust compensator is introduced to restrain the effects of equivalent disturbances. The robust properties of the closed-loop control system with the proposed controller are shown better than the standard H controller. Experimental results demonstrate the improved performances of the proposed control strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.
