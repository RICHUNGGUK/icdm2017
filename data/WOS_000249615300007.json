The proposed realizations offer enhanced features compared to previously reported ICCII. Also new oscillator circuits based on using the ICCII as an active element are presented. The presented oscillator circuits have the advantage that both the oscillation frequency and the oscillation condition can be adjusted independently. Also another application to the ICCII, which is a floating inductor, is proposed. A second order low pass filter using the proposed floating inductor is simulated and compared with the ideal result. The proposed ICCIIs and the presented applications are tested with SPICE simulations using CMOS 0.35 mu m technology to verify the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Novel CMOS realizations of the inverting second-generation current conveyor and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000249615300007"}
