We observe that any k-junta, that is, any function which depends only on k of its input variables, is O(2(k))-locally correctable. Moreover, we show that there are examples where this is essentially best possible, and locally correcting some k-juntas requires a number of queries which is exponential in k. These examples, however, are far from being typical, and indeed we prove that for almost every k-junta, O(k log k) queries suffice. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
