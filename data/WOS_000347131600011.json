An adaptive thermal-aware multi-core task scheduling framework based on run-time controllers is proposed in this paper to address the inter-core thermal effects and dynamic variations of task execution. In contrast to dynamic voltage scaling, the service rates of the tasks are adjusted in order to cool the system. Scheduling algorithms are used to prevent the system from overheating and maximize system utilization. This paper also evaluates the capability of the proposed framework through varying the workloads, ultimately demonstrating positive and stable performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
