Aggregation mechanisms need to address two main performance concerns. Naive aggregation schemes can wait to aggregate until enough data for pre-decided aggregated frame lengths is available, which can result in delay penalties due to variations in traffic type or load levels. The second possible performance side effect is that the increase in the aggregated frame length may result in an increased packet error rate in noisy environments. Adaptive aggregation methods have previously been proposed to deal with the above problems independently. In this study, a backlogged queue (BQ) aggregation approach is proposed that considers both these aspects, and also ensures inter-operability with other WLAN devices that are not capable of frame aggregation. The length of the backlogged queue is used as an indicator for delay-optimal framing, and, using modeling, the study shows that it is always beneficial to perform BQ frame aggregation up to the wireless MTU even in the presence of noise. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm on the ORBIT testbed shows throughput improvements of up to 56% in the presence of channel noise and 25% in scenarios with high contention over using a simple 802.11e based TxOP. An experimental case study shows improvement in FTP file transfer times of up to 11% while preserving performance for real-time traffic. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
