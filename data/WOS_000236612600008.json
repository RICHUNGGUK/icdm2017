Although advances in stand-alone diagnostic and treatment systems have been accelerating steadily, the lack of proper integration and interoperation of those systems produces systemic inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. This inflates costs and contributes to avoidable medical errors that degrade patient care. The use of software that controls medical devices to overcome these problems is inevitable and will help ensure safe advances in healthcare delivery. A critical concern, however, is the cost-effective development and production of reliable and safe medical device software and systems.", "paper_title": "High-confidence medical device software and systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236612600008"}
