In this context, were view the main motivations, technological achievements, physics-related implications and future challenges. Specific aspects governing the operation of multiple-gate transistors are discussed with the aim of clarifying the strategic trends. The physics mechanisms are briefly evoked. The road is difficult with many turns; hopefully, it looks long enough. Generic milestones are: nano-size, multiple-gates, innovative ideas and multi-facet SOI technology.", "paper_title": "How Many Gates Do We Need in A Transistor: One, Two, Three or Four?", "paper_id": "WOS:000207536500002"}
