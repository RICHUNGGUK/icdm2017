The minimum exposure path (MEP) problem is, given a pair of points x and y inside a sensor field, to find a path between x and y of minimum exposure. In this article we introduce the first rigorous treatment of the problem, designing an approximation algorithm for the MEP problem with guaranteed performance characteristics. Given a convex polygon P of size n with O(n) sensors inside it and any real number epsilon > 0, our algorithm finds a path in P whose exposure is within an 1 + epsilon factor of the exposure of the MEP, in time O(n/epsilon(2)psi log n), where. is a geometric characteristic of the field. We also describe a framework for a faster implementation of our algorithm, which reduces the time by a factor of approximately Theta(1/epsilon), while keeping the same approximation ratio.", "paper_title": "Approximation Algorithms for Computing Minimum Exposure Paths in a Sensor Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000285695800004"}
