The proposed algorithm mitigates the effect of excessive suppression due to successive peaks or relatively high peaks of a signal, which is often observed when applying the conventional peak windowing scheme. The bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) performances are measured for various window types and lengths. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement in terms of BER and PAPR reduction performance while maintaining similar spectrum performance compared to the conventional peak windowing scheme.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of a Windowed-Sine Function-Based Peak Windowing Scheme for OFDM Polar Transmitters", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619300004"}
