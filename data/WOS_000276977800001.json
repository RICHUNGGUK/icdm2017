In this paper, we study the Maximum Area Independent Set (MAIS) problem, a natural restricted version of MWIS in disk intersection graphs where the weight equals the disk area. We obtain: (i) Quantitative bounds on the maximum total area of an independent set relative to the union area; (ii) Practical constant-ratio approximation algorithms for finding an independent set with a large total area relative to the union area.", "paper_title": "MAXIMUM AREA INDEPENDENT SETS IN DISK INTERSECTION GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000276977800001"}
