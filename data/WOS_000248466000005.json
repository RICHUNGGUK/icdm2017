The LSP has to be set up in advance before carrying the traffic. Contention for network resources may happen if many LSPs try to use a common network link with limited bandwidth. In this paper, we investigate the problem of providing services to high priority LSPs whereby existing LSPs with lower priority may be preempted. The consequent interruption of the services of preempted LSPs would detrimentally affect users' perception on the QoS provided. Therefore, the preemption strategies may incorporate additional re-routing mechanisms to provide alternative paths for the LSPs which are to-be-preempted so that their services remain unaffected. A newly arrived high priority LSP in an MPLS network may find M possible paths between its source and destination. It may select the shortest path which may trigger preemption or choose a longer path which however utilizes more resources. We begin by formulating preemption strategies with global re-routing. Our investigations include the effects of routing of high priority LSPs on the shortest path and its alternative paths. We show that by persistently routing the high priority LSP on the shortest path, more preempted LSPs can be re-routed which would reduce the negative effects of preemption. However, as excessive re-routing may degrade the network performance as well, a re-routing control strategy is proposed to constrain the length of these re-routed paths. Finally, a decentralized preemption strategy with local re-routing is also presented to approximate the performance of the proposed strategy with significantly lower control overheads. Simulations show that with this approach, high priority LSPs can gain better access to network resources while simultaneously ensuring that, as compared to the existing preemption strategies, the network throughput and the ongoing connection services are not adversely affected.
