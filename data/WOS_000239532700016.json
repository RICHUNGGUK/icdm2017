Unfortunately, most of the proxy signature schemes, which have been proposed up to now, are not based on standard signature such as Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). Consequently, those proposals have inevitably been considered infeasible because of obvious security weaknesses so they suffer from new attacks. In fact, with the application of standard signature like DSA, which has been fully discussed, a proxy signature scheme could be well accepted for the deployment in many applications. Therefore, we propose a new proxy signature scheme which combines the DSA properties with proxy signatures. In other words, our scheme keeps not only the properties of the DSA but also fulfills the requirements of proxy signatures. We hope our new proxy signature based on DSA combining Public-key infrastructure (PKI) mechanism could be used in practice as well as the conventional DSA.", "paper_title": "Design of proxy signature in the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)", "paper_id": "WOS:000239532700016"}
