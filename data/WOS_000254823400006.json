The new approach (a) relies on the maxmin criterion which is a method in decision theory for maximizing the minimum gain and (b) builds upon the border theory of frequent itemsets. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology both with respect to the hiding results as well as with respect to the time performance compared to similar state of the art approaches.
