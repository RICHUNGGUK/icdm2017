The proposed 2DSDD scheme adopts the difference of both between-class scatter and within-class scatter as discriminant criterion. In this way, the small sample size problem usually occurred in the traditional Fisher discriminant analysis (LDA) is essentially avoided. In addition, the developed method directly depends on image matrices. That is to say, it is not necessary to convert the image matrix into high-dimensional image vector like those conventional linear discriminant methods prior to feature extraction so that much computational time would be saved. Finally, the experimental results on the ORL face database indicate that the proposed method outperforms Fisher-faces, the standard scatter difference discriminant analysis, not only in the computation efficiency, but also in its recognition performance.", "paper_title": "Two-dimensional discriminant transform based on scatter difference criterion for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100085"}
