The new approach introduces particle space constraints to improve velocity updating performance and position updating capability. This study presents numerical simulations and experimental results based on PID, PSO-PID, and IPSO-PID control systems. Real time experimental results show that the proposed IPSO algorithm has great computational convergence and ensures the stability of the controlled system without strict constraints on updating velocity. Tests on a linear synchronous motor (LSM) using a digital signal Microchip (dsPIC) processor demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness in positioning with disturbance excitation.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION BY UPDATING CONSTRAINTS OF PID CONTROL FOR REAL TIME LINEAR MOTOR POSITIONING", "paper_id": "WOS:000326140200018"}
