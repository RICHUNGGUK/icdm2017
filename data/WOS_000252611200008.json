This is useful for the analysis of events that took place on the system for the purpose of digital forensic investigations. In this paper we propose a mechanism that allows arbitrary meta-information bound to principals on a system to be propagated based on causality and influenced by information flow. We further discuss how to implement such a mechanism for the FreeBSD operating system and present a proof-of-concept implementation that has little overhead compared to the system without label propagation.
