The proposed algorithm is adapted from a recent finite element-based method and preserves the mass by means of a localized mass correction. A salient feature of the scheme is the absence of adjustable parameters. The algorithm is tested in two and three spatial dimensions and compared with the widely used partial differential equation (PDE)-based redistancing method using structured Cartesian grids. Through the use of quantitative error measures of interest in level set methods, we show that the overall performance of the proposed geometric procedure is better than PDE-based reinitialization schemes, since it is more robust with comparable accuracy. We also show that the algorithm is well-suited for the highly stretched curvilinear grids used in CFD simulations.
