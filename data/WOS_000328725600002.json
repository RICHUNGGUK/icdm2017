However, the emerging paradigm of grid computing provides a powerful platform for the solution of such problems by providing transparent access to large-scale distributed high-performance compute resources. As well as substantially speeding up the time taken to find a single controller design satisfying a set of performance requirements this grid-enabled design process allows a designer to effectively explore the solution space of potential candidate solutions. An example of this is in the multi-objective evolutionary design of robust controllers, where each candidate controller design has to be synthesised and the resulting performance of the compensated system evaluated by computer simulation. This paper introduces a grid-enabled framework for the multi-objective optimisation of computationally expensive problems which will then be demonstrated using and example of the multi-objective evolutionary design of a robust lateral stability controller for a real-world aircraft using H-infinity loop shaping.
