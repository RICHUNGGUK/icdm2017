During this process, a significant amount of information is exchanged between EDs and PCCs via telephone, leading to important inefficiencies and safety vulnerabilities. In the present work, we identified and assessed a set of data standards to enable a standards-based health information exchange process between EDs and PCCs. Materials and methods Based on a reference model for PCC-ED health information exchange, we (1) mapped PCC-ED information exchange events to clinical documents specified in the Health Level Seven (HL7) Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) Standard, and (2) mapped information types routinely exchanged in PCC-ED telephone conversations to C-CDA sections. Results Four C-CDA document types were necessary to support the PCC-ED information exchange process: History & Physical Note, Consultation Note, Progress Note, and Discharge Summary. Information types that are commonly exchanged between PCCs and EDs can be reasonably well represented within these C-CDA documents. Conclusions A standards-based health information exchange process between PCCs and EDs appears to be feasible given a set of clinical data standards that are required for EHR certification in the USA, although the proposed approach still needs to be validated in actual system implementations. Such a process has the potential to improve the safety and efficiency of PCC-ED communication, ultimately resulting in improved patient care outcomes.", "paper_title": "Data standards to support health information exchange between poison control centers and emergency departments", "paper_id": "WOS:000356717100005"}
