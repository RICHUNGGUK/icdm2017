Hence we must construct memories requiring more than two ports, either out of logic elements or by combining multiple block RAMs. We present a thorough exploration and evaluation of the design space of FPGA-based soft multi-ported memories for conventional solutions, and also for the recently proposed Live Value Table (LVT) [La Forest and Steffan 20101 and XOR [La Forest et al. 2012] approaches to unidirectional port memories, reporting results for both Altera and Xilinx FPGAs. Additionally, we thoroughly evaluate and compare with a recent LVT-based approach to bidirectional port memories", "paper_title": "Composing Multi-Ported Memories on FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342393800001"}
