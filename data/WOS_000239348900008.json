By drawing upon the Concepts (of logic of ordering adopted from actor network theory; and efffects adopted from upon reflexivity and the unexpected side of reflexive modernization, the paper makes three key contributions: (1) it demonstrates the socio-technical complexity; of IS standards and standardization efforts; (2) it shows how complexity generates reflexive processes that undermine standardization aims; and () it suggests a theoretical interpretation of standardization complexity by using ideas from complexity theory and the theory of reflective modernization. These research questions are addressed by offering an historical and contingent analysis of the complexity, dynamics emerging from the case.", "paper_title": "Reflexive standardization: Side effects and complexity in standard making", "paper_id": "WOS:000239348900008"}
