To connect socialbots, attackers employ several strategies. The authors' approach detects socialbots by intelligently selecting organization member profiles and monitoring their activity. Their study demonstrates their method's efficacy specifically, that when an attacker knows the defense strategy being deployed, the most effective attack is randomly sprayed friend requests, which eventually lead to a low number of connections.", "paper_title": "Anti-Reconnaissance Tools: Detecting Targeted Socialbots", "paper_id": "WOS:000341587800003"}
