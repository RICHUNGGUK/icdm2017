In such a network it is assumed that one can establish a link e by paying a cost c(e) in a given interval [c(e)(-), c(e)(+)] while taking a risk (c(e)(+) - c(e))/(c(e)(+) - c(e)(-)) of link failure. We develop polynomial time algorithms for minimum cost network connection with paths or spanning trees under risk-sum constraints. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
