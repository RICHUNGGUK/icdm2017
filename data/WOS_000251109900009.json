P2P streaming systems are inherently less reliable because of churn, internet dynamics, node heterogeneity and randomness in the swarm. We present a new model for P2P media streaming based on clustering of peers, called alliances. We show that alliance formation is a loosely coupled and an effective way to organize the peers. We show that our model maps to a \"small-world\" network, which form efficient overlay structures and are robust to network perturbations such as churn. We present a comparative simulation based study of our model with CoolStreaming/DONet and present a quantitative performance evaluation. Simulation results are promising and show that our model scales well under varying workloads and conditions, delivers near optimal levels of QoS, and for most cases, performs at par or even better than CoolStreaming/DONet.", "paper_title": "An alliance based peering scheme for P2P live media streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000251109900009"}
