We define simple and concise mathematical models for the game, including both cooperative and uncooperative versions, and analyze their computational complexity. In particular, we prove that even a single-player version of UNO is NP-complete, although some restricted cases are in P. Surprisingly, we show that the uncooperative two-player version is also in P.
