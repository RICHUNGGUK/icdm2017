The new temperature metric derived from frequency domain moment matching technique incorporates both initial temperature and other transient effects to make optimized task migration decisions, which leads to more effective reduction of hot spots in the experiments on a 100-core microprocessor than the existing distributed thermal management methods.", "paper_title": "Task Migrations for Distributed Thermal Management Considering Transient Effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000349420400019"}
