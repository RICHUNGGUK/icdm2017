In addition to the distance traveled a tour is evaluated by taking also preferences into account which address the sequence in which the targets are visited. The problem thus is a combination of two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the traveling salesman and the linear ordering problem. In this paper we point out some polyhedral properties and develop a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving the TVP to optimality. Some computational results are presented.", "paper_title": "Inter Programming Models for the Target Visitation Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000375119200006"}
