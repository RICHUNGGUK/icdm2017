Under the auspices of IETF working group of 6lowPAN, efforts are underway to provide interconnectivity between low powered IEEE802.15.4 devices and wired IPv6 domain. Besides a plethora of interoperability issues, routing stands out as a challenging consideration. In this paper, we have discussed the routing approaches adopted in current ZigBee device specifications and existing work under the 61owPAN charter. We describe, through a protocol, how to involve gateways in routing functionality in 6lowPAN networks. Through NS2-based simulation study, our performance analysis amenably supports the applicability of our protocol.", "paper_title": "Are low PANs a PAN or an Internet of PANs?", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300052"}
