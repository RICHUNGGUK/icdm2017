In this paper, we propose a context-aware hypergraph similarity measure (CAHSM), which leads to robust spectral clustering in the case of noisy data. We construct three types of hypergraphs-the pairwise hypergraph, the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) hypergraph, and the high-order over-clustering hypergraph. The pairwise hypergraph captures the pairwise similarity of data points; the kNNhypergraph captures the neighborhood of each point; and the clustering hypergraph encodes high-order contexts within the dataset. By combining the affinity information from these three hypergraphs, the CAHSM algorithm is able to explore the intrinsic topological information of the dataset. Therefore, data clustering using CAHSM tends to be more robust. Considering the intra-cluster compactness and the inter-cluster separability of vertices, we further design a discriminative hypergraph partitioning criterion (DHPC). Using both CAHSM and DHPC, a robust spectral clustering algorithm is developed. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Context-Aware Hypergraph Construction for Robust Spectral Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000342076600019"}
