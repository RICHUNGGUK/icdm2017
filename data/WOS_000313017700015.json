In recent years, one of the most popular and widely used devices in certain consumer electronic applications has been RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and of particular interest here is Near Field Communication (NFC), a two-way communication technology based on RFID. A setup that has a NFC device embedded in a cellular phone has attracted growing attention for various business applications, among them payments and ticketing. In this paper, we propose a novel application and framework that uses a NFC phone to create a personalized digital home environment. With this proposed setup, by one touch the NFC phone is used to send a request that carries predefined personal preferences to control various home appliances. We present the system architecture and implement the prototype, employing such well-known standards as NFC, OSGi, and UPnP to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. We then evaluate the performance for efficiency and discuss the merits of the approach.", "paper_title": "A near field communication-driven home automation framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000313017700015"}
