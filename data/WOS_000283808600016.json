In particular we consider the presence of heterogeneous clusters both in size and in population, which are common in many real systems We completely characterize the scaling exponent of the resulting network capacity by providing upper and lower bounds which differ at most by a poly-logarithmic factor in the number of nodes (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Capacity scaling of large wireless networks with heterogeneous clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000283808600016"}
