As evidenced in the report of the case study proposed, the method and associated tools provide information regarding the criticality of a system and make it possible to direct an intervention modifying the principal design parameters (characteristics of layout, shapes of components, and types of junction systems) in a way that improves the efficiency of disassembly. This comes off through a reasoned redistribution of the disassembly depth of components, searching for concordance between the ease of disassembly and the real need for it, and favoring the disassemblability of those parts of the system with higher environmental impact content, to recoup it at end-of-life.
