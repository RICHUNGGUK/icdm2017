In these devices, the time (when the neurons fire and/or spike) plays an essential role. For instance, the result of a computation is the time between the moments when a specified neuron spikes. Seen as number computing devices, SN P systems are shown to be computationally complete (both in the generating and accepting modes, in the latter case also when restricting to deterministic systems). If the number of spikes present in the system is bounded, then the power of SN P systems falls drastically, and we get a characterization of semilinear sets. A series of research topics and open problems are formulated.", "paper_title": "Spiking neural P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239018100008"}
