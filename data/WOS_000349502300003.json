In this paper, we consider the use of n out of m codes and data dispersal in combination to in-network storage. In particular, we provide an abstract model of in-network storage to show how n out of m codes can be used, and we discuss how this can be achieved in five cases of study. We also define a model aimed at evaluating the probability of correct data encoding and decoding, we exploit this model and simulations to show how, in the cases of study, the parameters of the n out of m codes and the network should be configured in order to achieve correct data coding and decoding with high probability.
