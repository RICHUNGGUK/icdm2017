In this paper we study the skeleton of a 2D shape in a two-manifold M, based on a geodesic metric. We present a formal definition of the skeleton S(Omega) for a shape Omega in M and show several properties that make S(Omega) distinct from its Euclidean counterpart in R-2. We further prove that for a shape sequence {Omega(i)} that converge to a shape Omega in M, the mapping Omega -> (S) over bar(Omega) is lower semi-continuous. A direct application of this result is that we can use a set P of sample points to approximate the boundary of a 2D shape Omega in M, and the Voronoi diagram of P inside Omega subset of M gives a good approximation to the skeleton S(Omega). Examples of skeleton computation in topography and brain morphometry are illustrated.", "paper_title": "Semi-Continuity of Skeletons in Two-Manifold and Discrete Voronoi Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000359216600016"}
