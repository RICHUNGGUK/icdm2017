In general, a physics-based approach for constraint animation offers a variety of animations with physically correct realism, which are achieved by solving the equations of motion. However, in the digital animation industry, solving the equations of motion is an indirect path to creating more art-directed animations that maintain a plausible realism. Our algorithms provide animators a practical way to make elastic body animation with plausible realism, while effectively using point-constraints to offer directatorial control. The animation examples illustrate that our framework creates a wide variety of point-constraint animations of elastic objects with greater directability than existing methods.
