This paper capitalizes on the common operator technique to present new common structures for the FFT and FEC decoding algorithms. A key benefit of exhibiting common operators is the regular architecture it brings when implemented in a Common Operator Bank (COB). This regularity makes the architecture open to future function mapping and adapted to accommodated silicon technology variability through dependable design. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
