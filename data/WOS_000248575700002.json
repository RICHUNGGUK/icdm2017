The model also helps validate such methods and estimate their complexity. In terms of this model, a new intrusion detection method is proposed, its validity is proved, and its computational complexity is evaluated. It differs from the available expert-based methods in that it does not impose constraints on the behavior being detected and makes it possible to detect unknown or modified attacks.", "paper_title": "A model of the behavior of network objects in distributed computer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248575700002"}
