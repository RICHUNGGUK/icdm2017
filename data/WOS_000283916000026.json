The model is based on recent advances in ICT and implements a three access modes to the laboratory experience (virtual, hands-on and remote) in one software package. A review of the three modes is provided with highlights of advantages and disadvantages of each mode. It is shown that recent literature on laboratory education recommends hybrid structures. Some literature has reported on the use of two modes hybrid structures, however, it is seldom reported to have triple access mode laboratory. This paper probably the first to report empirical findings of using the three components together. The virtual component of the TriLab has been mainly used in a preparation session for undergraduate students, while the remote component has been mainly used for demonstrating theory applicability in postgraduate courses. The empirical findings shows clearly the positive impact of the hybrid approach on students learning and motivation, these are discussed in light of pedagogical and cognitive psychology theories.
