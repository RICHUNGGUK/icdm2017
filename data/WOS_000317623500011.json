The proposed structure introduces an adaptive resistance dynamically adjusted according to the different output load conditions, which achieves an adequate system phase margin. A monolithic DC-DC buck converter using the proposed structure was fabricated with 0.35 mu m CMOS process. Measurement results show that the transient undershoot/overshoot voltage and the recovery time do not exceed 60 mV and 20 mu s for a load current variation from 0 to 1 A.", "paper_title": "Fast transient DC-DC converter with adaptive compensation zero technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000317623500011"}
