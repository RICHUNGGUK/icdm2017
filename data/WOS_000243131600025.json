In order to fully explore Web service business opportunities, while ensuring a correct and reliable execution, analyzing and tracking Web services interactions will enable them to be well understood and controlled. The work described in this paper is a contribution to these issues for Web services based process applications. This article describes a novel way of applying process mining techniques to Web services logs in order to enable \"Web service intelligence\". Our work attempts to apply Web service log-based analysis and process mining techniques in order to provide semantical knowledge about the context of and the reasons for discrepancies between process models and related instances.", "paper_title": "Web service mining and verification of properties: An approach based on event calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000243131600025"}
