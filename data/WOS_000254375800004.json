The strongly t-diagnosable system is (t + 1) diagnosable except when all of the neighbors of a node are simultaneously faulty. In this paper, we discuss the in-depth properties of diagnosability for t-regular and t-connected networks under the comparison model. We show that a t-regular and t-connected multiprocessor system with at least 2t + 6 nodes, for t >= 4, is strongly t-diagnosable under the comparison model if the following two conditions hold: (1) the system is triangle free, and (2) there are at most t - 2 common neighbors for each pair of distinct nodes in the system.
