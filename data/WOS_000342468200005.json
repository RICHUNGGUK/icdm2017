Notably, during this activity, mountaineers are likely to enter into dangerous situations. In this paper, we propose a cloud-computing-based architecture to respond rapidly to an SOS emergency event requiring first aid. Our scheme constructs an aid platform based on cloud computing and, on the basis of the features of mobile devices, such as mobility and convenient communication, the injured party/patient can quickly send an SOS and summon aid. In this paper, we propose a scheme with which to accomplish the proxy authorization of the Schnorr signature from the patient. However, security is a very important issue as regards the communication. If an application suffers from a security challenge, the application is not practical. Therefore, the proposed scheme also integrates symmetric encryption technology, a message authentication code and RFC 2631 to defend against known attacks as well as performing an analysis with regards to achieving these security requirements provided by a proxy signature. Finally, we analyze the performance cost to determine whether our scheme is suitable for implementation in an emergency response and SOS system.", "paper_title": "Design and analysis of a secure and effective emergency system for mountaineering events", "paper_id": "WOS:000342468200005"}
