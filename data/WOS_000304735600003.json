This paper develops a methodology to appraise performance of the IA and demonstrate the use in the B2C e-commerce negotiation process. An experiment was conducted to acquire empirical data and a survey was implemented to confirm advantage of the use of the IA. The computational results indicate that the proposed approach successfully evaluates IA performance and significantly distinguishes groups of using (vs. not using) the negotiation mechanism in B2C e-commerce.
