In this paper, a software tool and a configuration of the dissolved oxygen control closed loop are proposed to achieve the aerobic end-point detection of a sequencing batch reactor in a coke wastewater treatment plant. The proposed software tool consists of self-organizing map (SOM) and clustering algorithms. Moreover a validation method for SOM training is outlined and a predefined criterion to determine the SOM size is tested. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
