For state space analysis, it is thus recommendable to consider, in each state, all steps of transitions for firing. Since the number of activated steps may be exponential in the number of transitions, we have, in addition to the well-known state explosion problem, another explosion which we call step explosion. In this paper, we present an approach for alleviating step explosion. We furthermore discuss the joint application of our method with partial order reduction and in the context of CTL model checking.", "paper_title": "On the step explosion problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425800019"}
