We assume that G is given in adjacency list representation and the point/vertex set P is given in an array. We present a property testing algorithm that accepts graph G if it is an EMST of P and that rejects with probability at least 2/3 if G differs from every EMST of P in more than epsilon n edges. Our algorithm runs in O(root n/epsilon . log(2)(n/epsilon)) time and has a query complexity of O(root n/epsilon . log(n/epsilon)).", "paper_title": "Testing Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees in the Plane", "paper_id": "WOS:000265882100007"}
