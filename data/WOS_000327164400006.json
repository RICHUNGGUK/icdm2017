The services are related to genetic analysis, genome data visualization, and pharmacokinetic modeling. Furthermore, business concepts for these services have been examined which are supported by an accounting and billing service. While the tools cover a whole service chain for biomedicine, the business concepts are rather heterogeneous. However, the overall addressed target market areas show promising potential. In addition, a structured coaching process reduces friction in the technology transfer from grid computing to biomedicine. This should be considered for similar future endeavors.
