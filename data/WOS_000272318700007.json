However, mobility makes it more difficult to trace agents. It is also more complex for agents to communicate with each other in a reliable manner. Therefore, a reliable communication protocol is necessary to control and monitor mobile agents and deliver messages between them. In this paper, a new Reliable Communication Protocol (RCP) is proposed for a multiregion mobile agent computing environment. RCP is implemented on the ODDUGI mobile agent system. Analysis and evaluation show that RCP fulfills the following design goals: reliability, asynchrony, timeliness, location dependency, scalability, and communication cost.", "paper_title": "A Reliable Communication Protocol for Multiregion Mobile Agent Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000272318700007"}
