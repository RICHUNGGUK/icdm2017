By analyzing -dimensional lattice-free sets, we prove that for every integer there exists a positive integer such that every facet-defining inequality of the convex hull of a mixed-integer polyhedral set with integer variables is a -branch split cut. We use this result to give a finite cutting-plane algorithm to solve mixed-integer programs. We also show that the minimum value , for which all facets of polyhedral mixed-integer sets with integer variables can be generated as -branch split cuts, grows exponentially with . In particular, when , we observe that not all facet-defining inequalities are 6-branch split cuts.", "paper_title": "Lattice-free sets, multi-branch split disjunctions, and mixed-integer programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000336278500017"}
