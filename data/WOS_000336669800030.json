A clear difference with most of the existing neural network implementations (most of them based on the use of the backpropagation algorithm) is that the C-Mantec automatically generates an adequate neural architecture while the training of the data is performed. All the steps involved in the implementation, including the on-chip learning phase, are fully described and a deep analysis of the results is carried on using the two sets of benchmark problems. The results show a clear increase in the computation speed in comparison to the standard personal computer (PC)-based implementation, demonstrating the usefulness of the intrinsic parallelism of FPGAs in the neurocomputational tasks and the suitability of the hardware version of the C-Mantec algorithm for its application to real-world problems.", "paper_title": "FPGA Implementation of the C-Mantec Neural Network Constructive Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800030"}
