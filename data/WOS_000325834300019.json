The Navier-Stokes equations are solved in the zero-Reynolds-number limit, and the fluid forces acting on particles within the aggregates as well as the aggregates' influence on the fluid flow are evaluated by the discrete methods. Two fluid-flow profiles are considered; uniform plug flow and linear shear flow. The paper compares three methods in their own typical simulation environment. Thus, the results may provide practical guidelines on which methods to chose for certain accuracy requirements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
