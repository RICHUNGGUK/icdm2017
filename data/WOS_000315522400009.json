By exploiting unused timing margin, produced by state-of-the-art worst-case designs, power consumption is minimized. Timing information of the circuit is obtained by in situ delay monitors (Pre-Error flip-flops), detecting late-arriving signals (pre-errors) in critical paths. Based on the occurrence of pre-errors, the voltage is adjusted by a low-overhead control unit connected to the on-chip voltage regulator. As the voltage is adapted during normal circuit operation (on-line), the randomness of the applied input pattern has to be considered. We developed a Markov chain model, based on transistor level simulations, to describe the resulting statistics of the closed-loop voltage control. With this model, the risk of overcritical voltage reductions and the effect of global and local variations on the closed-loop control can be analyzed. For an arithmetic circuit, synthesized in an industrial 65nm design-flow, an average power saving of 23% (including all overheads) is achieved for very low error rates below 1E-11.", "paper_title": "ON-LINE SUPPLY VOLTAGE SCALING BASED ON IN SITU DELAY MONITORING TO ADAPT FOR PVTA VARIATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000315522400009"}
