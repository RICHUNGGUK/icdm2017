In this context, for a series to be stationary it needs to be differentiated a sufficient number of times, where the number of differences is known as the integration order I(d). Classical tests for unit root processes consider an integer order of integration, where the null and alternative hypotheses are I( 1) and I( 0), respectively. However, recently, some research has shown a refinement of these hypotheses where 0 <= d <= 1. This kind of analysis can be obtained through fractional processes, also known as long-memory models. In this work, we propose, for testing unit roots, the use of the semi-parametric estimator of the fractional parameter of the ARFIMA model suggested by Geweke and Porter-Hudak [ Geweke, J. and Porter-Hudak, S., 1983, The estimation and application of long memory time series model. Journal of Time Series Analysis, 4( 4), 221 - 238.], GPH, and a bootstrap version of this test, GPH*. Through Monte Carlo experiments, we observed that the GPH and GPH* tests presented higher power than the classic ADF test [ Said, S. E. and Dickey, D.
