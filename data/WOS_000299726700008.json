This distribution can be used to model survival data when the hazard rate function is increasing, decreasing, bathtub and unimodal-shaped including some distributions commonly used in lifetime analysis as particular cases. Some appropriate matrices are derived in order to evaluate local influence on the estimates of the parameters by considering different perturbations, and some global influence measurements are also investigated. Finally, data set from the medical area is analysed.", "paper_title": "The Conway-Maxwell-Poisson-generalized gamma regression model with long-term survivors", "paper_id": "WOS:000299726700008"}
