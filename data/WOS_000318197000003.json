However, their visual realism has seldom been seriously discussed in the community of human computer interaction, not to mention the challenging balance between their visual/motion realism and real-time performance. In this paper, a novel approach for virtual hand interaction modeling based on dual quaternion is proposed. Specifically, dual quaternion blending (DQB) is introduced as pseudo muscular layer of our virtual hand model instead of traditional linear blending (LB) and quaternion blending (QB) due to its advantages in muscular deformation. A framework for virtual hand interaction is proposed which supports both gesture interactions and 3D manipulations. Experimental results show that our proposed virtual hand interaction model is suitable for most virtual reality applications and achieves good visual/motion realism while maintains real-time performance.", "paper_title": "Dual quaternion based virtual hand interaction modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000318197000003"}
