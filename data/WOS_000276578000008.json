However, none of any application-based research to realize technical efficiency from management engineering perspective was found in literatures. This paper establishes an innovative Path-convoyed design technique not only to identify technical efficiency but also to realize technical progress in different regions. The FDI path identifies technical level increasing trend in Eastern region and declining trend in both Middle and Western regions in China during 1996-2005. TFP growth is mainly attributed to technical progress rather than efficiency improvement in both Eastern and Middle regions. Most importantly, the innovative realizations of technical progress are obtained in Middle and Western provinces with more than 0.8 and 0.65 times of national GDP per capita, respectively.", "paper_title": "IDENTIFICATION AND REALIZATION OF CHANGING TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY BASED ON PATH-CONVERGED DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000008"}
