The MISE proposes an overall MIS design method according to a model-driven approach, based on model transformations. This MIS is in charge of managing (i) information, (ii) functions and (iii) processes among the information systems (IS) of partner organisations involved in the network. Semantic issues are accompanying this triple objective: How to deal with information reconciliation? How to ensure the matching between business functions and technical services? How to identify workflows among business processes? This article aims first at presenting the MISE approach, second at defining the semantic gaps along the MISE approach and third at describing some past, current and future research works that deal with these issues. Finally and as a conclusion, the very design-oriented' previous considerations are confronted with 'runtime' requirements.", "paper_title": "Semantic issues in model-driven management of information system interoperability", "paper_id": "WOS:000326354000005"}
