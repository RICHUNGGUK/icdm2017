To obtain the rating order of technical attributes is a crucial step in applying quality function deployment. Based on the fuzzy soft theory proposed by Maji et al., which is a new mathematical tool to deal with uncertainties, a novel approach is proposed in this paper in order to prioritize technical attributes. We utilize the relative deviation between scores of customer requirements and their average to construct membership function in order to construct fuzzy soft sets. The weights of customer requirements and the final importance of technical attributes are obtained from fuzzy soft sets derived from raw data without other information. An illustrated example is cited to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy soft set-based approach to prioritizing technical attributes in quality function deployment", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800067"}
