We assume a bidirectional information flow between members, and study a class of feedback laws that are implementable with local information available to each member. We first review a unifying passivity framework for the group agreement problem in continuous-time. Then, we extend the results to a class of sampled-data systems by exploiting the passivity properties of the underlying continuous-time system, and prove semiglobal asymptotic stability as the sampling period and a feedback gain are reduced.", "paper_title": "Passivity-based agreement protocols: Continuous-time and sampled-data designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241002300002"}
