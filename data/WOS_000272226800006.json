In addition to fundamental application scalability characteristics, application and system peculiarities often only manifest at extreme scales, requiring highly scalable performance measurement and analysis tools that are convenient to incorporate in application development and tuning activities. We present our experiences with a multigrid solver benchmark and state-of-the-art real-world applications for numerical weather prediction and computational fluid dynamics, on three quite different multi-thousand-processor supercomputer systems - Cray XT3/4, MareNostrum & Blue Gene/L - using the newly-developed SCALASCA toolset to quantify and isolate a range of significant performance issues.", "paper_title": "Performance measurement and analysis of large-scale parallel applications on leadership computing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272226800006"}
