For popular applications, we can expect a huge number of users to both contribute with sensor data and request information from the system. In such scenario, scalability of data processing becomes a major issue. In this paper, we present a system for supporting participatory sensing applications that leverages cluster or cloud infrastructures to provide a scalable data processing infrastructure. We propose and evaluate three strategies for data processing in this architecture.", "paper_title": "Scalable Data Processing for Community Sensing Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000320390100006"}
