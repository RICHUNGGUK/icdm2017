In this model, the learner may query whether a set of vertices induces an edge of the hidden hypergraph or not. We show that an r-uniform hypergraph with m edges and n vertices is learnable with O(2(4r)m. poly (r,logn)) queries with high probability. The queries can be made in O (min(2(r)(logm + r)(2); (logm + r)(3))) rounds. We also give an algorithm that learns an almost uniform hypergraph of dimension r using O(2(O((1 + Delta/2)r)) . m(1 + Delta/2) . poly(logn)) queries with high probability, where Delta is the difference between the maximum and the minimum edge sizes. This upper bound matches our lower bound of Omega((m/1 + Delta/2)(1 + Delta/2)) for this class of hypergraphs in terms of dependence on m. The queries can also be made in O((1 + Delta) . min (2(r)(logm + r)(2), (logm + r)(3))) rounds.", "paper_title": "Learning a hidden hypergraph", "paper_id": "WOS:000245390500010"}
