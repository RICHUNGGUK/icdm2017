Our proposed approach, called Chain Based Relocation Approach (CBRA), aims to relocate a minimum number of redundant sensors from their initial positions within the ROI towards the COI to maintain the connectivity between the ROI and the COI. CBRA uses steps which determine the redundant nodes' set, the propagation of the COI coordinates within the ROI and then the selection and the relocation of the redundant nodes towards the COI. The selection of the redundant nodes is based on an average energy consumption model to balance the energy consumption among the sensor nodes when they are relocated depending on their initial and final positions. We evaluate the performance of CBRA using performance metrics such as energy consumption, the number of relocated nodes, relocation time and number of transmitted messages. Sensor nodes are relocated using a chain-based method between the ROI and the COI. In addition, if one relocated sensor node fails, the connectivity between the COI and the ROI is affected. To address this possible failure, we propose a fault tolerant recovery procedure to repair the route between the COI and the ROI. Finally, we compare the performance of CBRA with two other approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
