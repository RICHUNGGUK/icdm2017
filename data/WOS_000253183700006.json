In this paper, the associative theory is adopted as an underlying need awaring methodology. To show the feasibility of the methodology proposed in this paper, a prototype system has been implemented. Moreover, while prior prototype-based approaches have focused on whether the system is workable, they have not focused on capacity analysis such as scalability. Hence, to test if our proposed need-awaring methodology will work in real world situations, another purpose of this paper is to examine the quality analysis about the implemented need-awaring reminder service in terms of scalability.
