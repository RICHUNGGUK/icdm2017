The proposed charge pump is designed in 0.18 mu m 1.8V standard CMOS process with high voltage boosting efficiency when the supply voltage is between 0.5 V and 1.8 V. Moreover, it eliminates the body effect by means of adding two auxiliary substrate switching PMOS transistor. The simulation results show that the proposed charge pump has higher efficiency than the other two low voltage charge pumps when the resistive load is 100 M ohm and the supply voltage is between 0.5 and 1.8 V. A test chip has been realized in a 0.18 mu m 1.8V standard CMOS process. The test results show perfect performance when the supply voltage is between 0.7 and 1.8 V. The proposed charge pump is quite suitable for low power applications.", "paper_title": "ULTRA-LOW-VOLTAGE GAIN-ENHANCED FOUR-PHASE CHARGE PUMP WITHOUT BODY EFFECT", "paper_id": "WOS:000341242100014"}
