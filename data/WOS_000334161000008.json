These systems are large networked systems of systems, in which a component system may itself be a grid. In this paper we survey the current state of the art of CPS security, identify the issues surrounding secure control, and investigate the extent to which context information may be used to improve security and survivability of CPS.", "paper_title": "Context-Aware Security Solutions for Cyber-Physical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000334161000008"}
