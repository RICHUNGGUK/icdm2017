For many problems, more than one protocol exists, such that one protocol performs better in one environment while the other performs better in another. In such cases, adaptive distributed systems can be designed by dynamically switching between the protocols as the environment changes. In this work we propose an adaptive distributed mutual exclusion scheme that dynamically switches between two token based distributed mutual exclusion protocols; the Raymond's algorithm [15] and the Martin's algorithm [13]. Algorithms are proposed for switching in both directions and their correctness are proved. For each switching algorithm, it is shown that no more than one node can access the shared resource during the switching and no deadlock happens during the switching.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE DISTRIBUTED MUTUAL EXCLUSION BY DYNAMIC TOPOLOGY SWITCHING", "paper_id": "WOS:000289639700012"}
