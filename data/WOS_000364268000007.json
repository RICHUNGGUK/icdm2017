Some of these protocols avoid the state in intermediate routers and leave the burden of scalability management to the multicast source and end-hosts. Still, the existing BF-based protocols have scalability limitations and require explicit network management as well as non-trivial functionality from the network components. In this work we address the scalability limitations of the BF-based forwarding protocols by partitioning endhosts into clusters. We propose several algorithms to do the partitioning so as to decrease the overall traffic in the network. We evaluate our algorithms in a real Internet topology, demonstrating the ability of the proposed design to save up to 70% of traffic volume in the large-scale topology for big groups of subscribers, and up to 30% for small groups.
