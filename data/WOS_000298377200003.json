We focus on the case when the underlying graphs are trees with back-edges and provide both theoretical and experimental analysis of this class of games. In particular, we present an algorithm that solves Buchi games played on trees with back-edges in time O(min{r.m,l+m}) where m is the number of edges, l is the sum of the distances from the root to all leaves and the parameter r is bounded by the height of the tree. We also show that parity games played on trees with back-edges can be solved in time O(l + m).", "paper_title": "Efficient Algorithms for Games Played on Trees with Back-edges", "paper_id": "WOS:000298377200003"}
