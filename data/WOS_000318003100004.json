Different from the existing models, the present ANN contains the multiply-threshold neurons, the discrete charge-controlled memristors, and a new learning law named the max-input-feedback (MIF). We shall demonstrate the processes of the associative learning and associative correcting via a modified Pavlov experiment where more conditioning factors are considered. We also make some comparisons of MIF with spike-timing-dependent plasticity and back-propagation and show that MIF learning law is suitable to fast learning.", "paper_title": "Associate learning and correcting in a memristive neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000318003100004"}
