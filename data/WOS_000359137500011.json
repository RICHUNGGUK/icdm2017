However, in an open network, uncontrolled sharing and transmission mode of digital content between users create considerable problems regarding digital rights management (DRM). This paper aims to explore potential paths on the propagation of copyrighted contents. An approach to mining credible potential paths is proposed for MSNs. The formal descriptions were primarily based on rough set theory for mining potential paths. Trust was also measured to find credible potential paths. We presented related algorithms for mining two kinds of paths between any two nodes. Finally, we conducted an experiment based on three non-overlapped sharing communities multiplied by 150 nodes. In the communities found by using a representative real-world MSN YouTube dataset, we further mine the general and credible potential paths based on the simulated trust assessment values. The proposed method could effectively and accurately mine two kinds of potential paths of copyrighted digital content distribution and sharing, which can help to resolve critical DRM issues.", "paper_title": "A Formal Analytic Approach to Credible Potential Path and Mining Algorithms for Multimedia Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359137500011"}
