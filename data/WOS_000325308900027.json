By using Lyapunov functionals, some new results are provided. The obtained results show that impulses can stochastically stabilize an unstable discrete-time Markovian jump delay neural network. The obtained results also show that the stability property of the impulse-free neural network can be retained even under certain destabilizing impulses. Two examples together with their simulations are also presented to show the effectiveness and the advantage of the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
