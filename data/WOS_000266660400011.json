BOUT solves for time evolution of plasma fluid variables: plasma density N(i), parallel ion velocity V(parallel to i), electron temperature T(e), ion temperature T(i), electric potential phi, parallel current j(parallel to), and parallel vector potential A(parallel to), in realistic 3D divertor tokamak geometry. The current status of the code, physics model, algorithms, and implementation is described. Results of verification testing are presented along with illustrative applications to tokamak edge turbulence. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
