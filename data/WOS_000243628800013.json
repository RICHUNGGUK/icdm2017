The integration of different frameworks is the purpose of this paper since a unified framework is necessary in the situation where the efficient analysis of both spatial and spectral correlations is needed at the same time. This unified framework also provides a remedy for a limitation of multivariate image analysis (MIA), namely the loss of spatial information in the images. The unified framework, multiresolutional multivariate image analysis (MR-MIA), is illustrated visually through the decomposition of a simple color image, and then used in a quantitative manner for color-textured image classification where the extraction of both spatial and spectral information is necessary. The performance of MR-MIA approaches are shown to be equal to or better than that of wavelet texture analysis, while employing a smaller number of features, and maintaining computational complexity at the same level. Wavelet texture analysis is shown to be a limiting case of one form of MR-MIA. The true advantages of MR-MIA will be most evident when analyzing hyperspectral images having a large number of spectral bands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
