First, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is used to represent the state-space model of nonlinear discrete-time systems with time delays. Next, we design a stable fuzzy H. filter based on the T-S fuzzy model, which guarantees asymptotic stability and a prescribed H(infinity) index for the filtering error system, irrespective of the time delays and uncertain disturbances. A sufficient condition for the existence of such a filter is established by using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. The proposed LMI problem can be efficiently solved with global convergence guarantee using convex optimization techniques such as the interior point algorithm. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the design procedure of the present method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy H(infinity) filter design for a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems with multiple time delay's", "paper_id": "WOS:000247285300012"}
