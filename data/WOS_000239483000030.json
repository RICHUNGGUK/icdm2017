The face area is divided into small regions, from which local binary pattern(LBP) histograms are extracted and concatenated into a single vector efficiently representing the facial image. The classification is performed by using support vector machines(SVMS), which had been shown to be superior to traditional pattern classifiers in gender classification problem. The experiments clearly show the superiority of the proposed method over support gray faces on the CASPEAL face database and a highest correct classification rate of 96.75% is obtained. In addition, the simplicity of the proposed method leads to very fast feature extraction, and the regional histograms and global description of the face allow for multi-view gender classification.", "paper_title": "Multi-view gender classification using local binary patterns and support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000030"}
