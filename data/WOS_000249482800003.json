In this paper, we study recent trends in the provision of optimisation tools and optimisation-based decision support systems (DSS) as web-enabled distributed applications. We analyse the evolution from the Application Service Provision (ASP) model to the e-Services model, and we illustrate the importance of distributed optimisation components in the effective deployment of embedded \"business analytics\". We finally provide an overview of the OSP and the WEBOPT projects, which deliver optimisation-based applications and optimisation components in a distributed environment. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
