We introduce a collection of techniques that address issues of convergence, robustness, sample complexity, computational complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. This paper explores a number of implementations of the NES family, such as general-purpose multi-variate normal distributions and separable distributions tailored towards search in high dimensional spaces. Experimental results show best published performance on various standard benchmarks, as well as competitive performance on others.", "paper_title": "Natural Evolution Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000335458100004"}
