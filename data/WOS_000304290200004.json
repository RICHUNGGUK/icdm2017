To this aim, the learning problem of a FNN is cast into a robust output feedback control problem of a discrete time-varying linear dynamic system. New robust learning algorithms with adaptive learning rate are therefore developed, using linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques to find the appropriate learning rates and to guarantee the fast and robust convergence. Theoretical analysis and examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
