The gene expression profiles from 6 patients with CC and 5 normal controls were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and compared. As a result, 204 differentially co-expressed genes (DCGs) in cc patients compared to normal controls were identified using a computational bioinformatics analysis. These genes were mainly involved in coenzyme metabolic process, peptidase activity and oxidation reduction. A regulatory network was constructed by mapping the DCGs to known regulation data. Four transcription factors, FOXC1, ZIC2, NKX2-2 and GCGR, were hub nodes in the network. In conclusion, this study provides a set of targets useful for future investigations into molecular biomarker studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
