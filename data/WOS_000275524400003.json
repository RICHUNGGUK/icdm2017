The proposed model consists of two delay differential equations (DDEs) where five adjustable parameters are used to characterize the respective dynamics and oscillation behavior of normal and diabetic subjects. Several clinical data tests demonstrate that the suggested model is practical to approach the daily-life glucose dynamics on normal, diabetic Type 1 and Type 2 subjects. Moreover, the corresponding parameters are fairly persuasive to identify the patients' conditions of physiological functions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
