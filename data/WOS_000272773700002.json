In this paper, we proposed a channel reconfiguration technique to combat the rank deficiency problem of the involved MIMO wireless channels that can not afford high-order multiplexing gains. In the proposed approach, each mobile station can Simultaneously receive several independent data streams from multiple base stations through a set of MMSE-based receive beamformers to suppress the multiple access interferences. Making use of the receive beamforming, which virtually produce the effect of a single antenna at each receive mobile, makes the transmit base station possible to reconfigure the MIMO downlink channel and then pre-cancel the co-channel interferences. The proposed signal processing mechanism that iteratively optimized the MMSE receive weights and the transmit precoders, which brings the reconfigured MIMO system about the high data throughput seen only with indoor MIMO systems having rich wireless channels. It is shown that as compared to the conventional MIMO system, the M4 system can achieve a significantly higher capacity which is proportional to the number of the linked base stations.", "paper_title": "Use Channel Reconfiguration Technique to Improve the Spatial Multiplexing Gain of MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773700002"}
