We propose a novel approach for multiperson tracking-by-detection in a particle filtering framework. In addition to final high-confidence detections, our algorithm uses the continuous confidence of pedestrian detectors and online-trained, instance-specific classifiers as a graded observation model. Thus, generic object category knowledge is complemented by instance-specific information. The main contribution of this paper is to explore how these unreliable information sources can be used for robust multiperson tracking. The algorithm detects and tracks a large number of dynamically moving people in complex scenes with occlusions, does not rely on background modeling, requires no camera or ground plane calibration, and only makes use of information from the past. Hence, it imposes very few restrictions and is suitable for online applications. Our experiments show that the method yields good tracking performance in a large variety of highly dynamic scenarios, such as typical surveillance videos, webcam footage, or sports sequences. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other methods that rely on additional information. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of different algorithm components on the robustness.", "paper_title": "Online Multiperson Tracking-by-Detection from a Single, Uncalibrated Camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000292740000009"}
