They also reflect on the features of the currently available information managers, from an educational point of view. They found there is a lack of tools for information management at low scale when it has to be used as a resource for teaching and learning whether at secondary or university level. Finally, they propose a solution, which consists of naming a 'small virtual educational library' (SVEL), and they show how it works in Physics education context. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
