The proposed method models the interaction capability of the devices. The interaction is modeled by categorizing elementary actions and measuring its effect in semantic behaviors. With this model, an interaction process can be modified to a given device by changing sequence of elementary actions for each behavior. In the pilot test, we showed the possibility of interaction adaptation for different situations. With the proposed adaptation mechanism, interface and interaction can be modeled for the device independently and can be transferred over different interaction environments.
