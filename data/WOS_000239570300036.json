The algorithm extends the Query Server with Caching algorithm that we proposed earlier, with support of message routing in the wide-area networks. Our algorithm is suitable for two kinds of PAs collaboration: (1) within a local group of mobile individuals, who can communicate frequently using different computers connected to a local-area network (possibly via a wireless medium), and (2) some individuals may also communicate via the global network and move to other groups.", "paper_title": "Scalable message routing for mobile software assistants", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300036"}
