An estimating equation-based inference procedure is developed for the model parameters, and the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established. In addition, a lack-of-fit test is presented to assess the adequacy of the model. The finite sample behavior of the proposed estimators is evaluated through simulation studies, and an application to a clinic study on chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is illustrated.
