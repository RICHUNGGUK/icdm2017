Most existing approaches have limitations due to incomparability between decisions or ties due to the use of some aggregation operations that produce a ranking. The natural way of overcoming the lack. of discrimination power is to refine the obtained ranking. We bring an overview of methods that enable aggregation-based rankings to be refined, generalizing concepts like discrimin (max), leximin (max), and Lorentz orderings that refine such aggregation operations like the minimum (the maximum) and the sum.", "paper_title": "Refining aggregation operator-based orderings in multifactorial evaluation - Part I: Continuous scales", "paper_id": "WOS:000251699000008"}
