Based on Gray mapping and the known binary ZCZ sequences, in this letter, six families of 16-QAM sequences with ZCZ are presented. When the binary ZCZ sequences employed by this letter arrive at the theoretical bound on the binary ZCZ sequences, and their family size is a multiple of 4 or 2, two of the resultant six 16-QAM sequence sets satisfy the bound referred to above as well.", "paper_title": "16-QAM Sequences with Zero Correlation Zone from the Known Binary ZCZ Sequences and Gray Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300052"}
