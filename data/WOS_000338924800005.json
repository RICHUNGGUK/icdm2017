Cross talk stemming from the blocked packets, due to the nonideal switching performed by the SOA-MZIs, is analyzed in every stage of the routing configuration. The routing functions and states performance are evaluated through bit-error ratio measurements and extinction ratio analysis.", "paper_title": "Experimental Analysis of an All-Optical Packet Router", "paper_id": "WOS:000338924800005"}
