In kanban system, decision making is based on determination of the number of kanbans as well as batch sizes. This paper attempts to model supply chain system with regard to costs under just-in-time (JIT) production philosophy. Since adopted model is of mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) type and solving it by exact algorithm such as branch and bound (B&B) takes a lot of time, a heuristic method via Memetic algorithm (MA) is presented. Some problems are solved by our proposed MA to illustrate its performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
