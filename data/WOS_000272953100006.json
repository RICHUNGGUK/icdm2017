Localization is a necessary step for automation of curved plate fabrication that aligns a designed shape with a fabricated one as closely as possible for comparison of their shapes. On top of this localization, various conditions are introduced to reflect requirements occurring during fabrication such as minimum cutting length, maintenance of cutting length, localization for non-penetration and data types for localization. Each condition is formulated as a constraint which is provided as input to the optimization problem for localization. Algorithms for localization with each constraint based on iteration are proposed. Examples are used to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
