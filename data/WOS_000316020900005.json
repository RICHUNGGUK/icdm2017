Self-stabilization is a general technique that permits to recover from catastrophic transient failures in self-organized networks without human intervention. We propose a fully distributed self-stabilizing approximation algorithm for the MLST problem in arbitrary topology networks. Our algorithm is the first self-stabilizing protocol that is specifically designed to approximate an MLST. It builds a solution whose number of leaves is at least 1/3 of the maximum possible in arbitrary graphs. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(n (2)) rounds.", "paper_title": "A self-stabilizing 3-approximation for the maximum leaf spanning tree problem in arbitrary networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316020900005"}
