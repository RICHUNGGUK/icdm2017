Presently, the reference implementation for SDN architecture is reliant upon a single controller to push flow rules to all SDN-enabled switches in the network, creating a performance bottleneck and single-point of failure in large networks. To provide a scalable yet efficient solution to distributed SDN network management, we propose FlowBroker, a hierarchical brokering agent layer which manages and coordinates among distributed SDN controllers, where each controller is charged with the flow-rule maintenance of the switches in its managed domain. This paper proposes the FlowBroker architecture as a collaborative multi-domain approach to load balancing and network performance enhancement in software-defined networks. Moreover, we introduce distributed machine learning agents to allow controllers to evaluate which brokers are more advantageous than others, from a performance-based reputation perspective. Simulation results show that the FlowBroker architecture, with broker-based collaborative load-balancing and controller-based distributed reputation, can significantly increase the network performance of a multi-domain software-defined network. FlowBroker yields significant reductions in traffic loss, end-to-end delay and maximum link utilization when cooperative brokering and reputation are utilized.", "paper_title": "FlowBroker: A Software-Defined Network Controller Architecture for Multi-Domain Brokering and Reputation", "paper_id": "WOS:000350554900005"}
