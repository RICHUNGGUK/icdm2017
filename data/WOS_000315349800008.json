The free energies are consistent with available experimental results and suggest that the binding site of BSA-drug1 is more stable than those of BSA-drug2 and BSA-drug3. The energy decomposition analysis is performed and reveals that the electrostatic interactions play an important role in the stabilization of the binding site of BSA-drug1 while the van der Waals interactions contribute largely to stabilization of the binding site of BSA-drug2 and BSA-drug3. The key residues stabilizing the binding sites of BSA-drug1, BSA-drug2 and BSA-drug3 are identified based on the residue decomposition analysis.", "paper_title": "Insight into the dynamic interaction between different flavonoids and bovine serum albumin using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000315349800008"}
