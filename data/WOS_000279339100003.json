Analytical and experimental results show the relevance of the Window-game to real TCP congestion games and provide interesting insight into the respective Nash equilibria. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithmic queue mechanism, called Prince, which at congestion makes a scapegoat of the most greedy flow. We provide evidence which shows that Prince achieves efficient Nash equilibria while requiring only limited computational resources. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
