We obtain parameterized subexponential-time algorithms for p-KAGG-a problem in social choice theory-and for p-OSCM-a problem in graph drawing. These algorithms run in time O*(2(O(root klogk))), where k is the parameter, and significantly improve the previous best algorithms with running times O*(1.403(k)) and O*(1.4656(k)), respectively. We also study natural \"above-guarantee\" versions of these problems and show them to be fixed parameter tractable. In fact, we show that the above-guarantee versions of these problems are equivalent to a weighted variant of p-directed feedback arc set. Our results for the above-guarantee version of p-KAGG reveal an interesting contrast. We show that when the number of \"votes\" in the input to p-KAGG is odd the above guarantee version can still be solved in time OX(2(O(root klogk))), while if it is even then the problem cannot have a subexponential time algorithm unless the exponential time hypothesis fails (equivalently, unless FPT = M[1]).", "paper_title": "Social Choice Meets Graph Drawing: How to Get Subexponential Time Algorithms for Ranking and Drawing Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000364488600007"}
