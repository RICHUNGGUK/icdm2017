It is exactly invertible with both the forward and inverse transforms requiring only the addition operation. Over the last 10 years it has found many applications including image watermarking and encryption, tomographic reconstruction, robust data transmission and distributed data storage. This paper presents an elegant and efficient algorithm to directly apply the inverse Mojette transform. The method is derived from the inter-dependance of the \"rational\" projection vectors (p(i), q(i)) which define the direction of projection over the parallel set of lines b = p(i)l - q(i)k. Projection values are acquired by summing the value of image pixels, f (k, l), centered on these lines. The new inversion is up to 5 times faster than previously proposed methods and solves the redundancy issues of these methods.", "paper_title": "A geometry driven reconstruction algorithm for the Mojette transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000241649600011"}
