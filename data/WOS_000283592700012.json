In this paper, we focused on the relationship between the sucking pressure and the flow dynamics when gap distance from the cup to a work piece changes. Then simultaneous measurement of a pressure and a flow field in the cup was performed. As a result, the mean pressure changes and the pressure fluctuation inside the cup enhances with increasing gap height. Especially, periodic pressure perturbation is observed with wide gap height and it synchronizes with an eccentric rotation of the swirling flow. It is also found that the rotation axis of swirling flow steadily inclines against the central axis of the cup for appropriate gap height.", "paper_title": "Performance of a non-contact handling device using swirling flow with various gap height", "paper_id": "WOS:000283592700012"}
