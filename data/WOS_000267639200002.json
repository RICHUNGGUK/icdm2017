Unlike existing algorithms, the rate of change of tray specific enthalpy is obtained analytically. This allows direct calculation of the instantaneous vapor rate leaving a tray from the dynamic energy balance. Application to an example methyl acetate RD column shows that the developed algorithm is twice as fast as the algorithm of Jhon and Lee [Jhon, Y. H., & Lee, T. H. (2003).
