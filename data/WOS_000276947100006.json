These renewable energy technologies are called with its source such as solar power, wind power, hydropower, geothermal and biomass. Energy resources are so important in perspective of economics and politics for all countries. Hence, the selection of the best alternative for any country takes an important role for energy investments. In this paper, axiomatic design (AD) methodology is suggested for the selection among renewable energy alternatives under fuzzy environment. AD methodology works under fuzziness which evaluates the alternatives under objective or subjective criteria with respect to the functional requirements obtained from experts. In the application of the proposed methodologies the most appropriate renewable energy alternative is determined for Turkey under fuzziness.", "paper_title": "Selection among Renewable Energy Alternatives Using Fuzzy Axiomatic Design: The Case of Turkey", "paper_id": "WOS:000276947100006"}
