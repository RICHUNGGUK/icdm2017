The hybrid resonant structure is a dual-plane structure which is an effective combination of a pair of microstrip stepped impedance resonators on the top layer and two nested dual-mode defected ground structure resonators on the bottom layer. A triband BPF adopting this hybrid resonant structure was presented which was operating at 2.4/5.7 GHz (wireless local area network application) and 3.5 GHz (worldwide interoperability for microwave access application). The size of this filter is only 0.14(0) x 0.11(0). (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
