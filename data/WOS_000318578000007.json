Two concepts, structural destroyed mode and data correlation, are given and discussed. The structural destroyed mode refers to the pattern of certain structural state or situation that some kind of failure occurred. The study on data correlation focuses on the relations existed between different sensors and locations. A structural safety monitoring system for a simply supported beam including several damage indices is built, and the numerical experiment shows it works effectively.", "paper_title": "A NEW STRATEGY FOR STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING BASED ON STRUCTURAL DESTROYED MODE AND DATA CORRELATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578000007"}
