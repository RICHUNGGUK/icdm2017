As with ring theory, one method to deal with complexity is to look at semisimplicity modulo radical structures. We find some bounds on the Jacobson 2-radical and show that in certain groups, this radical can be explicitly found and the semisimple image determined.", "paper_title": "J(2) RADICAL IN AUTOMATA NEARRINGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000341493500005"}
