In particular for an active RFID system, tags are powered by small batteries, and a large number of re-transmissions caused by collisions can deteriorate and exhaust the tag energy which may result in missing tags. An efficient collision-free arbitration protocol for active RFID systems is proposed in this paper. In this protocol, a new mechanism involving collision detection, collision avoidance, and fast tag access is introduced. Specifically, the pulse burst duration and busy-tone-detection delay are introduced between the preamble and data portion of a tag-to-reader (T-R) frame. The reader identifies tag collision by detecting pulses and transmits a busy tone to avoid unnecessary transmission when collision occurs. A polling process is then designed to quickly access the collided tags. It is shown that the use of the proposed protocol results in a system throughput of 0.612, which is an obvious improvement when compared to the framed-slotted ALOHA (FSA) arbitration protocol for ISO/IEC 18000-7 standard. Furthermore, the proposed protocol greatly reduces communication overhead, which leads to energy conservation.", "paper_title": "Collision-Free Arbitration Protocol for Active RFID Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000301401500006"}
