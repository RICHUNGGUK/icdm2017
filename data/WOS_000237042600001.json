When modelled and used to animate artificial creature, these laws makes these creatures (either virtual or robotic) move in a much more realistic, life-like, fashion.", "paper_title": "Perception and synthesis of biologically plausible motion: From human physiology to virtual reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000237042600001"}
