The resulting hierarchical rule base is constructed by using structure building pure evolutionary and memetic techniques, namely, Genetic and Bacterial Programming Algorithms and their memetic variants containing local search steps. Applying hierarchical-interpolative fuzzy rule bases is a rather efficient way of reducing the complexity of knowledge bases, whereas evolutionary methods (including memetic techniques) ensure a relatively fast convergence in the learning process. As it is presented in the paper, by applying a newly proposed representation schema these approaches can be combined to form hierarchical-interpolative machine learning systems.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL-INTERPOLATIVE FUZZY SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION BY GENETIC AND BACTERIAL MEMETIC PROGRAMMING APPROACHES", "paper_id": "WOS:000308710000006"}
