The analysis indicates wide dispersions in operational efficiency, industry and region differences, large differences in labor budgets between efficient and inefficient firms, few organizations efficient in both refresh processing and query production, and difficulty of providing some variables. Follow-up interviews provide insights about the value of efficiency comparisons of information technology organizations and suggestions to improve the model. Using this analysis, we propose a framework containing data warehouse characteristics and firm characteristics to explain IT operational efficiency at the subfirm level. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
