An input HDR image is firstly decomposed into a base layer and a detail layer by an improved guided filtering method. For the base layer, its dynamic range is compressed by the simulated camera response function. For the detail layer, it is enhanced to produce more fine structures and reduce halo effect by applying the guided image filter. The colour balance correction method is adopted to suppress colour distortion. The experiments on HDR images demonstrate that the proposed technique could bring better brightness, contrast, and visibility with less halo effect than other state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in most cases.", "paper_title": "Tone mapping based on fast image decomposition and multi-layer fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000364485000017"}
