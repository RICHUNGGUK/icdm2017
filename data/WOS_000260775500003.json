Software measurement program implementations sometimes fail, and this failure is frequently caused by their definition: the measurement program does not provide the required information, the data required are difficult to obtain and so on. The definition of measurement programs is even less encouraging in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), since most of the outstanding measurement program models are not suited to these types of companies. Additionally, the literature provides few cases of measurement program implementation, which could be used as a source of reference for good practices through which to successfully perform these activities. A measurement program definition framework suited to SMEs called MIS-PyME is used to implement a measurement program in the software development and maintenance department of a medium company. The result of this measurement program and the good practices detected from this experience are expounded, along with the benefits obtained using MIS-PyME in contrast to our previous experiences of using the goal question indicator metric.", "paper_title": "Implementing a software measurement program in small and medium enterprises: a suitable framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000260775500003"}
