Application in medical decision support has produced promising results. However, model features and parameters may vary geo- or demographically. Therefore methods are needed that allow for easy adjustment of the model to a change in conditions. We present a method to represent causal probabilistic networks generically that maximizes the transferability of a models relevance and completeness, when moved from one environment to another, and illustrate application of the method with an example from a medical decision support system.
