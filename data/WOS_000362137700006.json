However, there is an increasing demand for database applications that require access to heterogeneous loosely-coupled distributed data sources. This paper presents a hybrid benchmark based on TPC-H where the data sources are heterogeneous. Specifically, the paper describes the design of the relational and XML data sources as well as the query redesign in the LINQ query language, which supports queries over heterogeneous data sources. The results of a performance evaluation of the hybrid benchmark over various database products is included for untyped and typed XML with and without clearing the database cache.
