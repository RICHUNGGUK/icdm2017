This assumption may not be reliable since in reality the barge is flexible. Having incorrect ballast plan may lead to overstressing of the loaded-out structure. We present a method of finding a more accurate ballast plan, taking into account the flexibility of the barge. This method makes use of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find the optimum ballast arrangement at every load-out stage. We model the load-out configuration as a beam on elastic foundation, loaded with distributed trapezoidal loading representing the load from the structure. Minimizing deflection and curvature of the beam, as well as maximizing the ballast transfer efficiency between the load-out stages are chosen as the objectives of the algorithm. It is shown that the proposed method is better than the conventional rigid barge method in terms of minimizing the deflection and curvature as well as maximizing the ballast transfer efficiency.", "paper_title": "Optimization of ballast plan in launch jacket load-out", "paper_id": "WOS:000264330500004"}
