Through the fingerprints of medicinal herbs by wavelet transform and the fractal dimensions, 13 features are obtained, which are called fractal-wavelet features. In this new approach, the information of each sample can be acquired to the maximum degree. These novel hybrid features have been applied to recognition of the different types of ginseng. Experiments have been conducted, and the result of recognition can match the real situation. Experiments indicate this method is better than the traditional ones.
