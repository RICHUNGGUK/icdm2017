Results are first provided for asimulated camera system and then verified through carefully controlled experiments using real-world measurements. Our aims are to provide suggestions to researchers who require an immediate solution for camera calibration and a warning of the practical difficulties one may encounter in a real environment. In addition, we offer some insight into the factors to keep in mind when selecting a calibration technique. Finally, we hope that this paper can serve as an introduction to the field for those newly embarking upon calibration-related research.", "paper_title": "An empirical evaluation of factors influencing camera calibration accuracy using three publicly available techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000236382400005"}
