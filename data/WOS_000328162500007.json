The key component for supporting multimedia application well is embedded processor. Thus, we have designed and implemented an embedded processor, called UniDual processor, to achieve this objective. Its key features are the integration of instructions of reduced instruction set computers (RISCs) and digital signal processors (DSPs) as well as the support of special instruction set and shared-based clustered register architecture. However, an important issue of UniDual that remains open is how to efficiently allocate registers.In this paper, we present a scheduling and instruction transformation approach to resolve the aforementioned issue. The proposed approach schedules instructions and then transforms overlapped instructions into RISC and DSP instructions by taking communication overhead and hardware limitations into account. Compared with the greedy approach, the evaluation shows that our work is relatively effective in performance and code size reduction.
