This paper presents an original method to generate large atlases of leaves with many details from a single formal grammar. Leaves are described by a parameterized 2Gmap L-system that describes their evolution in shape and texture through out their entire life cycle. Our approach automatically synthesizes the deformations as well as the color and texture changes as the leaves age, as well as defects such as holes or cracks produced by insect attacks or accidents.", "paper_title": "Generating vast varieties of realistic leaves with parametric 2Gmap L-systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257384800036"}
