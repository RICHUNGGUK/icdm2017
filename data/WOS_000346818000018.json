The peak point queue (PPQ) is used to adaptively determine the embedding level and achieve superior quality in the marked image. In respect to data reversion key for the double protection, our approach, named Athena, makes better utilization of the overhead information and allows users to exchange the key based on a public key infrastructure (PKI). Our experimental results show that the method is capable of providing a better quality image for a range of different test images of various sizes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
