In an effort to understand the perceived lower limits of intelligible sign language video intended for mobile communication, we evaluated sign language video transmitted at four low frame rates (1, 5, 10, and 15 frames per second [fps]) and four low fixed bit rates (15, 30, 60, and 120 kilobits per second [kbps]) at a constant spatial resolution of 320 x 240 pixels. We discovered an \"intelligibility ceiling effect,\" in which increasing the frame rate above 10fps did not improve perceived intelligibility, and increasing the bit rate above 60kbps produced diminishing returns. Given the study parameters, our findings suggest that relaxing the recommended frame rate and bit rate to 10fps at 60kbps will provide intelligible video conversations while reducing total bandwidth consumption to 25% of the ITU-T standard (at least 25fps and 100kbps). As part of this work, we developed the Human Signal Intelligibility Model, a new conceptual model useful for informing evaluations of video intelligibility and our methodology for creating linguistically accessible web surveys for deaf people. We also conducted a battery-savings experiment quantifying battery drain when sign language video is transmitted at the lower frame rates and bit rates. Results confirmed that increasing the transmission rates monotonically decreased the battery life.", "paper_title": "Evaluating Intelligibility and Battery Drain of Mobile Sign Language Video Transmitted at Low Frame Rates and Bit Rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000367988400004"}
