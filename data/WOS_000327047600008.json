However, current approaches to content routing heavily rely on data-driven protocol events and thereby introduce a strong coupling of the control to the data plane in the underlying routing infrastructure. In this paper, threats to the stability and security of the content distribution system are analyzed in theory, simulations, and practical experiments. We derive relations between state resources and the performance of routers, and demonstrate how this coupling can be misused in practice. We further show how state-based forwarding tends to degrade by decorrelating resources. We identify intrinsic attack vectors present in current content-centric routing, as well as possibilities and limitations to mitigate them. Our overall findings suggest that major architectural refinements are required prior to global ICN deployment in the real world. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
