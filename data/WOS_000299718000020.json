The reseeding method removes the short periods of the digitized logistic map and the mixing method extends the system period length to 2(253) by \"xoring\" with a DX generator. When implemented in the TSMC 0.18-mu m 1P6M CMOS process, the new reseeding-mixing PRNG (RM-PRNG) attains the best throughput rate of 6.4 Gb/s compared with other nonlinear PRNGs. In addition, the generated random sequences pass the NIST SP 800-22 statistical tests including ratio test and U-value test.", "paper_title": "Period Extension and Randomness Enhancement Using High-Throughput Reseeding-Mixing PRNG", "paper_id": "WOS:000299718000020"}
