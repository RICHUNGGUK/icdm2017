The excellent properties of the method are: (1) Locality: the perturbation of a given vertex only influences the surface shape near this vertex. (2) Efficiency: the locations of new points can be computed with explicit formulae. (3) Easiness in implementation: only the geometric rule of the first step should be modified. (4) Freedom: for each edge, there is one degree of freedom to adjust the shape of the interpolation surface. (5) Easiness in generalization: it is easy to generalize our method to other approximation subdivision schemes with explicit formulae to compute limit point.", "paper_title": "Interpolating triangular meshes by Loop subdivision scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000281150500006"}
