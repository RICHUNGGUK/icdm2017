Thus, infrastructures and tools that support multiagent systems are needed, especially those that promote the adoption of agent-based systems by designers and programmers in both academia and industry. This special issue is a selection of contributions whose preliminary versions were presented at the ITMAS 2010 workshop, which was held in conjunction with the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems.
