We then prove that this system enjoys the Church-Rosser property using a semi-automatic 'divide and conquer' technique by which we determine all the pairs of commuting subsystems of the formalism (considering all the possible combinations of the nine primitive reduction rules). Finally, we prove a separation theorem similar to Bohm's theorem for the whole formalism.", "paper_title": "The lambda-calculus with constructors: Syntax, confluence and separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000270762600005"}
