In the proposed model, it is assumed that the actual processing time of a job of the first (second) agent is a decreasing function of the sum-of-processing-times-based learning (or increasing function of the sum-of-processing-times-based deteriorating effect) in a schedule. The aim of this paper is to find an optimal schedule to minimize the total weighted completion time of the jobs of the first agent with the restriction that no tardy job is allowed for the second agent. For the proposed model, we develop a branch-and-bound and some ant colony algorithms for an optimal and near-optimal solution, respectively. Besides, the extensive computational experiments are also proposed to test the performance of the algorithms.", "paper_title": "Ant colony algorithms for a two-agent scheduling with sum-of processing times-based learning and deteriorating considerations", "paper_id": "WOS:000308820200039"}
