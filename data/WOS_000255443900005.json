In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of finding all steady states of genetic regulatory networks described by piecewise-linear differential equation (PLDE) models. We show that the problem is NP-hard and translate it into the problem of finding all valuations of a propositional satisfiability (SAT) formula. This allows the use of existing, efficient SAT solvers and has enabled the development of a steady state search module of the computer tool Genetic Network Analyzer (GNA). The practical use of this module is demonstrated by means of the analysis of a number of relatively small bacterial regulatory networks, as well as randomly generated networks of several hundred genes.", "paper_title": "Search for steady states of piecewise-linear differential equation models of genetic regulatory networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000255443900005"}
