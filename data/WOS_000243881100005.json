A crucial role for the analysis played the Chan-Games algorithm. We use a more sophisticated generalization of the Chan-Games algorithm by Ding et al. to obtain exact formulas for the counting function and the expected value for the 1-error linear complexity for p(n)-periodic sequences over F-p,p prime. Additionally we discuss the calculation of lower and upper bounds on the k-error linear complexity of p(n)-periodic sequences over F-p.", "paper_title": "Remarks on the k-error linear complexity of p(n)-periodic sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000243881100005"}
