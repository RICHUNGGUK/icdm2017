The final automaton is then turned into a CSP-algebra: operators and fixpoints are defined, respectively, via behavioural differential equations and simulation relations. This structure is then shown to be preserved by the final homomorphism. As a result, we obtain a fully abstract compositional model of csp phrased in purely set-theoretical terms.
