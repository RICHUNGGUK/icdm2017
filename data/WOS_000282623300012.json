Using 70 structurally diverse compounds, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models between the BBB permeability and the MEDV descriptors were developed and validated by the variable selection and modeling based on prediction (VSMP) technique. The estimation ability, stability, and predictive power of a model are evaluated by the estimated correlation coefficient (r), leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation correlation coefficient (q), and predictive correlation coefficient (R(p)). It has been found that PLSR model has good quality, r = 0.9202, q = 0.7956, and Rp = 0.6649 for M1 model based on the training set of 57 samples. To search the most important structural factors affecting the BBB permeability of compounds, we performed the values of the variable importance in projection (VIP) analysis for MEDV descriptors. It was found that some structural fragments in compounds, such as -CH(3), -CH(2)-, =CH-, =C=, C-, -CH<, =C<, =N-, -NH-, =O, and -OH, are the most important factors affecting the BBB permeability.
