With this approach. it can reduce the cost of web service composition, and improve scalability, reusability and efficiency. Using a proactive well defined service base. web service composition execution engine can gain the logic with Case-Based Reasoning technology. Comparing to other method and qualitative analysis. the approach proposed by this paper can solve the problem of web service composition under the condition of insufficient and ill-defined knowledge. and can reduce the difficulty and cost of web service composition.", "paper_title": "Using case-based reasoning to support Web service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500012"}
