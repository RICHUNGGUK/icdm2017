We first consider single-user state-dependent channels with asynchronous side information at the transmitter. It is assumed that the state information sequence is a possibly delayed version of the state sequence, and that the encoder and the decoder are aware of the fact that the state information might be delayed. It is additionally assumed that an upper bound on the delay is known to both the encoder and the decoder, but other than that, they are ignorant of the actual delay. We consider both the causal and the noncausal cases and present achievable rates for these channels, and the corresponding coding schemes. We find the capacity of the asynchronous Gel'fand-Pinsker channel with feedback. Finally, we consider a memoryless state-dependent channel with asynchronous side information at both the transmitter and the receiver, and establish a single-letter expression for its capacity.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous Transmission Over Single-User State-Dependent Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000363256500011"}
