On the one hand, the rotational measurements from the inertial system are used to track precisely all limbs of the body of the human. On the other hand, the translational measurements from both systems are combined by three different fusion algorithms (a Kalman filter, a particle filter and a combination of both) in order to obtain a precise global localization of the human in the environment. Several experiments have been performed to compare their accuracy and computational efficiency (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
