The passivity property is adopted to analyze the influence of the external disturbance on such systems to achieve prescribed attenuation levels. Based on average dwell time approach, free-weighting matrix method, and Jensen's integral inequality, delay-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which ensure the uncertain switched stochastic time-delay system to be robustly mean-square exponentially stable and stochastically passive. Then, the switched passive controllers are synthesized by linearization techniques. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Passivity and Passification for a Class of Uncertain Switched Stochastic Time-Delay Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317643500001"}
