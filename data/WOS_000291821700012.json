This is applied to a two-level system (one single harmonically trapped ion) by taking into account the linear center-of-mass-motional degree of freedom. Detailed analytical and explicit expressions are given, taking into account different configurations. The results show the important roles played by the laser phase and initial state setting in the evolution of the atomic Q-function, atomic Wehrl entropy and marginal atomic Q-function. Our procedure of using atomic Wehrl entropy may be applied to a system with Hilbert space of high dimension.", "paper_title": "ATOMIC WEHRL ENTROPY OF A SINGLE QUBIT SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000291821700012"}
