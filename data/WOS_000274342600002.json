Most of the pinpointing algorithms described in the DLliterature are obtained as extensions of the standard tableau-based reasoning algorithms for computing consequences from DL knowledge bases. Although these extensions are based on similar ideas, they are all introduced for a particular tableau-based algorithm for a particular DL. The purpose of this article is to develop a general approach for extending a tableau-based algorithm to a pinpointing algorithm. This approach is based on a general definition of tableau algorithms, which captures many of the known tableau-based algorithms employed in DLs, but also other kinds of reasoning procedures.", "paper_title": "Axiom Pinpointing in General Tableaux", "paper_id": "WOS:000274342600002"}
