In particular, we are interested in LQFA since NMR was used to construct the most powerful physical quantum machine to date. We give a complete characterization of the languages recognized by LQFA and by Boolean combinations of BPQFA. It is a surprising consequence of our results that LQFA and Boolean combinations of BPQFA are equivalent in language recognition power.", "paper_title": "Algebraic results on quantum automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000234426500010"}
