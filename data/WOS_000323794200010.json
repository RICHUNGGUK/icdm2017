Two are the most important issues in this field. On one hand, most methods do not preserve the multidimensional character of the signals throughout the segmentation process. They usually perform an early projection of the hyperspectral information to a two dimensional representation with the consequent loss of the large amount of spectral information these images provide. On the other hand, there is usually very little and dubious ground truth available, making it very hard to train and tune appropriate segmentation and classification strategies. This paper describes an approach to the problem of segmenting and classifying regions in multidimensional images that performs a joint two-step process. The first step is based on the application of cellular automata (CA) and their emergent behavior over the hyperspectral cube in order to produce homogeneous regions. The second step employs a more traditional SVM in order to provide labels for these regions to classify them. The use of cellular automata for segmentation in hyperspectral images is not new, but most approaches to this problem involve hand designing the rules for the automata and, in general, average out the spectral information present. The main contribution of this paper is the study of the application of evolutionary methods to produce the CA rule sets that result in the best possible segmentation properties under different circumstances without resorting to any form of projection until the information is presented to the user. In addition, we show that the evolution process we propose to obtain the rules can be carried out over RGB images and then the resulting automata can be used to process multidimensional hyperspectral images successfully, thus avoiding the problem of lack of appropriately labeled ground truth images. The procedure has been tested over synthetic and real hyperspectral images and the results are very competitive. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
