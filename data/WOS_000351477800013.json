Ground state electron affinities for all the main group elements and homonuclear diatomics were identified recently using the normalized binding energy of the hydrogen atom: [0.75420375(3)/2=0.37710187(1) eV]. Here we revisit experimental values and extend the identifications to diatomics in the G2-1 set. We assign new ground state electron affinities: (eV) Cl-2, 3.2(2); Br-2, 2.87(14); CH, 2.1(2); H-2, 0.6; NH, 1.1, SiH, 1.90. Anion Morse potentials are calculated for H-2 and N-2 from positive electron affinities and for hyperfine superoxide states for the first time.", "paper_title": "Hylleraas hydride binding energy: diatomic electron affinities", "paper_id": "WOS:000351477800013"}
