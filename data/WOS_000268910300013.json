Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has been proven to be an effective method for reducing energy consumption of processors. This paper proposes an energy-saving algorithm under the fixed priority multi-subtask model. This algorithm includes two parts: first, it exploits the relationship among tasks to set the slowdown factors of subtasks; second, it dynamically reclaims and reuses the slack time of precedent subtasks during the execution of tasks. Experimental results show this method can reduce energy consumption effectively while guaranteeing the real-time requirements of systems.", "paper_title": "ENERGY-EFFICIENT SCHEDULING FOR SMALL PERVASIVE COMPUTING DEVICES UNDER FIXED-PRIORITY MULTI-SUBTASK MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000268910300013"}
