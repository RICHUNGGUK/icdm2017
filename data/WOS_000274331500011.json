Their max-plus or tropical analogues have been proved by various authors. We show that more advanced results in discrete geometry also have max-plus analogues, namely, the colorful Carath,odory theorem and the Tverberg theorem. A conjecture connected to the Tverberg theorem-Sierksma's conjecture-although still open for the usual convexity, is shown to be true in the max-plus setting.", "paper_title": "Carath,odory, Helly and the Others in the Max-Plus World", "paper_id": "WOS:000274331500011"}
