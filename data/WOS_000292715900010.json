The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to cover the effect of saturation on the armature flux density within conformal mapping (CM) by an finite element (FE) re-parameterization. Design/methodology/approach - Field computation by CM techniques is a time-effective method to compute the radial and tangential field components, but it generally neglects the effect of saturation. Findings - This paper presents a method to re-parameterize the CM approach by single FE computations so as to consider saturation in the model over a wide operation range of the electrical drive. Practical implications - The proposed method is applied to a surface permanent magnet synchronous machine, and compared to numerical results obtained by finite element analysis (FEA). Originality/value - The paper shows that an accuracy similar to that of FE simulations can be obtained with still the low-computation time that is the characteristic of analytical models.", "paper_title": "Accounting for saturation in conformal mapping modeling of a permanent magnet synchronous machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000292715900010"}
