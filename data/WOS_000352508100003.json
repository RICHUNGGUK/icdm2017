Because the desirable nature of mixed crude oils is a powerful guarantee for normal operations and corporate earnings. In this paper, the optimization and prediction model for Shanbei crude oil blending is established. The objectives were to improve the total yield of fractions and the compatibility and to reduce the viscosity of the mixed crude oils. After solving the model, two applicable proportions for mixed crude oils were given. With these proportions, two samples of mixed oils were prepared and distilled. The test results showed that the model was valid. The study of the viscosity and compatibility index was introduced to the optimization model because forecasting those properties in mixed crude oils has a certain significance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
