Based on this approach, we develop an algorithm for computing the characteristic cycle of the local cohomology modules H-l(r)(R) for any ideal I subset of R using the Cech complex. The algorithm, in particular, is useful for answering questions regarding vanishing of local cohomology modules and computing Lyubeznik numbers. These applications are illustrated by examples of computations using our implementation of the algorithm in Macaulay 2. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
