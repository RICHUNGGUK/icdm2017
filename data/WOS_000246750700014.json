Our logic lifts the main features of separation logic, from an assertion to a relation, and from a property about a single program to a relationship between two programs. We show the strength of the logic, by proving that the Schorr-Waite graph marking algorithm is equivalent to the depth-first traversal. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
