In this article, the problem of synthesizing a given function on a set of ancillea is addressed. The proposed approach benefits from extensive sharing of cofactors among cubes that appear on function outputs. Accordingly, it can be considered a multilevel logic optimization technique for reversible circuits. In particular, the suggested approach can efficiently implement any n-input, m-output lookup table (LUT) by a reversible circuit. This problem has interesting applications in the Shor's number-factoring algorithm and in quantum walk on sparse graphs. Simulation results reveal that the proposed cofactor-sharing synthesis algorithm has a significant impact on reducing the size of modular exponentiation circuits for Shor's quantum factoring algorithm, oracle circuits in quantum walk on sparse graphs, and the well-known MCNC benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Cofactor Sharing for Reversible Logic Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000345067100007"}
