Digital signature plays a crucial role to provide integrity, authentication and non-repudiation of data. In this letter, we propose a practical identity-based online/offline signature scheme for wireless sensor networks. Our scheme splits the signature generation into two phases: offline phase and online phase. In the offline part, most heavy computations are done without the knowledge of a message. In the online stage, only light computations are done when the message is known. As compared with the existing four pairing-based identity-based online/offline signature schemes, our scheme has the lowest computational cost.", "paper_title": "Practical Identity-Based Signature for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696400022"}
