Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a quantitative methodology to evaluate the nine forecasting models (two moving average and seven exponential smoothing) of SAP (R)'s ERP system. Event management adjustment and fitted smoothing parameters are also assessed. SAP (R) is the largest European software enterprise and the third largest in the world, with headquarters in Walldorf, Germany. Findings - The findings of the study support the adoption of CFE as a more relevant commercial decision-making measure than commonly applied statistical forecast measures. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide forecast model selection guidance to SAP (R)'s 12 + million worldwide users. However, the CFE metric can be adopted in any commercial forecasting situation. Originality/value - This study is the first published cost assessment of SAP (R)'s forecasting models.", "paper_title": "Assessing forecast model performance in an ERP environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000258447100008"}
