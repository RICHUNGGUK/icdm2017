This work is based on our previous work on the properties of the stability crossing curves in the delay parameter space. Based on the results, an algorithm to calculate the maximum radius of delay deviation without changing the number of right hand zeros of the characteristic quasipolynomial can be devised. If the nominal system is stable, then the system remains stable when the delays do not deviate more than this radius.", "paper_title": "Computing maximum delay deviation allowed to retain stability in systems with two delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000244619700010"}
