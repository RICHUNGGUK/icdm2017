Some oversampling is permitted in order to have some freedom degrees and so a minimization problem is established. This problem has always a solution that can be characterized in terms of the best uniform approximation by constant functions to some appropriate splines. Some examples are given and the error is analyzed. (c) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
