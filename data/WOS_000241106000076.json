The processing time of a batch is defined as the longest processing time among the jobs in the batch. This model is motivated by applications in the manufacturing of integrated circuits. Based on several optimal properties, a polynomial algorithm is proposed for given due window.", "paper_title": "Batch scheduling with a common due window on a single machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000076"}
