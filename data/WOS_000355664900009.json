We focus on properties describing the behaviour of a single agent in a (large) population of agents, exploiting a limit result known also as fast simulation. In particular, we will approximate the behaviour of a single agent with a time-inhomogeneous CTMC, which depends on the environment and on the other agents only through the solution of the fluid differential equation, and model check this process. We will prove the asymptotic correctness of our approach in terms of satisfiability of CSL formulae. We will also present a procedure to model check time inhomogeneous CTMC against CSL formulae.
