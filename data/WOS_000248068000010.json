The proposed algorithm aims to reduce the aliasing error in red and blue channels by exploiting high-frequency information of the green channel. To achieve this, color-difference based edge-adaptive filtering and post-processing schemes are designed to reproduce the color values by exploiting the green channel information. For green channel interpolation, any of the existing image interpolation methods can be used and combined with the proposed algorithm. Moreover, a new adaptive interpolation method is presented for reconstructing the green channel from CFA samples. We have compared this technique with two recently proposed demosaicing techniques: Gunturk's and Lu's methods. The experimental results show that EADA outperforms both of them in both PSNR values and CIELAB Delta E*(ab) measures. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
