Links in the network can be organized and assigned to orthogonal channels so as to minimize the co-channel interference. In this paper we focus on the channel assignment problem for links in the mesh networks and aim at minimizing the overall network interference. The problem is proved to be NP-hard. We have first formulated an approach based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm which can be used to find the approximate optimized solution in small-size networks and as a baseline that other algorithms can be compared with. We also have proposed a centralized heuristic as well as a distributed heuristic algorithm for the channel assignment problem. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated that our schemes have good performance in both dense and sparse networks compared with related works.", "paper_title": "Links organization for channel assignment in multi-radio wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000318708100005"}
