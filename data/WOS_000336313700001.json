It is a fundamental problem for sensory perception to understand how sensory information is decoded from the spatiotemporal activity. However, little is known about the decoding mechanism. To address this issue, we are concerned with auditory system as a model system exhibiting spatiotemporal activity. We present here a model of auditory cortex, which performs a hierarchical processing of auditory information. The model consists of three layers of two-dimensional networks. The first layer represents auditory stimulus as a spatiotemporal activity of neurons. The second layer consists of feature-detecting neurons, which extract the features of phonemes and their overlaps from the spatiotemporal activity of the first layer. The third layer combines information of the sound features encoded by the second layer and decodes word information about the sound stimulus as a temporal sequence of attractors. Using the model, we show how the information of phonemes and words emerge in the hierarchical processing of the auditory cortex. We also show that the overlap between phonemes plays a crucial role in linking the attractors of phonemes. The present study may provide a clue for understanding the mechanism by which word information is decoded from spatiotemporal activity of neurons.", "paper_title": "Decoding Word Information from Spatiotemporal Activity of Sensory Neurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000336313700001"}
