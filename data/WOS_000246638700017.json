Design/methodology/approach - An accurate numerical model of the probe-rebar interaction, including eddy currents and skin effect, is considered. The inverse problem is approached with a very efficient inversion procedure previously introduced in a different context. Findings - A critical analysis of the issues to be considered for the quantitative imaging of rebars is given, and the possibility of relevant simplifications in the numerical model outlined, allowing the development of an accurate and computationally efficient method. Originality/value - The proposed formulation is applied for the first time to the problem of rebars imaging. Experimental tests have been carried out to validate the numerical model and its underlying hypothesis.", "paper_title": "Electromagnetic inspection of concrete rebars", "paper_id": "WOS:000246638700017"}
