The child keys are generated through the developed discrete Logistic mapping, and the Feistel encrypting function with discrete chaos operation is constructed. The single byte block is encrypted and decrypted through one turn permutation, being divided into two semi-byte, quadri-Feistel structural operation, and one turn permutation again. The amount of keys may be variable with the turns of Feistel structural operation. The random and security of the child key was proven, and the experiment for the block cipher in wireless sensor network was completed. The result indicates that the algorithm is more secure and the chaos block cipher in single byte is feasible for wireless sensor network.", "paper_title": "Chaos block cipher for wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394000006"}
