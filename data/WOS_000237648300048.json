The main results of this paper are that the 5-round differential probabilities of these structures are upperbounded by p(4) + 2p(5) and p(4), respectively, if the maximum differential probability of a round function is p. We also discuss a provable security for the RC6-like structure against LC. Our results are attained under the assumption that all of components in our proposed structures are bijective.", "paper_title": "Provable security for an RC6-like structure and a MISTY-FO-like structure against differential cryptanalysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300048"}
