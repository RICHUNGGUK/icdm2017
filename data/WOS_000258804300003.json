This includes a categorization, by a number of dimensions, of inventory problems and associated models. Relevant Canadian contributions to fundamental and applied theory are listed within the dimensions. Then substantial evidence is provided of widespread Canadian applications of inventory management. The paper points out the continuing gap between theory and practice, followed by a number of suggested research topics to help bridge the gap.", "paper_title": "Inventory management: An overview, Canadian publications, practical applications and suggestions for future research", "paper_id": "WOS:000258804300003"}
