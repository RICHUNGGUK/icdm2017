BVH rotation channels are extracted as features of motion for both the retrieval instance and the motion data. Several hyper sausage neurons are constructed according to the retrieval instance, and the trained domain covered by these hyper sausage neurons can be considered as the distribution range of a same kind of motions. By use of CMU free motion database, the retrieval algorithm has been implemented and examined, and the experimental results are illustrated. At the same time, the main contributions and limitations are discussed.", "paper_title": "A Retrieval Method for Human Mocap Data Based on Biomimetic Pattern Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000276234000010"}
