Relations between (is an element of V q, is an element of V q)-fuzzy implicative filters and (is an element of, is an element of V q)-fuzzy implicative filters are investigated, and conditions for an (is an element of, is an element of V q)-fuzzy implicative filter to be an (is an element of, c)-fuzzy implicative filter are provided. Characterizations of (is an element of, is an element of V q)-fuzzy implicative filters are given, and conditions for a fuzzy set to be a (q, is an element of V q)-fuzzy implicative filter are provided.
