In this paper, we are interested in the reliable single-hop wireless multicast. As the wireless channel is inherently error prone, it is challenging to achieve high channel utilization in reliable wireless multicast. Most schemes proposed by now for reliable single-hop wireless multicast share the same weakness in that an entire frame will be retransmitted even if it has single error bit. To alleviate this problem, this paper presents an efficient reliable multicast scheme based on block-level ARQ and network coding technique. The new scheme breaks the data stream into blocks and retransmits only erroneous blocks (rather than the entire corrupted frame), where the novel network coding technique is further adopted to minimize the total number of block retransmissions. The theoretical analysis and simulation are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the new scheme and also some typical available schemes in terms of their bandwidth efficiency. The simulation and theoretical results indicate that new reliable wireless multicast scheme can significantly enhance the channel utilization, especially in the scenarios where bit error rate is high and the number of receivers is large.
