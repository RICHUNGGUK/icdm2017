The convex region is assumed to be made of an isotropic material in such a way that arbitrary rotations of the items, preserving the orthogonality constraint, are allowed. The solution method is based on a combination of branch and bound and active-set strategies for bound-constrained minimization of smooth functions. Numerical results show the reliability of the presented approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
