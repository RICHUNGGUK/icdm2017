We first explore the equation in the more general setting of AE-solution sets, and show that only a small part of Shary's results on the AE-solution sets of interval linear systems can be generalized to the interval Lyapunov matrix equation. Then, we propose our modification of Krawczyk operator which enables us to reduce the computational complexity of obtaining an outer estimation for the united solution set to cubic, provided that the midpoint of A is diagonalizable.
