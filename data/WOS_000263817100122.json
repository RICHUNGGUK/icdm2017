Tainan City, located in the southern Taiwan, is famous for its abundant historic sites and delicious snack food, and it has been one of the top tourist attractions in Taiwan for years. In this paper, we propose an ontological recommendation multi-agent for Tainan City travel. The core technologies of the agent contain the ontology model, fuzzy inference mechanism, and ant colony optimization. The proposed agent can recommend the tourist a personalized travel route to enjoy Tainan City according to the tourist's requirements. It includes a context decision agent and a travel route recommendation agent. First, the context decision agent finds a suitable location distance. counts the context relation, and infers the context information based on the tourist's requirements and Tainan City travel ontology. Next, the travel route recommendation agent is responsible for finding a personalized tour and plotting this travel route on the Google Map. Finally, the tourist can follow the personalized travel route to enjoy the cultural heritage and the local gourmet food during his stay at Tainan City. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively recommend a travel route matched with the tourist's requirements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
