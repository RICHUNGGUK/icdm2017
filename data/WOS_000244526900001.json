It is always desirable simultaneously to maximize network reliability and minimize resource consumption, e.g., the total cost [i.e., the multi-objective network reliability problem (MONR)]. In this study, we first construct the network reliability function using the formulations for simple networks and the MCS-RSM (the Monte-Carlo simulation & the response surface methodology) for complex networks of which the exact reliability functions are very difficult to find. Then, an intuitive interactive algorithm is developed using the augmented max-min method to solve the MONR based on a nonfuzzy nonlinear programming model. The feasibility of the proposed method by means of two numerical examples has been demonstrated.", "paper_title": "An interactive augmented max-min MCS-RSM method for the multi-objective network reliability problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000244526900001"}
