While the later commercial development of database systems has led to the so-called object-relational databases since late 1990s, such a marriage of the two does not actually solve the problems encountered by multimedia data management. In this paper, we present a new semantic multimedia database model based on an extension to the traditional ANSI/SPARC three-level architecture, attempting to cater for the unique requirements of multimedia data management. Various facilities of this semantic multimedia database model are described and discussed. A number of applications have been developed based on this new model, and in this paper we shall describe some of these including recipe modeling and graph mining for retrieval.
