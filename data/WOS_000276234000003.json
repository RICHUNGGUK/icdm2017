To deal with this common reflective phenomenon, we introduce a novel representation for specular reflection with a set of specular basis functions with different roughness values. This representation is suitable for any intensively or weakly specular object, and is introduced into the photometric stereo algorithm to recover both the surface shape and its reflectance properties. The reconstructed shapes and re-rendered images validate the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "An Extended Photometric Stereo Algorithm for Recovering Specular Object Shape and Its Reflectance Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000276234000003"}
