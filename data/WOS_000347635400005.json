In this manuscript we identify two monitoring tasks known in literature, namely dynamic coverage and target tracking, and motivate how these tasks are relevant in ice defense using remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPASs). An optimization-based path planning concept is outlined for solving these tasks. A path planner for the target tracking problem is elaborated in more detail and a hybrid experiment, which consists of both a real fixed-wing aircraft and simulated objects, is included to show the applicability of the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Autonomous Aerial Ice Observation for Ice Defense", "paper_id": "WOS:000347635400005"}
