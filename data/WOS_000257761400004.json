Two types of perturbations are distinguished: random perturbations and attacks. The robustness of directed and undirected scale-free networks is studied numerically for two different measures and the obtained results are compared. For random perturbations, the results indicate that the strength of the perturbation plays a crucial role. In general, directed scale-free networks are more robust than undirected scale-free networks.", "paper_title": "Robustness in scale-free networks: Comparing directed and undirected networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257761400004"}
