The traditional methods dealing with multiple datasets (e.g., vector autoregressive moving average models and neural networks) have some shortcomings, such as limited modeling capability and opaque reasoning operations. To tackle these problems, a novel fuzzy neural network (FNN) is proposed in this paper to effectively extract information from multiple datasets, so as to improve forecasting accuracy. The proposed predictor consists of both autoregressive (AR) nodes modeling and nonlinear nodes modeling; AR models/nodes are used to capture the linear correlation of the datasets, and the nonlinear correlation of the datasets are modeled with nonlinear neuron nodes. A novel particle swarm technique [i.e., Laplace particle swarm (LPS) method] is proposed to facilitate parameters estimation of the predictor and improve modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the developed FNN predictor and the associated LPS method is verified by a series of tests related to Mackey-Glass data forecast, exchange rate data prediction, and gear system prognosis. Test results show that the developed FNN predictor and the LPS method can capture the dynamics of multiple datasets effectively and track system characteristics accurately.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Neural Network Technique for System State Forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000324586700016"}
