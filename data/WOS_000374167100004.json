This paper introduces the concept of a Knowledge Society Operating System (KSOS) that allows users to form knowledge societies in which members can search, create, manipulate and connect geographically distributed knowledge resources (including data, documents, tools, people, devices, etc.) based on semantics (\"meaning\", \"intention\") in order to solve problems of mutual interest. Built on top of the current Internet infrastructure, a KSOS can take advantage of existing resources to enable the use of applications or services through a web browser. This paper discusses some crucial aspects of a KSOS.", "paper_title": "KSOS - An Operating System for Knowledge Societies", "paper_id": "WOS:000374167100004"}
