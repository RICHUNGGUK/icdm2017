These are first obtained from an extensive experimental program. The measured loading curves are then compared with those derived numerically in the framework of an inverse approach. Here, the artificial neural network and the ATENA finite element code are combined to constitute the optimization driver that allows for a reliable determination of the modulus of elasticity, fracture energy, and tensile strength of individual concretes. A brief introduction to the numerical analysis of fiber reinforced specimens again in conjunction with inverse analysis is also provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
