Given that the sensor nodes that are selected as active form a connected wireless network, the inactive sensor nodes can be turned off. Allowing some sensor nodes to be active and some sensor nodes inactive interchangably during the lifecycle of the application helps the wireless sensor network to have a longer lifetime. The problem of determining a set of active sensor nodes in a correlated data environment for a fully operational wireless sensor network can be formulated as an instance of the connected correlation-dominating set problem. In this work, our contribution is twofold; we propose an effective and runtime-efficient iterative improvement heuristic to solve the active sensor node determination problem, and a benefit function that aims to minimize the number of active sensor nodes while maximizing the residual energy levels of the selected active sensor nodes. Extensive simulations we performed show that the proposed approach achieves a good performance in terms of both network lifetime and runtime efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
