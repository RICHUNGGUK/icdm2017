This information is materialized when the full model is broken down into a scenario cluster partition with smaller subproblems. In this paper we present a scheme for obtaining strong bounds and branching strategies for the Twin Node Families to increase the efficiency of the procedure BFC-MSMIP, based on the information provided by the nonanticipativity constraints that are explicitly considered in the problem. Some computational experience is reported to support the efficiency of the new scheme. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
