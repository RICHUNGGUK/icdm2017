In this work, we investigate two optimisation strategies that are commonly used for systems which can be described by partial differential equations, namely the adjoint-based and the sensitivity-based approach. The approaches are reviewed and their merits and disadvantages are discussed. We employ both strategies to minimise the separation of a laminar flow over a backward-facing step and critically compare the outcome. It turns out that both strategies are able to considerably reduce the reattachment length compared to the uncontrolled case. Nevertheless, the sensitivity-based approach allows for a simpler implementation and a less complex solution process and therefore appears attractive for engineering applications. The sensitivity-based approach is implemented for the active flow control in an electrokinetic micromixer and various numerical experiments are performed. It is shown that the sensitivity-based optimisation leads to very high mixing degrees in short operation times. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
