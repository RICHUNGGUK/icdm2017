This is used to improve the theoretical approximation of the information bit error rate, in terms of the channel bit-error rate, in a block transmission through a discrete memoryless channel. Since a bounded distance reproducing encoder is assumed, we introduce the here-called false positive, a decoding failure with no information-symbol error, and we estimate the probability that this event occurs. As a consequence, a new performance analysis of an MDS code is proposed.", "paper_title": "INFORMATION BIT ERROR RATE AND FALSE POSITIVES IN AN MDS CODE", "paper_id": "WOS:000354031100002"}
