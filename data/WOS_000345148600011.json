Design/methodology/approach - The history is based on published materials, unpublished school records, and semi-structured interviews with 19 current or ex-members of staff. Findings - The School has grown steadily over its first half-century, extending the range of its teaching from conventional programmes in librarianship and information science to include cognate programmes in areas such as health informatics, information systems and multi-lingual information management. Originality/value - There are very few published accounts of the history of LIS departments.", "paper_title": "The Information School at the University of Sheffield, 1963-2013", "paper_id": "WOS:000345148600011"}
