According to our approach, a composite service is described in WS-BPEL. Each component service in the description may be resolved to either an OSGi service or Web Service at runtime. The proposal can overcome current limitations with OSGi technology in terms of its geographical coverage and candidate service population available for service composition.", "paper_title": "Enriching OSGi Service Composition with Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000266425700041"}
