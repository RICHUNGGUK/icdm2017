Using agent-wise labeling maps (ALMs), the framework explores the observation and control structures of an already designed centralised supervisor in a distributed manner, and represent them as polynomial equations over a finite field. Communication is naturally required to re-evaluate the equations, which depend on distributed information, correctly, and is formalised and implemented using communication events. The framework generalises the authors' previous work on extended finite-state machines (EFSMs) by formalising system representation and communication events, proving the correctness of proposed communication policies, and algorithmic simplification of polynomial equations. This provides a systematic procedure for the synthesis of decentralised supervisors and formalisation, computation and implementation of the communication.", "paper_title": "A framework for synthesis of communicating decentralised supervisors for discrete-event systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329903700009"}
