Among all capacity vectors (u) over cap satisfying this condition, we would like to find one with minimum parallel to(u) over cap - u parallel to value. We consider two distance measures for parallel to(u) over cap - u parallel to, rectilinear (L(1)) and Chebyshev (L(infinity)) distances. By reduction from the feedback arc set problem we show that the capacity inverse minimum cost flow problem is NP-hard in the rectilinear case. On the other hand, it is polynomially solvable by a greedy algorithm for the Chebyshev norm. In the latter case we propose a heuristic for the bicriteria problem, where we minimize among all optimal solutions the number of affected arcs. We also present computational results for this heuristic.", "paper_title": "Capacity inverse minimum cost flow problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000273402400004"}
