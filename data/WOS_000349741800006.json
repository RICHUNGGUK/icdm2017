This paper focuses on the case in which Phi defines a family of graphs whose edge-minimal elements all have bounded treewidth; this includes the special case in which Phi describes the property of being connected. We show that exactly counting the number of connected induced k-vertex subgraphs in an n-vertex graph is #W[1]-hard, but on the other hand there exists an FPTRAS for the problem; more generally, we show that there exists an FPTRAS for p-#INDUCED SUBGRAPH WITH PROPERTY(Phi) whenever Phi is monotone and all the minimal graphs satisfying Phi have bounded treewidth. We then apply these results to a counting version of the GRAPH MOTIF problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
