In this paper, it is shown that recovery by a BP variant is stable tinder perturbation of the samples values by noise. A similar partial result for OMP is provided. For BP, in addition, the stability result is extended to (nonsparse) trigonometric polynomials that can he well approximated by sparse ones. The theoretical findings are illustrated by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Stability Results for Random Sampling of Sparse Trigonometric Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000261648100023"}
