By constructing suitable Lyapunov functionals and combining with linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, new global asymptotic stability criteria about different types of time-varying delays are obtained. It is shown that the criteria can provide less conservative result than some existing ones. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "LMI-based asymptotic stability analysis of neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000257299000006"}
