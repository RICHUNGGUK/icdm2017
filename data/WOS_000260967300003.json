In this paper, a new algorithm called the ranking selection-based PSO (RSPSO) is developed. In RSPSO, the objective function and constraints are handled separately. For discrete variables, they are partitioned into ordinary discrete and categorical ones, and the latter is managed and searched directly without the concept of velocity in the standard PSO. In addition, a new ranking selection scheme is incorporated into PSO to elaborately control the search behavior of a swarm in different search phases and on categorical variables. RSPSO is relatively simple and easy to implement. Experiments on five engineering problems and a benchmark function with equality constraints were conducted. The results indicate that RSPSO is an effective and widely applicable optimizer for optimization problems in engineering design in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms in the area.", "paper_title": "A ranking selection-based particle swarm optimizer for engineering design optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000260967300003"}
