A number of field measurements, a total of 154 runs with different train speeds of 198-303 km/h, were carried out to test the stability and accuracy of the proposed evaluation procedure. The evaluation differences of the train speed by using the opposed photoelectric sensing approaches and dominant frequency method are less than 3%, which means that the proposed procedure for automatic train speed evaluation is applicable and accurate. The advantages of the dominant frequency method for train speed calculation are in its mobility and cost-savings with regard to the installation and repair work, especially for long-term monitoring programs at elevated railway systems. Thus, the proposed procedure increases the applicability and potential of the dominant frequency method for train speed monitoring in real-time field measurement, since the evaluation work does not have to be done manually.
