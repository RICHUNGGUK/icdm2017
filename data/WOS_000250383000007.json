A seminal example of such a theorem is the Feferman-Vaught Theorem [3] which reduces the first-order theory of generalized products to the first order theory of its factors and the monadic second-order theory of index structure. Shelah [23] used the composition theorem for linear orders as one of the main tools for obtaining very strong decidability results for the monadic second-order theory of linear orders. The main technical contribution of our paper is (1) a definition of a generalized sum of structures and (2) a composition theorem for first-order logic over the generalized sum. One of our objectives is to emphasize the work-out of the composition method.", "paper_title": "Composition theorem for generalized sum", "paper_id": "WOS:000250383000007"}
