A large proportion of the AVF late failures are related to local haemodynamics (Sivanesan et al., 1999a). As in AVF, blood flow dynamics plays an important role in growth, rupture, and surgical treatment of aneurysm. Several techniques have been used to study the flow patterns in simplified models of vascular anastomose and aneurysm. In the present investigation, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to analyze the flow patterns in AVF and aneurysm through the velocity waveform obtained from experimental surgeries in dogs (Galego et al., 2000), as well as intra-operative blood flow recordings of patients with radiocephalic AVF ( Sivanesan et al., 1999b) and physiological pulses (Aires, 1991), respectively. The flow patterns in AVF for dog and patient surgeries data are qualitatively similar. Perturbation, recirculation and separation zones appeared during cardiac cycle, and these were intensified in the diastole phase for the AVF and aneurysm models. The values of wall shear stress presented in this investigation of AVF and aneurysm models oscillated in the range that can both cause damage to endothelial cells and develop atherosclerosis.", "paper_title": "Flow Visualization in Arteriovenous Fistula and Aneurysm Using Computational Fluid Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000267017000006"}
