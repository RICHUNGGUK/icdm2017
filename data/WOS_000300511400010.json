For example, a conventional robot cannot perform the walk known as \"the catwalk\" commonly seen in fashion shows. We developed a control method that allows a realistically simulated adult-size humanoid robot to exhibit a stable dynamic walk with features (such as catwalk, rolling trunk and waist motions, knee stretch walking, etc.) commonly exhibited by fashion models. Our method has the potential to be used in feminized robots in the fashion, advertisement and entertainment industries.", "paper_title": "Computer Simulations of a Humanoid Robot Capable of Walking Like Fashion Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000300511400010"}
