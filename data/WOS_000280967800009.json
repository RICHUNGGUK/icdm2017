This tool makes noisy temporal belief functions smoother using a Temporal Evidential Filter (TEF). The Belief Scheduler makes belief on states smoother, separates the states (assumed to be true or false) and synchronizes them in order to infer the sequence. A criterion is also provided to assess the appropriateness between observed belief functions and a given sequence model. This criterion is based on the conflict information appearing explicitly in the TBM when combining observed belief functions with predictions. The Belief Scheduler is part of a generic architecture developed for on-line and automatic human action and activity recognition in videos of athletics taken with a moving camera. In experiments, the system is assessed on a database composed of 69 real athletics video sequences. The goal is to automatically recognize running, jumping, jailing and standing-up actions as well as high jump, pole vault, triple jump and long jump activities of an athlete. A comparison with Hidden Markov Models for video classification is also provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
