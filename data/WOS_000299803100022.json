Therefore, the performance could be achieved in a more realistic manner. Within this framework, an innovative software code is developed by combining the Monte Carlo and finite difference methods to predict the behavior of embankment dams after impounding. In order to assess the efficiency of the method, the case study of Chahnimeh-4 dam, located at Southeast of Iran, has been investigated in detail. The behavior of this dam is predicted and compared with the field monitoring by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The results indicate the robustness of the proposed method and it can be then efficiently used in monitoring the dam responses with respect to the various factors like seepage, piping and settlement.
