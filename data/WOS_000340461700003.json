The integrating structure of such a depository (which is a well-founded partial order) allows one to deal with the hierarchical nature of biology. This leads to the notion of an exploration system E which consists of (1) a static part which is a depository of knowledge given by an extended zoom structure Z, and (2) a dynamic part given by a family of reaction systems F. In this setup the depository of knowledge Z is explored by computations/processes provided by reaction systems from F, where this exploration can use/integrate knowledge present on different levels (e.g., atomic, cellular, organism, species, ... levels).", "paper_title": "ZOOM STRUCTURES AND REACTION SYSTEMS YIELD EXPLORATION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340461700003"}
