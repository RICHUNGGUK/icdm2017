We introduce a partial ordering on the extreme points of P(G) and give necessary conditions for a non-integer extreme point of P(G) to be minimal with respect to that ordering. We show that, if (x) over bar is a non-integer minimal extreme point of P(G), then G and (x) over bar can be reduced, by means of some reduction operations, to a graph G' and an extreme point (x) over bar of P(G') where G' and (x) over bar' satisfy some simple properties. As a consequence we obtain a characterization of the perfectly 2-edge connected graphs, the graphs for which the polytope P(G) is integral.", "paper_title": "Critical extreme points of the 2-edge connected spanning subgraph polytope", "paper_id": "WOS:000233867100009"}
