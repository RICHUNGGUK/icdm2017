In an uniform machine environment, all machines have different processing speeds. Linear deterioration means that job's actual processing time is a linear increasing function on its execution starting time. We propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) to show the problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense.", "paper_title": "An FPTAS for uniform machine scheduling to minimize makespan with linear deterioration", "paper_id": "WOS:000302381300007"}
