In this paper we present an integrated secure routing system based on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Statistically Unique and Cryptographically Verifiable (SUCV) identifiers. The proposed IDS has been used for the support of secure Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing, named IDS-based Secure AODV (IS- AODV), in wireless ad hoc and vehicular network scenarios. Our IDS is based on the detection of behavior anomalies on behalf of neighbor hosts, with passive reactions, aiming to create a cluster whose route paths will include only safe nodes, eventually. Simulation results show that the proposed IDS is effective in isolating misbehaving hosts, and it assists the AODV secure routing scheme to converge in finding safe end-to-end routes.", "paper_title": "Intrusion detection for secure clustering and routing in mobile multi-hop wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251612900003"}
