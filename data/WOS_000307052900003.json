Dynamic cache reconfiguration is a promising approach for reducing energy consumption as well as for improving overall system performance. It is a major challenge to introduce cache reconfiguration into real-time multitasking systems, since dynamic analysis may adversely affect tasks with timing constraints. This article presents a novel approach for implementing cache reconfiguration in soft real-time systems by efficiently leveraging static analysis during runtime to minimize energy while maintaining the same service level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate dynamic cache reconfiguration in real-time scheduling techniques. Our experimental results using a wide variety of applications have demonstrated that our approach can significantly reduce the cache energy consumption in soft real-time systems (up to 74%).", "paper_title": "Dynamic Cache Reconfiguration for Soft Real-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000307052900003"}
