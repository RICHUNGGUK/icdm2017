However, such devices are usually equipped with small display panels and poor acoustic equipments. In order to achieve better user experience with high quality panel or audio stereo, users often need to transfer or copy digital media contents to external powerful devices, like personal computers and home theater devices. Nevertheless, it can be awkward or difficult for users to follow up a series of operations of connection setup and media content transfer. In this paper, we present a mobile media content sharing mechanism based the UPnP framework and wireless communication technology in home network environments. As a result, users could conveniently share media contents stored in mobile devices and play them by other home networked player devices. The demonstration result shows that the developed mechanism is attractive and of practicability and ease of use.", "paper_title": "Mobile Media Content Sharing in UPnP-Based Home Network Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000261206300009"}
