With already crowded radio spectrum, utilization efficiency of frequency resources needs to be substantially improved in 5G to accommodate more users. On the other hand, the extremely wide and dynamic spectrum resources required by 5G create a significant opportunity to develop advanced resource management techniques. In this article, we propose a novel architecture to support 5G spectrum management, which uses various requirements for QoE as the design objective. With the proposed architecture, an intelligent and dynamic QoE-driven spectrum assignment scheme for 5G is introduced. The proposed scheme accomplishes dynamic spectrum assignment for each macrocell by utilizing global information that reflects the dynamic QoE requirement. In addition, we effectively allocate the spectrum bands for various devices relying on the reconfigurable RF front-end of SDR-based devices. The presented architecture is expected to support dynamic and efficient spectrum management for 5G wireless networks. Meanwhile, the intelligent and dynamic QoE-driven spectrum assignment scheme is expected to achieve an improved spectrum utilization rate, which could directly accelerate the development of 5G wireless networks.", "paper_title": "QOE-DRIVEN SPECTRUM ASS IGNMENT FOR 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS USING SDR", "paper_id": "WOS:000367729400008"}
