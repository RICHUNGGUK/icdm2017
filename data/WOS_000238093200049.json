This paper focuses on effective keyword search in XML documents which are modeled as labeled trees. We first analyze the problems caused by the refinement of result granularity during XML keyword search and then propose to partition an XML document into XML fragments with the granularity of Minimal Information Unit (MIU). Furthermore, we present efficient index structures and the corresponding search algorithms. Finally, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of our method over previously proposed methods in terms of result quality, index size and execution time.", "paper_title": "Effective keyword search in XML documents based on MIU", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093200049"}
