It provides unique opportunities for test compaction that do not exist with the standard test application scheme. We show that it also provides unique opportunities for reducing the power dissipation of a scan-based test set. After translating a standard scan-based test set into a transparent-scan sequence, we apply two operations for reducing the power dissipation of the sequence. The first operation attempts to remove a test vector that causes high power dissipation. The second operation attempts to replace a scan clock cycle with a functional clock cycle, or a functional clock cycle with a scan clock cycle, in order to reduce the power dissipation. Both operations are implemented such that they reduce the power dissipation without reducing the fault coverage. We also consider a third operation that attempts to complement arbitrary values in the transparent-scan sequence in order to further reduce the power dissipation.", "paper_title": "Reducing the Switching Activity of Test Sequences under Transparent-Scan", "paper_id": "WOS:000289069700005"}
