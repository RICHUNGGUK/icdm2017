Conventional clustering of visual primitives, however, usually ignores the spatial and feature structure among them, thus cannot discover high-level visual patterns of complex structure. To overcome this problem, we propose to consider spatial and feature contexts among visual primitives for pattern discovery. By discovering spatial co-occurrence patterns among visual primitives and feature co-occurrence patterns among different types of features, our method can better address the ambiguities of clustering visual primitives. We formulate the pattern discovery problem as a regularized k-means clustering where spatial and feature contexts are served as constraints to improve the pattern discovery results. A novel self-learning procedure is proposed to utilize the discovered spatial or feature patterns to gradually refine the clustering result. Our self-learning procedure is guaranteed to converge and experiments on real images validate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Context-Aware Discovery of Visual Co-Occurrence Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000333026400002"}
