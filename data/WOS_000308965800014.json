Recently, a simple and efficient learning method, referred to as extreme learning machine (ELM), was proposed by Huang et al., which has shown that, compared to some conventional methods, the training time of neural networks can be reduced by a thousand times. However, one of the open problems in ELM research is whether the number of hidden nodes can be further reduced without affecting learning effectiveness. This brief proposes a new learning algorithm, called bidirectional extreme learning machine (B-ELM), in which some hidden nodes are not randomly selected. In theory, this algorithm tends to reduce network output error to 0 at an extremely early learning stage. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the network output error and the network output weights in the proposed B-ELM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can be tens to hundreds of times faster than other incremental ELM algorithms.", "paper_title": "Bidirectional Extreme Learning Machine for Regression Problem and Its Learning Effectiveness", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965800014"}
