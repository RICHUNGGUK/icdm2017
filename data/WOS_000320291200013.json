However, it is a challenge to enforce security and reliability of those applications due to the uncertainty of service quality in distributive and heterogeneous environment. This paper proposes a novel method to compose Web services for high security and reliability, which is driven by the requirements of service consumers. Petri nets are used to precisely describe the process of service composition in order to articulate the logic relationship between components. Based on this, a strategy for analyzing the compositionality of service is presented, and a reliable service composition method and its enforcement technique are proposed. Theories of Petri nets help prove the effectiveness of strategy. Finally, a case study of Travel Service demonstrates the feasibility of our method.", "paper_title": "A Requirement-Driven Method for Secure and Reliable Web Service Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000320291200013"}
