Accordingly, numerous computer-based farming devices for logging, processing and exchanging data have recently been installed on moving farm machinery such as tractors. The exchange of data generally takes place between the devices and farming systems, mostly installed at the premises of farmers, contractors, advisory services, etc. In most cases. data exchange is based on farming data exchange standards and is bi-directional. Bi-directional data exchange allows different devices and systems to exchange data based on a predefined set of rules. In consequence, many hand-coded data exchange solutions have been developed in the farming business. Although efforts regarding incorporating data exchange standards have been made, their actual usage so far has been limited, due to the fact that hand-coded bi-directional data exchange solutions have proven themselves too complex to maintain. Maintenance need to occur as requirements change frequently and the existing data exchange techniques lack flexibility with regards to efficient requirements change management. In addition, requirements change results in managing low-level code rather than a high-level specifications. This paper presents a bi-directional data exchange solution in the farming business that is based on high-level specifications without any need for hand-coding. The proposed solution supports ISOBUS based bi-directional data exchange as well as efficient requirements change management through a graphical user interface. The paper also demonstrates the use of the proposed solution based on a farming case study and open source technologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
