This work presents a multi-view vision-based method to capture hand motion. A 3-D hand model with structural and kinematical constraints is developed to ensure that the proposed hand model behaves similar to an ordinary human hand. Human hand motion in a high degree of freedom space is estimated by developing a separable state based particle filtering (SSBPF) method to track the finger motion. By integrating different features, including silhouette, Chamfer distance, and depth map in different view angles, the proposed motion tracking system can capture the hand motion parameter effectively and solve the self-occlusion problem of the finger motion. Experimental results indicate that the hand joint angle estimation generates an average error of 11 degrees. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
