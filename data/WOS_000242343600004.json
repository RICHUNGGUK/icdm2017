We pay particular attention to equating the relevant security levels and comparing not only computational performance and bandwidth performance. The paper focuses on the BLS signature scheme and the Boneh-Franklin encryption scheme, but a similar analysis can be applied to many other pairing based schemes.", "paper_title": "A comparison of MNT curves and supersingular curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000242343600004"}
