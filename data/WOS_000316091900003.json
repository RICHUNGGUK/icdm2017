Meanwhile, network coding (NC) was invented as an efficient technique to address these problems. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive discussion about wireless-RN modes in the literature. We therefore provide a tutorial concerning the basic concepts of NC, dealing with the classification of particular relay modes, and presenting new wireless-RN protocols with/without NC in this paper. Under appropriate categories (i.e., fixed and dynamic), much attention has been given to various proposed wireless-RN protocols because they may differ individually depending on their processing at relay nodes and network topology. We compare the available wireless-RN protocols with/without NC, and conclude that the wireless-RN based on NC outperforms the traditional wireless-RN in certain scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
