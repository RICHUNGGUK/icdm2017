The papers are classified first according to the HFS characteristics and production limitations considered in the respective papers. This represents a new approach to the classification of papers in the HFS environment. Second, the papers have been classified according to the solution approach proposed. These two classification categories give a comprehensive overview on the state of the art of the problem and can guide the reader with respect to future research work. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
