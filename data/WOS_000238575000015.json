The filtering module is designed to provide news professionals and general users with an interactive and personalised tool for news gathering and delivery. It exploits content-based filtering criteria and category-based filtering techniques to deliver to the user a ranked list of either news or clusters of news. In fact, if the user prefers to have a synthetic view of the topics of recent news pushed by the stream, the system filters groups (clusters) of news having homogenous contents, identified automatically by the application of a fuzzy clustering algorithm that organizes the recent news into a fuzzy hierarchy. The filter can be trained explicitly by the user to learn his/her interests as well as implicitly by monitoring his/her interaction with the system. Several filtering criteria can be applied to select and rank news to the users based on the user's information preferences and presentation preferences. User preferences specify what information (the contents of interest) is relevant to the user, the sources that provide reliable information, and the period of time during which the information remains relevant. Each individual news or cluster of news homogeneous with respect to their content is selected based on a customizable multi criteria decision making approach and ranked based on a combination of criteria specified by the user in his/her presentation preferences.", "paper_title": "A flexible news filtering model exploiting a hierarchical fuzzy categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000015"}
