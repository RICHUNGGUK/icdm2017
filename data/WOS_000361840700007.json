For its arbitrarily close, fast, and robust tracking performance, the L-1 adaptive output feedback controller is designed as the augmentation controller in the inner-loop to keep the nominal dynamics of the system in the overall operation scope. The robust PID controller and offset-free linear MPC controller are recommended as the available outer-loop baseline controllers to follow control commands. The closed-loop stability of the cascade control system is ensured. The simulation experiments on a benchmark nonlinear boiler-turbine generation model verify the greatly improved adaptation and robustness of the augmentation control system in the presence of unknown uncertainties. Additionally, it is easy to upgrade a conventional control system to this cascade one in practice because the add-in L-1 adaptive augmentation controller influences little on the augmented system setup.", "paper_title": "A Collaborated Multi-controller Strategy by Using L-1 Adaptive Augmentation Control for Power-generation Systems with Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000361840700007"}
