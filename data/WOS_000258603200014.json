This involves large, sparse linear systems of equations that may be solved using preconditioned Krylov subspace methods. Our preconditioners involve fast discrete trigonometric transforms and are based on a physical approximation. Simulations show significant gain in terms of computation time and iteration count in comparison with results obtained with preconditioners based on incomplete LU (ILU) factorization. Moreover, with the new preconditioners, the required number of iterations is independent of the grid size. (C) 2008 Elsevier inc.
