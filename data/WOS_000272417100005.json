However, the growing power consumption of such systems is of increasing concern, and techniques that can be used to increase the overall system power efficiency while sustaining the performance are very desirable. Operating system (OS) noise can have a dramatic effect on the system performance. Effectively handling the smaller OS tasks while simultaneously preserving application thread synchronicity leads to gains in the overall system efficiency. Recently, under a fixed power budget, asymmetric multiprocessors (AMP) have been proposed to improve the performance of multithreaded applications. An AMP in this context is a multiprocessor system in which its processors are not operating at the same frequency. This paper proposes two simple scheduling methods that reduce the impact of OS noise, while simultaneously taking advantage of an opportunity to increase the overall machine energy efficiency on AMP servers. Prototyping AMPS on a commercial 2-way dual-core Hyper-Threaded (HT) Intel Xeon SMP server, using real power measurements across six SPEC OpenMP applications, indicates that the first proposed scheduler performs better on average for HT-enabled systems, whereas the second scheduler is superior on average for HT-disabled systems.
