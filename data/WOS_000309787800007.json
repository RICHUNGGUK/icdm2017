In a heterogeneous network environment, cameras and viewers are located in different networks so that frame synchronization may span across diverse network domains with different transmission capabilities. The mismatch of transmission capabilities may affect the viewing continuity and playback liveness between cameras and viewers. In the article, we propose an adaptive frame synchronization mechanism for frame capturing at cameras based on the network condition to improve the frame synchronization between two sides across a heterogeneous network. Based on a brief theoretical analysis of the asynchronization effect for video communication in a heterogeneous network environment, the proposed adaptive pause time mechanism can be an effective solution to relieve the asynchronization effect in the unmatched transmission rate situation. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a shorter time delay between the captured frames at the camera site and the viewer site. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
