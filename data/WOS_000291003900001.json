We show that, if used as a lossy compressor, the maximum-likelihood channel decoder of a randomly chosen capacity-achieving codebook achieves the rate-distortion function almost surely. However, operational duality does not hold for every capacity achieving encoder-decoder sequence, or rate-distortion achieving compressor-decompressor sequence. We show that there exist optimal channel coding [lossy compression] schemes, which fail when used for the dual lossy compression [channel coding resp.] problem.", "paper_title": "Operational Duality Between Lossy Compression and Channel Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900001"}
