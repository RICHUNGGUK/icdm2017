This paper presents an improved technique for Face Recognition, which consists of two phases where in each phase; a technique is employed effectively that is used extensively in computer vision and pattern recognition. Initially, the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is used specifically in the first phase, which is employed to reduce dimensionality and to extract abstract features of faces. The framework of the second phase is sparse representation based classification (SRC) and introduced metaface learning (MFL) of face images. Experiments for face recognition have been performed on ORL and AR face database. It is shown that the proposed method can perform much best than other methods. And with the proposed method, we can obtain a best understanding of data.", "paper_title": "Improved combination of RPCA and MEL for sparse representation-based face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000336657900009"}
