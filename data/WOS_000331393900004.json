In order to accurately detect these moving objects taking into account possible changing motion models, we propose an adaptive multi-motion model in the joint detection and tracking (JDT) framework. The proposed technique differs from the existing JDT-based methods mainly in two ways. First we express the solution in the JDT framework via a formulation in the multiple motion model setting. Second, we introduce a new motion model prediction function which exploits the correlation between the motion model and object kinematic state. Experiments on both synthetic and real videos demonstrate that the JDT method employing the proposed adaptive multi-motion model can detect objects more accurately than the existing peer methods when objects change their motion models.", "paper_title": "Object joint detection and tracking using adaptive multiple motion models", "paper_id": "WOS:000331393900004"}
