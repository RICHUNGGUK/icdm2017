The MIML formulation can be applied in many domains. For example, in an image domain, bags are images, instances are feature vectors representing segments in the images, and the label sets are lists of objects or categories present in each image. Although many MIML algorithms have been developed for predicting the label set of a new bag, only a few have been specifically designed to predict instance labels. We propose MIML-ECC (ensemble of classifier chains), which exploits bag-level context through label correlations to improve instance-level prediction accuracy. The proposed method is scalable in all dimensions of a problem (bags, instances, classes, and feature dimension) and has no parameters that require tuning (which is a problem for prior methods). In experiments on two image datasets, a bioacoustics dataset, and two artificial datasets, MIML-ECC achieves higher or comparable accuracy in comparison with several recent methods and baselines.", "paper_title": "Context-aware MIML instance annotation: exploiting label correlations with classifier chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000351519700003"}
