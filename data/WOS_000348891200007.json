This constitutes an improvement of the time complexity of the best known existing bound since in Ausiello et al. (2009) [5] a 4/3-approximation is already given with a complexity O(n(3)). Our algorithm is of independent interest because it does not use a matching to build the approximate solution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
