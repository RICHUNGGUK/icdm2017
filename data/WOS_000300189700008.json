A mental arithmetic task and a manual error correction task were performed both separately and concurrently on a computer using verbal and haptic input devices. Heart rate, skin conductance, respiration and peripheral skin temperature were recorded in addition to objective performance measures and self-report questionnaires. Analysis of psychophysiological responses found significant changes from baseline for both single-task and dual-task conditions. There were also significant psychophysiological differences between the mental arithmetic task and the manual error correction task, but no differences in questionnaire results. Additionally, there was no significant psychophysiological difference between performing only the mental arithmetic task and performing both tasks at once. These findings suggest that psychophysiological measures respond differently to different types of tasks and that they do not always agree with performance or with participants' subjective feelings.", "paper_title": "Dual-task performance in multimodal human-computer interaction: a psychophysiological perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000300189700008"}
