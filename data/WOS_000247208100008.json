Evaluation codes were defined in order to give an algebraic generalization of both one-point algebraic-geometry codes and Reed-Muller codes. Given an F-q-algebra A, an order function rho on A and given a surjective F-q-morphism of algebras phi: A -> F-q(n), the ith evaluation code with respect to A, rho, phi is defined as the code C-i = phi(f is an element of A : rho(f) <= i}). In this work it is shown that under a certain hypothesis on the F-q-algebra A, not only any evaluation code is a one-point code, but any sequence of evaluation codes is a sequence of one-point codes. This hypothesis on A is that its field of fractions is a function field over F-q and that A is integrally closed. Moreover, we see that a sequence of algebraic-geometry codes G(i) with associated divisors Gamma(i) is the sequence of evaluation codes associated to some F-q-algebra A, some order function rho and some surjective morphism phi with {f is an element of A : rho(f) <= i} = L(Gamma(i)) if and only if it is a sequence of one-point codes.", "paper_title": "Algebraic-geometry codes, one-point codes, and evaluation codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000247208100008"}
