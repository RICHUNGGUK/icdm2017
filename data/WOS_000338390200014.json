However, PSO has an inherent drawback in handling constrained problems, mainly because of its complexity and dependency on parameters. Furthermore, one PSO variant may perform well for some test problems but not obtain good results for others. In this paper, our purpose is to develop a new PSO algorithm that can efficiently solve a variety of constrained optimization problems. It considers a mix of different PSO variants each of which evolves with a different number of individuals from the current population. In each generation, the algorithm assigns more individuals to the better-performing variants and fewer to the worse-performing ones. Also, a new PSO variant is developed for use in the proposed algorithm to maintain a better balance between its local and global PSO versions. A new methodology for adapting PSO parameters is presented and the proposed self-adaptive PSO algorithm tested and analyzed on two sets of test problems, namely the CEC2006 and CEC2010 constrained optimization problems. Based on the results, the proposed algorithm shows significantly better performance than the same global and local PSO variants as well as other-state-of-the-art algorithms. Although, based on our analysis, it cannot guarantee an optimal solution for any unknown problem, it is expected to be able to solve a wide variety of practical problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
