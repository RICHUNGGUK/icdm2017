Methods: A clinical trial was conducted to define and elucidate an expert anesthetists' decision pathway utilised in controlling this patient population. This data and derived knowledge were used to elicit a decision-making model. The structural framework of the decision-making model is hierarchical, clearly defined, and dynamic. The decision levels are linked to five important components of the cardiovascular physiology in turn, i.e. the systolic blood pressure (SBP), central venous pressure (CVP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), cardiac output (CO), and heart rate (HR). Progress down the hierarchy is dependent upon the normalisation of each physiological parameter to a value pre-selected by the clinician via fluid, chronotropes or inotropes. Since interventions at each and every level cause changes and disturbances in the other components, the proposed decision support model continuously refers back decision outcomes back to the SBP which is considered to be the overriding supervisory safety component in this hierarchical decision structure. The decision model was then translated into a computerised decision support system prototype and comprehensively tested on a physiological model of the human cardiovascular system. This model was able to reproduce conditions experienced by post-operative cardiac surgery patients including hypertension, hypovolemia, vasoditation and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Results: In all the simulated patients scenarios considered the CDSS was able to initiate similar therapeutic interventions to that of the expert, and as a result, was also able to control the hemodynamic parameters to the prescribed target values.
