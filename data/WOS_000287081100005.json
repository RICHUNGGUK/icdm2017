This paper presents a novel composite model descriptor, which takes into account both visual and geometric characteristics of 3D models. It also proposes an original mapping mechanism from low-level model features to high-level semantic concepts based on the user's retrieval history, and so this method belongs to long-term relevance feedback algorithms for 3D model retrieval. Finally, an effective 3D model retrieval system \"ModelSeek\" has been built, and implemented with the introduced model descriptor and mapping mechanism. The experimental results show that the approaches above not only have significantly improved the retrieval performance, but have also achieved better retrieval effectiveness than the state-of-the-art techniques on the publicly available 3D model criterion that Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB) and several standard evaluation measures.", "paper_title": "ModelSeek: an effective 3D model retrieval system", "paper_id": "WOS:000287081100005"}
