In this paper, we aim to handle this kind of complex data in a transfer learning framework, and propose a robust non-negative matrix factorization via joint sparse and graph regularization model for transfer learning. First, we employ robust non-negative matrix factorization via sparse regularization model (RSNMF) to handle source domain data and then learn a meaningful matrix, which contains much common information between source domain and target domain data. Second, we treat this learned matrix as a bridge and transfer it to target domain. Target domain data are reconstructed by our robust non-negative matrix factorization via joint sparse and graph regularization model (RSGNMF). Third, we employ feature selection technique on new sparse represented target data. Fourth, we provide novel efficient iterative algorithms for RSNMF model and RSGNMF model and also give rigorous convergence and correctness analysis separately. Finally, experimental results on both text and image data sets demonstrate that our REGTL model outperforms existing start-of-art methods.", "paper_title": "Robust non-negative matrix factorization via joint sparse and graph regularization for transfer learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000322139500028"}
