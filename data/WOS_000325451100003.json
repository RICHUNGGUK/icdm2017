The more traditional Euclidean similarity is employed to provide a reference. As a comparison, dynamic time warping is introduced as a similarity measure. Multidimensional scaling is employed to compare these dissimilarities on 15 financial indices sampled daily over a 10-year period. In addition to investigating the whole period, 1-year tranches are also considered. This analysis is compared to a recent study of Machado et al. [Analysis of stock market indices through multidimensional scaling, Commun. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simul. 16(12) (2011), pp. 4610-4618], who examined these same indices using correlation as a similarity measure. It is suggested that this approach may be problematic. Doubt is also cast on the efficacy of the histogram' similarity they also propose.", "paper_title": "Analysis of stock market indices through multidimensional scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000325451100003"}
