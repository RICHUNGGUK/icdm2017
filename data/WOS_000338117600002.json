Ge, Rees and Shalaby started the investigation into the spectrum of non-uniform Kirkman frames of type . They determined the spectrum for the cases where , leaving 24 cases of . In this paper, we continue to investigate this spectrum problem by removing all of these 24 possible exceptions. Using this result, we show that for each value of the obvious necessary conditions on are also sufficient.", "paper_title": "Kirkman frames having hole type h(u)m(1) for h equivalent to 0 mod 12", "paper_id": "WOS:000338117600002"}
