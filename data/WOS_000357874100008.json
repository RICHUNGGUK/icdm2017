The PS ontology is based on the UK payments ontology and reuses, among others, the W3C Registered Organization Vocabulary and the Core Business Vocabulary. RDFized data are linked to product classifications, Geonames and DBpedia resources. Online services contain advanced search features and domain level information (e.g. local government), simple and complex visualizations based on network analysis, linked information about payment entities and SPARQL endpoints. During February 2013, the growing dataset consists of approximately 2 million payment decisions valued 44.5 billion euros forming 65 million triples.", "paper_title": "Public spending as LOD: The case of Greece", "paper_id": "WOS:000357874100008"}
