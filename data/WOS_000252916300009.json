Design/methodology/approach - A reference limit eddy current FE problem is first solved by considering perfect conductors via appropriate boundary conditions. Its solution gives the source for eddy current FE perturbation subproblems in each conductor with its actual conductivity. Each of these problems requires an appropriate mesh of the associated conductor and its surrounding region. Findings - The skin and proximity effects in inductors can be accurately determined in a wide frequency range, allowing for a precise consideration of inductive phenomena as well as joule losses calculations in thermal coupling. Originality/value - The developed subdomain method allows to accurately determine the current density distributions and ensuing joule losses in conductors of any shape, not only in the frequency domain but also in the time domain. It extends the domain of validity and applicability of impedance boundary condition techniques. It also allows the solution process to be lightened, as well as efficient parameterized analyses on signal forms and conductor characteristics.", "paper_title": "Subdomain perturbation finite element method for skin and proximity effects in inductors", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300009"}
