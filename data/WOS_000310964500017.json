Using publication records of 852 social scientists, we show that performance differences indeed exist. However, our case study suggests that in the younger generation of researchers these have disappeared. If performance differences exist at all in our case, young female researchers outperform young male researchers. The trend in developed societies, that women increasingly outperform men in all levels of education, is also becoming effective in the science system.", "paper_title": "Gender differences in scientific productivity: a persisting phenomenon?", "paper_id": "WOS:000310964500017"}
