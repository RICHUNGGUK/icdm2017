In each time step, an arbitrary number of packets arrive and only one packet can be sent. The buffer can store a limited number of packets and, due to the FIFO property, the sequence of sent packets has to be a subsequence of the arriving packets. The differentiated service model is abstracted by attributing each packet with a value according to its service level. A buffer management strategy can drop packets, and the goal is to maximize the sum of the values of sent packets. For only two different packet values, we introduce the account strategy and prove that this strategy achieves an optimal competitive ratio of root 2 - (root 5 + 4 root 2 - 3)/2 approximate to 1.282 if the buffer size tends to infinity and an optimal competitive ratio of (root 13 - 1)/2 approximate to 1.303 for arbitrary buffer sizes. For general packet values, the simple preemptive greedy strategy (PG) is studied. We show that PG achieves a competitive ratio of root 3 approximate to 1.732 which is the best known upper bound on the competitive ratio of this problem. In addition, we give a lower bound of 1 + 1/root 2 approximate to 1.707 on the competitive ratio of PG which improves the previously known lower bound. As a consequence, the competitive ratio of PG cannot be further improved significantly.", "paper_title": "Lower and Upper Bounds on FIFO Buffer Management in QoS Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000264698900006"}
