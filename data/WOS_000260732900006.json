It is based on the specification agreed inside the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF). Accordingly, this library is nicknamed ETSF_IO. The purpose of this article is to give both an overview of the ETSF_IO library and a closer look at its usage. ETSF_IO is designed to be robust and easy to use, close to Fortran read and write routines. To facilitate its adoption, a complete documentation of the input and output arguments of the routines is available in the package, as well as six tutorials explaining in detail various possible uses of the library routines.", "paper_title": "Sharing electronic structure and crystallographic data with ETSF_IO", "paper_id": "WOS:000260732900006"}
