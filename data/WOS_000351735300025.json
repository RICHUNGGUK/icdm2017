The main idea of the method is to construct a variable-length mapping sequence with unparallel lambda positions, with which to map short-length-OOCs into long-length OOCs to realize the general construction of ML OOCs with correlation value lambda with high efficiency by the Johnson bound. The cardinality of multiple-length mapping sequences is derived. Based on the cardinality, the fundamentals of constructing the aforementioned multiple-length mapping sequences are presented and proved. The construction method of ML OOCs with arbitrary cross-correlation lambda is given. Simulation results show that the method can construct ML OOCs with arbitrary lambda; the applications of ML OOCs show that the method is practical for constructing ML OOCs to support multiple service.", "paper_title": "General Construction Method of Multilength Optical Orthogonal Codes With Arbitrary Cross-Correlation Constraint for OCDMA Multimedia Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000351735300025"}
