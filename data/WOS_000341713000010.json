Design/methodology/approach - Transport in silicon semiconductor devices can be described using the Drift-Diffusion model, and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (MC) of the Boltzmann Transport Equation. Findings - A new estimator of the heat generation rate to be used in MC simulations has been found. Originality/value - The new estimator for the heat generation rate has better approximation properties due to reduced statistical fluctuations.", "paper_title": "Heat generation in silicon nanometric semiconductor devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713000010"}
