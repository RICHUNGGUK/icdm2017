The system contains a modified level-crossing analog-to-digital converter and a novel algorithm for detecting the R-peaks from the level-crossing sampled data in a compressed volume of data. Simulated with MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, the proposed system delivers an average detection accuracy of 98.3%, a sensitivity of 98.89%, and a positive prediction of 99.4%. Synthesized in 0.13 mu m CMOS technology with a 1.2 V supply voltage, the overall system consumes 622 nW with core area of 0.136 mm(2), which make it suitable for wearable wireless ECG sensors in body-sensor networks.", "paper_title": "A Level-Crossing Based QRS-Detection Algorithm for Wearable ECG Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000329516400021"}
