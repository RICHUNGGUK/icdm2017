Interaction between users is produced in many environments and new mobility technologies allow access information anytime and anywhere. Many researches and location systems have focused in specific domains to share knowledge between agents. This article proposes a global ontology to let agents work with heterogeneous domains using a wireless network. The intention of the proposed ontology is to provide customization about different environment services based on user location and profile.", "paper_title": "Heterogeneous domain ontology for location based information system in a multi-agent framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900142"}
