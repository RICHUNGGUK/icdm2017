To design the intelligent complementary beamforming, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is utilized, whose beam pattern exhibits perfect nulling performance at the main beam angles, and provides uniform power out of main beams. The proposed method can be utilized with any arbitrary beamforming algorithms and can control the power with a small value of E to satisfy detection criteria of communication standards.", "paper_title": "Intelligent beamforming for personal area network systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100060"}
