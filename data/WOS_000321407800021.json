It allows to describe models of physical components and then to connect them to obtain the model of a system. However, this language cannot support the description of some physical phenomena, such local ones, defined by numerical methods (e.g.: finite element method, special numerical integrals). When an aspect of a model cannot be described in VHDL-AMS, the paper proposes to use software components. So, the aim of the paper is to propose a generic way to extend the computation capability of VHDL-AMS, by coupling the models described in VHDL-AMS with external ones specified as software components (where VHDL-AMS fails). The approach has been applied on several applications, among them the time simulation of an electrical plunger. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
