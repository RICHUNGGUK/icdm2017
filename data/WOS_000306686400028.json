The package contains a comprehensive collection of functions required to fit and cross-validate genomic prediction models. All functions are embedded within the framework of a single, unified data object. Thereby a versatile genomic prediction analysis pipeline covering data processing, visualization and analysis is established within one software package. The implementation is flexible with respect to a wide range of data formats and models. The package fills an existing gap in the availability of user-friendly software for next-generation genetics research and education.", "paper_title": "synbreed: a framework for the analysis of genomic prediction data using R", "paper_id": "WOS:000306686400028"}
