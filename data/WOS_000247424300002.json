In most cases, only reporting the point predictions is unsatisfactory and intervals are needed to quantify the uncertainty involved. It is common practice to use the 95% prediction interval for this goal and to interpret such an interval as if 95% of the future responses will be contained within this interval. However, this is inappropriate, and it can result in a gross underestimation of the real uncertainty of the predicted response, especially in cases where the degrees of freedom is small. To correctly quantify the uncertainty of a prediction, so-called tolerance intervals should be used. Although the theoretical background on tolerance intervals is well documented in the statistical literature, practical guidelines to calculate and use tolerance intervals in real-world applications are lacking. Another less known concept is that of simultaneous versus non-simultaneous intervals. In this tutorial, we explain the origin, interpretation and practical calculation of confidence, prediction, and tolerance intervals, both in their simultaneous and non-simultaneous form. Depending on the case, equations for exact or approximate tolerance intervals are provided. The accuracy of the approximations is discussed. A MATLAB program is available to estimate the exact width of tolerance intervals in all cases involving ordinary least squares regression. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
