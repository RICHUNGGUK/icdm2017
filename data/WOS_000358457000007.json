Conversely, the category MV(C)(G) is transferred into the category GS by means of a contravariant functor P. Moreover, it is shown that the functor 14 is faithful, the functor P is full and the both functors are dense. The description of finite coproduct of algebras, which are isomorphic to Chang algebra, is given. Using duality a characterization of projective algebras in MV(C)(G) is given. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
