Monte Carlo simulations show that all the considered estimators, including the simulated maximum-likelihood (SML) estimation, of the trivariate probit model are biased in very small samples (N=100). With moderately small samples (N=500), some of the approximations perform as well as the SML estimator when the degree of endogeneity is not very large. Some of the approximations seem robust with higher correlations and are also promising for testing the exogeneity of binary covariates. The methods are used to estimate the impact of employment-based health insurance and health care (HC) on HC use, where the approximations seem to work at least as well as the SML and in some cases better.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the performance of simple estimators for probit models with two dummy endogenous regressors", "paper_id": "WOS:000320187500011"}
