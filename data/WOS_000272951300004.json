However, it is challenging to effectively identify anomalies from the voluminous amount of noisy, high-dimensional data. The traditional manual approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and even worse, not scalable. In this paper, we present an automated mechanism for node-level anomaly identification in large-scale systems. A set of techniques is presented to automatically analyze collected data: data transformation to construct a uniform data format for data analysis, feature extraction to reduce data size, and unsupervised learning to detect the nodes acting differently from others. Moreover, we compare two techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), for feature extraction. We evaluate our prototype implementation by injecting a variety of faults into a production system at NCSA. The results show that our mechanism, in particular, the one using ICA-based feature extraction, can effectively identify faulty nodes with high accuracy and low computation overhead.", "paper_title": "Toward Automated Anomaly Identification in Large-Scale Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272951300004"}
