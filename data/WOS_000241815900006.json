The present paper presents a novel method for the classification of coding and non-coding regions in prokaryotic genomes, based on a suitably defined compression index of a DNA sequence. The main features of this new method are the non-parametric logic and the costruction of a dictionary of words extracted from the sequences. These dictionaries can be very useful to perform further analyses on the genomic sequences themselves. The proposed approach has been applied on some prokaryotic complete genomes, obtaining optimal scores of correctly recognized coding and non-coding regions. Several false-positive and false-negative cases have been investigated in detail, which have revealed that this approach can fail in the presence of highly structured coding regions (e.g., genes coding for modular proteins) or quasi-random non-coding regions (e.g., regions hosting non-functional fragments of copies of functional genes; regions hosting promoters or other protein-binding sequences). We perform an overall comparison with other gene-finder software, since at this step we are not interested in building another gene-finder system, but only in exploring the possibility of the suggested approach.", "paper_title": "A compression-based approach for coding sequences identification.
