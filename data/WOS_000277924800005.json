Hardware-level dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques can effectively constrain the chip temperature, but degrades the performance. We propose an OS-level technique that performs thermal-aware job scheduling to reduce DTMs. The algorithm is based on the observation that hot and cool jobs executed in a different order can make a difference in resulting temperature. Real-system implementation in Linux shows that our scheduler can remove 10.5% to 73.6% of the hardware DTMs in a medium thermal environment. The CPU throughput is improved by up to 7.6% (4.1%, on average) in a severe thermal environment.", "paper_title": "Performance-Aware Thermal Management via Task Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000277924800005"}
