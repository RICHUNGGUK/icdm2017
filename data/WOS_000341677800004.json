Moreover, we employ the LeFiR scheme to model the localized nature of deformation introduced by a new treatment modality - laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for treating neurological disorders. Magnetic resonance (MR) guided LITT has recently emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to craniotomy for local treatment of brain diseases (such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and epilepsy). However, LITT is currently only practised as an investigational procedure world-wide due to lack of data on longer term patient outcome following LITT. There is thus a need to quantitatively evaluate treatment related changes between post- and pre-LITT in terms of MR imaging markers. In order to validate LeFiR, we tested the scheme on a synthetic brain dataset (SBD) and in two real clinical scenarios for treating GBM and epilepsy with LITT. Four experiments under different deformation profiles simulating localized ablation effects of LITT on MRI were conducted on 286 pairs of SBD images. The training landmark configurations were obtained through 2000 iterations of registration where the points with consistently best registration performance were selected. The estimated landmarks greatly improved the quality metrics compared to a uniform grid (UniG) placement scheme, a speeded-up robust features (SURF) based method, and a scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) based method as well as a generic free-form deformation (FFD) approach. The LeFiR method achieved average 90% improvement in recovering the local deformation compared to 82% for the uniform grid placement, 62% for the SURF based approach, and 16% for the generic FFD approach. On the real GBM and epilepsy data, the quantitative results showed that LeFiR outperformed UniG by 28% improvement in average. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
