The modulus of elasticity of Abies pinsapo Boiss. timber was predicted in this study through the parameters of density, width, thickness, moisture content, ultrasonic wave propagation velocity and visual grading of the test pieces. A feedforward multilayer perceptron network was designed for this purpose, achieving 75.0% success in the testing or unknown group. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
