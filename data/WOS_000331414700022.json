In this paper, real-time scheduling algorithms, namely ELST (Effective Least Slack Time First) and H-ELST (Heuristic-Effective Least Slack Time First), are presented for CPS, where servicing node needs to move to serviced node for real-time services. We measure the real-time performance in terms of deadline meet ratio by mathematical analysis and simulations. The results show that our algorithms reduce a deadline miss ratio approximately up to 50% and 20% compared to the conventional real-time scheduling algorithm, FIFO (First In First Out) and LST (Least Slack Time First), respectively.
