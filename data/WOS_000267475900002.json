It is therefore important to understand the current state of the art in image display technology so that one can begin to anticipate how this technology in the future will evolve, and how best to take advantage of that evolution once it matures. This chapter focuses on the issues of image display and how new advanced displays that are being used mainly in research and higher education today may become commonplace in the next 5-10 years.", "paper_title": "Advances in Computer Displays", "paper_id": "WOS:000267475900002"}
