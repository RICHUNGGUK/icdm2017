However, the results of fuzzy clustering depend highly on the initial state selection and there is also a high risk for getting the best results when the datasets are large. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm based on FCM and modified stem cells algorithms, we called it SC-FCM algorithm, for optimum clustering of a dataset into K clusters. The experimental results obtained by using the new algorithm on different well-known datasets compared with those obtained by K-means algorithm, FCM, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm demonstrate the better performance of the new algorithm.
