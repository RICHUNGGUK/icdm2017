In existing works, the asymptotic capacity is only obtained in the high peak power region at secondary transmitter (ST) or obtained without considering the interference from primary transmitter (PT) for easy analysis. Here, we analyze the asymptotic capacity by considering an arbitrary peak power at the ST and the interference from the PT based on extreme value theory. Simulation results show that our approximated capacity is well-matched to the exact capacity. Furthermore, the scaling law of our capacity is found to be double logarithm of the number of secondary users.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Capacity Analysis in Multipoint-to-Point Cognitive Radio Networks with an Arbitrary Peak Power", "paper_id": "WOS:000335833600005"}
