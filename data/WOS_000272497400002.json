The problem is generalised from the identification of friction models of servo mechanical systems via limit-cycle experiments under dual-channel relay feedback. Locations of limit cycles are given so that the exact durations between two consecutive switchings of relays can be determined via numerical computation. After this, local stability of limit cycles can be checked via the Jacobian of Poincare map. Examples are analysed using proposed theorems.", "paper_title": "Limit cycles induced in type-1 linear systems with PID-type of relay feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000272497400002"}
