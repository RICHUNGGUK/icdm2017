In this paper, a refined Runge-Kutta-Dormand-Prince explicit algorithm and a fully implicit Euler scheme are compared for the integration of the latter class of models. The explicit and implicit procedures have been tested along different hydromechanical paths, involving various hydraulic and mechanical external control conditions. Accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms have been investigated. The results confirm that substepping is mandatory for the explicit algorithm to converge regardless the initial step size and to remain sufficiently accurate. The value of the incremental hydromechanical work per unit volume was calculated during the explicit integration procedure. The numerical results show that the maximum size of the substep which can be adopted to meet a given tolerance depends on the gradient of the incremental work per unit volume. Therefore, the latter appears a good candidate to identify problematic integration steps in terms of convergence. Accuracy of the implicit algorithm also depends on the chosen step size, although the algorithm proved to be convergent in all the paths analysed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
