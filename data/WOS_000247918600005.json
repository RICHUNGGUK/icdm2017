It adjusts the modulation order and allocates the transmit power to each spatial sub-channel when meeting the user's requirements at the cost of minimum transmission power. Compared to the other algorithm, it can obtain good performance with lower computational complexity and can be applied to the wireless communication system. Computer simulation results present the efficiency of the proposed scheme. And its performance under different channel condition has been compared with the other algorithm.", "paper_title": "Optimal bit allocation adaptive modulation algorithm for MIMO system", "paper_id": "WOS:000247918600005"}
