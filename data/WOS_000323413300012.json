To this end, four cases are considered to show the existence of the fuzzy solution mentioned equation. Some theorems are proved, and the uniqueness of the fuzzy solution is discussed step by step. Finally, the illustrated examples are solved to investigate the conditions of theorems.", "paper_title": "Toward the existence and uniqueness of solutions of second-order fuzzy volterra integro-differential equations with fuzzy kernel", "paper_id": "WOS:000323413300012"}
