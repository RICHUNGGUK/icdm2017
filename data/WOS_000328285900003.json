The first one is the HLB(N; Q(x); Q(y); Q(z)) family, derived by using the Cartesian coordinate system and the Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The second one is the SLB(N; K; L; M) family, derived by using the spherical coordinate system and the Gauss-Laguerre, as well as the Gauss-Legendre quadratures. These models order themselves according to the maximum order N of the moments of the equilibrium distribution function that are exactly recovered. Microfluidics effects(slip velocity, temperature jump, as well as the longitudinal heat flux that is not driven by a temperature gradient) are accurately captured during the simulation of Couette flow for Knudsen number (kn) up to 0.25.", "paper_title": "GAUSS QUADRATURES - THE KEYSTONE OF LATTICE BOLTZMANN MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000328285900003"}
