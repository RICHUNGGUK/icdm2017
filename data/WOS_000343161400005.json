This system detects the peak of the R-wave based on wavelet transform (WT) and then uses a new algorithm to detect PVC. The proposed PVC detection algorithm combines the sum of trough and sum of R_peak with minimum to detect PVC. A crucial function of morbid warning is implemented in this system so that users receive an alert signal when PVC is detected. The proposed system is simulated and verified using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (mitdb). The system is also implemented by FPGA to illustrate its high precision and real-time performance.", "paper_title": "High-Precision Real-Time Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) Detection System Based on Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000343161400005"}
