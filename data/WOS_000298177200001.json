In particular, the specific problem of power-aware routing and wavelength assignment (PA-RWA) is addressed considering a transparent multi-fiber optical network. An integer linear programming formulation is provided for the static lightpath establishment problem and a few heuristics are proposed to solve the problem in the case of dynamic lightpath establishment. To solve the routing problem we propose a novel algorithm named load based cost; it is based on a cost function that considers the load of each optical fiber to compute link weights. We also propose two new wavelength assignment algorithms: the first one is derived from the first fit heuristic whilst the second one is based on an innovative approach. It works like a least cost routing algorithm assigning a cost to each wavelength for each link in the path and then minimizes the total cost. Our proposal is compared with a number of already known RWA algorithms showing that it is able to reduce the power consumption of the network by about 20-30%, depending on the amount of traffic treated, with respect to state of the art algorithms with a difference of about 10% with respect to the lower bound. In order to provide a complete analysis of the feasibility of the proposed heuristics, the blocking probability is evaluated: the results show that, unlike the other power-aware algorithms here considered, our proposal shows a low impairment with respect to the least congested path-first fit alternative. Another important result regards the better performance of the proposed wavelength assignment algorithm with respect to first fit.", "paper_title": "Power-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment in Multi-Fiber Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298177200001"}
