M-unambiguity is studied both in terms of words and matrices and several sufficient criteria for M-unambiguity are provided in both cases, nontrivially generalizing the criteria based on the gamma-property introduced by Salomaa in [15]. Also, the notion of M-unambiguity with respect to a word is defined in connection with the extended Parikh matrix morphism [16] and some of the M-unambiguity criteria are lifted from the classical setting to the extended one.", "paper_title": "Injectivity of the Parikh matrix mappings revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000240746400023"}
