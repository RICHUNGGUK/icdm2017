In this paper we study three-dimensional orthogonal drawings and provide lower bounds for three scenarios: (1) drawings where the vertices have a bounded aspect ratio, (2) drawings where the surfaces of vertices are proportional to their degrees, and (3) drawings without any such restrictions. Then we show that these lower bounds are asymptotically optimal, by providing constructions that in all scenarios match the lower bounds within a constant factor.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional orthogonal graph drawing with optimal volume", "paper_id": "WOS:000235219800004"}
