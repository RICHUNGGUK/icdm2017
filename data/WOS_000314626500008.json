This is done through the design and development of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Architecture following SOA and RM-ODP principles, to facilitate openness, reusability, scalability and interoperability. Rationale selection of standards, technologies and platforms, considering system's requirements (real time, cost ellipsis) has been done. An iterative agile development process, with incremental stages from design to final prototype, has been used. Early outcomes are centered in two services; multimedia flow management and notification. They have been developed using CORBA and are embedded in system's devices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
