The derived closed-form equation for output voltage enables the usage of the model in computer-aided design (CAD) tools for complex systems where high simulation speed is essential. The model also combines together properties such as inductive coupling, initial conditions, signal rise time, input phases, and bit sequences that have not been included in a single closed-form model before. The model is compared to HSPICE and previous models. The model and HSPICE are in good agreement with each other.", "paper_title": "Analytical model for crosstalk and intersymbol interference in point-to-point buses", "paper_id": "WOS:000238709900017"}
