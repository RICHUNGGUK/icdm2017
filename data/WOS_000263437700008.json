Using it allows us to classify the consistency models in two groups, depending on whether they are fast or not. In the case of non-fast consistency models, we show that they cannot be interconnected in any way. In contrast, in the case of fast consistency models we provide protocols to interconnect some of them. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
