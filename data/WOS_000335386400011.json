Accordingly, the Network Local Mobility Management (NETLMM) working group [1] of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [2] as a protocol for accomplishing the transmissibility of mobile terminals. PMIPv6 is a network-led IP-based mobility management protocol, which can control terminal mobility without depending on the type of access system or the capability of the terminal. By combining PMIPv6 and the mobility of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), we can establish terminal mobility and session mobility through a more effective route. The mobility function can be improved and the overlap of function reduced as compared to that in the case of independent operation. PMIPv6 is appropriate for a non-real-time service using TCP, and SIP is appropriate for a real-time service using RTP/UDP. Thus, in the case of a terminal using both services, an effective mobility management is possible only by using PMIPv6 together with SIP. In order to manage mobility in this manner, researches on PMIPv6-SIP are in progress. In line with this trend, this paper suggests a new PMIPv6-SIP architecture where when a mobile terminal conducts a handover, a network-led handover while maintaining the session without the addition of a special function or middleware is possible along with effective performance evaluation through mathematical modeling by comparing the delay and the packet loss that occur during the handover to the Pure-SIP.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of A Novel Inter-Networking Architecture for Cost-Effective Mobility Management Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000335386400011"}
