Rather than assigning material properties to increasingly smaller elements to capture detail in three-dimensional finite element (FE) models, properties can be assigned to Gauss points within larger elements. As part of a validation process, we compared experimental and analytical results from a composite beam under four-point load to FE models with material properties assigned to refined elements and Gauss points within larger elements. Both FE models accurately predicted deformation and the analytical predictions of internal shear stress.", "paper_title": "Validation of an efficient method of assigning material properties in finite element analysis of pelvic bone", "paper_id": "WOS:000347531000001"}
