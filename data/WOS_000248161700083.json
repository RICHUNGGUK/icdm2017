Protonation states are modeled with different charge sets, and titrating residues are sampled from a Boltzmann distribution of protonation states. The simulation periodically adopts Monte Carlo sampling based on Generalized Born (GB) derived energies. However, when this approach was applied to a bio-toxin, Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) at pH 4.4, 4.7, 5.0, 6.8 and 7.2, the pK predictions yielded by the method were inconsistent with the experimental values. The systems being simulated were divergent. Furthermore, the system behaviors in a very weak acidic solution (pH 6.8) and in a very weak basic solution (pH 7.2) were significantly different from the neutral case (pH 7.0). Hence, we speculate this method may require further study for modeling large biomolecule.
