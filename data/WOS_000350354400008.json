The main innovative aspect of the proof is a simple combinatorial argument showing that the rectangle covering number of the unique-disjointness matrix is at least , and thus the nondeterministic communication complexity of the unique-disjointness predicate is at least . We thereby slightly improve on the previously best known lower bounds and , respectively.", "paper_title": "A Short Proof that the Extension Complexity of the Correlation Polytope Grows Exponentially", "paper_id": "WOS:000350354400008"}
