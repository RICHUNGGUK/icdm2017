This paper gives analysis on the variable block-size techniques based on software simulations, and variable block-size transform is specially studied. As a result of the analysis, a generalized dual quad-tree based variable block-size coding (DQTC) structure is proposed. This structure also shows good flexibility and expansibility, in which the prediction block-size set and the transform block-size set can be configured according to requirements and the implementation complexity constraints. Simulation results show a considerable performance improvement for the proposed structure with low implementation complexity while the coding block-size sets and parameters are optimized.
