The aim of this research is to uncover and systematize the factors and dimensions involved in the data representation issue and more exactly in the planning and design of the information products (W) and their previous representation processes (RP). QFD (quality function deployment) is a planning tool based on user needs and expectations - quality functions - allowing the planning and design of IN and RPs. A series of linked deployments provides the implied factors and dimensions: W planning factors - representing, relating, filtering and seeking relevant information; IP design-dimensions - relevance, format, comprehensiveness, consistency, accuracy and currentness; RP planning factors - comprehension, synthesizing, structuring and selecting; and RP design dimensions - human resources, computers and tangibles. By means of these deployments, the analysis of the factors and dimensions and their corresponding relationships provides an excellent picture for the quality planning and design of information products and representation processes.", "paper_title": "Data representation factors and dimensions from the quality function deployment (QFD) perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000236793300002"}
