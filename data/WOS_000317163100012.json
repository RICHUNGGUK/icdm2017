Most CLV prediction models do not take into consideration the dynamics of the customer purchase behavior and changes of the marketing environment such as the adoption of different promotion policies. In this study, a framework for the dynamic CLV prediction using longitudinal data is presented. In the framework, both the dynamic customer purchase behavior and customized promotions are considered. An improved multiple kernel support vector regression (MK-SVR) approach is developed to predict the future CLV and select the best promotion using both the customer behavioral variables and controlled variable about multiple promotions. Computational experiments using two databases show that the MK-SVR exhibits good prediction performance and the usage of longitudinal data in the MK-SVR facilitate the dynamic prediction and promotion optimization.
