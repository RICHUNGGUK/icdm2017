The formulation is weakly coercive for spaces that fail to satisfy the inf-sup condition and consider discontinuous basis functions for the pressure field. We consider the results of a stability analysis through a lemma which indicates that there exists an optimal or quasi-optimal least-square stability parameter that depends on the polynomial degree used to interpolate the velocity and pressure fields, and on the geometry of the finite element in the mesh. We provide several numerical experiments illustrating such dependence, as well as the robustness of the method to deal with arbitrary basis functions for velocity and pressure, and the ability to stabilize large pressure gradients. We believe the results provided in this paper contribute for establishing a paradigm for future studies of the parameter of the Galerkin least square method for second-gradient theory of incompressible flow problems.
