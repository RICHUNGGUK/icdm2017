The model is based on a three-energy-level and three-speed lattice Boltzmann equation by using a method of higher moments of the equilibrium distribution functions. In order to obtain second-order accuracy, we employ the ghost field distribution functions to remove the non-physical Viscous parts. We also use the conditions of the higher moment of the ghost field equilibrium distribution functions to obtain the equilibrium distribution functions. In the numerical examples, we compare the numerical results of this scheme with those obtained by other lattice Boltzmann models for the compressible Euler equations.
