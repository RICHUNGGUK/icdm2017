The power efficiency of the overall heterogeneous power delivery system has recently been shown to be a strong function of the clustering of the power supplies - the specific configuration in which the power converters and regulators are co-designed. A recursive clustering algorithm with polynomial computational complexity is proposed for a dynamically controllable power distribution system. The algorithm is evaluated on IBM power grid benchmark circuits, yielding up to a 21% increase in power efficiency, and orders of magnitude speedup in runtime. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
