In order to provide the shared-path-protected lightpath in multi-domain optical mesh networks, we propose a protection solution, called GSLSSP. A new source egress gateway selecting mechanism is adopted in this solution. For each connection request, this mechanism can enable the source node to select a better egress gateway node to the destination domain and compute one inter-domain working path near the optimal path with the cooperating of this gateway node, under scalability and domain privacy constraint of multi-domain networks. And then one intra-domain link-disjoint local segment-backup path for each working-segment path is computed out in each single-domain passed by the working path. Simulation evaluation shows that the proposed scheme can provide 100% protection ability for multiple failures. Besides, it is effective in multi-domain path protection with more efficient resource utilization, lower blocking probabilities and less inter-domain cost than other schemes.", "paper_title": "Local segment-shared protection based on source egress gateway selection for multi-domain optical mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287703200002"}
