First, the Takagi and Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to represent a boiler-turbine system. Next, based on the fuzzy model, a sufficient condition for the existence of a fuzzy guaranteed cost nonlinear state feedback tracking control is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The advantage of the proposed tracking control design is that only a simple fuzzy controller is constricted and it does neither involve the feedback linearization technique nor complicated adaptive scheme. Numerical simulations of a boiler-turbine system are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design as compared with a linearized approach.", "paper_title": "FUZZY GUARANTEED COST TRACKING CONTROL FOR BOILER-TURBINES VIA TS FUZZY MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700020"}
