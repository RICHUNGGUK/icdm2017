The model accounts for interactions among successive links in a linear network, correcting the overestimation of the blocking probability caused by the link independence assumption. Comparisons with simulation results show that the proposed reduced load approximation is a better substitute for the well-known reduced load approximation that uses the link independence assumption for blocking computation. It is shown that the proposed model provides accurate estimates of blocking probabilities in WDM rings with a wavelength continuity constraint.
