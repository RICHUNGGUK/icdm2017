Achieving interoperability in the e-business generates numerous benefits. Thus, interoperability frameworks are the main component of e-business activities. This paper describes the existing interoperability frameworks for e-business, and performs a comparative analysis among their findings to determine the similarities and differences in their philosophy and implementation. This analysis yields a set of recommendations for any party that is open to the idea of creating or improving an E-business Interoperability Framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
