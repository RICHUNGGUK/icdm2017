In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture based on power-efficient gathering in sensor information system (PEGASIS) and low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH). This architecture can achieve an average distribution of energy loads, and reduced energy consumption in transmission. To further extend the system lifetime, we combine the intersection-based coverage algorithm (IBCA) with LEACH architecture and the hybrid architecture to prolong the system lifetime that introducing sensor nodes to enter sleep mode when inactive. This step can save more energy consumption. Simulation results show that the performance of our proposed LEACH architecture with IBCA and the hybrid architecture with IBCA perform better than LEACH architecture with PBCA in terms of energy efficiency, surviving nodes and sensing areas.", "paper_title": "A New Hybrid Architecture with an Intersection-Based Coverage Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341333500008"}
