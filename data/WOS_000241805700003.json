A novel capacity independent approach is presented. It verifies the strong convergence of the algorithm under a very weak assumption of the step sizes and yields satisfactory convergence rates for polynomially decaying step sizes. Explicit learning rates with respect to the misclassification error are given in terms of the choice of step sizes and the regularization parameter (depending on the sample size). Error bounds associated with the hinge loss, the least square loss, and the support vector machine q-norm loss are presented to illustrate our method.", "paper_title": "Online regularized classification algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700003"}
