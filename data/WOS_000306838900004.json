The algorithm is designed to be a exible tool to tackle general, possibly highly varying input signals in such a way that maintains the maximum signal power without introducing significant data loss. Numerical experiments are presented in the end of the paper to illustrate the behavior of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "WINDOW WALKER - A MARKOV-BASED ADAPTIVE BIT WINDOW SELECTION FOR DSP BLOCKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306838900004"}
