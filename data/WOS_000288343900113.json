Previous studies only show how it increases the level of brand recall while giving very little attention to the effectiveness of persuasion through the consumer's cognitive and affective modes. In this study, advergames are used to represent interactivity with different levels of website richness created by a mix of experimental designs. Two experiments using two different products with search and experience-dominated attributes were conducted. The results indicated that the main effects of interactivity and media richness significantly enhance a consumer's telepresence and affective responses. The cognitive responses were influenced modestly by products dominated by search attributes. Interaction effects were found only in products dominated by experience attributes. Practical, as well as, academic contributions are presented. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
