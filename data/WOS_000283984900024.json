The current research challenge is to design and realize radio systems that should be able to achieve a desired quality-of-service (QoS) in harsh, time-varying, coexisting industrial environments. Conventional coexistence solutions attempt to accommodate coexisting systems in a single dimension, mostly in the frequency dimension. The concept of multidimensional electromagnetic (EM) space utilization provides optimal opportunities to achieve coexistence optimized solutions. It can revolutionarily augment the shareable capacity of the resource space and provide optimal coexisting capabilities of radio systems. A software defined radio (SDR)-based cognitive radio (CR) is realized which can exploit the frequency, time, and power dimensions of the EM space to improve coexistence in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. Furthermore, a conventional hardware defined radio (HDR) and additional simulations are used to test and prove the feasibility of the triple EM space utilization. Joint results of these experiments are presented in this contribution. Additionally, we present a novel computational efficient algorithm to detect cyclic properties of industrial wireless systems.", "paper_title": "Exploitation of Multiple Hyperspace Dimensions to Realize Coexistence Optimized Wireless Automation Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283984900024"}
