PCST appears frequently in the design of utility networks where profit generating customers and the network connecting them have to be chosen in the most profitable way. Our main contribution is the formulation and implementation of a branch-and-cut algorithm based on a directed graph model where we combine several state-of-the-art methods previously used for the Steiner tree problem. Our method outperforms the previously published results on the standard benchmark set of problems. We can solve all benchmark instances from the literature to optimality, including some of them for which the optimum was not known. Compared to a recent algorithm by Lucena and Resende, our new method is faster by more than two orders of magnitude. We also introduce a new class of more challenging instances and present computational results for them. Finally, for a set of large-scale real-world instances arising in the design of fiber optic networks, we also obtain optimal solution values.", "paper_title": "An algorithmic framework for the exact solution of the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000233867100015"}
