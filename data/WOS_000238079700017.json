A small example of network is given, along with its model, which is then extended and simulated. We also show the different directions we plan to take in order to make the models even more realistic and to be able to verify them.", "paper_title": "Network structure and traffic modeling and simulation with CO-OPN", "paper_id": "WOS:000238079700017"}
