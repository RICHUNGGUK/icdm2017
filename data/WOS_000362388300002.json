Main challenges for human pose estimation are variation of body poses, complicated background and depth ambiguities. To solve these problems, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the related fields. In this survey, we focus our attention on the recent advances in vision-based human pose estimation. We first present a general framework of human pose estimation, and then go through the latest technical progress on each stage. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the existing approaches and foresee the future directions to be explored. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
