The symbol error rate (SER) is also presented by theoretical derivation and Monte-Carlo simulations. It is shown that the performance of TH-precoding is better than the classical V-BLAST algorithm. It is mainly due to the cancellation of error propagation. The comparison between TH-precoding with sub-channel ordering and one without sub-channel ordering is also investigated.", "paper_title": "Performance of Tomlinson-Harashima precoding over spatially correlated MIMO channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000026"}
