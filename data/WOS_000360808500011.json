With the advent of Vehicle Ad hoc Network (VANET), the Roadside Unit (RSU) can be considered as an anchor or base station to offer positioning reference. The ground-based positioning solution can help us acquire more precise position information through many times interaction, but multiple communications will result in heavy burden for network and more energy consumption. In this paper, we firstly analyze the pros and cons of representative algorithm, i.e., Symmetric Double Side-Two way Ranging (SDS-TWR). Then, we propose a novel energy-saving One-Sided Synchronous Two-Way Ranging (OSS-TWR) algorithm to reduce the communication times, which gains lower energy consumption and better performance than SDS-TWR. The experiments verify the validity of our solution. Finally, we make a conclusion and discuss the future works of vehicular positioning.", "paper_title": "A Novel Energy-Saving One-Sided Synchronous Two-Way Ranging Algorithm for Vehicular Positioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000360808500011"}
