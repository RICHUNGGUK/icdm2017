The approach is purely bibliometric, based on census of the full scientific production from all Italian public research organizations active in 2001-2006 (hard sciences only). The analysis is conducted both at sectorial level (aggregated, by scientific discipline and for single fields within disciplines) and at organizational level (by type of organization and for single organizations). The essence of the methodology should be replicable in all other national contexts. Its offers support to policy-makers and administrators for strategic analysis aimed at identifying strengths and weaknesses of national research systems and institutions.", "paper_title": "The field-standardized average impact of national research systems compared to world average: the case of Italy", "paper_id": "WOS:000292210400018"}
