Since the first procedure is resistant to watermarks removal attacks as cropping of windows, removal of rows and columns and JPEG compression, and the second procedure is especially robust against geometric transforms, we get a watermarking system embracing a resistance to the above mentioned attacks. The image corrupting after concatenated watermark usage and error correcting codes applying in order to improve a reliability of fingerprinting application of watermark have been also investigated.", "paper_title": "Concatenated Digital Watermarking System Robust to Different Removal Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345948100020"}
