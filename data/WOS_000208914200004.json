Team cognition and social impact theories are integrated to provide a framework for explaining how technology-mediated collaboration constrains or enhances team shared mental model development and its subsequent impact on task outcomes. Partial least squares analysis revealed that technology-mediated collaboration impacts shared mental model development. The results also demonstrate that timely and accurate development of shared mental model facilitates increases in both productivity and team process satisfaction. Direct observation of team process behaviors suggests that collaboration modes differ not only in their impact on communication facilitation but efficacy-based, motivational, and social influence factors (e. g., self-efficacy and team-efficacy, perceived salience and credibility of contributions, social influence on action, etc.) as well. Shared mental model development requires quality communication among team members that are motivated to participate by a positive team climate that promotes idea convergence.", "paper_title": "Technology-Mediated Collaboration, Shared Mental Model and Task Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000208914200004"}
