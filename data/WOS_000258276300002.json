Our algorithm is based on the reverse search paradigm of Avis and Fukuda. It generates each output graph in O(n(4)) time and O(n) space, or, with a slightly different implementation, in O(n(3)) time and O(n(2)) space. In particular, we obtain that the set of all the constrained non-crossing Laman frameworks on a given point set is connected by flips which preserve the Laman property.", "paper_title": "Enumerating constrained non-crossing minimally rigid frameworks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258276300002"}
