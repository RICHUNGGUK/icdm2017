By introducing rational communication participants, we model the secure communication process in the manner of game theory to capture the interactions of distrusted communication parties. More specifically, we propose a formal framework to provide a precise description of the computation and communication rules in a secure communication game. Each player tends to behave in a way that maximizes their profits in this framework. Following the framework, the fairness of a protocol is presented according to Nash equilibrium of the communication game, as well as the equivalence condition towards a fair protocol. To verify the effectiveness of this framework, we design and implement a series of experiments. The experimental results show that our rational framework is more secure and closer to the practice compared with traditional cryptographic models, which can be a promising analysis solution for future cryptographic protocols.
