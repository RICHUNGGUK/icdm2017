In the real world, automation and manual performance change dynamically with changes in the environment. However, a few studies investigated whether changes in automation or manual performance have more effect on whether users choose to use automation. We used two types of experimental tracking tasks in which the participants had to select whether to use automation or conduct manual operation while monitoring the variable performance of automation and manual operation. As a result, we found that there is a mutual relationship between human use of automation and their sensitivity to automation and manual performance changes. Also, users do not react equally to both automation and manual performance changes although they use automation adequately.", "paper_title": "Experimental Investigation of Calibration and Resolution in Human-Automation System Interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000321467700015"}
