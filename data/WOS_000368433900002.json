In search-based layout methods there are typically a number of parameters that control the search algorithm which do not affect the fitness function, but nevertheless have an impact on the final layout. We explore how varying three parameters (grid spacing, the starting distance of allowed node movement and the number of iterations) affects the resultant diagram in a hill-climbing layout system. Using an iterative process, we produce diagram layouts that are significantly better than those produced by ad-hoc parameter settings.", "paper_title": "Improving Search-Based Schematic Layout by Parameter Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000368433900002"}
