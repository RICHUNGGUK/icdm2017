In particular, this optimisation problem is considered from two different points of view: single and multiobjective problem formulations. Some of existing approaches within both formulations are surveyed, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Two most popular evolutionary multiobjective algorithms and one single objective algorithm are adapted to optimisation of the anti-spam filters' scores and compared on publicly available datasets widely used for benchmarking purposes. This comparison is discussed, and the recommendations for the developers and users of optimising anti-spam filters are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
