This package also allows the analysis of relevant properties of those resonances such as the square of the wave functions at the origin, their corresponding derivatives for l not equal 0 states, typical heavy-quark velocities, and mean square radii. Besides, it includes a tool to analyze the spin dependent contributions to the heavy quarkonia spectrum, providing the splitting of n(3)S(1)-n(1)S(0), as well as the n(3)p(J) - n(1)P(1), energy levels. Finally a simple software implemented in QQ-onia to compute E1 transition rates is presented.", "paper_title": "QQ-onia package: a numerical solution to the Schrodinger radial equation for heavy quarkonium", "paper_id": "WOS:000265158700009"}
