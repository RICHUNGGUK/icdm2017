The interleaving of different threads constitutes a multi-thread. Several multi-threads may exist concurrently on a single host in a network, several host behaviours may exist concurrently in a single network on the internet, etc. In the current paper we assume that the abovementioned kind of interleaving is also present at those other levels. We extend the theory developed so far with features to cover the multi-level case. We employ the resulting theory to develop a simplified, formal representation schema of the design of systems that consist of several multi-threaded programs on various hosts in different networks and to verify a property of all systems designed according to that schema.", "paper_title": "A thread algebra with multi-level strategic interleaving", "paper_id": "WOS:000246522600002"}
