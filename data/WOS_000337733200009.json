In this paper, a model reference control approach is addressed for nonlinear affine singular systems. First, a basic control system is proposed based on the Lyapunov stability theorem so that nonlinear singular system can asymptotically track the desired linear reference model. After that, in the second design, it has been considered that systems' parameters are unknown and two adaptive approaches are investigated. For better illustration, simulation has been done and the results show the tracking performance for both presented control systems.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Control for Nonlinear Singular Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337733200009"}
