ITM knowledge representation language is based on topic maps. We show that these topic maps (and especially those describing the domain ontology and the annotation base) can be naturally mapped to the SG family, a sublanguage of conceptual graphs. As this mapping is reversible, ITM can be equipped with a graph-based query language equivalent to conjunctive queries and it can be enriched with inference rules.", "paper_title": "Introducing graph-based reasoning into a knowledge management tool: An industrial case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800064"}
