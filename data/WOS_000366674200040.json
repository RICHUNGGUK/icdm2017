It is necessary to identify the key factors affecting urban regeneration and then construct an urban regeneration decision-making evaluation system to provide a basis for objective and comprehensive judgment for urban regeneration decision-making. Through constructing a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model based on the entropy weight method, this paper attempts to provide a scientific evaluation method for the suitability of urban regeneration. An urban regeneration scheduling method by sorting the appropriate degree of the update of different areas in the large region, is proposed to achieve urban regeneration implementation in the sequence of time and space optimization.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of urban regeneration decision-making based on entropy weight method: Case study of yuzhong peninsula, China", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200040"}
