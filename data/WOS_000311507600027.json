How to respond to such changes rapidly and at minimum cost constitutes a major challenge for manufacturers. The DIMS project (Dynamically Integrated Manufacturing Systems) has developed an agent-based approach that enables manufacturing systems to be modelled using multi-agent systems such that optimal and timely responses to changes are generated from the interactions taking place within the multi-agents systems. This approach also incorporates a distributed discrete event simulation mechanism that enables 'what-if' system configurations that have been generated through agent interactions to be evaluated dynamically for system restructure. This paper presents the approach with particular focus on the distributed simulation mechanism.", "paper_title": "Modelling and simulation of dynamically integrated manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507600027"}
