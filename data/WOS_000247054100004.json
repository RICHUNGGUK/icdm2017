In this paper, we focus on the use of unique representations of data objects in terms of public repositories (in this case MusicBrainz) and the use of recommendation mechanisms as a basis for supporting information access. We have implemented a prototypical system with the corresponding functionality in the area of digital music. We discuss the challenges of providing integrated access to structured web resources and the solutions adopted in the MusiDB system. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
