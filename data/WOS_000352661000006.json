Individual density functions are flexibly modeled using Bernstein densities, which are mixtures of beta densities whose parameters depend only on the number of mixture components. A prior distribution is placed on the number of mixture components, and the mixture weights are expressed as increments of a distribution function G. A Dirichlet process prior is placed on G and the parameters of the Dirichlet process, the baseline distribution and the precision parameter, are treated as random. A mixture of a product of beta densities is used to partition subjects into groups, with subjects in the same group sharing information via a common baseline distribution. Inference is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo. A computing algorithm based on the constructive definition of the Dirichlet process is offered, for both a fixed number of groups and an unknown number of groups. When the number of groups is unknown, a birth-death algorithm is used to make inference regarding the number of groups. The model is demonstrated using radiologist-specific distributions of percent mammographic density. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
