In this paper we present a general purpose neural-net able to obtain adaptive periodical controllers, described by means of the NSBL. NSBL is a Neuro-Symbolic Behavior modeling Language that allows one to express propositional logical inference and to translate them into the logically equivalent neural network. Such general periodic clocks are peculiar to each behavior, and their periods are influenced by the sensor input changing rate. In this way, the Robotic System is able to adapt its reaction time coherently to the changes occurring in the environment and to its internal state. To test our architecture we investigate the case of two conflicting behaviors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
