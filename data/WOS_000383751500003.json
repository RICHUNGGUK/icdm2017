Security of the proposed scheme relies on k-CAA Problem as well as Computational Diffie-Hellman problem and is resistant against chosen message attack. The scheme is suited for broadcast authentication and integrity of message exchanging between the sensor nodes. The process of generation of the signature is carried out in two phases online and off-line. The heavy computation is performed in off-line phase, i.e the base station. The actual signature will be generated in the sensor nodes. The authors assume that the online phase is more efficient. Here they have evaluated the size of the signature with respect to the size of the user's public key and compare with some current schemes. Also, the authors have evaluated the computational cost and time which shows the scheme is most suited to implement on sensor node.", "paper_title": "Short Online/Off-line Signature Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000383751500003"}
