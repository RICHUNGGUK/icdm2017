Recently new approaches have been advanced based on mixed formulations. In the present paper a fully coupled 3-D mixed finite element model is developed with the aim at alleviating the pore pressure numerical oscillations at the interface between materials with different permeabilities. A solution algorithm is implemented that takes advantage of the block structure of the discretized problem. The proposed model is verified against well-known analytical solutions and successfully experimented with in realistic applications of soil consolidation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
