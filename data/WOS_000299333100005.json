In this paper we analyze a kanban controlled and heijunka leveled production system where the arriving demands are controlled and limited by a kanban loop. The production system is modeled as a queueing network with synchronization stations. The aim is to determine the optimal number of production kanbans, and thus the buffer size that guarantees a given service level.", "paper_title": "Buffer sizing of a Heijunka Kanban system", "paper_id": "WOS:000299333100005"}
