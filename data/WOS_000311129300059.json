By representing the testing image as a sparse linear combination of the training samples, sparse representation based classification (SRC) has been successfully applied in face recognition. In SRC, the l(1) minimization instead of the l(0) minimization is used to seek for the sparse solution for its computational convenience and efficiency. However, l(1) minimization does not always yield sufficiently sparse solution in many practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel SRC method, namely the l(P) (0 < p < 1) sparse representation based classification (l(P)-SRC), to seek for the optimal sparse representation of a testing image. In l(P)-SRC, the l(P) (0 < p < 1) minimization is adopted as an alternative to l(0) minimization, the solution of which is sparser than that of l(1) minimization used in traditional SRC. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the l(P) minimization problem in this paper. The extensive experimental results on publicly available face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of l(p)-SRC for robust face recognition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
