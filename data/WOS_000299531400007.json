The proposed algorithm utilizes a new addressing scheme and the associated angle generator logic in order to remove any ROM usage for storing twiddle factors. As a case study, the radix-2 and radix-4 FFT algorithms have been implemented on FPGA hardware. The synthesis results match the theoretical analysis and it can be observed that more than 20% reduction can be achieved in total memory logic. In addition, the dynamic power consumption can be reduced by as much as 15% by reducing memory accesses.", "paper_title": "Reduced Memory and Low Power Architectures for CORDIC-based FFT Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000299531400007"}
