Unlike a static primitive, where the depth function is planar, the depth function is a rational function in time and the lens parameters. Furthermore, we show how these compact depth functions can be used to design an efficient depth buffer compressor/decompressor, which significantly lowers total depth buffer bandwidth usage for a range of test scenes. In addition, our compressor/decompressor is simpler in the number of operations needed to execute, which makes our algorithm more amenable for hardware implementation than previous methods.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Depth Buffer Compression using Generalized Plane Encoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000318545100011"}
