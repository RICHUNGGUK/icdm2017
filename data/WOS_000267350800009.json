In some way, the more number of elicitations, the more probable inconsistency is. This is mostly the case within a fuzzy framework, even when the number of alternatives or object to be classified is relatively small. In this paper we propose a fast method to compute a T-indistinguishability from a reflexive and symmetric fuzzy relation, being T any left-continuous t-norm. The computed approximation we propose will take O(n(3)) time complexity, where it is the number of elements under consideration, and is expected to produce a T-transitive opening. To the authors' knowledge, there are no other proposed algorithm that computes T-transitive lower approximations or openings while preserving the reflexivity and symmetry properties.
