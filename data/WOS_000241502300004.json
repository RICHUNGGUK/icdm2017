Math. Anal. Appl. 159, No2, (1991),532-549) and by Denneberg (Fuzzy sets and Systems, 92, (1997),139-156). Using the mediator for representations, it is shown that the theorems are partially equivalent. The difference between them are also stated with some examples.", "paper_title": "Representation of Choquet integral - Interpreter and Mobius transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000241502300004"}
