Subsequently, Abe and Okamoto proposed a provably secure construction for-partially blind signature schemes with a formalized definition in their work. In this paper, based on discrete logarithm problem and the Schnorr's blind signature scheme, we propose a new efficient partially blind signature scheme. Follow the construction proposed by Abe and Okamoto, we prove its security in random oracle model. The computation and communication costs are both reduced in our scheme. It will make privacy-oriented applications which based on partially blind signatures more efficient and suitable for hardware-limited environment, such as smart phones and PDAs.", "paper_title": "Efficient partially blind signature scheme with provable security", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300040"}
