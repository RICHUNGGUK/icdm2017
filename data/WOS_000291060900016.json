The Curriculum Sequencing problem (CS) concerns the dynamic generation of a personal optimal learning path for a learner. This problem has gained an increased research interest in the last decade, as it is not possible to have a single learning path that suits every learner in the widely heterogeneous e-Learning environment. Since this problem is NP-hard, heuristics and meta-heuristics are usually used to approximate its solutions, in particular Evolutionary Computation approaches (EC). In this paper, a review of recent developments in the application of EC approaches to the CS problem is presented. A classification of these approaches is provided with emphasis on the tools necessary for facilitating learning content reusability and automated sequencing.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary computation approaches to the Curriculum Sequencing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000291060900016"}
