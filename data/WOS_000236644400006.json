The first improvement focuses on control of the local operations that modify the mesh to satisfy the given anisotropic mesh metric field. The second is the parallelization of the mesh modification procedures to support effective parallel adaptive analysis. The resulting procedures are demonstrated on general curved 3D domains where the anisotropic mesh size field is defined by either an analytic expression or by an adaptive correction indicator as part of a flow solution process.", "paper_title": "Parallel anisotropic 3D mesh adaptation by mesh modification", "paper_id": "WOS:000236644400006"}
