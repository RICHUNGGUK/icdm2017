The pipelining algorithm uses multiple groups of processors and optimizes the job allocation on the processors in parallel computing. The algorithm is implemented on the quasistatic code QuickPIC and is shown to scale to over 10(3) processors and increased the scale and speed by two orders of magnitude over the non-pipelined model. The new approach opens the door to performing full scale 3D simulations of future plasma wakefield accelerators or full lifetime models of beam interaction with electron clouds in circular accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.
