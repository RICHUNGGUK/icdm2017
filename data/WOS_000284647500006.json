In this paper, combining the forward diffusion with the backward diffusion by different weights, we present an adaptive bidirectional diffusion method for image denoising and deblurring simultaneously. Further, we introduce a gradient factor into the data fidelity term, which forms a spatially varying constraint and allows a better restoration of image edges and fine details. In order to obtain a stable solution, we develop a numerically stable scheme and give its theoretical analysis. Finally, we show advantages of this method in deblurring edges, denoising and restoring fine details of image compared with other related methods in experiments.", "paper_title": "Adaptive bidirectional diffusion for image restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500006"}
