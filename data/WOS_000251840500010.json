The dynamical behavior of the system and causality between events can be explicitly described by temporal formulas. The functional correctness of the modeled system is formally verified by using the inferential rules in temporal logic. Important properties of the system are analyzed based on its TPN model such as liveness, eventuality, and fairness properties. This paper demonstrates that TPNs can provide significant advantages in the design and analysis of business processes.", "paper_title": "A Petri-net-based correctness analysis of Internet stock trading systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251840500010"}
