The method supports change of view, moving objects and reflectors, higher order reflections, view-dependent lighting of reflected objects, and reflector surface properties. In order to render reflections with the feed forward graphics pipeline, one has to project reflected vertices. A sample-based camera is a collection of BSP trees of pinhole cameras that jointly approximate the projection function. It is constructed from the reflected rays defined by the desired view and the scene reflectors. A scene point is projected by invoking only the cameras that contain it in their frustums. Reflections are rendered by projecting the scene geometry and then rasterizing in hardware.", "paper_title": "Sample-based cameras for feed forward reflection rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383900021"}
