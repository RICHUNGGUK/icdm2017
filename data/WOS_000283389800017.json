Pat set (CIParser), which incorporates the cognitive interactionist approach with semantic information and simple recurrent networks to extend and enrich the technologies for sentence parsing Considering the parsing efficiency. CIParser processes the semantic information of nouns and verbs in current stage The performance of the Cognitive Interactionist Parser is evaluated using elaborately designed experiments using the noted SUSANNE Corpus The experimental results demonstrate that the Cognitive Interactionist Parser surpasses two state-of-the-art statistical parsers in two classical measures.
