In this paper, we analyze the data management requirements for supporting this common work practice in typical collaborative activities and applications. We call the applications that support such work practice multi-synchronous applications. This analysis shows that, as users interact in different ways in each setting, some applications have different requirements and need to rely on different data sharing techniques in synchronous and asynchronous settings. We present a data management system that allows to integrate a synchronous session in the context of a long-term asynchronous interaction, using the suitable data sharing techniques in each setting and an automatic mechanism to convert the long sequence of small updates produced in a synchronous session into a large asynchronous contribution. We exemplify the use of our approach with two multi-synchronous applications.", "paper_title": "Supporting multi-synchronous groupware: Data management problems and a solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000237855600005"}
