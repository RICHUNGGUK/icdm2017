Many strategies for ACO have been studied, but little theoretical work has been done on ACO's parameters alpha and beta, which control the relative weight of pheromone trail and heuristic value. This paper describes the importance and functioning of alpha and beta, and draws a conclusion that alpha fixed beta may not enable ACO to use both heuristic and pheromone information for solution when alpha = 1. Later, following the analysis, an adaptive beta strategy is designed for improvement. Finally, a new ACO called adaptive weight ant colony system (AWACS) with the adaptive beta and alpha = 1 is introduced, and proved to be more effective and steady than traditional ACS through the experiment based on TSPLIB test.", "paper_title": "A novel ACO algorithm with adaptive parameter", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400002"}
