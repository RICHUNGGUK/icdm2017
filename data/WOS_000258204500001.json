This has also promoted the development of many new econometrics software packages written in R and made available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This special volume on \"Econometrics in R\" features a selection of these recent activities that includes packages for econometric analysis of cross-section, time series and panel data. This introduction to the special volume highlights the contents of the contributions and embeds them into a brief overview of other past, present, and future projects for econometrics in R.", "paper_title": "Econometrics in R: Past, present and future", "paper_id": "WOS:000258204500001"}
