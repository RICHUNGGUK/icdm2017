In these studies, different ensemble schemes for complex classifiers were applied, and the best results were obtained using the Random Subspace method. The Bagging scheme was one of the ensemble methods used in the comparison. However, it was not correctly used. It is very important to use this ensemble scheme on weak and unstable classifiers for producing diversity in the combination. In order to improve the comparison, Bagging scheme on several decision trees models is applied to bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring. Decision trees encourage diversity for the combination of classifiers. Finally, an experimental study shows that Bagging scheme on decision trees present the best results for bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
