Sleep control is one of the effective ways to save energy, but it may lead to the Spectral Efficiency (SE) loss. In this letter, we study the energy-SE tradeoff in heterogeneous network with sleep control where some PBSs are adaptively switched on or off based on traffic variation. Using tools from stochastic geometry and markov chain theory, we derive the analytical expressions in terms of power consumption, SE and energy efficiency. Numerical results confirm that our theoretical analysis is reasonable. Additional, our results provide new insight into the setting of threshold of the sleep control scheme.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Energy Efficiency in Heterogeneous Network with Sleep Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100010"}
