The drive-in vehicle should merge into the main road while the exit vehicle should diverge from the main road. The influence of those merging and diverging behavior on the dynamics of traffic around the weaving section is studied by analyzing the phase diagram in different spaces and the total flux depending on each parameter. When the number of drive-in vehicle and the number of exit vehicle are close to each other, the total flux is less disturbed. But when they have large difference, the total flux is greatly reduced. We also studied the total flux as a function of the length of the weaving section. It is shown that the weaving section should not be shorter than 150 m.", "paper_title": "TRAFFIC BEHAVIOR AROUND THE WEAVING SECTION IN CELLULAR AUTOMATA MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000278088500007"}
