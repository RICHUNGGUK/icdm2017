The purpose of NDP is to preserve the within-class neighboring geometry of the image space, while keeping away the projected vectors of the samples of different classes. For representing the intrinsic within-class neighboring geometry and the similarity of the samples of different classes, the within-class affinity weight and the between-class affinity weight are used to model the within-class submanifold and the between-class submanifold of the samples, respectively. Comprehensive comparisons and extensive experiments on face recognition are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
