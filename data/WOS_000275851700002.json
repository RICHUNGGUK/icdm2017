In general, the conventional shooting method employs the Newton algorithm to estimate a better approximation of the steady-state working condition. The Newton algorithm requires the computation of the Jacobian matrix and this seriously limits the use of the conventional shooting method to solve medium/large scale circuits. In this paper, an approach to efficiently determine the shooting matrix is presented. It is shown that the approach is also adequate to deal with mixed analog/digital circuits.", "paper_title": "FSSA: Fast Steady-State Algorithm for the Analysis of Mixed Analog/Digital Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000275851700002"}
