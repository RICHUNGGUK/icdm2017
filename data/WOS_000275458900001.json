The specific technology is detailed and an analytical design algorithm is developed. A simplified model is proposed for calculating the machine heating and three dimensions magnetic flux calculation via finite element method (FEM) is carried on in order to check the main generator characteristics.", "paper_title": "Construction and Design of a Modular Permanent Magnet Transverse Flux Generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000275458900001"}
