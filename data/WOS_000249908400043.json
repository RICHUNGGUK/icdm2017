Earlier GAP-RBF was evaluated only for function approximation problems. Improvements to GAP-RBF for enhancing its performance in both accuracy and speed are also described and the resulting algorithm is referred to as Fast GAP-RBF (FGAP-RBF). Performance comparison of FGAP-RBF algorithm with GAP-RBF and the Minimal Resource Allocation Network (MRAN) algorithm based on four benchmark classification problems, viz. Phoneme, Segment, Satimage and DNA are presented. The results indicate that FGAP-RBF produces higher classification accuracy with reduced computational complexity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
