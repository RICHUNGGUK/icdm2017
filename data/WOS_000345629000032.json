A new time-dependent Lyapunov functional is proposed for the synchronization error systems. The advantage of the constructed Lyapunov functional lies in the fact that it is positive definite at sampling times but not necessarily between sampling times, and makes full use of the available information about the actual sampling pattern. A local stability condition of the synchronization error systems is derived, based on which a sampled-data controller with respect to the actuator saturation is designed to ensure that the master neural networks and slave neural networks are locally asymptotically synchronous. Two optimization problems are provided to compute the desired sampled-data controller with the aim of enlarging the set of admissible initial conditions or the admissible sampling upper bound ensuring the local synchronization of the considered chaotic neural networks. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design technique.", "paper_title": "Local Synchronization of Chaotic Neural Networks With Sampled-Data and Saturating Actuators", "paper_id": "WOS:000345629000032"}
