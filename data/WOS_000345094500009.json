Although handwriting synthesis has recently gained increasing interest, the area still lacks a stand-alone review. This paper provides classifications for the different aspects of handwriting synthesis. It presents the applications, techniques, and evaluation methods for handwriting synthesis based on the several aspects that we identify. Then, it discusses various synthesis techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the only stand-alone survey on this topic, and we believe it can serve as a useful reference for the researchers in the field of handwriting synthesis.", "paper_title": "Handwriting synthesis: classifications and techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000345094500009"}
