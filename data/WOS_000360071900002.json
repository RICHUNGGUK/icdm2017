However, it is still an open question as to what the next layer of representational units above the layer of wavelets should be. We address this fundamental question by proposing a sparse FRAME (Filters, Random field, And Maximum Entropy) model for representing natural image patterns. Our sparse FRAME model is an inhomogeneous generalization of the original FRAME model. It is a non-stationary Markov random field model that reproduces the observed statistical properties of filter responses at a subset of selected locations, scales and orientations. Each sparse FRAME model is intended to represent an object pattern and can be considered a deformable template. The sparse FRAME model can be written as a shared sparse coding model, which motivates us to propose a two-stage algorithm for learning the model. The first stage selects the subset of wavelets from the dictionary by a shared matching pursuit algorithm. The second stage then estimates the parameters of the model given the selected wavelets. Our experiments show that the sparse FRAME models are capable of representing a wide variety of object patterns in natural images and that the learned models are useful for object classification.", "paper_title": "Learning Sparse FRAME Models for Natural Image Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000360071900002"}
