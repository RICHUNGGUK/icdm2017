The Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations for incompressible flow are solved in transformed geometry using boundary-fitted coordinate system. The aim of the work is to investigate the influence of three inlet conditions: uniform, parabolic and trapezoidal inlet velocity profiles, on the mean flow and turbulent characteristics of the jet flowing tangentially along a multiple inclined solid wall. The results show that the inlet conditions affect the flow in the vicinity of the nozzle exit area and also the far field region. Mean flow has been presented in terms of evolution of mean velocity profiles, jet spread, decay of streamwise maximum velocity, distribution of wall pressure and skin friction coefficients, and streamwise variations of integrated momentum and energy fluxes. Discontinuities in the boundary slope of the segmented wall produces oscillations in distribution of skin friction and pressure coefficients. Reduced pressure in the region of wall discontinuity appeared to be causing the deflected jet to remain attached to the wall. The growth of the inner layer of the jet is relatively high with uniform inlet velocity profiles in the near-field region, but in the far-field region the inner layer grows with higher rate for the trapezoidal and the parabolic profiles. The rate of decay of maximum streamwise velocity for oblique wall jet on segmented wall is higher than that of plane wall jet. The jet with parabolic and trapezoidal inlet profiles show higher rate of decay than that with a uniform inlet profile. Similarity of streamwise velocity and velocity component parallel to the oblique wall has been observed in the developed region of flow. The volume flow rate of the jet varies linearly along the flow direction due to entrainment of the fluid from the surrounding. Sudden change in slope of the wall causes a sharp rise in entrained volume of fluid. The distribution of near wall velocity in the inner coordinates of the boundary layer is grossly altered and the profiles do not conform to the universal velocity profiles in the form of the law of the wall. Relatively higher position of defect law data signifies comparatively lower turbulence in the outer mixing layer. Cross-stream distribution of Reynolds stresses shows that the effect of inlet velocity profiles is more pronounced in the near field region of flow. Self-similarity is observed in the normalized turbulent shear stress profiles whereas considerable scatter can be noticed in the profiles of turbulent normal stresses for all the inlet velocity conditions. Two distinct peaks in the normalized turbulent kinetic energy profiles characterize the two shear layers of the jet and shifting of the outer peak toward the wall suggests a strong interaction of the outer layer with the inner layer as the jet develops.
