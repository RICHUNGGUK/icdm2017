W. Michor and D. Mumford, Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal., 23 (2007), pp. 74-113] for plane curves to the case of hypersurfaces in R-n. Let M be a compact connected oriented n - 1 dimensional manifold without boundary like the sphere or the torus. Then shape space is either the manifold of submanifolds of R-n of type M or the orbifold of immersions from M to Rn modulo the group of diffeomorphisms of M. We investigate almost local Riemannian metrics on shape space. These are induced by metrics of the following form on the space of immersions: G(f)(h, k) - integral(M) Phi(Vol(f), Tr(L))(g) over bar (h, k) vol(f* (g) over bar), where (g) over bar is the Euclidean metric on R-n, f* (g) over bar is the induced metric on M, h, k. C-infinity(M, R-n) are tangent vectors at f to the space of embeddings or immersions, where F : R-2 -> R->0 is a suitable smooth function, Vol(f) = integral(M) vol(f* (g) over bar) is the total hypersurface volume of f(M), and the trace Tr(L) of the Weingarten mapping is the mean curvature. For these metrics we compute the geodesic equations both on the space of immersions and on shape space, the conserved momenta arising from the obvious symmetries, and the sectional curvature. For special choices of F we give complete formulas for the sectional curvature. Numerical experiments illustrate the behavior of these metrics.", "paper_title": "Almost Local Metrics on Shape Space of Hypersurfaces in n-Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000302220800009"}
