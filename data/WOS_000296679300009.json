We use a two-level multivariate likelihood ratio model for comparison of forensic glass evidence in the form of elemental composition data under three data transformations: the logratio transformation, a complementary log-log type transformation and a hyperspherical transformation. The performances of the three transformations in the evaluation of evidence are assessed in simulation experiments through use of the proportions of false negatives and false positives.
