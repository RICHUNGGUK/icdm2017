To construct a multicast tree is the basis of multicast data transmission. The prime problem concerning the construction of a shared multicast tree is to determine the position of the root of the shared tree. which is a center selection problem. The selection of the center Rendezvous Point (RP) directly affects the structure of the tree, and the performance of multicast accordingly. This paper proposes a multicast RP selection algorithm based on tabu search in PIM-SM multicast routing. This algorithm selects RP by considering both cost and delay. Simulation results show that good performance is achieved in multicast cost, end-to-end delay and register delay. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
