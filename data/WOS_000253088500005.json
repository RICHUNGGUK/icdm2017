While it is possible to deal with continuous variables without discretisation, the simplest approach is to discretise them. A fuzzy partition of continuous domains will be used, which requires an inference procedure able to deal with soft evidence. Soft evidence is a type of uncertain evidence, and it is also a result of the type of discretisation used. An algorithm for inference in multiply connected networks will be proposed and exploited for filtering and abduction in dynamic, time-invariant models, when continuous variables are present.
