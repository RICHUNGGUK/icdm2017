Herein, several convection schemes are assessed in uniform and distorted non-orthogonal grids with emphasis on industrial applications. Linear and nonlinear (TVD) convection schemes are assessed on analytical benchmarks in both uniform and distorted grids. To evaluate the performance of the schemes, four error metrics are used: dissipation, phase and L(1) errors, and the schemes' effective order of accuracy. Qualitative and quantitative deterioration of these error metrics as a function of the grid distortion metrics are investigated, and rigorous verifications are performed. Recommendations for effective use of the convection schemes based on the range of grid aspect ratio (AR), expansion ratio (ER) and skewness (Q) are included. A ship hydrodynamics case is studied, involving a Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulation of a bare-hull KVLCC2 tanker using linear and nonlinear convection schemes coupled with isotropic and anisotropic Reynolds-stress (ARS) turbulence models using CFDShip-Iowa v4. Predictions of local velocities and turbulent quantities from the midships to the nominal wake plane are compared with experimental fluid dynamics (EFD), and rigorous verification and validation analyses for integral forces and moments are performed for 0 degrees and 12 degrees drift angles. Best predictions are observed when coupling a second-order TVD scheme with the anisotropic turbulence model. Further improvements are observed in terms of prediction of the vortical structures for 30 degrees drift when using TVD2S-ARS coupled with DES.
