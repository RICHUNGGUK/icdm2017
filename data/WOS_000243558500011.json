In response to Jha's critique, we now provide an upper bound on the bisection width of a diagonal mesh. The proof is a constructive one and an algorithm is provided to divide the network into two equal halves ( plus/minus one node).", "paper_title": "An upper bound for the bisection width of a diagonal mesh", "paper_id": "WOS:000243558500011"}
