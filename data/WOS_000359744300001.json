When implementing a top-down design process, the required modelling method is engraving with the traits, which are of great consideration through the decomposition of design activities, of hierarchy, coupling and complexity. Explored in this paper is an integrated evaluation approach based on the HDSM with emphasis on its application for supporting the top-down design process of CoPS. After the dependence degree between different levels in the top-down design process is analysed when the HDSM constructed, a concordant method based on triangular fuzzy number converts binary matrix design to the weighted form representing the coupling strength. Purpose served in this approach, including strengthening the internal polymerisation and sorting, can be demonstrated among design activities. The relevant issues having been developed and the coupling analysis implemented, the effectiveness and potential of the proposed approach is highlighted through a real-world case dealing with the development of a large tonnage crawler crane.", "paper_title": "An integrated top-down design process evaluation approach of complex products and systems based on hierarchical design structure matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000359744300001"}
