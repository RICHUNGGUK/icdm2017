However, almost all cloud-computing architectures including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are vulnerable to serious security issues. Similarly, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is vital to overcoming mobile limited storage and computing capabilities. MCC authentication and authorization issues must be provided on two levels: login password control and the environment from where the cloud is accessed. MCC has overcome the barrier of limited storage by providing remote storage but requires a strict security system that is responsible for retrievability, integrity, and seamless storage access. Elasticity and connectivity are also of major concern in MCC because delays and jitters cause degradation in the user experience. Cloud-computing architecture creates more challenges in maintaining security because of the liberty of users to choose any MCC architecture. Thus in this paper we discuss current cloud computing issues and future directions.", "paper_title": "Toward Advanced Mobile Cloud Computing for the Internet of Things: Current Issues and Future Direction", "paper_id": "WOS:000338530300012"}
