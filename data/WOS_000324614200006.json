In tradition, the computation of affine parameters and the transformation of non-common points are individually implemented, in which the coordinate errors only of the target system are taken into account although the coordinates in both target and source systems are inevitably contaminated by random errors. In this article, we propose the seamless affine error-in-variables (EIV) transformation model that computes the affine parameters and transforms the non-common points simultaneously, importantly taking into account the errors of all coordinates in both datum systems. Since the errors in coefficient matrix are involved, the seamless affine EIV model is nonlinear. We then derive its least squares iterative solution based on the Euler-Lagrange minimization method. As a case study, we apply the proposed seamless affine EIV model to the map rectification. The transformation accuracy is improved by up to 40%, compared with the traditional affine method. Naturally, the presented seamless affine EIV model can be applied to any application where the transformation estimation of points fields in the different systems is involved, for instance, the geodetic datum transformation, the remote sensing image matching, and the LiDAR point registration.", "paper_title": "Seamless multivariate affine error-in-variables transformation and its application to map rectification", "paper_id": "WOS:000324614200006"}
