In this paper, we study dynamics of traffic flow with real-time information. The influence of a feedback strategy named vehicle number feedback strategy (VNFS) is introduced, in which we only calculate the vehicle number of first 500 route sites from the entrance. Moreover, the two-route traffic system has only one entrance and one exit, which is different from those in the previous work. Our model incorporates the effects of adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow, and simulation results by adopting this optimal information feedback strategy have demonstrated higher efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns than the other three information feedback strategies, i.e., TTFS, MVFS and CCFS.", "paper_title": "Advanced information feedback strategy in intelligent two-route traffic flow systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362900010"}
