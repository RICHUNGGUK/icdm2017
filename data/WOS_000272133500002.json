Validation of these homology models by procheck, verify-3D and ERRAT programs revealed that these models are highly reliable. Docking studies of 4-(2-phenyltetrahydrofuran-3-yl) benzene sulfonamide analogs designed by substituting different chemical groups on benzene rings replacing 1H pyrazole in celecoxib with five membered thiophene, furan, 1H pyrrole, 1H imidazole, thiazole and 1,3-oxazole showed that diaryl furan molecules showed good binding affinity towards mouse COX-2. Further, docking studies of diaryl furan derivatives are likely to have superior thromboxane synthase and COX-2 selectivity. Docking studies against site directed mutagenesis of Arg120Ala, Ser530Ala, Ser530Met and Tyr355Phe enzymes displayed the effect of inhibition of COX-2. Drug likeliness and activity decay for these inhibitors showed that these molecules act as best drugs at very low concentrations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
