The classical Preisach model (CPM) is the most popular model to demonstrate hysteresis which can be represented by infinite but countable first-order reversal curves (FORCs). The usage of look-up tables is one way to approach the CPM in actual practice. The data in those tables correspond with the samples of a finite number of FORCs. This approach, however, faces two major problems: firstly, it requires a large amount of memory space to obtain an accurate prediction of hysteresis; secondly, it is difficult to derive efficient ways to modify the data table to reflect the timing effect of elements with hysteresis. To overcome, this article proposes the idea of using a set of polynomials to emulate the CPM instead of table look-up. The polynomial approximation requires less memory space for data storage. Furthermore, the polynomial coefficients can be obtained accurately by using the least-square approximation or adaptive identification algorithm, such as the possibility of accurate tracking of hysteresis model parameters.", "paper_title": "New realisation of Preisach model using adaptive polynomial approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306409300005"}
