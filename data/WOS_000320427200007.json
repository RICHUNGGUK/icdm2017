We consider two different versions, including and not including reactive effects. We describe the overall organization of the algorithm and give details on its implementations. Efficiency ranges from 25% to 31% of the double precision peak performance of the GP-GPU. We compare our results with a different implementation of the same algorithm, developed and optimized for many-core Intel Westmere CPUs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
