The proposed algorithm is able to find the natural number of category in SAR image based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), The learning process starts from a single SAR image at proper scale randomly initialized in the feature space, and grows adaptively during the learning process until most appropriate number of category are found. Experimental results of the proposed algorithm are proposed and compared with that of previous algorithms.", "paper_title": "A multiscale self-growing probabilistic decision-based neural network for segmentation of SAR imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500154"}
