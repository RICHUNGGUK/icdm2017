In the classical axiomatic design (AD) approach, the relationships between functional requirements (FRs) and design parameters (DPs) are defined in crisp numbers notably \"0\" or \"1\". This definition restricts relevant designers due to the incomplete information or uncertainty in various circumstances. This study debates the adaptation of the current AD principles into fuzzy sets theory. Those transformations are expressed by the developed formulas to prove the independence degree of the design in quantitative manner. A numerical study illustrates the logic of the proposed ideas clearly. Consequently, the proposed methodology provides a genuine link to explain the correspondences among FRs and DPs in linguistic form. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
