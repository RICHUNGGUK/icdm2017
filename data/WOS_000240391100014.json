An important component of these mechanisms is the traffic scheduler, an entity that decides on the channel allocation among different stations. This paper proposes a scheduling algorithm for IEEE 802.11e, referred to as P-ARROW (Prioritized and Adaptive Resource Reservation over Wireless), that effectively handles multimedia traffic by utilizing the formal specification of each traffic stream. Using a single \"priority factor\" parameter, the scheduling can vary between strict prioritization and purely deadline-driven allocation. Performance evaluation results extracted from an advanced simulation model, show that P-ARROW is very efficient in supporting the desired level of service differentiation and prioritization among different traffic classes.
