On the other hand, the traffic requested by an individual connection is still in the Mbps range. Therefore, to utilize the network resources (such as bandwidth and transceivers) effectively, several low-speed traffic streams have to be efficiently groomed or multiplexed into one or more high-speed lightpaths. The grooming problem of a static demand is considered as an optimization problem. In this work, we have investigated the traffic grooming problem with the objective of maximizing the network throughput for wavelength-routed mesh networks and map this problem to the clique partitioning problem. We have proposed an algorithm to handle general multi-hop static traffic grooming based on the clique partitioning concept. The efficiency of our approach has been established through extensive simulation on different sets of traffic demands with different bandwidth granularities for different network topologies and compared the approach with existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Traffic grooming, routing, and wavelength assignment in an optical WDM mesh networks based on clique partitioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000281986700001"}
