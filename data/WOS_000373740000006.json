The downlink coverage probability and the mean achievable rate are derived using the proposed two-tier networks model. Finally, performance is evaluated numerically and is validated against simulation results and compared with the performance of other models.", "paper_title": "Downlink Coverage and Rate Analysis of Two-Tier Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000373740000006"}
