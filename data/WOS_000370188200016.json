It exploits the psychological interpretation of color to assign a basic color to each emotion subspace such that the BSES can be visualized, and by using quantum gates, changes in emotions can be tracked and recovered. In an experimental validation, two typical human emotions, happiness and sadness, are analyzed and visualized using the BSES according to a preset emotional transmission model. A transition matrix that tracks emotional change can be used to control robots allowing them to adapt and respond to human emotions.", "paper_title": "Bloch Sphere-Based Representation for Quantum Emotion Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000370188200016"}
