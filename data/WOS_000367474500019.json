This paper studies the key technologies of a mobile mapping system in emergency management. It considers the design of a total factor and full-texture real map, which is measurable and can be marked through the mobile mapping technology. It also proposes the application of a real map in emergency cases, which has large practical significance.", "paper_title": "Visualization Emergency Research Based on Mobile Mapping Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000367474500019"}
