Steriadis, P. Constantinou, Designing human-computer interfaces for quadriplegic people, ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum.-Interact. (TOCHI) 10 (2) (2003) 87-118.]. People with severe motor-impairments due to spinal cord injury (SCI) or spinal cord dysfunction (SCD), however, often have difficulty with accurate and efficient control of pointing devices, limiting their integration to society and unassisted control over their environment through the use of such operating systems [S. Keates, F. Hwang, P. Langdon, P.J. Clarkson, P. Robinson, Cursor measures for motion-impaired computer users, in: Proceedings of ACM SIGCAPH Conference of Assistive Technologies - ASSETS 2002, pp. 135-142.]. The questions \"How can someone with severe motor-impairments perform 'point and click' interactions as accurately and efficiently as an able-bodied person?\" and \"How can these interactions be advanced through use of Computational Intelligence (CI)?\" are the driving forces behind the research described in this paper. Through this research, a novel fuzzy mouse cursor control system (FMCCS) is described. The FMCCS core consists of several fuzzy control functions, which define different user interactions with the system. Design and descriptions of these functions, as well first prototype implementation and testing with real users sustaining severe disabilities are presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
