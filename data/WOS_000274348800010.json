In the second method (selection of existing color constancy algorithms). the proper algorithm for a given image is selected by ridge regression based on natural image statistics Then it is used to estimate the color of the light source The proposed two algorithms are verified on a large data set with more than 11,000 images The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with the state-of-the-art methods", "paper_title": "Color Constancy Using Ridge Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000274348800010"}
