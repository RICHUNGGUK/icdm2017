The tasks are managed by an Operating System whose main role consists in defining the resource allocation and the temporal scheduling. One of the main characteristics of these architectures is the heterogeneity of their execution resources which makes this scheduling complex. In this paper, we propose a neural network based model for the design of heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures scheduler. Previous works have shown that neural networks using the Hopfield model can be defined to schedule tasks on an homogeneous architecture. This approach was extended to take platform heterogeneity into account. The work presented in this paper is based on a new neural network structure using inhibitor neurons. These neurons allow to limit the number of additional neurons and the number of network re-initialisations to reach convergence. We compare our network to the classic solutions based on the Hopfield neural network. These comparisons show that the number of neurons is reduced by a factor of more than two, which reduces the time convergence. We also compare our approach in terms of number of migrations with the PFair algorithm which is known as an optimal solution in the context of homogeneous architecture. The results show that our solution significantly limit the number of task migrations. Finally, we present results in the context of heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures, which is representative of complex system-on-chip. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
