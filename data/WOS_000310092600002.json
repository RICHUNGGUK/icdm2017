In this work, we present a method for photo-realistic DOF and motion blur generation based on the characteristics of a real camera system. Both the depth-blur relation for different camera focus settings and the nonlinear intensity response of image sensors are modeled. The camera parameters are calibrated and used for defocus and motion blur synthesis. For a well-focused real scene image. DOF and motion blur effects are generated by post-processing techniques. Experiments have shown that the proposed method generates more photo-consistent results than the commonly used graphical models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
