Here, we generalize these ideas to a class of nondeterministic semiautomata. A semiautomaton is settable if, for every state q, there exists a word w(q) such that q, and no other state, can be reached from some initial state by a path spelling w(q). We extend many results from the deterministic case to settable nondeterministic semiautomata. Now each word has a number of canonical representatives. We show that a prefix-rewriting system exists for transforming any word to any of its representatives. If the set of canonical words is prefix-continuous (meaning that, if w and a prefix u of w are in the set, then all prefixes of w longer than u are also in the set), the rewriting system has no infinite derivations. Examples of specifications of nondeterministic modules are given. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
