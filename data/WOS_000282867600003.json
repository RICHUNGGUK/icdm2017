We present an aggregation strategy that combines predicted disease states from multiple classifiers using several fuzzy integration variants. Rather than using all input features for each classifier, these multiple classifiers are presented with different, randomly selected, subsets of the spectral features. Results from a set of detailed experiments using this strategy are carefully compared against classification performance benchmarks. We empirically demonstrate that the aggregated predictions are consistently superior to the corresponding prediction from the best individual classifier.
