TMIS and its nodal architecture, nicknamed Intelligent Junction (IJ), are summarized from our recent work. System design sets an example to a software architecture implementing autonomous semantic agents through semantic web services, junction-based sensor networks, local- and wide-area networking through wire/wireless integrated communication infrastructure. It is so construed as to provide (near-) real-time services throughout the network. This introduction is with reference to the SOA of Cooperative Labyrinth Discovery Robotics and Traffic Management and Information System Projects. This also takes up several issues including real-time goal-oriented coordination of semantic web services. Especially described are its essential functions crucial to aid security applications. A security scenario concerning tracking and routing reported, say missing, vehicles is considered and shown how to graft it onto TMIS network. Simulation results show promising outcomes. Performance of the system in terms of mean response time is analytically derived. Simulation and analytical results agree. Research involving similar development base is suggested.", "paper_title": "Tracking Reported Vehicles in Traffic Management and Information System using Intelligent Junctions", "paper_id": "WOS:000278399600011"}
