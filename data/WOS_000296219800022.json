However, the flowshop setting is relatively unexplored. On the other hand, the actual processing time of a job under an uncontrolled learning effect will drop to zero precipitously as the number of jobs increases. This is rather absurd in reality. Motivated by these observations, we consider a two-machine flowshop scheduling problem in which the actual processing time of a job in a schedule is a function of the job's position in the schedule and a control parameter of the learning function. The objective is to minimize the total completion time. We develop a branch-and-bound and three simulated annealing algorithms to solve the problem. Computational results show that the proposed algorithms are efficient in producing near-optimal solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
