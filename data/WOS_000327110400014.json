Creep is an essential phenomenon when a PEA operates over long periods of time. A fractional-order model is proposed by representing the PEA as resistocaptance, which is a novel approach. The simplified fractional-order PEA model results in a double-logarithmic creep. Identification methods for PEA parameters are presented. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed fractional-order creep model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
