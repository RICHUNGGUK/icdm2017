The relaxation time Monte Carlo (RTMC) method was modified by using an ellipsoid statistical model and a multiple translational temperature model in the BGK model equation to simulate continuum-transition gas flows. The modified RTMC method uses a simplified form of the generalized relaxation time, which is related to the macro velocity and the local Knudsen number. The results for Couette flow and Poiseuille flow in microchannels predicted using the modified RTMC and the DSMC are in good agreement with the modified RTMC being much faster than the DSMC for continuum-transition gas flow simulations.
