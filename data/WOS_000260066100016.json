When a sequence is retrieved from the linked sequences, ambiguity of sequences becomes a serious problem because the shared events have some possible ways to retrieve other events. We have focused on location dependency elucidated from the hippocampus and suggested that CA3 is functionally divided into autoassociative and heteroassociative memories. Computer simulation results show that the functionally divided CA3 concurrently enables both sequence disambiguation and pattern completion. Consequently, it demonstrates that cooperation between both memories of CA3 brings out the abilities of sequence disambiguation and pattern completion in the hippocampus. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
