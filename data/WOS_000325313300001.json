In this fuzzy distance we use the left and right point. Its calculations are easier compared to the previous presented distances and its result is always a non negative fuzzy number. This distance can be widely used in Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) techniques and data mining. Finally, some examples are presented to illustrate the benefits of this method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy distance of triangular fuzzy numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000325313300001"}
