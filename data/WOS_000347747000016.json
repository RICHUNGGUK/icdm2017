In phase 1, VI-MGR uses the entropy of the limb region of a gait energy image (GEI) to determine the matching gallery view of the probe using 2-dimensional principal component analysis and Euclidean distance classifier. In phase 2, the probe subject is compared with the matching view of the gallery subjects using multiscale shape analysis. In this phase, VI-MGR applies Gaussian filter to a GEL to generate a multiscale gait image for gradually highlighting the subject's inner shape characteristics to achieve insensitiveness to boundary shape alterations due to carrying conditions and clothing variation. A weighted random subspace learning based classification is used to exploit the high dimensionality of the feature space for improved identification by avoiding overlearning. Experimental analyses on public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VI-MGR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
