The FLPRFNS has a functional link-based orthogonal basis function fuzzy consequent and a Petri layer to eliminate the redundant fuzzy rule for each input calculation. In addition, the FLPRFNS is trained by the proposed hybrid algorithm. The main innovation is that the random-neighbourhood local search is replaced by a PSO algorithm with an instant-update strategy for particle information. Each particle updates its information instantaneously and in this way receives the best current information. Thus. HEMPSO combines the advantages of multiple-agent-based searching, global optimisation, and rapid convergence. Simulation results confirm that HEMPSO can be used to perform global optimisation and offers the advantage of rapid convergence; they also indicate that the FLPRFNS exhibits high accuracy.
