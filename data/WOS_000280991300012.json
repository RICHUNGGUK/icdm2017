Our method extends the recent directional occlusion shading model by enabling light source positioning with practically no performance penalty. Light transport is approximated using a tilted cone-shaped function which leaves elliptic footprints in the opacity buffer during slice-based volume rendering. We perform an incremental blurring operation on the opacity buffer for each slice in front-to-back order. This buffer is then used to define the degree of occlusion for the subsequent slice. Our method is capable of generating high-quality soft shadowing effects, allows interactive modification of all illumination and rendering parameters, and requires no pre-computation.", "paper_title": "A Multidirectional Occlusion Shading Model for Direct Volume Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000280991300012"}
