By using the (pure) KKT conditions, the true optimum can be found in the sense of minimizing the fuel consumption. This is the most economic way of dispatching the load to generators, but it may not be directly applicable in the real world. In practice extra constraints, in the form of swing generator(s), base load generator upper and lower operating limits, and spinning reserve are also required. These lead to a set of constrained KKT conditions, which are utilized to solve the problem. Note that although this solution obtained from constrained KKT conditions is not the true optimum, the extra constraints are there to enhance the system stability and reliability. This new approach is tested extensively in simulation against standard dispatch approaches, and its performance is seen to be superior in all cases.", "paper_title": "Microgrid generation units optimum dispatch for fuel consumption minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000209332400009"}
