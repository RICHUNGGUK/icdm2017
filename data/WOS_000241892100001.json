As multiple-quantum operator algebra theory mentioned, any unitary transformation can be decomposed into a sequence of a limited number of one-qubit quantum gates and two-qubit diagonal gates. Based on these backgrounds, we proposed the method to design NMR pulse sequences to implement Generalized Quantum Search Algorithm with arbitrary phase rotation, and, experimental finished the algorithm with different phase rotations respectively in a two-qubit system, on a Quantum Computer Emulator.", "paper_title": "Simulation and investigation of Quantum Search Algorithm system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100001"}
