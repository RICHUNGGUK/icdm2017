To support the design of more selective inhibitors with fewer side effects or with altered target profiles for improved efficacy, we developed a method combining ligand- and receptor-based information. Conventional QSAR models enable one to study the interactions of multiple ligands toward a single protein target, but in order to understand the interactions between multiple ligands and multiple proteins, we have used proteochemometrics, a multivariate statistics method that aims to combine and correlate both ligand and protein descriptions with affinity to receptors. The superimposed binding sites of 50 unique kinases were described by molecular interaction fields derived from knowledge-based potentials and Schrodinger's WaterMap software. Eighty ligands were described by Mold(2), Open Babel, and Volsurf descriptors. Partial least-squares regression including cross-terms, which describe the selectivity, was used for model building. This combination of methods allows interpretation and easy visualization of the models within the context of ligand binding pockets, which can be translated readily into the design of novel inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Visually Interpretable Models of Kinase Selectivity Related Features Derived from Field-Based Proteochemometrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000327747200022"}
