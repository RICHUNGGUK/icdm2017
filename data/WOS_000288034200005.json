The flow simulation is carried out by solving the 3D Reynolds-averaged continuity and Navier-Stokes equations with Reynolds stress equation model (RSM) for steady-state flow. Finite volume method (FVM) is applied to numerically solve the governing equations of fluid flow. The velocity magnitude, tangential velocity, transverse velocity and Reynolds stresses are calculated for various flow conditions. Good agreement between the simulated and available laboratory measurements was obtained, indicating that the RSM can accurately predict the complicated flow phenomenon. Comparison of the calculated secondary currents of four cases (one being inbank flow and other three being overbank flow) with different water depths reveals that (i) the inbank flow exhibits different flow behaviors from that of the overbank flow does and (ii) the water depth has significant effects on the magnitude and direction of secondary currents.
