With the aid of a repetition index, the conventional algorithm is a special case of our algorithm. Compared with related studies, the proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the SVD operation and is suitable for cyclic-prefix-free systems. In particular, the necessary condition of the proposed signal matrix to be full rank can be satisfied with fewer OFDM blocks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional methods in normalized mean-square error.", "paper_title": "Blind Channel Estimation for SIMO-OFDM Systems without Cyclic Prefix", "paper_id": "WOS:000274505900042"}
