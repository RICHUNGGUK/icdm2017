These data are free to the scientific community, industry, and the public. The rNOMADS package provides an interface between NOMADS and the R programming language. Like R itself, rNOMADS is open source and cross platform. It utilizes server-side functionality on the NOMADS system to subset model outputs for delivery to client R users. We discuss rNOMADS implementation and usage as well as provide two case studies. Users can download rNOMADS from within the R interpreter or from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
