In this paper, we study the task of tensor network non-zero testing (TNZ): Given a tensor network T, does T represent a non-zero vector? We show that TNZ is not in the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy unless the hierarchy collapses. We next show (among other results) that the special cases of TNZ on non-negative and injective tensor networks are in NP. Using this, we make a simple observation: The commuting variant of the MA-complete stoquastic k-SAT problem on D-dimensional qudits is in NP for k is an element of O(logn) and D is an element of O(1). This reveals the first class of quantum Hamiltonians whose commuting variant is known to be in NP for all (1) logarithmic k, (2) constant D, and (3) for arbitrary interaction graphs.", "paper_title": "TENSOR NETWORK NON-ZERO TESTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000359505800007"}
