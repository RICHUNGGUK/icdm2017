It is shown that communication networks with coding are closely related to queueing networks with positive and negative customers. The tradeoff between minimizing energy consumption and minimizing delay for a two-way relay is investigated. Analytical upper and lower bounds on the energy consumption and the delay are obtained using a Markov reward approach. Exact expressions are given for the minimum energy consumption and the minimum delay that are attainable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
