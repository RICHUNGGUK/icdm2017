For this problem, in which the objective is to minimize the length of the longest tour in order to find a set of balanced tours for the vehicles, we present here an ILP formulation and study its associated polyhedron. Based on its partial description, a branch-and-cut algorithm has been implemented and computational results on a large set of instances are finally presented. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
