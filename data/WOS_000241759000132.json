The circuit, which can be fabricated in a standard CMOS process, performs the four-quadrant weighting of interconnect signals. Using this multiplier a programmable CNN neuron can be implemented with little expense. Both simulation and test results are given for the circuit fabricated in a standard, mixed signal, 0.18 mu m, CMOS process. According to this design, one input is analog voltage and the other input is digital signal. The linearity deviation is less than 1% in the dynamic range (1.0V,2.2V) centered on V-ref=1.6V. The power supply voltage is 3.3V.", "paper_title": "A novel multiplier for achieving the programmability of cellular neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000132"}
