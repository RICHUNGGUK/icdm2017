There are two tiers in this framework including national central centre and local centre. In each node, the services for querying and accessing datasets based on agent environment are designed, which includes data resource agent, local management system, and metadata system. Information retrieval can be conduced either locally or distributed, by querying local weather data or exploiting global metadata respectively. With a variety of advantages, this proposed platform is designed to provide a useful platform for research on weather data sharing system in a national area.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Distributed Weather Data Sharing System Based on Agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000302396500009"}
