This algorithm adopted multi-population parallel searching mode, close chain-like agent structure, cycle chain-like agent structure, dynamic neighborhood competition and orthogonal crossover strategy to realize parallel optimization, and has the characteristics of high optimization precision and short optimization time. In order to verify the optimization precision of this algorithm, some popular benchmark test functions were used for comparing this algorithm and a popular agent genetic algorithm (MAGA). The experimental results show that MPAGA has higher optimization precision and shorter optimization time than MAGA.", "paper_title": "Multi-population co-genetic algorithm with double chain-like agents structure for parallel global numerical optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000277282600005"}
