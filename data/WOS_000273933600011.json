To deal with such complex problems using just one feature descriptor is a difficult task and feature fusion may become mandatory. Although normal feature fusion is quite effective for some problems. it can yield unexpected classification results when the different features are not properly normalized and preprocessed. Besides it has the drawback of increasing the dimensionality which might require more training data. To cope with these problems, this paper introduces a unified approach that can combine many features and classifiers that requires less training and is more adequate to some problems than a naive method, where all features are simply concatenated and fed independently to each classification algorithm. Besides that, the presented technique is amenable to continuous learning, both when refining a learned model and also when adding new classes to be discriminated. The introduced fusion approach is validated using a multi-class fruit-and-vegetable categorization task in a semi-controlled environment, such as a distribution center or the supermarket cashier. The results show that the solution is able to reduce the classification error in up to 15 percentage points with respect to the baseline. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
