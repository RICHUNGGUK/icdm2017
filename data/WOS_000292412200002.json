By calculating global sums with enhanced precision techniques based on Kahan or Knuth summations, the consistency of the numerical results can be greatly improved with minimal memory and computational cost. This study assesses the value of the enhanced numerical consistency in the context of general finite difference or finite volume calculations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
