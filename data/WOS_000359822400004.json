This paper concerns with the automatic generation of Farsi/Arabic handwritten fonts. To reach this target, we need to extract the properties of the writer's script style. The \"glyphs\" (simple characters or ligatures) of the writer's script are extracted from the basic subwords. The basic subwords are acquired from a writer using tabular sheets. A learning method is used in extraction phase. After glyph extraction, four important steps are performed automatically: (a) adjusting glyphs joints and baselines (b) computing metric data, (c) locating dots, and (d) computing kerning pairs. Finally, the gathered information is compiled in an OpenType font file structure to generate a computer font, which can be used in any computer application. The results seem visually acceptable.", "paper_title": "Toward automatic development of handwritten personal Farsi/Arabic OpenType fonts", "paper_id": "WOS:000359822400004"}
