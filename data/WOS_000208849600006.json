The bounds derived are similar to those previously established for either k substitutions, k insertions or k deletions within a single period. The bounds are useful when T/2k < lambda < T/k, where lambda is the linear complexity of the original sequence and T is its period. It is shown that similar bounds hold for the joint linear complexity of periodic multisequences. Similar results are obtained for the N-adic complexity of periodic sequences over {0, ... , N - 1}. New non-trivial lower bounds on the minimum number of operations needed to decrease the complexity are also given. The derivations are simpler compared to those in previous work on these problems.", "paper_title": "Lower bounds on error complexity measures for periodic LFSR and FCSR sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000208849600006"}
