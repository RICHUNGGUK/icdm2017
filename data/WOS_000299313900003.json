They present high computational efficiency. If a set of probability intervals is used to represent the available information, the concept of dominance can play an important role in the decision-taking process. In this paper, we present the equivalence relations among three dominance concepts when the set of probability intervals used is obtained from a general credal set or from a reachable set of probability intervals; these are the two models of imprecise probabilities, the first being more general than the second. These three concepts of dominance present the common characteristic of having been used in the final process of a classifier.", "paper_title": "Equivalence relations among dominance concepts on probability intervals and general credal sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000299313900003"}
