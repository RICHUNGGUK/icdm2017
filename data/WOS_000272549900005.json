Bilingual dictionaries are usually constructed from parallel corpora, but since these corpora are available only for selected text domains and language pairs, the potential of other resources is being explored as well. In this article, we want to further pursue the idea of using Wikipedia as a corpus for bilingual terminology extraction. We propose a method that extracts term-translation pairs from different types of Wikipedia link information. After that, an SVM classifier trained on the features of manually labeled training data determines the correctness of unseen term-translation pairs.", "paper_title": "Improving the Extraction of Bilingual Terminology from Wikipedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000272549900005"}
