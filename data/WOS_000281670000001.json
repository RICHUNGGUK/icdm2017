To give in-depth insights into them, detailed analyses and comparisons are provided. Finally, some future potential work in terms of light field capture and its application are discussed at length.", "paper_title": "Key technologies of light field capture for 3D reconstruction in microscopic scene", "paper_id": "WOS:000281670000001"}
