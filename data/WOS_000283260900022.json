The proposed algorithm is based on a robust implementation of a beta-encoder with beta = phi = (1 + root 5)/2, the golden ratio. It was previously shown that beta-encoders can be implemented in such a way that their exponential accuracy is robust against threshold offsets in the quantizer element. This paper extends this result by allowing for imperfect analog multipliers with imprecise gain values as well. Furthermore, a formal computational model for algorithmic encoders and a general test bed for evaluating their robustness is proposed.", "paper_title": "The Golden Ratio Encoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000283260900022"}
