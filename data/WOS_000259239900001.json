The goal of Builder is to force Painter to create a monochromatic copy of a fixed graph H in as few rounds as possible. The minimum number of rounds (assuming both players play perfectly) is the on-line Ramsey number (r) over tilde( H) of the graph H. We determine exact values of (r) over tilde (H) for a few short paths and obtain a general upper bound (r) over tilde (P-n) <= 4n - 7. We also study asymmetric version of this parameter when one of the target graphs is a star S-n with n edges. We prove that (r) over tilde (S-n, H) <= n.e (H) when H is any tree, cycle or clique.", "paper_title": "On-line Ramsey numbers for paths and stars", "paper_id": "WOS:000259239900001"}
