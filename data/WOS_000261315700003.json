Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a new grey decision dynamic model was set up; it integrates with modified GM model, the transfer function and response characteristic of cybernetics, and other knowledge. The building steps of this integrated model and its application method in a certain enterprise were presented. Findings - Until recently, there have been many references studying grey decision or grey relational analysis of factors, but it was found that dynamic affecting of multi-factors for enterprise production and their affecting levels were not studied synthetically in these references, and by this new dynamic model, these useful conclusions can be gotten. Research limitations/implications - The built time response equation and dynamic model in this paper can be only used for whole regularity analysis and not suited to daily one-to-one analyzing; otherwise the error of the reductive values must be tested. Practical implications - This new grey decision dynamic model can be used widely in decision making and optimization analyzing of enterprises with multi-factors. Practical applying results show that the proposed method can instruct effectively actual production. Originality/value - This paper offers a new grey decision dynamic model that can be used in decision making and optimization analyzing of enterprises with multi-factors. By applying this new dynamic model in practice, some useful conclusions are drawn; some dynamic factors affecting production capacity of enterprises and their affecting levels can be found.", "paper_title": "A new grey decision dynamic model-based on cybernetics knowledge for complex system optimization analyzing and its practical application", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700003"}
