Nevertheless, there are few studies that explore the knowledge-sharing (KS) mechanisms used and the contingency factors affecting their application in the context of managing new product development projects that encounter changes in project scope. Therefore, in this research the principles of the contingency approach were adopted in order to examine the KS mechanisms used and the contingency factors affecting their use in this context via an in-depth case study. Three key KS mechanisms and three contingency factors affecting their application were identified based on the research results. The relationship between the KS mechanisms and the contingency factors is formalized in five propositions. Future research that examines the interrelationships among these contingency factors and how they collectively influence KS practices in similar contexts is encouraged.", "paper_title": "Knowledge sharing practices of project teams when encountering changes in project scope: A contingency approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000309578400002"}
