In this demo, we design and implement a multi-screen technology to provide multi-screen interactions over wide area network (WAN). Furthermore, we incorporate face-detection technology into our system to identify users' bio-features and employ a machine learning base traffic scheduling mechanism to improve the system performance.", "paper_title": "Toward a Biometric-Aware Cloud Service Engine for Multi-Screen Video Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000350564600091"}
