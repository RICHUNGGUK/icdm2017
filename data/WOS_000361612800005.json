The problem of estimation of mu with respect to a quadratic loss function is considered. Sufficient conditions for inadmissibility of estimators in certain classes of affine and location have been derived. Consequently, some complete class results are obtained. A detailed simulation study has been carried out in order to numerically compare the risk functions of some well-known estimators of common mean for the case k = 3 and k = 4. Finally, certain decisions have been taken regarding the use of these estimators.", "paper_title": "Equivariant estimation of common mean of several normal populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000361612800005"}
