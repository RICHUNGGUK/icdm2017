In particular, we are interested in identifying disjoint, contiguous regions that are unusual with respect to the distribution of a given class; i.e. a region that contains an unusually low or high number of instances of a particular class. This paper centers on the discussion of techniques, methodologies, and algorithms to discover such regions. A measure of interestingness and a supervised clustering framework are introduced for this purpose. Moreover, three supervised clustering algorithms are proposed in the paper: an agglomerative hierarchical supervised clustering named SCAH, an agglomerative, grid-based clustering method named SCHG, and lastly an algorithm named SCMRG which searches a multi-resolution grid structure top down for interesting regions. Finally, experimental results of applying the proposed framework and algorithms to the problem of identifying hotspots in spatial datasets are discussed.", "paper_title": "Discovery of interesting regions in spatial data sets using supervised clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000241104900011"}
