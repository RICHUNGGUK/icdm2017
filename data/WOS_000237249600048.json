Group pattern is a type of mobile user data mining method. In group pattern mining, group patterns from a given user movement database is found based on spatio-temporal distances. In this paper, we propose an improvement of efficiency using area method for locating mobile users and using sliding window for static group pattern mining. This reduces the complexity of valid group pattern mining problem. We support the use of static method, which uses areas and sliding windows instead to find group patterns thus reducing the complexity of the mining problem.", "paper_title": "SGPM: Static group pattern mining using apriori-like sliding window", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600048"}
