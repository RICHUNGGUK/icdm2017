Simple electrical capacitive throughput sensors, but also very complex electrical capacitance tomograph sensors were tested. An interesting compromise may be segmented capacitance sensor (SCS). In this paper, a mathematical model of SCS is verified. Two mathematical models are compared. The first model simplifies the problem by the use of the electrostatic field. Using the second model a variable electric field at low frequencies is described. It was found that, for an easier description of the SCS electric field, this field can be considered as the electrostatic field. Measurements carried out, for the most part supported the correctness of the mathematical model. Some deviations were probably caused by transferring the problem to 2D.", "paper_title": "The mathematical model of experimental sensor for material distribution detecting on the conveyor", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100030"}
