A similar construction is used to give graph sequences that converge to the same limit, and such that a Hamiltonian cycle in one of them has a limit that is not approximable by any subgraph of the other. We give an example where this holds, but convergence is meant in a stronger sense. This is related to whether having a Hamiltonian cycle is a testable graph property.", "paper_title": "Approximating Cayley Diagrams Versus Cayley Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000304915900011"}
