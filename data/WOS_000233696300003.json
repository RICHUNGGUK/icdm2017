A system of functional equations turns up if some functional independence of the difference between both generalizations is demanded. In this paper, we explore which De Morgan triplets, based on a left-continuous t-norm T, solve this system. Imposing some extra continuity conditions on T, these t-norm solutions can be obtained by the rotation construction of Jenei. The Cauchy equation plays a key role in the reasoning process.
