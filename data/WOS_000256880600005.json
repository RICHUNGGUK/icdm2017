Current approaches use simplified assumptions or propose complex analysis algorithms to bound the cache-related preemption delay. In this paper, a scalable preemption delay analysis for associative instruction caches to control the analysis precision and the time-complexity is proposed. An accurate preemption delay calculation is integrated into a cache-aware schedulability analysis. The framework is evaluated in several experiments.", "paper_title": "Scalable precision cache analysis for real-time software", "paper_id": "WOS:000256880600005"}
