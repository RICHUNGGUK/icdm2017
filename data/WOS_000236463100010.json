The CANDELA project, which is part of the European ITEA program, focuses on the integration of video content analysis in combination with networked delivery and storage technologies. To unleash the full potential of such integration, adaptive video-content analysis and retrieval techniques are being explored by developing several pilot applications.", "paper_title": "CANDELA - Storage, analysis and retrieval of video content in distributed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236463100010"}
