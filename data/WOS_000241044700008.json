Activity patterns in cultured networks of cortical neurons from rat embryos were investigated at different days in vitro (DIV), by a multi-site recording technique based on planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Transitions in neuronal dynamics of the networks were induced by administering antagonists of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. Neurochernical effects on synaptic transmission were evaluated analyzing the network activity by using ad hoc developed algorithms. A decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission corresponded to a decrease in spiking and bursting activity with a loss of synchronization. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
