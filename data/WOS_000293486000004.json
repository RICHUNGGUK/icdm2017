Simulating the CP(N-1) model, we find a small improvement with the leading order transformation, which is however compensated by the additional computational overhead. The scaling of the algorithm towards the continuum is not changed. In particular, the effect of the topological modes on the autocorrelation times is studied. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
