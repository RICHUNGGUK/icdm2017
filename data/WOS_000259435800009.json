The oriented chromatic number of G is the minimum order of an oriented graph H such that G has a homomorphism to H. In this paper, we determine the oriented chromatic number of the class of partial 2-trees for every girth g >= 3. We also give an upper bound for the oriented chromatic number of planar graphs with girth at least 11. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
