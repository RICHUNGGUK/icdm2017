We consider the scenario that the scheduler does not have full knowledge of the channel state information, but instead estimates the channel state by exploiting the memory inherent in the Markov channels along with Automatic-Repeat-reQues-styled-styled feedback from the scheduled users. Opportunistic scheduling is optimized in two stages: 1) channel estimation and rate adaptation are performed to maximize the short-term throughput, i.e., the successful transmission rate of the scheduled user in the current slot and 2) user scheduling is performed, based on the short-term throughput, to maximize the overall long-term sum-throughput of the downlink. The scheduling problem is a partially observable Markov decision process with the classic exploitation versus exploration tradeoff that is difficult to quantify. We, therefore, study the problem in the framework of restless multiarmed bandit processes, and perform a Whittle's indexability analysis. Whittle's indexability is traditionally known to be hard to establish and the index policy derived based on Whittle's indexability is known to have optimality properties in various settings. We show that the problem of downlink scheduling under imperfect channel state information is Whittle indexable and derive the Whittle's index policy in closed form. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that the Whittle's index policy has near-optimal performance and is robust against various imperfections in channel state feedback. Our work reveals that, under incomplete channel state information, exploiting channel memory for opportunistic scheduling can result in significant system-level performance gains and that almost all of these gains can be realized using the polynomial-complexity Whittle's index policy.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Channel Memory for Joint Estimation and Scheduling in Downlink Networks-a Whittle's Indexability Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800013"}
