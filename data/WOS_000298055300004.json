Competitors participated by submitting level generators-software that generates new levels for a version of Super Mario Bros tailored to individual players' playing style. This paper presents the rules of the competition, the software used, the scoring procedure, the submitted level generators, and the results of the competition. We also discuss what can be learned from this competition, both about organizing procedural content generation competitions and about automatically generating levels for platform games. The paper is coauthored by the organizers of the competition (the first three authors) and the competitors.", "paper_title": "The 2010 Mario AI Championship: Level Generation Track", "paper_id": "WOS:000298055300004"}
