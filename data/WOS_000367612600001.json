Research-based private companies could also use such mapping for efficient selection in localizing R&D activities and university research collaborations. In this work we apply a bibliometric methodology for ranking by research productivity: (i) the fields of research for each territory (region and province); and (ii) the territories for each scientific field. The analysis is based on the 2008-2012 scientific output indexed in the Web of Science, by all professors on staff at Italian universities. The population is over 36,000 professors, active in 192 fields and 9 disciplines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
