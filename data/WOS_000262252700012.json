In this paper, we propose a distributed group-based intrusion detection scheme that meets all the above requirements by partitioning the sensor networks into many groups in which the sensors in each group are physically close to each other and are equipped with the same sensing capability. Our intrusion detection algorithm takes simultaneously into consideration of multiple attributes of the sensor nodes to detect malicious attackers precisely. We show through experiments with real data that our algorithm can decrease the false alarm rate and increase the detection accuracy compared with existing intrusion detection schemes while lowering the computation and transmission power consumption.
