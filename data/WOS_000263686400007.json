Optimization is implemented with the goal to improve the dynamic accuracy of the end-effector at high speed. The governing equations of flexible links within the robot are formulated in the floating reference frame using Euler-Lagrange method, leading to a global FEM model being generated using the KED (Kineto-Elasto-Dynamics) technique. The dynamic characteristics of the robot are then investigated by model analysis. A numerical dynamic index is proposed to identity the range of natural frequency when the robot reaches different configurations. The comparisons are made between the optimized and original designs in terms of dynamic stress and response.", "paper_title": "Dynamics and elasto-dynamics optimization of a 2-DOF planar parallel pick-and-place robot with flexible links", "paper_id": "WOS:000263686400007"}
