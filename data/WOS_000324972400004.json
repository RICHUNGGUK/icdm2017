By using a flattening technique, we first show that any EN P system working in one of these modes can be simulated by an equivalent one-membrane EN P system working in the same mode. Then we show that linear production functions, each depending upon at most one variable, suffice to reach universality for both computing modes. As a byproduct, we propose some small deterministic universal enzymatic numerical P systems.", "paper_title": "Improved Universality Results for Parallel Enzymatic Numerical P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324972400004"}
