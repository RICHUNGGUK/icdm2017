Our extension attaches an additional encryption function to the original XEX*, which has some limitation but is slightly faster than the encryption implemented by XEX*. We prove our scheme's security in a general form, where the offset function, a key component of our construction, is not restricted to the one used by XEX*. We also provide some applications of our result, in particular to OCB 2.0, an authenticated encryption based on XEX*.", "paper_title": "Generalization and Extension of XEX* Mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701000023"}
