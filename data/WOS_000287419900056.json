In this paper, we eliminate the assumption of average and utilize the Shannon entropy to determine the weights for ultimate cross efficiency scores, and the procedures are introduced in detail. In the end, an empirical example is illustrated to examine the validity of the proposed method. Some future research directions are also pointed out.
