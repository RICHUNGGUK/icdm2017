Radiofrequency identification microchips working at low or ultra high frequency were associated to different items such as organism, matrix or container commonly involved in a plant pathology test. Moreover, the microchips were subjected to various environmental conditions, such as thermal and chemical stress. A collaborative Web 2.0-based workspace was used to support research data management and interaction between users. Our findings demonstrate that the microchips maintained their reliability following environmental treatments, while the selected Web 2.0 collaborative workspace allowed useful data interchange and communications between labs during long-term trials as sanitary selection of grapevine.
