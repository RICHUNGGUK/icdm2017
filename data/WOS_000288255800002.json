Objects in membranes are associated with positions. Rules specify, in the usual way, the objects which are consumed and the ones which are produced; in addition, they can specify the positions of the produced objects. Objects belong to two different sets: the set of ordinary objects and the set of mutually exclusive objects. Every position inside a membrane can accommodate an arbitrary number of ordinary objects, but at most one mutually exclusive object. We prove that Spatial P systems are universal even if only non-cooperating rules are allowed. We also show how Spatial P systems can be used to model the evolution of populations in presence of geographical separations.", "paper_title": "Spatial P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800002"}
