The proposed addressing scheme considers the continuous-flow operation with minimum shared memory requirements. To improve throughput, parallel high-radix processing units are employed. We prove that the solution to non-conflict memory access satisfying the constraints of the continuous-flow, variable-size, higher-radix, and parallel-processing operations indeed exists. In addition, a rescheduling technique for twiddle-factor multiplication is developed to reduce hardware complexity and to enhance hardware efficiency. From the results, we can see that the proposed processor has high utilization and efficiency to support flexible configurability for various FFT sizes with fewer computation cycles than the conventional radix-2/radix-4 memory-based FFT processors.", "paper_title": "A Generalized Conflict-Free Memory Addressing Scheme for Continuous-Flow Parallel-Processing FFT Processors With Rescheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000296459300014"}
