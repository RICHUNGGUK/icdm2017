In this paper, we focus on how to improve the sampling efficiency for CS-based image compression by using our proposed adaptive sampling mechanism on the block-based CS (BCS), especially the reweighted one. To achieve this goal, two solutions are developed at the sampling side and reconstruction side, respectively. The proposed sampling mechanism allocates the CS-measurements to image blocks according to the statistical information of each block so as to sample the image more efficiently. A generic allocation algorithm is developed to help assign CS-measurements and several allocation factors derived in the transform domain are used to control the overall allocation in both solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our adaptive sampling scheme offers a very significant quality improvement as compared with traditional non-adaptive ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
