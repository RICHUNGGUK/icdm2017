The main contribution of this work is as follows: First, we introduce a new formulation for the Stokes/Darcy coupled equations, subject respectively to the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman interface condition and an alternative matching interface condition. Secondly, we prove the well-posedness of these weak problems by using the classical saddle point theory. Thirdly, some spectral approximations to the weak problems are proposed and analyzed, and some error estimates are provided. It is found that the new formulations significantly simplify the error analysis and numerical implementation. Finally, some two-dimensional spectral and spectral element numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of our methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
