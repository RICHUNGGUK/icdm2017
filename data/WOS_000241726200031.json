We present our approach to integrate such data for two large collaborative cancer research studies in Germany. Our platform interconnects a commercial study management system (eRN) with a data warehouse-based gene expression analysis system (GeWare). We utilize a generic approach to import different anonymized pathological and patient-related annotations into the warehouse. The platform also integrates different forms of experimental data and public molecular-biological annotation data and thus supports a wide range of genetic analyses for both clinical and non-clinical parameters.", "paper_title": "An integrated platform for analyzing molecular-biological data within clinical studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200031"}
