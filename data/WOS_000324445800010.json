Design/methodology/approach - The simulation method is based on decomposition: a 2D axisymmetric RF FE model is used for describing the whole measurement set-up, while a 3D quasi-static FE model is used for the symmetry cell of the shielding layer in order to capture the effect of its fine geometric details. Findings - Comparison with real measurements shows that the shielding characteristics can be reliably predicted this way, with some deviation in the low end of the frequency range though. Practical implications This simulation tool can be applied in the design and optimization of braided cable shields to be used in the automotive industry. Originality/value - Two numerical models are coupled by the novel concept of \"equivalent shielding layer\", which is obtained by homogenization.", "paper_title": "Simulation of the absorbing clamp method for optimizing the shielding of power cables", "paper_id": "WOS:000324445800010"}
