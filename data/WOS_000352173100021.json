Neural networks are utilized to approximate unknown nonlinear functions, and an adaptive decentralized controller is constructed by incorporating the minimal learning parameters algorithm into backstepping design procedure. It is proved that the proposed control scheme guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
