Design/methodology/approach - The mass transfer relations are derived based on the mechanics of evaporation and condensation, in which the mass and momentum transfer count for factors such as non-dissolved gas, turbulence, surface tension, phase-change rate, etc. Findings - As shown by two calculation examples, the modified model can predict the cavitating flow with high accuracy, agreeing well with experimental results. Originality/value - The methods described are of value in improving stability in numerical calculations.", "paper_title": "A mixture model with modified mass transfer expression for cavitating turbulent flow simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000256902400006"}
