Covering-based rough sets are one of the important generalizations of classical rough sets. Naturally, covering-based fuzzy rough sets can be studied as a combination of covering-based rough set theory and fuzzy set theory. It is clear that Pawlak's rough set model and fuzzy rough set model are special cases of the covering-based fuzzy rough set model. This paper investigates the properties of covering-based fuzzy rough sets. In addition, operations of intersection, union and complement on covering-based fuzzy rough sets are investigated. Finally, the corresponding algebraic properties are discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Covering-based fuzzy rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200012"}
