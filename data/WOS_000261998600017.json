Autonomy software allows such vehicles to make decisions and command actuators based on their observations of the environment or sensor feedback. Increased autonomy will be critical to the success of future missions, in which rovers will be expected to travel over long distances in a short time and handle dynamic processes such as taking a core sample from a rock while slipping on a slope.", "paper_title": "Autonomy for Mars Rovers: Past, Present, and Future", "paper_id": "WOS:000261998600017"}
