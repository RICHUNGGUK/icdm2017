Approaches based on multiporting and virtually pipelined architectures, which have been studied in static random access memory (SRAM)/dynamic random access memory (DRAM)/hybrid-SRAM/DRAM memory systems for high throughput performance, provide an attractive means to overcome these challenges through innovations spanning the memory cell to architecture levels. This paper describes a virtually pipelined memory architecture built on a two-port phase change memory (PCM) substrate for high-performance networking applications. The proposed two-port PCM cell significantly reduces the probability of bank conflicts due to blocking writes. We comprehensively evaluate the two-port cell design in terms of programming current, voltage pumping for access transistors, and area overhead. We also propose a two-port PCM bank design to provide the large bandwidth and bank parallelism critical for high-performance networking applications. Furthermore, the virtually pipelined architecture is implemented at the memory controller level, eliminating the extra delay of read requests due to the asymmetrical access latency through separate reservation tables for read and write requests. We analyze the performance of this architecture using queuing theory and statistical information obtained by processing packet traces using PacketBench, and show that the proposed innovations can reduce the expected read (write) delay by 12-40x (up to 14%) over conventional single-port PCM for 110%-170% additional area.", "paper_title": "Two-Port PCM Architecture for Network Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208500015"}
