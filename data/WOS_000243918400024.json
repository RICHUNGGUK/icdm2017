Then, within different normed spaces, several sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of an APS are proposed using two fixed-point theorems. Based on the continuity property and some inequality techniques, two theorems insuring the global stability of the unique APS are given. Comparing with known literatures, all conclusions are drawn with slacker restrictions, e.g., do not require the integral of the kernel function determining the distributed delays from zero to positive infinity to be one, and the activation functions to be bounded, etc.; besides, all criteria are obtained by different ways. Finally, two illustrative examples show the validity and that all criteria are easy to check and apply.", "paper_title": "On the almost periodic solution of cellular neural networks with distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000243918400024"}
