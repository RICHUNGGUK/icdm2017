However, they also raise several new challenges such as deployment flexibility, inter-group connectivity, and security resilience. Aiming at these challenges, we propose three flexible deployment models and the corresponding key management scheme in this paper. We provide analytical evaluations of the proposed models and key management scheme. The results indicate that our approaches achieve a wonderful performance in inter-group connectivity, deployment flexibility, as well as resilience in security.", "paper_title": "Flexible deployment models for location-aware key management in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000031"}
