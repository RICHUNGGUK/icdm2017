Design/methodology/approach - The paper gives a necessary entropy condition, valid for all sequences on the alphabet {0, 1} read by lumping and generated by a Cantorian stochastic automaton. Findings - The paper finds that, on this basis, once can determine that a given sequence is not generated by Cantorian stochastic automata and reconstruct the automaton when the sequence is generated by a Cantorian stochastic automaton. Originality/value - This paper derives a new diagnostic for Cantorian stochastic automata, which could find a direct application to biology, where there is a recent claim that the coding regions of chromosomes form Cantor sets.", "paper_title": "Characterizing Cantorian sets by entropy-like quantities", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835500013"}
