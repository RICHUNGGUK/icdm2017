Improving the front electrode design is one of the approaches to improve the performance of the solar cells. It serves to produce the voltage distribution for the front surface such that the current flow through the solar cell is maximized. In this paper, we use TO to design the front electrode pattern for side-contact and pin-up modules. Specific challenges include the nonlinearity of the physical problem and the design-dependent photocurrent loading. The greater design freedom of TO versus traditional shape optimization generates novel, efficient electrode patterns. In addition, we study the effect of mesh resolution and solar cell size on the final design. The results suggest that TO can probably be an effective method to generate designs which could lead to improved performance of the solar cells.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of front metallization patterns for solar cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000355759200009"}
