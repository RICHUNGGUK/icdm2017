Although studies on online games have received more attention in the literature, MMORPGs have seldom been addressed. This study applies the theory of reasoned action and modifies the technology acceptance model to propose a research model. An empirical study was conducted to test this model. The goal of this study is to examine what perceived factors contribute to an online game user's behaviors. The results of this study indicate that users' attitudes and intentions are influenced by perceived security and perceived enjoyment. Subjective norm and flow are key behavioral antecedents to users' loyalty.", "paper_title": "The Dynamic User Activities in Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (Retracted article.
