In particular, we exactly compute the 1-error linear complexity of ternary Sidel'nikov sequences when p equivalent to -1 mod 3 and m >= 4. Furthermore, we give a tighter lower bound on the linear complexity of ternary and quaternary Sidel'nikov sequences for p equivalent to -1 mod M by a more detailed analysis. Based on these results, we present the ratios of the linear complexity and the 1-error linear complexity to the period asymptotically.", "paper_title": "Bounds on the linear complexity and the 1-error linear complexity over F-p of M-ary Sidel'nikov sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000007"}
