In the paper, to obtain a forging preform shape with reduced material consumption but enhanced uniform material deformation, a new element removal and addition criterion has been established with consideration of hydrostatic stress and strain components. In order to overcome the problem that the size of FE mesh for forging simulation cannot be directly used for topology optimization, background mesh was employed for optimization evolution while coarser but smoother FE mesh was employed for FE simulation. The other key techniques developed include an interpolation method and surface smoothing treatment for jagged surface after element addition and elimination. A C# program for optimization system integrated with DEFORM-3D finite element (FE) software package is developed and an industrial case problem: forging of a 3D aeroengine blade is investigated. Considering the feasibility of producing a preform, different constraints are applied in the optimization process to affect the preform shape. The optimization results are presented and discussed, which suggest that the developed topology optimization method is an efficient approach for 3D preform design and optimization.", "paper_title": "A new approach of preform design for forging of 3D blade based on evolutionary structural optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000350896500014"}
