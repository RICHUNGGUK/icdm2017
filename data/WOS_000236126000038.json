Algebraic constructions are of particular interest because they admit analytical designs and simple, practical hardware implementation. Contention-free interleavers have been recently shown to be suitable for parallel decoding of turbo codes. In this correspondence, it is shown that permutation polynomials generate maximum contention-free interleavers, i.e., every factor of the interleaver length becomes a possible degree of parallel processing of the decoder. Further, it is shown by computer simulations that turbo codes using these interleavers perform very well for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard.", "paper_title": "On maximum contention-free interleavers and permutation polynomials over integer rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000236126000038"}
