The proposed estimation fusion is called as the Chebyshev fusion estimation (CFE) because its geometrical interpretation is in coincidence with the Chebyshev center, which is a nonlinear combination of local estimates. Theoretically, the CFE is better than any local estimator in the sense of the worst-case squared estimation error and is robust to the choice of the supporting bound. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed CFE is a robust fusion in localization and tracking and more accurate than the previous covariance intersection (CI) method.", "paper_title": "A Minimax Unbiased Estimation Fusion in Distributed Multisensor Localization and Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000312810400001"}
