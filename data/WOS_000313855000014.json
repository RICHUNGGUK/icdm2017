This paper presents a solution to support collision avoidance based on the timely detection of the vehicle maneuvers. Since the longitudinal interaction among vehicles, with the commonly known car-following behavior, is one of the most important causes of crashes, it was decided to focus on longitudinal maneuvers, identifying the maneuvering states of cruise, accelerating or decelerating and stop. The classification is carried out by means of fuzzy rules extracted from navigational data. Therefore, in our proposal no extra sensors are needed apart from two commonly installed for navigation purposes: the odometry of the vehicle and an accelerometer. The system was tested with low-cost sensors showing good results when compared to the literature of the field. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
