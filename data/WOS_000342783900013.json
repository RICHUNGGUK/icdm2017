The problem at hand is converted into an unconstrained optimization problem by using linear-algebraic techniques. The unconstrained optimization problem is then solved iteratively by applying an efficient quasi-Newton algorithm with closed-form formulas for key gradient evaluation. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Roundoff Noise Minimization for a Class of 2-D State-Space Digital Filters Using Joint Optimization of High-Order Error Feedback and Realization", "paper_id": "WOS:000342783900013"}
