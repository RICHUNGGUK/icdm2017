We hybridize this technique by incorporating path relinking (PR) in four different ways. Several test instances are used to test the effectiveness of the different approaches. Computational results show that hybridizing PACO with PR improves the performance of PACO. The hybrid algorithms also show competitive results compared to other state of the art metaheuristics.", "paper_title": "Solving a bi-objective flowshop scheduling problem by pareto-ant colony optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100026"}
