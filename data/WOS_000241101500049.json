Its major purpose is to manage and preserve digital images of cultural artifacts and provide the images to external DIAS uses the DjVu image technique to solve the speed and distortion problems that arise when browsing very large images on the Internet. It also provides an online, real-time visible watermark appending function for digital image copyright protection, and uses image copy detection techniques to track illegal duplication. Currently, DIAS manages a vast number of digital images and can be integrated with metadata archiving systems to manage digital images and metadata as a complete digital archiving system. We are developing digital image data exchange, heterogeneous system integration, automatic image classification, and multimedia processing technologies to improve DIAS.", "paper_title": "DIAS: The Digital Image Archiving System of NDAP Taiwan", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500049"}
