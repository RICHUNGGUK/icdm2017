The input is a number and a directed graph with a specified \"start\" vertex, each of whose vertices may have one \"memory bank requirement\", an integer. There are \"registers\", labeled . A valid solution associates to the vertices with no bank requirement one or more \"load instructions\" , for bank and register , such that every directed trail from the start vertex to some vertex with bank requirement contains a vertex that has been associated (for some register ) and no vertex following in the trail has been associated an , for any other bank . The objective is to minimize the total number of associated load instructions. We give a -approximation algorithm based on linear programming rounding, with being the best possible unless Vertex Cover has approximation for . We also present a approximation, with being the number of vertices in the input directed graph. Based on the same linear program, another rounding method outputs a valid solution with objective at most times the optimum for registers, using registers.", "paper_title": "Register Loading via Linear Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000356461400006"}
