Identification of antigenic regions on pathogen proteins will play a pivotal role in designer vaccine immunotherapy. We have developed a novel method that identifies MHC class I binding peptides from peptides sequences. For the first time we present a method for MHC class I binding peptides prediction using Fourier analysis and support vector machines (SVM). Using cross-validation, we demonstrate that this novel prediction technique has a reasonable performance.", "paper_title": "Prediction of MHC class I binding peptides using Fourier analysis and support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000133"}
