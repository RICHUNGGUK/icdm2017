Based on the asymptotic analysis of the solution, we derive corresponding convergence rates in terms of the frequency for the Filon method, and for piecewise constant and linear collocation methods. We also present asymptotic schemes for large values of the frequency. These schemes possess the property that the numerical solutions become more accurate as the frequency increases.", "paper_title": "Efficient methods for Volterra integral equations with highly oscillatory Bessel kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000316076800011"}
