This algorithm makes use of coarse and fine time estimation; the fine time estimation is performed using a cross-correlation similar to previous proposals in the literature, whereas the coarse time estimation is made using a new metric and an iterative search of the last sample of the repetitive preamble. A complete analysis of the new metric is included, as well as a wide performance comparison, for multipath channel and carrier frequency offset, with the main time synchronization algorithms found in the literature. Finally, the complexity of the VLSI implementation of this proposal is discussed.", "paper_title": "Low Complexity Time Synchronization Algorithm for OFDM Systems with Repetitive Preambles", "paper_id": "WOS:000304210700001"}
