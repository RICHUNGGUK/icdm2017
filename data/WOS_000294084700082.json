The proposed algorithm takes PSO as the main evolution method. The velocity, a sensitive parameter of PSO, is adjusted dynamically to increase the precision of PSO. To overcome the drawback of premature in PSO, chaotic local search is imported into proposed algorithm. Moreover, a new strategy is proposed to handle the various constraints of DED problem in this paper, the results solved by proposed strategy can satisfy the constraints of DED problem well. Finally, the high feasibility and effectiveness of proposed CSAPSO algorithm is validated by three test systems consisting of 10 and extended 30 generators while compared with the experimental results calculated by the other methods reported in this literature.
