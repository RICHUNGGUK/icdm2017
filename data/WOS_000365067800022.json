Three mathematical models with various objective functions are developed. The objective functions are to minimize: (a) total transportation and installation costs, (b) weighted sum of service times in the hubs to produce and transfer commodities and the tardiness and earliness times of the flows including raw materials and finished goods, and (c) total greenhouse gas emitted by transportation modes and plants located in the hubs. To come closer to reality, some of the parameters of the proposed mathematical model are regarded as uncertain parameters, and a robust approach is used to solve the given problem. Furthermore, two methods, namely fuzzy multi-objective goal programming (FMOGP) and the Torabi and Hassini's (TH) method are used to solve the multi-objective mathematical model. Finally, the concluding part presents the comparison of the obtained results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
