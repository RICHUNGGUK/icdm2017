The MIH standard is suitable for not only heterogeneous networks but also homogeneous networks. According to the Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6), during handover initiation, for MNs to get new Access Router (nAR's) prefixes, using Router Solicitation for Proxy Advertisement (RtSolPr)/Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv) may be time consuming. If there are additional quality of service requirements, the FMIPv6 would require much more time. Based on FMIPv6, this paper proposes a new IS-FMIPv6, which combines MIH services. We also propose a new mechanism for discovering the access route. This scheme reduces the time spent for finding the route to the nAR and increases the probability that FMIPv6 operates in the predictive mode by reducing initiation handoff delay.
