The proposed scheme improves bit error rate (BER) performance and throughput on the edge of a cellular base station (CBS) cooperating with another CBS in the same broadcasting coverage. The proposed scheme for the enhancement of BER performance employs two schemes by a channel quality information (CQI) between a broadcasting base station (BBS) and users. In a physical area, the edge of a CBS is concatenated with the edge of another CBS. When users are on the edge of a CBS. they transmit simultaneously the CQI to CBSs, and then a BBS and CBSs transmit signals by the proposed algorithm. The two schemes apply space-time cyclic delay diversity (COD) and a combination of space-time block code (STBC) with vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) to a signal from a BBS and CBSs. The resulting performance indicates that the proposed scheme is effective for users on the edges of CBSs.", "paper_title": "An Advanced Cooperative Scheme in the Broadcasting and Cellular System", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784300026"}
