Also a wireless network consisting of biomedical sensors can be implanted into the patient's body and can monitor the patients' conditions. These sensor devices apart from having an enormous capability of collecting data from their physical surroundings are also resource constraint in nature with a limited processing and communication ability and hence we have to integrate the Grid technology to do the processing and storage of the data collected by the sensor nodes. In this paper, we proposed the sensor grid enhancement data management system, called SEGEDMA ensuring the integration of different network technologies and the continuous data access to system users. The main contribution of this work is to achieve the interoperability of both technologies through a novel network architecture and according to the results SEGEDMA can be applied successfully.
