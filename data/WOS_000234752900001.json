We assume that the servers are cross-trained (so that they can work at several different stations) and that two or more servers can cooperate on the same job. For such a system, we provide sufficient conditions on the service times and sizes of the input and output buffers at the pooled station under which pooling will decrease the departure time of each job from the system (and hence increase the system throughput). We also show that pooling decreases the total number of jobs in the system at any given time and the sojourn time of each job in the system if the departure time of each job from the system is decreased by pooling and there is an arrival stream at the first station. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions under which pooling will improve the holding cost of each job in the system incurred before any given time, and extend our results to closed tandem lines and to queueing networks with either a more general blocking mechanism or probabilistic routing. Finally, we present a numerical study aimed at quantifying the improvements in system performance obtained through pooling and at understanding which stations should be pooled to achieve the maximum benefit. Our results suggest that the improvements gained by pooling may be substantial and that the bottleneck station should be among the pooled stations in order to obtain the greatest benefit.", "paper_title": "Partial pooling in tandem lines with cooperation and blocking", "paper_id": "WOS:000234752900001"}
