Based on coarse edge-location by SOBEL operator, the geometric information of the target is used to reduce the number of moment-template to only one, which can largely save the time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective with more robustness, higher precision and speed. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
