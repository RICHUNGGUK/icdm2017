An integral sliding mode control approach is proposed to address it. As a first step, a proper sliding surface is constructed. Based on the drive-response concept and Lyapunov stability theory, both delay-independent and delay-dependent conditions are derived under which the resulting error system is globally asymptotically stable in the specified switching surface. The gain matrix of the sliding mode is achieved by means of a linear matrix inequality, which can be solved by resorting to standard numerical algorithm. Then, a sliding mode controller is synthesized to guarantee the reachability of the specified sliding surface. A simulation example is finally exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
