It is emergent to develop computational methods to efficiently and objectively analyze these images, with the aim of providing potentially better diagnostic and prognostic information for BC. This work focuses on analyzing our in-house HE stained histopathological images of breast cancer tissues. Since tumor nests (TNs) and stroma morphological characteristics can reflect the biological behaviors of breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), accurate segmentation of TNs and the stroma is the first step towards the subsequent quantitative analysis. We first propose a method based on the pixel-wise support vector machine (SVM) classifier for segmenting TNs and the stroma, then extract four morphological characters related to the TNs from the images and investigate their relationships with the patients' 8-year disease free survival (8-DFS). The evaluation result shows that the classification based segmentation method is able to distinguish between TNs and stroma with 87.1% accuracy and 80.2% precision, suggesting that the proposed method is promising in segmenting HE stained IDC histopathological images. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves show that three morphological characters (number of TNs, total perimeter, and average area of TNs) in the images have statistical correlations with 8-DFS of the patients, illustrating that the segmented images can help to identify new morphological factors in IDC TNs for the prediction of BC prognosis.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of Hematoxylin-Eosin stained breast cancer histopathological images based on pixel-wise SVM classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000359801900009"}
