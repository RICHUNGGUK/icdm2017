Disregarding the low-duty-cycle nature of media access often leads to overestimation of link quality. Neglecting the bursty loss characteristic of wireless links inevitably consumes much more energy than necessary and underutilizes wireless channels. The routing strategy, if not well tailored to the above two factors, results in poor packet delivery performance. In this paper, we propose L-2, a practical design of data forwarding in low-duty-cycle wireless sensor networks. L-2 addresses link burstiness by employing multivariate Bernoulli link model. Further incorporated with synchronized rendezvous, L-2 enables sensor nodes to work in a lazy mode, keep their radios off most of the time, and realize highly reliable forwarding by scheduling very limited packet transmissions. We implement L-2 on a real sensor network testbed. The results demonstrate that L-2 outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of energy efficiency and network yield.", "paper_title": "L-2: Lazy Forwarding in Low-Duty-Cycle Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000356298800018"}
