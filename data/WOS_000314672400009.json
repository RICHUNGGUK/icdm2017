For the first time, time-sequence-based triangular and Gaussian fuzzy membership functions have been proposed for the single support phase (SSP) and the double support phase (DSP), respectively, according to time properties of different biped phases, which provides an effective way to formulate time properties of biped walking samples in the context of time-varying external disturbances. In addition, a time-sequence-based moving learning window (TS-MLW) is proposed for online training of the proposed TSF-SVM. The performance of the proposed TSF-SVM is compared with other typical intelligent methods; simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is more sensitive to occasional external disturbances, which increases the stability margin and prevents the robot from falling down.
