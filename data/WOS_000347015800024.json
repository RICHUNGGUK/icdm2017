Whereas human-centric contexts (e.g., indoor/outdoor, at home/in office, driving/walking) have been extensively researched, few attempts have studied from phones' perspective (e.g., on table/sofa, in pocket/bag/hand). We refer to such immediate surroundings as micro-environment, usually several to a dozen of centimeters, around a phone. In this study, we design and implement Sherlock, a micro-environment sensing platform that automatically records sensor hints and characterizes the micro-environment of smartphones. The platform runs as a daemon process on a smartphone and provides finer-grained environment information to upper layer applications via programming interfaces. Sherlock is a unified framework covering the major cases of phone usage, placement, attitude, and interaction in practical uses with complicated user habits. As a long-term running middleware, Sherlock considers both energy consumption and user friendship. We prototype Sherlock on Android OS and systematically evaluate its performance with data collected on fifteen scenarios during three weeks. The preliminary results show that Sherlock achieves low energy cost, rapid system deployment, and competitive sensing accuracy.", "paper_title": "Sherlock: Micro-Environment Sensing for Smartphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000347015800024"}
