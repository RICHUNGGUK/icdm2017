The AgCl-H2Ti2O5 nanowires composite is prepared by combining hydrothermal and photoreduction chlorination route. The H2Ti2O5 nanowires exhibit a nest meso-architecture network with AgCl nanoparticles attached on the nanowires. The element Hg sensing performance of ATO composite sensor was investigated. The sensor shows good sensitivity, selectivity, fast response and recovery sensing features to large concentrations range of element Hg vapour.", "paper_title": "The development of AgCl-H2Ti2O5 nanowires composite as a room temperature sensor for the detection of element mercury", "paper_id": "WOS:000358693100005"}
