In this study, we outline a multifactor approach to evaluating models that we developed in order to select an appropriate student model for our medical ITS. The combination of areas under the receiver-operator and precision-recall curves, with residual analysis, proved to be a useful and valid method for model selection. We improved on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with models that treat help differently from mistakes, model all attempts, differentiate skill classes, and model forgetting. We discuss both the methodology we used and the insights we derived regarding student modeling in this novel domain.", "paper_title": "A multifactor approach to student model evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000257961000002"}
