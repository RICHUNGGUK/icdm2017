We give conditions under which Sigma is attractive through sliding which are sharper than those given in a previous paper of ours. Under these sharper conditions, we show that the sliding vector field considered in the same paper is still uniquely defined and varies smoothly in x is an element of Sigma. A numerical example illustrates our results. (C) 2014 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
