The application of variants of LDA technique for solving small sample size (SSS) problem can be found in many research areas e.g. face recognition, bioinformatics, text recognition, etc. The improvement of the performance of variants of LDA technique has great potential in various fields of research. In this paper, we present an overview of these methods. We covered the type, characteristics and taxonomy of these methods which can overcome SSS problem. We have also highlighted some important datasets and software/packages.", "paper_title": "Linear discriminant analysis for the small sample size problem: an overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000354391500009"}
