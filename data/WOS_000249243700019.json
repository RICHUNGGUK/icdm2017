After constructing parametric models of bioprosthetic heart valves via computer aided design, a series of accurate dimension parameters are obtained. The experimental result via the finite element analysis is consistent with the theoretical result for the loaded leaflets with different shapes. It is showed that the stress distribution of the spherical valve leaflets is comparatively reasonable. Spherical valve leaflets have some advantages over cylindrical valves leaflets: the position of the peak stress of spherical valve leaflets is comparatively far from seam position, and the maximal primary stress of spherical valve leaflets is less than that of the cylindrical valve leaflets. While the cylindrical valve leaflets have the following disadvantages: there exists obvious stress concentration and the stress distribution within the whole component is not uniform. Therefore, mechanical properties of spherical valve leaflets are superior to those of cylindrical valve leaflets. The present result provides a theoretical guide and useful information for the bioprosthetic-heart-valve designer.", "paper_title": "Geometrical design and finite element analysis on the bioprosthetic heart valve", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700019"}
