It simultaneously achieves two main functions: a high-quality multimedia service in cloud computing, and a power saving control mechanism for extending the lifetime of hand-held devices used on multimedia streaming server applications. This paper enables dynamic voltage and frequency scaling power control mechanisms to enable frequency and voltage adjustment according to the system state of a device. The proposed mechanism increases the frame rate of multimedia services to 16.66%/s and mitigates power consumption by 1.5%.", "paper_title": "A Power Saving Mechanism for Multimedia Streaming Services in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000331983100026"}
