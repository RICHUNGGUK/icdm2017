The framework is based on the Active Appearance Model (AAM) and permits to combine shape deformations with appearance variability. We have used two modifications of the Blurred Shape Model (BSM) descriptor as basic shape and appearance features to learn the model. These modifications permit to overcome the rigidity of the original BSM, adapting it to the deformations of the shape to be represented. We have applied this framework to representation and classification of handwritten digits and symbols. We show that results of the proposed methodology outperform the original BSM approach.
