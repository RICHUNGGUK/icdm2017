To achieve alignment leveraging, enterprise architecture (EA) is considered fundamental as a comprehensive approach to planning and managing IT actions within the organization, based on its business requirements. This paper reports on a study to assess the effect of successful EA projects on the business-IT alignment in Iranian organizations, using the Luftman's maturity model as the assessment tool. The implications of our findings in this study as well as its limitations are discussed to assist in detecting the flaws in the existing EA frameworks and to propose improvements.", "paper_title": "Investigating the role of an enterprise architecture project in the business-IT alignment in Iran", "paper_id": "WOS:000316020500006"}
