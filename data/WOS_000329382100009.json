Users consuming Linked Data on the Web, should be able to search and query data spread over potentially large numbers of heterogeneous, complex and distributed datasets. Ideally, a query mechanism for Linked Data should abstract users from the representation of data. This work focuses on the investigation of a vocabulary independent natural language query mechanism for Linked Data, using an approach based on the combination of entity search, a Wikipedia-based semantic relatedness measure and spreading activation. Wikipedia-based semantic relatedness measures address existing limitations of existing works which are based on similarity measures/term expansion based on WordNet Experimental results using the query mechanism to answer 50 natural language queries over DBpedia achieved a mean reciprocal rank of 61.4%, an average precision of 48.7% and average recall of 57.2%.
