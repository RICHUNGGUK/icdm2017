We show that, similar to the single machine case, the solution is given by a closed form, consisting of identical decreasing arithmetic sequences of batch sizes on the different machines. A very close-to-optimal integer solution is obtained in O(m + root n) time, where m is the number of machines, and n is the number of jobs. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
