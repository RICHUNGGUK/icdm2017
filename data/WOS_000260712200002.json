In particular, the proposal tries to replace an individual in the population with worse values for these two features. In this way, the diversity of the population becomes increased and the quality of the solutions gets better, thus preserving high levels of useful diversity. Experimental results show the proposed replacement strategy achieved significant performance for problems with different difficulties, with regards to other replacement strategies presented in the literature.
