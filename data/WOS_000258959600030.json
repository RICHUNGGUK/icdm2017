The vast majority of these models are derived from published, peer-reviewed papers. Model curation is an important and ongoing process to ensure the CellML model is able to accurately reproduce the published results. As the CellML community grows, and more people add their models to the repository, model annotation will become increasingly important to facilitate data searches and information retrieval.", "paper_title": "The CellML model repository", "paper_id": "WOS:000258959600030"}
