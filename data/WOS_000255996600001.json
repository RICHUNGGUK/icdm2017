The goal is to schedule n jobs, divided into k disjoint chains, on m identical machines, without preemption, so that the jobs within each chain complete in the order of release times and the maximum flow time is minimized. We present a deterministic online algorithm Block with competitive ratio O(root n/m), and show a matching lower bound, even for randomized algorithms. The performance bound for Block we derive in the paper is, in fact, more subtle than a standard competitive ratio bound, and it shows that in overload conditions (when many jobs are released in a short amount of time), Block's performance is close to the optimum. We also show how to compute an offline solution efficiently for k = 1, and that minimizing the maximum flow time for k, m = 2 is NP-hard. As by-products of our method, we obtain two offline polynomial-time algorithms for minimizing makespan: an optimal algorithm for k = 1, and a 2-approximation algorithm for any k.", "paper_title": "Competitive analysis of scheduling algorithms for aggregated links", "paper_id": "WOS:000255996600001"}
