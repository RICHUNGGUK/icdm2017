An empirical study involving 119 participants provides strong evidence for the existence of cognitive biases in investment decision making and demonstrates the effectiveness of decision aids in lowering the negative impact of such biases on the ability of investors to make sound investment decisions. Additionally, such decision aids are shown to be more valuable in decision environments where the bias level is likely to be higher. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
