Our approach is based on the assumption that if a digital video undergoes logo-removal forgery; the blurriness of the forged region is expected to be different as compared to the nontampered parts of the video. Blurriness is first estimated by analyzing the spatial and temporal statistical property of logo areas, and suspicious areas are roughly located; then features are extracted and a fine classification is implemented by applying support vector machine (SVM) to extract features. If the suspicious areas and the reference areas are classified into different classes, the video is judged as a forged video. Experimental results show that our method is robust to video lossy compression for logo-removal forgery detection with the advantages of high classification accuracy and low computation cost.", "paper_title": "EXPOSING DIGITAL VIDEO LOGO-REMOVAL FORGERY BY INCONSISTENCY OF BLUR", "paper_id": "WOS:000284478600002"}
