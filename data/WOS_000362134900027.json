We explain in detail the parallelization of these methods and describe a number of optimizations, mainly focusing on improving memory management and reducing the cost of host-accelerator communication. As previous research has consistently shown, pure LBM simulations are able to achieve good performance results on heterogeneous systems thanks to the high parallel efficiency of this method. Unfortunately, when coupling LBM and IB methods, the overheads of IB degrade the overall performance. As an alternative, we have explored different hybrid implementations that effectively hide such overheads and allow us to exploit both the multi-core and the hardware accelerator in a cooperative way, with excellent performance results.
