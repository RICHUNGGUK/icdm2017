Usually, it is not easy to use a Bayes classifier for pattern recognition problems in high dimensional spaces. This paper proposes a novel PCA-based Bayes classifier for pattern recognition problems in high dimensional spaces, Experiments for face analysis have been performed on CMU facial expression image database. It is shown that the PCA-based Bayes classifier can perform much better than the minimum distance classifier. And, with the PCA-based Bayes classifier, we can obtain a better understanding of data.", "paper_title": "A novel PCA-based Bayes classifier and face analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300020"}
