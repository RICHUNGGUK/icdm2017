In our method, a decision function is determined first in a usual way by using all training samples. Next those support vectors which contribute less to the decision function are excluded from the training samples. Finally a new decision function is obtained by using the remaining samples. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively simplify decision functions of SVMs without reducing the generalization capability.", "paper_title": "An efficient method for simplifying decision functions of support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800046"}
