Nowadays Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) help to organize information and thus to carry out maintenance activities in a more efficient way. The emergence of new ICT has increased also the use of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) systems and the application of Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) analysis. Each system is proved to provide benefits to the maintenance management. However when all the systems are adopted, the lack of integration among them can prevent the maximum exploitation of their capabilities. This work aims at fulfilling this gap, proposing an e-maintenance integration platform that combines the features of the three main systems. The methodology and the reference open standards used to develop the platform are exposed. UML-BPMN diagrams represent the emerging algorithms of the designed system. The final product, a software demo is implemented in an electric transformer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
