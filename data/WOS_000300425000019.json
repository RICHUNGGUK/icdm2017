The proposed scheme utilizes a reinforcement learning framework to opportunistically route the packets even in the absence of reliable knowledge about channel statistics and network model. This scheme is shown to be optimal with respect to an expected average per-packet reward criterion. The proposed routing scheme jointly addresses the issues of learning and routing in an opportunistic context, where the network structure is characterized by the transmission success probabilities. In particular, this learning framework leads to a stochastic routing scheme that optimally \"explores\" and \"exploits\" the opportunities in the network.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Opportunistic Routing for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300425000019"}
