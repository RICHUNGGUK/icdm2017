However, production of high quality stereoscopic content is still a challenging art that requires mastering the complex interplay of human perception, 3D display properties, and artistic intent. In this paper, we present a computational stereo camera system that closes the control loop from capture and analysis to automatic adjustment of physical parameters. Intuitive interaction metaphors are developed that replace cumbersome handling of rig parameters using a touch screen interface with 3D visualization. Our system is designed to make stereoscopic 3D production as easy, intuitive, flexible, and reliable as possible. Captured signals are processed and analyzed in real-time on a stream processor. Stereoscopy and user settings define programmable control functionalities, which are executed in real-time on a control processor. Computational power and flexibility is enabled by a dedicated software and hardware architecture. We show that even traditionally difficult shots can be easily captured using our system.", "paper_title": "Computational Stereo Camera System with Programmable Control Loop", "paper_id": "WOS:000297216400068"}
