Hence they neglect the combination of features and lead to suboptimal subset of features. To address this problem, a joint feature weights learning framework, which automatically determines the optimal size of the feature subset and selects the best features corresponding to a given adjacency graph, is proposed in this paper. In particular, our framework imposes nonnegative and l(2)(2)-norm constraints on feature weights and iteratively learns feature weights jointly and simultaneously. A new minimization algorithm with proved convergence is also developed to optimize the non-convex objective function. Utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new unsupervised feature selection algorithm called Joint Laplacian Feature Weights Learning. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
