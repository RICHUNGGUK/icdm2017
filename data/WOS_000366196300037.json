Consequently, there is a growing emphasis on mining social networks to extract information for knowledge and discovery. However, methods for social network analysis (SNA) have not kept pace with the data explosion. In this review, we describe directed and undirected probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), and highlight recent applications to social networks. PGMs represent a flexible class of models that can be adapted to address many of the current challenges in SNA. In this work, we motivate their use with simple and accessible examples to demonstrate the modeling and connect to theory. In addition, recent applications in modern SNA are highlighted, including the estimation and quantification of importance, propagation of influence, trust (and distrust), link and profile prediction, privacy protection, and news spread through microblogging. Applications are selected to demonstrate the flexibility and predictive capabilities of PGMs in SNA. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of challenges and opportunities for PGMs in social networks.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic graphical models in modern social network analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000366196300037"}
