The new inequality is proved using a perturbation approach via a fundamental relationship between the derivative of mutual information and the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimate in linear vector Gaussian channels. As an application, a new extremal entropy inequality is derived from the generalized Costa EPI and then used to establish the secrecy capacity regions of the degraded vector Gaussian broadcast channel with layered confidential messages.", "paper_title": "A Vector Generalization of Costa's Entropy-Power Inequality With Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000275999500032"}
