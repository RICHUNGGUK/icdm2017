Since that kind of a surface is very hard to describe in an analytical manner, the topological and geometrical information about the surface was acquired with the help of self-organized neural networks (NNs) and first-or second-order statistic parameters. It is proved that the most significant parameter in this process is the curvature, especially when rapid changes of curvature on a free form surface occurred. As the Gaussian distribution of surface curvatures and slope gradient data were presumed, the mean and variance was used for one-dimensional data presentation, and the Hebbian output data vector was used to assess probability, density function and distribution of the presented data. For collecting the maximum amount of surface information, the principal component analysis method inside the Hebbian NN was used.", "paper_title": "Technological information extraction of free form surfaces using neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247428700012"}
