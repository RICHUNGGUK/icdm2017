It is a descriptive type system: the typing of a program is an approximation of its semantics. The type system was expressed by means of rules, which could be seen as a comprehensible abstraction of a typing algorithm. That system treats some query terms in a rather simplistic way. As a result the approximations produced for them axe rather imprecise. In this paper we provide an improved type system, producing more precise results.", "paper_title": "Towards more precise typing rules for Xcerpt", "paper_id": "WOS:000241555100009"}
