DV-hop algorithm is a well-known localization algorithm in WSN but with limited localization accuracy. In this paper, an improved DV-hop localization algorithm in hybrid optical wireless sensor networks is proposed based on the optimization of the parameters in WSN. Various factors that affect the localization accuracy of the DV-hop algorithm in WSN are investigated, including the communication radius of the node, the number of beacon nodes and the number of the total nodes. As the DV-hop algorithm is applied into hybrid optical sensor and WSNs (O-WSN) with rectangular topology, different parameters have to be optimized accordingly. Simulation results show that the square topology outperforms the rectangle topology more than 45 % under the same network parameters using the improved DV-hop algorithm. Therefore another improved DV-hop called Sub-Square Weighted DV-hop (SSW DV-hop) is proposed for the rectangle topology. Both simulation and experiment results demonstrate that applying the SSW DV-hop algorithmin O-WSNs could significantly improve the localization accuracy.", "paper_title": "Optimization of DV-hop localization algorithm in hybrid optical wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351523100003"}
