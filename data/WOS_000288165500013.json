Each SAR ADC channel exploits a threshold-configuring scheme, to avoid internal DAC thus saving circuit complexity, plus a dynamic comparator which allows for power consumption scalable versus processing speed. Implementation results in 90 nm 1 V CMOS technology are presented and compared to the state of the art.", "paper_title": "Configurable array of low-complex SAR ADCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000288165500013"}
