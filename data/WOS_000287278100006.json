Such a system allows users to practice any distributed instrumentation and simultaneously monitor it via real-time video. The system is characterized by use of object-oriented technique to integrate the scattered electronic instruments and video capture devices to form the DML, leading to a flexible and extendable architecture. Finally, evaluations of the DML have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "A DISTRIBUTED MEASUREMENT LABORATORY CAPABLE OF ON-LINE MONITORING OF INSTRUMENTS BASED ON AN OBJECT-ORIENTED APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000287278100006"}
