Kafri and Keren (1987) firstly implements (2,2)-VCS by random grids (RG-based VCS). Compared to conventional solutions of VCS, RG-based VCSs need neither extra pixel expansion nor complex codebook design. However, for a long period, RG-based VCSs are confined to (2,2) access structure. Until recently, Chen and Tsao (2011) proposed the first (k, n) RG-based VCS. In this paper, we improve the contrast of Chen and Tsao (2011)'s threshold scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms Chen and Tsao (2011)'s scheme significantly in visual quality. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
