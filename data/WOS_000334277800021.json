We conducted a bibliometric analysis of data in the Web of Science database to explore the research partners of industries and determine which industries generate scientific articles, observing industrial trends in Taiwan from 1982 to 2011. The results showed that articles were published related to 26 industries, and the electronic components industry generated the highest percentage of articles (42.4 %), followed by the computer, electronics, and optical product industry (12.3 %). High-tech industries dominated, generating 84.5 % of the articles and demonstrating an annual increase in publications. In addition, industry researchers tended to cooperate with researchers affiliated with domestic institutions, particularly universities. Those in high-tech industries produced a higher percentage of articles coauthored with universities compared with those in low-tech industries.", "paper_title": "Exploring scientific articles contributed by industries in Taiwan", "paper_id": "WOS:000334277800021"}
