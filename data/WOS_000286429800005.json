The VGA has gain range from -9 to 63 dB and bandwidth from 31 to 187 MHz. An input P1dB of -15.4 dBm is achieved at 0 dB gain. The RSSI has a dynamic range of approximately 70 dB. The RSSI linearity error is within +/- 1.2 dB for an input power from -77.5 dBm to -36.2 dBm. By adjusting the VGA gain and the LA threshold, the LA is able to detect an input pulse as low as 0.6 mV at a data rate of 15 mega-pulse per second (MP/s). The analogue baseband circuit draws current of 6.03 mA from a single voltage supply of 1.8 V. The test chip occupies an area of 970 mu m x 750 mu m, including two output buffers.", "paper_title": "CMOS LOW-POWER ANALOGUE BASEBAND CIRCUITS FOR A NON-COHERENT LOW DATA RATE IR-UWB RECEIVER", "paper_id": "WOS:000286429800005"}
