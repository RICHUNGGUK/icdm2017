Four popular docking tools (FlexX, Glide, Gold, and Surflex) were used to generate poses for ligands of the three data sets. In all cases, scoring by the similarity of interaction fingerprints to a given reference was statistically superior to conventional scoring functions in posing low-molecular-weight fragments, predicting protein-bound scaffold coordinates according to the known binding mode of related ligands, and screening a scaffold library to enrich a hit list in true cdk2-targeted scaffolds.", "paper_title": "Optimizing fragment and scaffold docking by use of molecular interaction fingerprints", "paper_id": "WOS:000243577400024"}
