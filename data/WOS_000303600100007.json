Two main independent approaches are considered in the paper: (i) discovery of the most important individuals in persistent social communities and (ii) regular centrality measures applied either to social groups or the entire network. A new method for separating of groups stable over time, fulfilling given conditions of activity level of their members is proposed. Furthermore, a new concept for extracting user roles and key persons in such groups is also presented. This new approach was compared to the typical clustering method and the structural node position measure applied to rank users. The experimental studies have been carried out on real two-year blogosphere data.", "paper_title": "Key Person Analysis in Social Communities within the Blogosphere", "paper_id": "WOS:000303600100007"}
