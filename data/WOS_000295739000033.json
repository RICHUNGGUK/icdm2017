By multiplicatively repeating the (2,3)-regular nonbinary LDPCmother code of rate 1/3, we construct rate-compatible codes of lower rates. 1/6, 1/9, 1/12,.... Surprisingly, such simple low-rate nonbinary LDPC codes outperform the best low-rate binary LDPC codes so far. Moreover, we propose the decoding algorithm for the proposed codes, which can be decoded with almost the same computational complexity as that of the mother code.", "paper_title": "Multiplicatively Repeated Nonbinary LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000033"}
