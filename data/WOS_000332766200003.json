The authors propose a characterization methodology that collects key information for troubleshooting IP communication problems, correlating it with propagation issues, such as cell changes or link outages, and resource-allocation problems at specific geographical locations. Mobile operators, services providers, and mobile developers could use the results from deploying this methodology to improve radio coverage, adapt services, and customize mobile applications and protocols based on IP.", "paper_title": "Characterizing Traffic Performance in Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332766200003"}
