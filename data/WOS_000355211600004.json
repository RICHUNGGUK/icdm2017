The field of CPS has been identified as a key area of research, and CPSs are expected to play a major role in the design and development of future systems. In this paper, we survey recent advancements made in the development and applications of CPSs. We classify the existing research work based on their characteristics and identify the future challenges. We also discuss the examples of prototypes of CPSs. The aim of this survey is to enable researchers and system designers to get insights into the working and applications of CPSs and motivate them to propose novel solutions for making wide-scale adoption of CPS a tangible reality.", "paper_title": "Design Techniques and Applications of Cyberphysical Systems: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000355211600004"}
