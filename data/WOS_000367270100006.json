Our quad layout follows the intrinsic object structure described by its curve skeleton; it contains few irregular vertices of low degree; it can be immediately refined into a semiregular quad mesh; it provides a structured domain for UV mapping and parametrization. Our method is fast, one-click, and does not require any parameter setting. The user can steer and refine the process through simple interactive tools during the construction of the quad layout.", "paper_title": "Extraction of the Quad Layout of a Triangle Mesh Guided by Its Curve Skeleton", "paper_id": "WOS:000367270100006"}
