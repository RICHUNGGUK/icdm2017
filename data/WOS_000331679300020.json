Our approach applies a weighted technique that automatically finds the possible atmospheric lights, and mixes these candidates to refine the atmospheric light. Then, difference prior, a novel prior processing method, is employed for the estimation of the transmission that mitigates the halo artifact around the sharp edges. This method requires a low computational cost and is suitable for real-time applications. The experimental results show that our approach obtains the comparable results as compared with previous methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
