In any of these algorithms, the error is interpreted as one of decision variables-called \"tolerance\"-of a certain optimization problem like the previously proposed algorithm, but the tolerance is determined based on the opposite criterion to its corresponding previously proposed one. Applying our each algorithm together with its corresponding previously proposed one, a reliability of the clustering result is discussed. Through some numerical experiments, the validity of this paper is discussed.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy c-means algorithms for data with tolerance based on opposite criterions", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800019"}
