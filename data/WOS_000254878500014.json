While the primary focus is to aid formulation, testing and reduction of theoretical biochemical reaction networks, the program can also be used for analysis of high-throughput genomic and proteomic data.", "paper_title": "In silico Biochemical Reaction Network Analysis (IBRENA): a package for simulation and analysis of reaction networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254878500014"}
