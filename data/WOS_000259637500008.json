Then we analyze the over-time stability of the competitive settings in various constituencies. Next we solve the same problem for seven most recent Finnish municipal elections. It turns out that only very few classes are needed to characterize the average patterns of support distribution. Our main finding is that out of thousands of conceivable over-time trends only few are needed to characterize the support development in both countries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
