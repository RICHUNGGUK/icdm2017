In order to achieve fault-tolerance under such a scenario, an effective way is to find an as large as possible logical fault-free subarray of m' x n' x h' from a faulty array of m x n x h (m' <= m; n' <= n; h' <= h), such that an original application can still work on the m' x n' x6 h' subarray. This paper investigates the problem of constructing maximum fault-free subarrays with minimum interconnection length from 3D arrays with faults. First, we prove that constructing maximum logical array (MLA) is NP-complete. We propose a linear-time algorithm which is capable of producing an MLA for the problem with the constraint of selected indexes. Second, we prove that minimizing the interconnection length (inter-length) of the MLA is NP-hard. We propose an efficient heuristic which significantly reduces the inter-length by revising each logical plane of the MLA. This leads to the reduction of communication cost, capacitance and dynamic power dissipation. In addition, we propose a lower bound for the inter-length of the MLA to evaluate the proposed algorithms. Simulation results show that, the size of logical array can be improved up to 62.6 percent in average, and the inter-length redundancy can be reduced by 22.7 percent in average, compared to the state-of-the-art, for all cases considered.", "paper_title": "Reconfiguring Three-Dimensional Processor Arrays for Fault-Tolerance: Hardness and Heuristic Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000361480400016"}
