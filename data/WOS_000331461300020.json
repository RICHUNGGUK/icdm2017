The proposed architecture includes using Fountain coding in the application layer, UDP in the transport layer and a proposed DTN routing algorithm in the network layer. It is assumed that files are coded based on a sample of Fountain codes which does not need in-order reception of packets. As a result, there is no need of using close-loop reliable protocols such as TCP, hence suffering from their different overheads; as a result, UDP can be used in the transport layer. In the network layer, we propose a novel DTN routing algorithm based on AODV and Store-Carry and Forward policy. This algorithm (named as AODV-DTN) uses a cross layer interaction between the network and the application layer. Results of extensive simulations study for highway scenarios show that the proposed architecture leads to a better performance in terms of file delivery ratio and byte throughput when compared with FOUNTAIN and classic FTP scenarios. Furthermore, the negative effect of increasing file size is mitigated in comparison to other alternatives. It is also shown that for delay tolerant and long-distanced inter-RSU communications the proposed architecture behaves sufficiently well.", "paper_title": "Fountain-code Aided File Transfer in Vehicular Delay Tolerant Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000331461300020"}
