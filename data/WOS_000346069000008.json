The known length of a rigid bar was reconstructed under different conditions of working volume (interpolation or extrapolation), number of cameras (2 or 4), position of the cameras (wide or narrow angle between optical axes), camera focal distance (4 or 8mm) and number of control points (CPs; 8, 12, 18 or 162), through four different camera set-ups. The accuracy (percent root mean square error) of Set-up 2 (non-extrapolated working volume; two cameras; 4mm focal distance; narrow optical axes angle) decreased with less CPs (162: 0.73%; 8: 2.78%). Set-up 1 (non-extrapolated working volume; two cameras; 8mm focal distance; wide optical axes angle), Set-up 3 (Set-ups 1 and 2 used simultaneously) and Set-up 4 (extrapolated working volume; two cameras; 4mm focal distance; wide optical axes angle) showed minor differences in accuracy across groups of CPs, with maximum values of 0.84%, 1.20% and 1.71%, respectively. Random errors were the main source of decreased accuracy of Set-ups 2 and 4.The proposed procedure enables accurate results with no modification in the DLT-based analysis system, even with smaller calibration frames, less CPs and wide field-of-view cameras.", "paper_title": "Improved accuracy in 3D analysis using DLT after lens distortion correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000346069000008"}
