An example based on WSCC-9 system is calculated using MATLAB. It can be seen that the deicing tool input should be larger if the efficiency of deicing tools is low or the expected failure probability is low. And a higher failure probability indicates more deicing tool input.", "paper_title": "Ice Disaster Prevention Measure Optimization Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000369380900016"}
