In particular, we assess the capability of the following five visual features to correctly discriminate epithelium from stroma in digitised tissue micro-arrays of colorectal cancer: coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeliness and roughness. The use of features directly related to human perception makes it possible to evaluate the tissue's appearance on the basis of a set of meaningful parameters; moreover, the number of features used to discriminate epithelium from stroma is very small. In the experiments we used histologically-verified, well-defined images of epithelium and stroma to train three classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Nearest Neighbour rule (1-NN) and Naive Bayes rule (NB). We optimised SVM's parameters on a validation set, and estimated the accuracy of the three classifiers on a independent test set. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed features can correctly discriminate epithelium from stroma with state-of-the-art accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
