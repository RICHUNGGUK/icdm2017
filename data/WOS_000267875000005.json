The analysis begins with a revision of some basic concepts such as the induced ordered weighted averaging operator and the induced ordered weighted geometric operator. We then analyze the problem of decision making with Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory of evidence. We suggest the use of induced aggregation operators in decision making with the D-S theory. We focus on the aggregation step and examine some of its main properties, including the distinction between descending and ascending orders and different families of induced operators. Finally, we present an illustrative example in which the results obtained with different types of aggregation operators can be seen.
