The application taken into consideration is the Regional Climate Model RegCM4, which has been recently re-written for making it more efficient and easier to be fully exploited on any kind of computational infrastructure. We describe here the methods applied to port this package on the Grid infrastructures made available by the EU-IndiaGrid project. We also discuss different approaches, the way to run the model on both European and Indian infrastructures and our promising approach to deal with data management issues. Use of RegCM on Grid infrastructure has further been compared with that on HPC resources. The domain worked upon for these tests is the South-Asia CORDEX domain, which is of great importance for the Indian Summer Monsoon. Our final conclusion is that, for certain class of experiments, RegCM4 model can be efficiently and easily integrated on Grid infrastructures, by means of the procedures described in this paper.", "paper_title": "Regional Climate Simulations on EU-INDIA Grid Infrastructures: Methodologies and Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000339887600007"}
