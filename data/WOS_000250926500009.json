In this approach, sensory data provided by different evaluators are transformed into measures of consistency on fuzzy satisfaction degrees. Based on these measures of consistency, we obtain the aggregated information for all evaluators and all attributes and measure the dissimilarity between evaluators and between used evaluation attributes. The effectiveness of this method has been validated in the fabric hand evaluation for a number of samples of knitted cotton.", "paper_title": "An intelligent sensory evaluation method for industrial products characterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000250926500009"}
