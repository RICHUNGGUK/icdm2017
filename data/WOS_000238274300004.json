This includes positive answers to several questions raised in Berline (2000), as well as several independent results, the state of the art on the long-standing open questions concerning the representability of lambda(beta), lambda(beta eta). H as theories of models, and 22 open problems. We will focus on the class G of graph models, since almost all the existing semantic proofs on lambda F have been, or could be, more easily, obtained via graph models, or slight variations of them. But in this paper we will also give some evidence that, for all uniform classes l, 'l' of proper lambda-models living in functional semantics, lambda l - lambda l should have cardinality 2(omega), provided l is not included in 'l'.", "paper_title": "Graph models of lambda-calculus at work, and variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238274300004"}
