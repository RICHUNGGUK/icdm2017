We address the problem of discovering such substitutions when the original and substitute words have the same natural frequency. We construct a number of measures, all of which search for local discontinuities in properties such as string and bag-of-words frequency. Each of these measures individually is a weak detector. However, we show that combining them produces a detector that is reasonably effective.", "paper_title": "Measures to detect word substitution in intercepted communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800017"}
