Radiologists can use the differences between the left and right breasts, or asymmetry, in mammograms to help detect certain malignant breast cancers. Image similarity is used to determine asymmetry using a contextual and then a spatial comparison. The mammograms are filtered to find the most contextually significant points, and then the resulting point set is analyzed for spatial similarity. We develop the analysis through a combination of modeling and supervised learning of model parameters. This process correctly classifies mammograms 84% of the time, and significantly improves the accuracy of a computer-aided breast cancer detection system by 71%.", "paper_title": "Image similarity and asymmetry to improve computer-aided detection of breast cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900031"}
