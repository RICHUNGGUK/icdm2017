It is a typical example of sofic shifts and has been used in media storage area, such as CD's or DVD's. The study of sofic shifts is based on graph theory, and the irreducibility of shifts is an important property to be considered for the study. hi this paper, we will provide some sufficient conditions for an SET to be irreducible from the perspective of the antidictionary of a word and the number of forbidden words. We also present a necessary and sufficient condition for an SET to be irreducible when the number of forbidden words is one less than the alphabet size.", "paper_title": "On the Irreducibility of Certain Shifts of Finite Type", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900013"}
