An experimental procedure is used, based on a commercial motion capture ring to provide ground truth. Metrics are proposed to assess performances in terms of accuracy, robustness, but also estimator dispersion which is often neglected elsewhere. Relative performances are discussed through some quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a video database. PF strategies based on Quasi Monte Carlo sampling, a scheme which is surprisingly seldom exploited in the Vision community, provide an interesting way to explore. Future works are finally discussed.", "paper_title": "EVALUATIONS OF PARTICLE FILTER BASED HUMAN MOTION VISUAL TRACKERS FOR HOME ENVIRONMENT SURVEILLANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000271863500007"}
