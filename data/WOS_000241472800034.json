To deal with this growing problem, the development of high-performance filters to block those unsolicited messages is strongly required. An Antibody Network, more precisely SRABNET (Supervised Real-Valued Antibody Network), is proposed as an alternative filter to detect spam. The model of the antibody network is generated automatically from the training dataset and evaluated on unseen messages. We validate this approach using a public corpus, called PU1, which has a large collection of encrypted personal e-mail messages containing legitimate messages and spam. Finally, we compared the performance with the well known naive Bayes filter using some performances indexes that will be presented.", "paper_title": "An immunological filter for spam", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472800034"}
