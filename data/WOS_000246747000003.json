Twelve DEM realizations of different grid sizes ranging from 30 m to 3000 m for each of two case watersheds are used for comparative examinations. The study shows that DEM grid size has significant influence on the topographic index distribution which represents the effect of topography on watershed hydrology in TOPMODEL. The smoothing effect of grid size increase may result in deteriorated topographic index distributions at coarse resolutions as the ratio of grid cell area to watershed area gets larger. The simulated discharges and model efficiencies using a same set of TOPMODEL parameters are sensitive to DEM grid size especially at coarse resolutions. This sensitivity, however, can be moderated by parameter calibrations as the optimization runs show that fairly equal efficiencies can be preserved by the compensation effect of transmissivity parameter To within a large extent of DEM resolution for each watershed. The interaction between To and the topographic index distribution with respect to TOPMDOEL model performance is also examined. It is found that both study watersheds demonstrate a similar pattern of change in model performance along with the increase of the grid-to-watershed ratio. The analysis reveals that the ratio poses an important factor in controlling the effect of DEM grid size on TOPMODEL performance. A ratio of less than 5% is suggested in DEM resolution selection for TOPMODEL applications based on the results of this study. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
