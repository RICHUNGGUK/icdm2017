First, some additive operational laws of IIULNs are defined. Subsequently, some new arithmetic aggregation operators, such as the interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic weighted averaging (IIULWA) operator, interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic ordered weighted averaging (IIULOWA) operator and interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic hybrid aggregation (IIULHA) operator, are proposed which are based on the operational laws. Furthermore, an approach to group decision making with interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic information is developed, which is based on the IIULWA and IIULHA operators. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A Group Decision Making Approach Based on Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Uncertain Linguistic Aggregation Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000363225700010"}
