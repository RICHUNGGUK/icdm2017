The parallel geometric multigrid preconditioned iterative solver for the resulting linear system was developed on a cluster of shared memory parallel computers. We propose a hybrid parallel ordering method for the parallelization of a multiplicative Schwarz smoother, which is a key component of the multigrid solver for electromagnetic field analysis. The method, using domain decomposition ordering for multi-process parallelism and introducing block multi-color ordering for multi-thread parallel processing, attains a high convergence rate with a small number of message passing interface communications and thread synchronizations. The numerical test confirms that the proposed method attains a solver performance more than twice as good as the conventional method based on multi-color ordering. Furthermore, an approximately 800 million degrees of freedom problem is successfully solved on 256 quad-core processors. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
