The aim of these methods is to filter the velocity and/or the vorticity fields of two-dimensional turbulence experiments in order to enhance the various components of the fluid. Using this king of methods allows us to separate the vortices from the background essentially composed by vorticity. laments. We have also shown the ability of the wavelet packets in performing this filtering. However, we had underestimated, like Borue in 1994, the influence of the filtering process in the computation of the energy and/or enstrophy spectra. We will show in the present paper how the introduction of discontinuities due to the filtering process can subsequently modify the spectra.", "paper_title": "Spectra and filtering: A clarification", "paper_id": "WOS:000251008400006"}
