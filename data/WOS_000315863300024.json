The numerical solution to adapt the gas dynamic model to chemical species transport in boundary conditions by means of the Method of Characteristics and in volumes by means of a filling and emptying model is described. The performance for chemical species transport in 1D elements of shock-capturing methods, such as the two-step Lax-Wendroff method and the Sweby's TVD scheme considering several flux limiter definitions, is carried out by means of shock-tube tests. The influence of the fluid modelling as perfect or non-perfect gas on the numerical methods features and the flow characteristics on shock-tube results are analysed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
