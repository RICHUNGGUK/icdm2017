Binary Space Partition ( BSP) is a space index used in graphics for hidden-surface removal and animation. We use BSP trees with fuzzy leaves as a progressive representation of solid meshes. Our approach is implemented as a dataflow with processes that progress concurrently, where each refinement of the input to a process is mapped instantly to a refinement of the output, so that the result is also a stream of progressive refinements. This framework allows for progressive generation of complex geometric parts and large-scale assemblies. We have adapted several graphics techniques, including BSP, boundary polygons, CSG, splines and subdivision methods, to fit into our dataflow graph, where four types of processes produce, transform, combine or consume mesh cells. This approach is scalable over different kinds of HPC hardware and different number of computing nodes, by way of the decomposition of the object space and of the distribution of computational processes. Compiling a generative geometric expression into a dataflow graph is well suited to SMP machines, whereas a space decomposition into independent portions fits well with computing clusters and grids.", "paper_title": "PARALLEL SOLID MODELING USING BSP DATAFLOW", "paper_id": "WOS:000262258600004"}
