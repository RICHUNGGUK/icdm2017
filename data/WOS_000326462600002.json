It is often launched by a national institute or a legitimate organisation for gathering funds or raising charity monies. In this study, the authors aim to design a new, electronic lottery (e-lottery) system based on Aryabhata remainder theorem, which can help realise e-lottery games. In particular, the new mechanism can guarantee the security of this popular game involving the potential for a lot of money.", "paper_title": "Aryabhata remainder theorem-based non-iterative electronic lottery mechanism with robustness", "paper_id": "WOS:000326462600002"}
