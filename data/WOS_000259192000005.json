In this paper, we present an efficient approach for solving the multiple-objective flexible job shop by combining evolutionary algorithm and guided local search (GLS). Instead of applying random local search to find neighboring solutions, we introduce a GLS procedure to accelerate the process of convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. The main improvement of this combination is to help diversify the population toward the Pareto front. A branch and bound algorithm for finding the lower bounds of multiple-objective solutions is also proposed. Experimental results indicate that the multiple-objective Pareto-optimal solutions of our algorithms dominate previous designs for solving the same benchmarks while incurring less computational time.", "paper_title": "Solving multiple-objective flexible job shop problems by evolution and local search", "paper_id": "WOS:000259192000005"}
