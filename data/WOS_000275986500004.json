If the bearing capacity failure is not the problem, reliable estimation of the liquefaction-induced settlement will be of prime importance in assessment of the overall performance of the structure. Currently, there are few procedures with limited application in practice for estimation of settlement of foundations on liquefied ground. Therefore, development of a general relationship is important from the practical viewpoint. In this paper, the dynamic response of shallow foundations on liquefied soils is studied using a 3D fully coupled dynamic analysis. For verification of the numerical model, simulation of a centrifuge experiment is carried out and the analysis results are compared with the experimental measurements. The results of centrifuge experiment are taken from the literature for the purpose of comparison and the experiment has not been performed by the authors. After verification of the numerical model, a practical relationship for estimation of liquefaction-induced settlement of rigid footings on homogeneous loose to medium fine sand is proposed based on the results of a comprehensive parametric study. In the interpretation process, the soil layer thickness in which the liquefaction takes place is found to be a key parameter, since by normalization with respect to this parameter, effects of a number of other parameters can be eliminated.
