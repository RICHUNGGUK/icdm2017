Recent studies have also revealed that objects of visual expertise activate the FFA more strongly than non-expertise stimuli, and it was argued that the right FFA is involved in expertise-specific rather than face-specific visual processing. According to these evidences, we propose a new biologically plausible computational model to illustrate face and car expertise effect on the gateway to the right FFA. In addition, there has been reported a difference in the onset latency of macaque inferotemporal neural responses. This latter case is also considered in the proposed model, where faces are recognized in the first layer and in the second layer, a discrimination task between cars and other objects is carried out.", "paper_title": "A BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTATIONAL NEURAL MODEL FOR ILLUSTRATION FACE AND CAR EXPERTISE EFFECT ON THE GATEWAY TO THE RIGHT FFA", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200002"}
