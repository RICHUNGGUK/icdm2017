The training time is small compared to the time used by other algorithms of artificial neural networks and the capacity to compute relations between the inputs and outputs represented by every term of the polynomial. In this paper a new structure of polynomial is presented that improves the performance of this type of network considering only non-integers exponents. The architecture adaptation uses genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimal architecture for every example. Some examples of sunspots and chaotic time series are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
