Design/methodology/approach - Philosophical and theoretical concepts related to the nature of music, aboutness, musical works are explored as they inform how music is represented. Multidisciplinary perspectives on music information representation, classification, and retrieval provide insight into how information science can better accommodate music information within its disciplinary boundaries. Findings - A new term, music information object (MIO), is presented and defined. Downie's (2003) theoretical statements are reconceptualized into a theory of representational incompleteness and three meta-classes for music information object representation. Practical implications - This new framework incorporates more dimensions of music representation than existing frameworks allow and can facilitate comparisons between classifications of MIO representations by music practitioners, scholars, and system developers. Originality/value - The meta-classes form a much-needed theoretical framework for classifying and defining MIOs from any musical tradition for retrieval. This fills a gap in music information retrieval research, which lacks a theoretical framework that can accommodate musics from all traditions without attempting to organize them according to a western-centered understanding.", "paper_title": "Toward a universal, meta-theoretical framework for music information classification and retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000369171000004"}
