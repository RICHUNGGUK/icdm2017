Considering the fuzziness in the decision data, linguistic variables that can be expressed in generalized fuzzy numbers are used, to assess the weights of all criteria and the ratings of each alternative with respect to each criterion. The proposed method considers the difference between each point in two interval numbers based on the alpha-cut of generalized fuzzy numbers, simultaneously, the defuzzified values, the height and the spreads of generalized fuzzy numbers, achieves the ranking order of every alternative.
