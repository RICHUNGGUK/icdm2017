The annotated data is then used to train object detectors in a standard supervised learning setting, possibly in conjunction with category discovery itself. Category discovery systems can be evaluated in terms of both accuracy of the resulting object detectors, and the efficiency with which they discover categories and annotate the training data. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of category discovery, we propose an iterative framework which alternates between optimizing nearest neighbor classification for known categories with multiple kernel metric learning, and detecting clusters of unlabeled image regions likely to belong to a novel, unknown categories. Experimental results on the MSRC and PASCAL VOC2007 data sets show that the proposed method improves clustering for category discovery, and efficiently annotates image regions belonging to the discovered classes.", "paper_title": "Iterative Category Discovery via Multiple Kernel Metric Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000335573700008"}
