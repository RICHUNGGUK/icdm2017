In contrast with such calculi, reduction in pi P generates a preorder on names rather than an equivalence relation. We present two characterisations of barbed congruence in pi P: the first is based on a compositional LTS, and the second is an axiomatisation. The results in this paper bring out basic properties of pi P, mostly related to the interplay between the restriction operator and the preorder on names. Consequently, pi P is a calculus in the tradition of Fusion calculi, in which both types and behavioural equivalences can be exploited in order to reason rigorously about concurrent and mobile systems.
