The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we construct the quantum stabilizer codes from the Hermitian tower. Second, we provide a deterministic decoding algorithm with decoding radius that almost achieves the optimal decoding radius, i.e., (1-R)/4, where R is the rate. Last and most importantly, we present a Monte Carlo algorithm with decoding radius roughly equal to (1 - R)/3, which is beyond the optimal decoding radius (1 - R)/4. There are several features in this paper. First of all, we employ a differential for the Hermitian tower. This differential plays a crucial role for decoding. We also extend our decoding by passing to the constant field extension. This constant field extension makes the decoding work perfectly.", "paper_title": "Decoding of Dual-Containing Codes From Hermitian Tower and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000363256500009"}
