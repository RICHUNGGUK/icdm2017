On the one hand, given the rich directional information provided by the contourlet transform (CT), we propose to use a redundant version of the CT, which describes texture structures more accurately. On the other hand, we use MoGG modeling of contourlet coefficients distribution, which allows for precise capturing of a wide range of histogram shapes and provides better description and discrimination of texture than single probability density functions (pdfs). Moreover, we propose three applications for the proposed approach, namely: (1) texture retrieval, (2) fabric texture defect detection, and 3) infrared (IR) face recognition. We compare two implementations of theCT: standard CT (SCT) and redundant CT (RCT). We show that the proposed approach yields better results in the applications studied compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Texture Modeling Using Contourlets and Finite Mixtures of Generalized Gaussian Distributions and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000333111500017"}
