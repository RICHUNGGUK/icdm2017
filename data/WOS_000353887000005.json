To prevent a passive adversary from collecting other nodes' shares to compromise the system key over a long period, each node can periodically refresh its share without changing the system key. At the same time, to resist an active adversary to forge partial share and even to solve the accusation problem, any one can publicly verify the correctness of partial shares submitted by other nodes in the share update phase. To achieve our goals, we explore the technique of verifiable encryption with additive homomorphism and that of threshold cryptography. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme is more secure and efficient than the previous schemes for ad hoc networks.
