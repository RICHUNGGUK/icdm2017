Moreover, we explore the system-level power-performance tradeoffs available when implementing streaming embedded applications on fine-grained reconfigurable architectures. For a certain group of streaming applications, we show that an efficient hardware/software partitioning algorithm is required when targeting low power. However, if the application objective is performance, then we propose the use of dynamically reconfigurable architectures. We propose a design methodology that adapts the architecture and algorithms to the application requirements. The methodology hag been proven to work on a real research platform based on Xilinx devices. Finally, we have applied our methodology, and algorithms to the case study of image sharpening, which is required nowadays in digital cameras and mobile phones.", "paper_title": "System-level power-performance tradeoffs for reconfigurable computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000239366800007"}
