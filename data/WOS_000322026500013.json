The data transport and computational requirements of these emerging digital media formats are significantly greater than those of preexisting media formats. Therefore, there is the need to deploy high-end media processing and storage resources interconnected by high-performance optical networks. To this end, a service-oriented control framework is proposed to facilitate user context-, media-, and network-aware service provisioning. We investigate one of the principal functionalities of this framework: Joint scheduling of media and optical network resources. The immediate and advance user request models are presented. These models are applied to several proposed heuristic algorithms and mathematical formulations based on integer linear programming (ILP). These algorithms and ILPs are comparatively investigated by simulations. The results show that our algorithms and ILPs are able to facilitate high acceptance of user requests as well as effective and efficient use of available media and optical network resources.", "paper_title": "Service-Oriented Control Framework for Next Generation Media Applications Over Future Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322026500013"}
