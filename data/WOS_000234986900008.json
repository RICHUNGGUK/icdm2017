The technique is a modification of the recently developed trajectory piecewise-linear approach, but uses ideas from balanced truncation to produce much lower order and more accurate models. The key result is a perturbation analysis of an instability problem with the reduction algorithm, and a simple modification that makes the algorithm more robust. Results are presented from examples to demonstrate dramatic improvements in reduced model accuracy and show the limitations of the method.", "paper_title": "Macromodel generation for bioMEMS components using a stabilized balanced truncation plus trajectory piecewise-linear approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000234986900008"}
