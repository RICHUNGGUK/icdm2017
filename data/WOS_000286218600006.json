Lifting has been shown to be very effective in developing strong valid inequalities for linear integer programming and it has been successfully used to solve such problems with branch-and-cut algorithms. Here we generalize the theory of lifting to conic integer programming, i.e., integer programs with conic constraints. We show how to derive conic valid inequalities for a conic integer program from conic inequalities valid for its lower-dimensional restrictions. In order to simplify the computations, we also discuss sequence- independent lifting for conic integer programs. When the cones are restricted to nonnegative orthants, conic lifting reduces to the lifting for linear integer programming as one may expect.", "paper_title": "Lifting for conic mixed-integer programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000286218600006"}
