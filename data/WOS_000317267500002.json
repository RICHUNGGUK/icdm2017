We then consider the set of so called \"F-Problems\" (emptiness, infiniteness, containment, disjointness, universe and equivalence) and show that they are also undecidable for bounded (non-)strict cut-point languages on probabilistic finite automata. For a finite set of matrices {M-1, M-2, ... , M-k} subset of Q(txt), we then consider the decidability of computing the maximal spectral radius of any matrix in the set X = {M-1(j1) M-2(j2) ... M-k(jk)vertical bar j(1), j(2), ... , j(k) >= 0}, which we call a bounded matrix language. Using an encoding of a probabilistic finite automaton shown in the paper, we prove the surprising result that determining if the maximal spectral radius of a bounded matrix language is less than or equal to one is undecidable, but determining whether it is strictly less than one is in fact decidable (which is similar to a result recently shown for quantum automata).", "paper_title": "Decision Problems for Probabilistic Finite Automata on Bounded Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000317267500002"}
