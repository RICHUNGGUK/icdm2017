In this paper, we show how to adapt termination analysis techniques based on polynomial interpretations-very well known in the context of term rewrite systems-to obtain new (nontransformational) termination analysis techniques for definite logic programs (LPs). This leads to an approach that can be seen as a direct generalization of the traditional techniques in termination analysis of LPs, where linear norms and level mappings are used. Our extension generalizes these to arbitrary polynomials. We extend a number of standard concepts and results on termination analysis to the context of polynomial interpretations. We also propose a constraint-based approach for automatically generating polynomial interpretations that satisfy the termination conditions. Based on this approach, we implemented a new tool, called Polytool, for automatic termination analysis of LPs.", "paper_title": "Polytool: Polynomial interpretations as a basis for termination analysis of logic programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000286996600002"}
