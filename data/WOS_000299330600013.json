The main problem is that most of these techniques are based on laser stripe extraction methods which are highly sensitive to noise, which is virtually inevitable in these conditions. In industrial environments, variable luminance, reflections which show up in the images as noise, and uneven surfaces are common. These factors modify the shape of the laser profile. This work proposes a fast, accurate, and robust method to extract laser stripes in industrial environments. Specific procedures are proposed to extract the laser stripe projected on the background, using a boundary linking process, and on the foreground, using an improved Split-and-Merge approach with different approximation functions including linear, quadratic, and Akima splines. Also, a novel procedure to automatically define the region of interest in the image is proposed. The real-time performance of the proposed method is analyzed by measuring the time taken by the tasks involved in their application. Finally, the proposed extraction method is applied to two real applications: 3D reconstruction of steel strips and weld seam tracking.", "paper_title": "Fast and robust laser stripe extraction for 3D reconstruction in industrial environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000299330600013"}
