Recently, we developed a new class of convolutional neural networks for visual pattern recognition. These networks have a simple network architecture and use shunting inhibitory neurons as the basic computing elements for feature extraction. Three networks with different connection schemes have been developed for in-plane rotation invariant face detection: fully-connected, toeplitz-connected, and binary-connected networks. The three networks are trained using a variant of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and tested on a set of 40,000 rotated face patterns. As a face/non-face classifier, these networks achieve 97.3% classification accuracy for a rotation angle in the range +/- 90 degrees and 95.9% for full in-plane rotation. The proposed networks have fewer free parameters and better generalization ability than the feedforward neural networks, and outperform the conventional convolutional neural networks.", "paper_title": "Rotation invariant face detection using convolutional neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100029"}
