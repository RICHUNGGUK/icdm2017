In this paper, the overshooting effect is modeled for CMOS inverter delay analysis in nanometer technologies. The results produced by the proposed model are close to simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE). Moreover, the influence of the overshooting effect on CMOS inverter analysis is discussed. An analytical model is presented to calculate the CMOS inverter delay time based on the proposed overshooting effect model, which is verified to be in good agreement with SPICE results. Furthermore, the proposed model is used to improve the accuracy of the switch-resistor model for approximating the inverter output waveform.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Overshooting Effect for CMOS Inverter Delay Analysis in Nanometer Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000273928400010"}
