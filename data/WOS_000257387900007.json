In this paper, we propose a unified model based on Web farming technology for collecting clickstream logs in the whole user interaction process. We emphasize that collecting clickstream logs at the application layer will help to seamlessly integrate Web usage data with other customer-related data sources. In this paper, we extend the Web log standard to modeling clickstream format and Web mining to Web farming from passively collecting data and analyzing the customer behavior to actively influence the customer's decision making. The proposed model can be developed as a common plugin for most existing commercial websites and portals.", "paper_title": "Web farming with clickstream", "paper_id": "WOS:000257387900007"}
