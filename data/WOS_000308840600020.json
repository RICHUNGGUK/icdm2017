Design/methodology/approach - For the incomplete weight information case, the weight model for the stage and decision maker is put forward based on the requirement of maximum difference among the alternatives. Also, the weight of the decision maker is estimated by the grey relationship method and the Euclid distance method. Findings - As a result, the method of multiple stage grey target decision making based on linguistic label is suggested. In the incomplete information case, the weight model is suggested and the aggregation is put forward. The suggested method is clear and simple, which can be used in multi-criteria decision making fields. Practical implications - This paper offers a very useful result for multi-attribute decision making. Originality/value - This paper succeeds in studying the extensive method of grey target based on multi-stage linguistic label, which is a hypothesis of incomplete information of the weight of stage and the decision maker.", "paper_title": "An extension of grey target method with multistage fuzzy linguistic evaluation under incomplete weight", "paper_id": "WOS:000308840600020"}
