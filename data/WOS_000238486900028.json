This paper presents a technique for generating BPEL code from process models expressed in a core subset of BPMN and UML AD. This model-to-code translation is a necessary ingredient to the emergence of model-driven business process development environments based on these standards. The proposed translation has been implemented as an open source tool.", "paper_title": "Translating standard process models to BPEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000238486900028"}
