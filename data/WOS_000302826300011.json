Most of these solutions usually consider the overall throughput as the main optimization objective. However, other objectives have to be considered in order to provide better quality wireless connections to non stationary users. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization model that, besides maximizing throughput, improves fairness and handoff experience of mesh clients. In this model, we use the jam's index to maximize users' fairness and we allow same-channel assignments to links involved in the same high handoff traffic, thus reducing handoff-triggered re-routing characterized by its high latency. Then, we propose a centralized variable neighborhood search and a Tabu search heuristics to efficiently solve our model as an offline CA process. Moreover, in order to adapt to traffic dynamics caused especially by user handoffs, we propose an online CA scheme that carefully re-assigns channels to interfaces with the purpose of continuously minimizing the re-routing overhead/latency during user handoffs. We further improve this online scheme using load balancing. Simulation results show the good performance of our proposed approach in terms of delay, loss rate, overall throughput and fairness. Particularly, performance results of our online handoff-aware CA show the effectiveness of handoffs not involving path re-routing in decreasing the delay, especially when considering load balancing.
