To ensure the safe operation of metro station and obtain the real-time risk status of metro station, it is necessary to study dynamic risk assessment of metro station. Based on the real-time data collected by data acquisition equipments and research on metro station risk assessment, the dynamic risk assessment index system is established by considering people, equipments, environments, managements and accidents factors together. Considering the fuzzy uncertainty in the process of risk assessment, a new decision model combining interval type-2 fuzzy set and TOPSIS method is proposed and applied to the metro station dynamic risk assessment. The results can reflect the actual risk status of metro stations objectively and are consistent with the real situation. A numerical example case of the metro station in Beijing is used to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods, which can provide effective decision support for decision-makers.", "paper_title": "Dynamic risk assessment of metro station with interval type-2 fuzzy set and TOPSIS method", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627000009"}
