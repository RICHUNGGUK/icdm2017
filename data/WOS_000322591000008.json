Previous research indicates that handheld digital technology is, in general, capable of supporting learning and educational literacy; however, iPad-focused studies are still scarce. In this study, we access and review the instructional benefits of using the iPad in educational spaces, such as classrooms and laboratories, by reviewing a vast body of empirical and theoretical findings reported by multidisciplinary literature on digital technology and children, digital technology use in classrooms, and the impact of interactive technology on learning, instruction, and educational literature. We found that while some studies suggest that the iPad motivates and brings positive impact among students towards their studies, other studies suggest that the long-term impact of the iPad on learning could be even negative. Therefore, we highlight the common misconceptions and conflicts about the use of this new technology and discuss its advantages and challenges. We also sketch some of the future trends relevant to incorporating the iPad into our learning setups.", "paper_title": "The Role of the iPad in the Hands of the Learner", "paper_id": "WOS:000322591000008"}
