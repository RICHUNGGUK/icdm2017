With these transformations, some new 2N-soliton periodic wave solutions for the GDNS equation are obtained by taking position spectral (lambda > 0), negaton spectral (lambda < 0) and complexiton spectral. When N = 1 we obtained two-soliton periodic wave solutions. In particular, when N = 2 we obtained some four-soliton periodic wave solutions. By using mathematical software, we show their profiles. In this method, we can give a Darboux transformation for a very systematic system of even-dimensional and odd-dimensional Lax integrable systems. This method can also be applied to other nonlinear evolution equations.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTING 2N-SOLITON PERIODIC WAVE SOLUTIONS FOR GENERALIZED DERIVATIVE NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000282814400005"}
