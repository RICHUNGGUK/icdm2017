The system is augmented with short-term plasticity (STP) to stabilize the learning dynamics, thereby increasing the system's learning capacity. A theoretical threshold is estimated for the number of distal rewards that this system can learn. The validity of the novel algorithm was verified by computer simulations.", "paper_title": "A Spiking Neural Model for Stable Reinforcement of Synapses Based on Multiple Distal Rewards", "paper_id": "WOS:000312036200005"}
