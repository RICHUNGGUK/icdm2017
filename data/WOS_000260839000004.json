In classical neural networks approaches, particularly associative memory models, synapses are only adjusted during the training phase. After this phase, synapses are no longer adjusted. In this paper we describe a new dynamical model where synapses of the associative memory could be adjusted even after the training phase as a response to an input stimulus. We provide some propositions that guarantee perfect and robust recall of the fundamental set of associations. In addition, we describe the behavior of the proposed associative model under noisy versions of the patterns. At last, we present some experiments aimed to show the accuracy of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A New Associative Model with Dynamical Synapses", "paper_id": "WOS:000260839000004"}
