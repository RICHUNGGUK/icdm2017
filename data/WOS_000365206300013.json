The founding dependence relation and its hardware interpretation provide an algorithm to automatically decide which signals are observed and which are generated. The method is efficient, and it synthesizes control circuits in a few seconds. The results obtained on classical benchmarks show that our technique compiles properties more efficiently than previous prototype tools.", "paper_title": "Efficient and Correct by Construction Assertion-Based Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300013"}
