We compare two models of wireless access network: pure all-IP and subnet based networks. The pure all-IP model is simple and cost-efficient but causes implementation issues of mobility management and resource coordination. In contrast, the subnet-based network enables layer 2 and layer 3 handoffs to be executed independently, deploying several access points under an access router. Further, to handle various cases efficiently according to traffic-class and mobility, we present an advanced model of a hierarchical cellular system that combines multiple access techniques of OFDMA and FH-OFDMA with microcells and macrocells. Finally, as an integrated approach to support diverse QoS requirements, we consider an IP-triggered resource allocation strategy (ITRAS) that exploits IntServ and DiffServ of the network layer to interwork with channel allocation and multiple access of MAC and PHY layers, respectively. These cross layer approaches shed light on designing a QoS support model in a 4G network that cannot be handled properly by a single layer based approach.", "paper_title": "All-IP 4G network architecture for efficient mobility and resource management", "paper_id": "WOS:000246122900007"}
