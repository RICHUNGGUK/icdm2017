We compare the performances of a back-propagation neural network and genetic algorithm in the training outcomes of three examples by referring to the measurement indicators and experiment data. The results show that the back-propagation neural network is superior to the genetic algorithm. Also, the back-propagation neural network has faster training speed than the genetic algorithm. However, the back-propagation neural network has the shortcoming of overtraining, while the genetic algorithm does not. The experiment result proves that the back-propagation neural network yields better outcomes than the genetic algorithm.", "paper_title": "FEED-FORWARD NEURAL NETWORKS TRAINING: A COMPARISON BETWEEN GENETIC ALGORITHM AND BACK-PROPAGATION LEARNING ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000295904300016"}
