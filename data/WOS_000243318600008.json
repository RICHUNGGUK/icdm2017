These inspections typically involve a number of acquisition equipments exploring the state of different parts of the plant in order to detect any kind of failure. Currently, these applications follow a typical client-server model, where every client -up to one hundred- accesses a central server containing all the information about the inspection itself; furthermore, it centralizes all the coordination and synchronization mechanisms of the work. The client applications act as producer/consumer from server data, so that a failure in the server should halt all the activity in the inspection. In this paper, we propose a peer to peer model where all the nodes share the information and discuss the pros and cons of the new system.", "paper_title": "A P2P-based system to perform coordinated inspections in nuclear power plants", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318600008"}
