In this paper, we employ a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model(TAM), a model which has been widely used and empirically validated to explain why individuals use a particular information technology(IT). This paper proposes that additional variables, such as educational impacts, contents quality, interaction and enjoyment, enhance our understanding of behaviors of pilot school teachers in using multimedia-based digital textbooks as a substitute for traditional paper-version of textbooks. A structural equation model is employed with survey data from 157 pilot school teachers in pilot program supported by Korean government and KERIS(Korea Education & Research Information Service), to empirically assess the strength of the relationships in the proposed model. It is hoped that the results from this study provide meaningful insight into the development and delivery of high quality digital textbooks.", "paper_title": "Factors influencing the Usage and Acceptance of Multimedia-based Digital Textbooks in Pilot School", "paper_id": "WOS:000310978600012"}
