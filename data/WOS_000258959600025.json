With the protein information and property explorer (PIPE), the biologist can acquire functional annotations for these proteins and explore the enrichment of the list, or fraction thereof, with respect to functional classes. These protein lists may be saved for access at a later time or different location. The PIPE is interoperable with the Firegoose and the Gaggle, permitting wide-ranging data exploration and analysis. The PIPE is a rich-client web application which uses AJAX capabilities provided by the Google Web Toolkit, and server-side data storage using Hibernate.", "paper_title": "The protein information and property explorer: an easy-to-use, rich-client web application for the management and functional analysis of proteomic data", "paper_id": "WOS:000258959600025"}
