The most important consequence of our proof is that this implicitly gives an efficient algorithm with time complexity O(vertical bar E(G)vertical bar(4)) for reducibility of planar graphs G with at most three terminals. It also can be used for restricted reducibility problems with more terminals. Our proof uses a very well-known translation from these operations to transformations on the medial graph.
