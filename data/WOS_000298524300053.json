An experiment was conducted to analyze the effectiveness of applying STR on learning performance. Students' perceptions and behavioral intentions toward using STR were also investigated. The results revealed students of the experimental group performed significantly better compared to the control group students in two sessions of writing essays, intermediate test and post-test. Most of students perceived that STR was useful for individual presentations and for essays writing. Students also expressed they are willing to use the STR for learning in the future. However, the students who obtained transcripts with low accuracy rate and experienced delay in STR-text generation did not perceive the STR as easy to use and useful for group discussions. Meanwhile, the results of this study showed that the SIR is beneficial to students' oral presentations and group discussions in a synchronous cyber classroom so as to improve their overall learning performance.
