While kernel smoothing methods are mathematically tractable, fitting them to data is computationally intensive. Here, we use smoothing splines in the form of P-splines to provide an alternate less computationally intensive method of fitting these models to capture-recapture data from open populations with frequent capture occasions. We fit the model to capture data collected over 64 occasions and model the population size as a function of time, seasonal effects and an environmental covariate. A small simulation study is also conducted to examine the performance of the estimators and their standard errors.", "paper_title": "Semiparametric inference for open populations using the Jolly-Seber model: a penalized spline approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000324088300011"}
