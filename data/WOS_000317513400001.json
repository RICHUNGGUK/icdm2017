To provide the required high coverage, the mobile sensors have to move from dense areas to sparse areas. However, where to move and how to move are important issues for mobile sensors. This paper presents a centralized algorithm to assist the movement of mobile sensors. In this algorithm, the management node of the WSN collected the geographical information of all of the static and mobile sensors. Then, the management node executed the algorithm to get the best matches between mobile sensors and coverage holes. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our algorithm, in terms of saving energy and the load balance.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Efficient Motion Strategy for Mobile Sensors in Mixed Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317513400001"}
