By employing Lyapunov functions and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, sufficient conditions that guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point are derived. The proposed criteria are easily verified and possess many adjustable parameters, which provide flexibility for the analysis of the neural networks. Finally, two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
