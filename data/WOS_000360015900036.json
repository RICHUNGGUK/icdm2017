The well-known Fano upper bound and Feder-Merhav lower bound on EE are tightened by including a succession of posterior probabilities starting at the largest, which directly controls the MPE, and proceeding to successively lower ones. A number of other interesting results are also derived, including a sequence of upper bounds on the MPE in terms of a previously introduced sequence of generalized posterior distributions. The tightness of the various bounds is numerically evaluated for a simple example.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Error-Based Sequences of Statistical Information Bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900036"}
