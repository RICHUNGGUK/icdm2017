Its effect on the fine structure of the wall turbulence has been analyzed in details, essentially through the spanwise vorticity transport mechanism. It is shown that only half of the viscous sublayer is mainly affected by the control. The actuation efficiency is limited in terms of the wall shear stress reduction, but is high as long as the turbulent wall activity is concerned. The wall shear stress is reduced due both to the reduction of the shear production in the viscous sublayer and to the contribution of the turbulent body force. The dissipation involving in the streamwise vorticity fluctuations transport equation increases significantly and overcomes the production in a thin layer near the wall leading to a drastic diminution of the turbulent wall shear stress fluctuations.
