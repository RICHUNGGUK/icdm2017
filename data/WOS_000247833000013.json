Because of the limited bandwidth of the channels, such random packet losses could occur, simultaneously, in the communication channels from the sensor to the controller and from the controller to the actuator. The random packet loss is assumed to obey the Bernoulli random binary distribution, and the parameter uncertainties are norm-bounded and enter into both the system and output matrices. In the presence of random packet losses, an observer-based feedback controller is designed to robustly exponentially stabilize the networked system in the sense of mean square and also achieve the prescribed H-infinity disturbance-rejection-attenuation level. Both the stability-analysis and controller-synthesis problems are thoroughly investigated. It is shown that the controller-design problem under consideration is solvable if certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. A simulation example is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LMI approach.", "paper_title": "Robust H infinity control for networked systems with random packet losses", "paper_id": "WOS:000247833000013"}
