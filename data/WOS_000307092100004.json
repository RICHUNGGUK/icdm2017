E), let N (u) denote the set of vertices adjacent to u. A not necessarily proper vertex k-coloring of G is a multiset k-coloring if M(u) not equal M(v) for every edge uv is an element of E(G), where M(u) denotes the multiset of colors in N(u). The minimum k for which G has a multiset k-coloring is the multiset chromatic number chi(m) (G) of G. For positive integers n and r with 1 <= r < n, let C-n(r) denote the r-th power of cycle C-n. It was conjectured in Chartrand et al. (2009) [2] that for every integer r >= 3, there exists an integer f (r) such that chi(m)(C-n(r)) = 3 for all n >= f (r). This paper gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
