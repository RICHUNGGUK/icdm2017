This opening-up policy is accompanied by a spectacular growth of the country's economy as well as visibility in the world's scientific literature. Also China' competitiveness in scientific research has grown, and is mirroring the development of the country's economy. On the other hand, international collaboration of most countries dramatically increased during the last two decades and accompanied the growth of science in emerging economies. Thus the question arises of whether growth of competitiveness in research is accompanied by an intensification of collaboration in China as well. In the present study we analyse the dynamics and the national characteristics of China's co-operation in a global context. We also study research profile and citation impact of international collaboration with respect to the corresponding domestic 'standards'.", "paper_title": "In-depth analysis on China's international cooperation in science", "paper_id": "WOS:000275124700012"}
