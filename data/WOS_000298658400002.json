Using the analogy of a human biography this paper recalls the development of the subject from its infancy through childhood and teenage years. We show how in each phase ILP has been characterised by an attempt to extend theory and implementations in tandem with the development of novel and challenging real-world applications. Lastly, by projection we suggest directions for research which will help the subject coming of age.", "paper_title": "Biography and future challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000298658400002"}
