The SIP and IEEE 802.11e are the two most promising protocols to support such services. In this paper, we show how to integrate SIP and 802.11e to conduct call admission control and resource reservation to support VoIP's QoS in IEEE 802.11e WLANs. Besides, we also suggest some adjustments and MAC enhancements to 802.11e to facilitate VoIP traffics over WLANs.", "paper_title": "Design of QoS and admission control for VoIP services over IEEE 802.11e WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000258108700001"}
