This model subsumes many of the qif models proposed so far. Our main contributions include the following: (1) we identify mild general conditions on the leakage function under which it is possible to derive general and significant results on adaptive qif; (2) we contrast the efficiency of adaptive and non-adaptive strategies, showing that the latter are as efficient as the former in terms of length up to an expansion factor bounded by the number of available actions; (3) we show that the maximum information leakage over strategies, given a finite time horizon, can be expressed in terms of a Bellman equation. This can be used to compute an optimal finite strategy recursively, by resorting to standard methods like backward induction.", "paper_title": "QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FLOW UNDER GENERIC LEAKAGE FUNCTIONS AND ADAPTIVE ADVERSARIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000373922900005"}
