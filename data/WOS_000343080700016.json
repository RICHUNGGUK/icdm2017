Moreover, many education scholars have pointed out that emotions are directly related to and affect learning performance. Therefore, it is very important to know what is the most important or influence factor to learner in online education. However, assessing the effects of multimedia materials in e-learning emotions has never been investigated. The aim of this paper is to classify the criteria for multimedia based learning contents and make a quality model corresponding multimedia factors. For this purpose, this research extracts 9 criteria from the past studies. To evaluate the quality model, pairwise comparison method is used.", "paper_title": "The quality model for e-learning system with multimedia contents: a pairwise comparison approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000343080700016"}
