First, the iris image is segmented into sixteen blocks, eight belonging to an upper group and eight to a lower group. We then calculate the fractal dimension value of these image blocks and take the mean value of the fractal dimension as the upper and the lower group fractal dimensions. Finally all the iris images are classified into four categories in accordance with the upper and the lower group fractal dimensions. This classification method has been tested and evaluated on 872 iris cases and the accuracy is 94.61 %. When we allow for the border effect, the double threshold algorithm is 98.28 % accurate.", "paper_title": "A novel method for coarse iris classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300054"}
