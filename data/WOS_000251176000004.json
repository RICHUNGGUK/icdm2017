But converting from residue to conventional notation is generally problematic. In this paper, we propose a high-speed architecture for reverse conversion; this is based on Base Extension and the Chinese Remainder Theorem.", "paper_title": "Fast residue-to-binary conversion using base extension and the Chinese remainder theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000251176000004"}
