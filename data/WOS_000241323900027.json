The LES is carried out using an explicit filtering to damp the scales discretized by less than four grid points without affecting the resolved large scales. The jet features are thus found not to appreciably depend on the filtering procedure. The flow development is also shown from simulations on different grids to be independent of the location of the grid boundaries. The flow and the sound field obtained directly by LES are compared to measurements of the literature. The acoustic radiation especially displays spectra and azimuthal correlation functions which behave according to the observation angle as expected for a high Reynolds number. Furthermore the two components of jet noise usually associated to large structures and to fine-scale turbulence, respectively, are apparently found. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
