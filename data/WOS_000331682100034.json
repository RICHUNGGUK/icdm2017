This study proposes an optimized hybrid artificial intelligence model to integrate a fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA) with a support vector machine (SVM). The fmGA-based SVM (GASVM) is used for early prediction of dispute propensity in the initial phase of public-private partnership projects. Particularly, the SVM mainly provides learning and curve fitting while the fmGA optimizes SVM parameters. Measures in term of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve and synthesis index are used for performance evaluation of proposed hybrid intelligence classification model. Experimental comparisons indicate that GASVM achieves better cross-fold prediction accuracy compared to other baseline models (i.e., CART, CHAID, QUEST, and C5.0) and previous works. The forecasting results provide the proactive-warning and decision-support information needed to manage potential disputes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
