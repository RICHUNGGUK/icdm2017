We build a general analytical framework which we then use to prove that, while Turing-complete, influence dynamics of the diffusive type is almost surely asymptotically periodic. In addition to resolving the dynamics of a widely used family of multiagent systems, we introduce a general renormalization method for the bifurcation analysis of multiagent systems.", "paper_title": "DIFFUSIVE INFLUENCE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000364454500009"}
