While current wakeup schemes in the literature promise to conserve energy in such networks, they apply several assumptions that may not be always true. First, all applications are assumed to require sensing coverage and network connectivity continuously; Second, a random dense deployment of sensors is always assumed possible: And third, the sensing ranges can be easily modeled by some sensing circles. In this paper, we show that these assumptions are not always valid, and propose sensor node wakeup schemes based on combinatorics block design to address energy-related issues when common assumptions fail. Another distinguishing feature of Our work is also the proposal of a dual wakeup design for sensing and communications as these are two very different tasks. Finally, we verified our proposed schemes with simulations and experiments.
