Kanban and CONWIP control systems are focused on and analyzed. We show that, for a production process controlled by Kanban or CONWIP, the critical circuit determines performance measures, such as the system throughput. Initial inventories as well as card distribution are important parameters that decide the critical circuit, and hence influence the system performance. In addition, by means of our proposed framework, we provide comparative results between Kanban and CONWIP control systems in tree-shaped production processes and serial production lines as sample applications of the framework. The results show that determining the certain superior production control system depends on the system parameters, such as the process structure, initial values and processing times.", "paper_title": "Developing a framework for performance analysis of a production process controlled by Kanban and CONWIP", "paper_id": "WOS:000299333100006"}
