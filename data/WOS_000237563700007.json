The theorems differ in their boundary conditions. For both theorems we give a proof using a combinatorial lemma and present a constructive proof based on a simplicial algorithm that finds a discrete zero point within a finite number of steps.", "paper_title": "Solving discrete zero point problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237563700007"}
