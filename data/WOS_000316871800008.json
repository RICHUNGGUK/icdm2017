These operators are very useful for analysing oscillatory signals with time-varying amplitude and frequency (AM-FM). We first propose a new mathematical expression of these operators using directional derivatives along any n-D vector and Kronecker powers (Proposition 1, Sect. 3). This mathematical formulation allows us to extend to n-D case some properties of the classical TKEO such as tracking of AM envelope and instantaneous frequency of a multi-dimensional AM-FM signal. In addition, we have introduced a new scalar function using the directional derivative along a vector to recover the \"sign\" of the frequency components. Applications of this model to a local n-D AM-FM signal and the related demodulation errors are presented. To show the effectiveness and the robustness of the new class of operators in term of envelope and frequency tracking, results obtained on synthetic and real data are compared to multi-dimensional energy separation algorithm (Maragos and Bovik in J Opt Soc Am A 12:1867-1876, 1995) and to our previously developed method (Salzenstein and Boudraa in Signal Process 89(4):623-640, 2009). Finally, the performances of these methods are investigated in the presence of an additive noise.", "paper_title": "A new class of multi-dimensional Teager-Kaiser and higher order operators based on directional derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000316871800008"}
