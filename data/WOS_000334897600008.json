Traditional background modeling methods often require complicated computations and are sensitive to illumination changes. This paper proposes a novel block-based background modeling method based on a hierarchical coarse-to-fine texture description, which fully utilizes the texture characteristics of each incoming frame. The proposed method is efficient and can resist both illumination changes and shadow disturbance. The experimental results show that this method is suitable for real-world scenes and real-time applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
