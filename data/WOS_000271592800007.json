Zero configuration is one of the advantages of UPnP-enabled devices, which makes it unnecessary for people to spend time configuring them. UPnP AV architecture defines the components and UPnP actions for audio and video transport. An OSGi framework integrates several services into home networks and has the advantage of modulations. The OSGi bundle is easy to develop and to be installed for the service providers. Therefore, in this paper, UPnP AV and OSGi are applied to design and implement at ubiquitous home multimedia service (UHMS). When the user is using the multimedia service and want to move to another room in the house, UHMS migrates the service to the suitable renderer in that room. Experimental results show that the latency of service migration is infinitesimal and tolerable to users.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of Ubiquitous Home Multimedia Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000271592800007"}
