Given a small sample texture, the design process starts with applying a set of deformation operations to the sample texture to obtain a set of deformed textures. Then local changes to those deformed textures are further made by replacing their local regions with the texture elements interactively selected from other textures. Such a deform-select-replace process is iterated many times until the desired deformed textures are obtained. Finally the deformed textures are composed to form a large texture with graph-cut optimization. By combining the graph-cut algorithm with an energy optimization process, interactive selections of local texture elements are done simply through indicating the positions of texture elements very roughly with a brush tool. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique can be used for designing a large variety of versatile textures from a single small sample texture, increasing or decreasing the density of texture elements, as well as for synthesizing textures from multiple sources.", "paper_title": "Deformation-based interactive texture design using energy optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000249207600003"}
