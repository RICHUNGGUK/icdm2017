We present a simple learning algorithm and exhibit, via a concise proof, bounds on the asymptotic trajectory errors for the learned input and the corresponding state and output trajectories. Furthermore, these bounds are continuous functions of the bounds on the initial condition errors, state disturbance, and output noise, and the bounds are zero in the absence of these disturbances.", "paper_title": "Discrete Learning Control with Application to Hydraulic Actuators", "paper_id": "WOS:000367822100002"}
