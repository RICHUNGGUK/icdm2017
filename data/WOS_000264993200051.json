These are considered as non-targets. The need for solving such a task arises in many practical applications, e.g. in machine fault detection, face recognition, authorship verification, fraud recognition or person identification based on biometric data. This paper proposes a new one-class classifier, the minimum spanning tree class descriptor (MST_CD). This classifier builds on the structure of the minimum spanning tree constructed on the target training set only. The classification of test objects relies on their distances to the closest edge of that tree, hence the proposed method is an example of a distance-based one-class classifier. Our experiments show that the MST-CD performs especially well in case of small sample size problems and in high-dimensional spaces. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
