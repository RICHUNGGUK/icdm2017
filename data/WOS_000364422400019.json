Most current feature representations look at contextual information extracted from the behaviour of nearby people. Every person needs to be detected and his pose should be estimated. After extracting the feature, hierarchical graphical models are always employed to model the spatio-temporal patterns of individuals and their interactions, and so can not avoid complex preprocessing and inference operations. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a new feature representation method, called attribute-based spatio-temporal (AST) descriptor. First, two types of information, spatio-temporal (ST) features and attribute features, are exploited. Attribute-based features are manually specified. An attribute classifier is trained to model the relationship between the ST features and attribute-based features, according to which the attribute features are refreshed. Then, the ST features, attribute features and the relationship between the attributes are combined to form the AST descriptor. An objective classifier can be specified on the AST descriptor and the weight parameters of the classifier are used for recognition. Experiments on standard collective activity benchmark sets show the effectiveness of the proposed descriptor.", "paper_title": "Collective Activity Recognition by Attribute-Based Spatio-Temporal Descriptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422400019"}
