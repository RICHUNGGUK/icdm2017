In this work, a new method based on the stationary wavelet packet transform is proposed to estimate and remove this kind of noise from EMG data records. The performance has been quantitatively evaluated with synthetic noisy signals, obtaining good results independently from the signal to noise ratio (SNR). For the analyzed cases, the obtained results show that the correlation coefficient is around 0.99, the energy respecting to the pure EMG signal is 98-104%, the SNR is between 16.64 and 20.40 dB and the mean absolute error (MAE) is in the range of -69.02 and -65.31 dB. It has been also applied on 18 real EMG signals, evaluating the percentage of energy respecting to the noisy signals. The proposed method adjusts the reduction level to the amplitude of each harmonic present in the analyzed noisy signals (synthetic and real), reducing the harmonics with no alteration of the desired signal.
