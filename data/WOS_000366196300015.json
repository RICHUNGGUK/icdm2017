Several overlapping extensions of modularity were proposed to measure the quality of overlapping community structure. However, all these extensions differ just in the way they define the belonging coefficient and belonging function. Yet, there is lack of systematic comparison of different extensions. To fill this gap, we overview overlapping extensions of modularity and generalize them with a uniform definition enabling application of different belonging coefficients and belonging functions to select the best. In addition, we extend localized modularity, modularity density, and eight local community quality metrics to enable their usages for overlapping communities. The experimental results on a large number of real networks and synthetic networks using overlapping extensions of modularity, overlapping modularity density, and local metrics show that the best results are obtained when the product of the belonging coefficients of two nodes is used as the belonging function. Moreover, the results may be used to guide researchers on which metrics to adopt when measuring the quality of overlapping community structure.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy overlapping community quality metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000366196300015"}
