Cooling fluids have traditionally been used to remove heat from the tool tip in an attempt to prolong tool life. Numerous health issues linked to the prolonged exposure of cooling. fluids and pollution concerns require costly and regulated disposal process of the cooling fluid. Metal cutting using alternative cooling methods has been considered by the manufacturing industry as a possible alternative to liquid-based cooling. However, low heat removal rates or the expense of alternative cooling processes have resulted in the manufacturing industry's continued use of liquid cooling. To assist in determining the most effective cooling process a tool life model for the cutting tool is used to reduce the lifecycle testing. The work presented in this paper examines the effectiveness of an aircooling technique based on jet impingement to prolong the effective life cycle of cutting tools. Results obtained so far clearly indicate a highly significant reduction in tool tip temperature with the air-jet arrangement, and at an economical cost. The cooling effectiveness of this technique is found to be comparable to liquid coolants with no significant decrease in tool life with air jet cooling.", "paper_title": "The introduction of an environmental cooling method is proved by using a reduced tool life cycle time method", "paper_id": "WOS:000248333700007"}
