For finite-dimensional sources, which contain hidden Markov sources as a subclass, the criterion can be effectively computed. This result is obtained on the background of a novel, elementary theory of discrete random sources, which is based on linear spaces spanned by word functions, and linear operators; on these spaces. An outline of basic elements of this theory is provided.", "paper_title": "Characterization of Ergodic Hidden Markov Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000265713000014"}
