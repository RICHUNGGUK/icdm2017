Based on the mechanism of vibrational resonance (VR), the signal transmission is enhanced significantly by adjusting the time-delay feedback. Via numerical simulation, it is found that the multiple VR is induced by modulating the delay time. As expected, the phenomenon that the resonances of the first neuron and the others are synchronous is learned under the condition that the coupling strength is strong enough. In addition, with the aid of vibration resonance, the coupling strength is also helpful to the signal transmission process. Finally, we also find that because of the cooperation between the time-delay feedback and the high-frequency signal, the weak low-frequency signal can be transmitted with a much higher efficiency than the corresponding in an ordinary system.
