Due to their complexity information management needs a thorough description or model of the managed information system. Methods: The three layer graph-based meta-model (3LGM(2)) and the 3LGM(2) tool provide means for effectively describing and modeling HIS by hospital functions, application systems and physical data processing components. The 3LGM(2) tool has been used to model parts of the information system of the health care system of the German federal state Saxony and of the Leipzig University Medical Centre. Results: Experiences showed, that 3LGM(2) is suitable for supporting information management even in rHIS. We explain some benefits for information management in regional as well as local settings. Conclusions: Acceptance of the 3LGM(2) depends strictly on its integration in management structures on the institutional, regional, and even national or European level. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
