Let {a, b} be an alphabet. For n >= 1, and r = r(1)r(2)...r(n) is an element of N(n) with 0 <= r(i) <= a(i) for 1 <= i <= n, there corresponds an nth-order alpha-word u(n)[r] with label r derived from the pair (a, b). These alpha-words are defined recursively as follows: u(-1) = b, u(0) = a, u(1)[r(1)] = a(a1-r1)ba(r1), u(i)[r(1)r(2)...r(i)] = u(i-1)[r(1)r(2)r...r(i-1)](ai-ri)u(i-2)[r(1)r(2)...r(i-2)]u(i-1)[r(1)r(2)...r(i-1)](ri), i >= 2. Many interesting combinatorial properties of alpha-words have been studied by Chuan. In this paper, we obtain some new methods of generating the distinct alpha-words of the same order in lexicographic order. Among other results, we consider another function r bar right arrow w[r] from the set of labels of alpha-words to the set of alpha-words. The string r is called a new label of the alpha-word w[r]. Using any new label of an nth-order alpha-word w, we can compute the number of the nth-order alpha-words that are less than w in the lexicographic order. With the radix orders <(r) on N(n) (regarding N as an alphabet) and {a, b}(+) with a <(r) b, we prove that there exists a subset D of the set of all labels such that w[r] <(r) w[s] whenever r, s is an element of D and r <(r) S.
