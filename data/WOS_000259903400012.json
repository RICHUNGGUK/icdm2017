Various approaches are used to represent it, one is the approximation of the discharge represented by a hot \"channel\", which verifies the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium [LTE] or the polynomial form of the conductance variation. A calculation procedure, based on \"channel\"approximation of the high pressure mercury (HPM) gas- discharge lamp, is developed to determine the physical and electric magnitudes, which characterize the dynamic behavior of the couple \"lamp electrical power system\". The evolution of the lamp properties when principal parameters of the discharge (pressure of mercury, voltage supply, frequency) are varying were studied and analyzed. We show the concordance between simulation, calculations and measurements for electric, energetic or irradiative characteristics. The model reproduces well the evolution of properties of the supply when principal parameters of the discharge vary.", "paper_title": "Modelling the Dynamic Interaction \"Power System - Lamp\".
