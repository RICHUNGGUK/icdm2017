A simple but efficient framework, in the form of a monotonic response function (MRF), is proposed for the analysis and the design of memoryless window-based source adaptation protocols by using these concepts. We first derive a necessary and sufficient condition for step-wise convergence to the weighted fairness. It is then used to construct increase-decrease policies. The requirements of our increase-decrease policy are less conservative than those of the CYRF (Choose Your Response Function) that was proposed in [1]. Our MRF is suitable for transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP), and can be used to design TCP-friendly and multimedia-friendly source adaptation schemes. Meanwhile, our MRF can be applied to provide bandwidth differentiation service without any change to the router of the existing Internet.", "paper_title": "MRF: A framework for source and destination based bandwidth differentiation service", "paper_id": "WOS:000247353400017"}
