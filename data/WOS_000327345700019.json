In this paper, we unify the first two families of problems by introducing a new class of problems, which can be reduced from both problems. Based on this new problem, namely the bounded distance decoding over hidden ideal lattice, we present a new fully homomorphic encryption scheme. Since it is a combination of the two problems to some extent, the performance of our scheme lies between the ideal lattice based schemes and the integer based schemes. Furthermore, we also show a lower bound and upper bound of the problem that our scheme is based on. Assuming this security conjecture holds, we can incorporate smaller parameters, which will result in a scheme that is more efficient than both lattice based and integer based schemes. Hence, our scheme makes a perfect alternative to the state-of-art ring learning with error based schemes.", "paper_title": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using Hidden Ideal Lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000327345700019"}
