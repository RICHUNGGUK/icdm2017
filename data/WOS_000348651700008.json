The reparameterizations improve regression inference by alleviating spatial confounding, and the sparse SGLMM also greatly speeds computing by reducing the dimension of the spatial random effects. Package ngspatial ('ng' = non-Gaussian) provides routines for fitting these new models. The package supports composite likelihood and Bayesian inference for the centered autologistic model, and Bayesian inference for the sparse SGLMM.", "paper_title": "ngspatial: A Package for Fitting the Centered Autologistic and Sparse Spatial Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Areal Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000348651700008"}
