The proposed technique is based on the generalised gramian framework for model reduction. It is shown that different classical reduction methods can be developed into a generalised gramian framework. Balanced reduction within a specified frequency bound is developed within this framework. In order to avoid numerical instability and also to increase the numerical efficiency, generalised gramian-based Petrov-Galerkin projection is constructed instead of the similarity transform approach for reduction. The framework is developed for switched controller reduction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other reported result on switched controller reduction in the literature. The method preserves the stability under an arbitrary switching signal for both model and controller reduction. Furthermore, it is applicable to both continuous and discrete time systems for different classical gramian-based reduction methods. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Generalised gramian framework for model/controller order reduction of switched systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000292642900005"}
