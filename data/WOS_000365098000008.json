In particular, we study the improvement of teamwork attitude, the predominant types of motivation in different contexts, and some correlations among these three components of the learning process. The above-mentioned aspects are of great importance. Currently, the professional profile of engineers has a strong teamwork component, and the motivational profile of students determines both their tendencies when they come to work as part of a team and their performance at work. Taking these issues into consideration, we suggest four hypotheses: H1) students improve their teamwork capacity through specific training and by carrying out a set of activities integrated into an active learning process; H2) students with higher mastery motivation have a better attitude toward teamwork; H3) students with different types of motivations reach different levels of academic performance; and H4) students show different motivation profiles in different circumstances, such as types of courses, teaching methodologies, and different times of the learning process. This study was carried out with Computer Science Engineering students from two Spanish universities. The first results point to an improvement in teamwork competence of students if they have previously received specific training in facets of that competence. Other results indicate that there is a correlation between the motivational profiles of students and their perception of teamwork competence. Finally, the results point to a clear relationship between some kind of motivation and academic performance. In particular, four kinds of motivation are analyzed, and students are classified into two groups according to them. After analyzing several marks obtained in compulsory courses, we perceive that the students who show higher motivation for avoiding failure obtain, in general, worse academic performance.", "paper_title": "Teamwork, Motivational Profiles, and Academic Performance in Computer Science Engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000365098000008"}
