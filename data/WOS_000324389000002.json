In this comprehensive survey, we review some major developments of Petri nets that have enhanced their modeling capabilities and in particular the methods to incorporate well-known software engineering development paradigms in Petri nets to support general software system modeling.", "paper_title": "A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF PETRI NET MODELING IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000324389000002"}
