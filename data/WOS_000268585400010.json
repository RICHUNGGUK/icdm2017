In this paper, we consider besides the graph also other modes of input such as the complement of the graph, the undergraph and the overgraph of the function. The relationships between these models are studied and a complete picture is obtained. Furthermore, these notions are also explored for learning with oracles, learning in teams and learning in the presence of additional information.", "paper_title": "Input-Dependence in Function-Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000268585400010"}
