The algorithm has the unique ability to handle cross-sections in which regions are classified as being inside the object, outside the object, or unknown. This is achieved by constructing a scalar function on R-3, whose zero set is the desired surface. The function is constructed independently inside every cell of the arrangement of the cross-section planes using transfinite interpolation techniques based on barycentric coordinates. These guarantee that the function is smooth, and its zero set interpolates the cross-sections. The algorithm is highly parallelizable and may be implemented as an incremental update as each new cross-section is introduced. This leads to an efficient online version, performed on a GPU, which is suitable for interactive medical applications.", "paper_title": "Online Reconstruction of 3D Objects from Arbitrary Cross-Sections", "paper_id": "WOS:000297299700005"}
