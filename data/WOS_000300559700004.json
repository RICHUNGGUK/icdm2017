However, this is not true for SR because of one-to-many mappings between LR and HR patches. To overcome or at least to reduce the problem for NE-based SR reconstruction, we apply a joint learning technique to train two projection matrices simultaneously and to map the original LR and HR feature spaces onto a unified feature subspace. Subsequently, the k-nearest neighbor selection of the input LR image patches is conducted in the unified feature subspace to estimate the reconstruction weights. To handle a large number of samples, joint learning locally exploits a coupled constraint by linking the LR-HR counterparts together with the K-nearest grouping patch pairs. In order to refine further the initial SR estimate, we impose a global reconstruction constraint on the SR outcome based on the maximum a posteriori framework. Preliminary experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms NE-related baselines.", "paper_title": "Joint Learning for Single-Image Super-Resolution via a Coupled Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000300559700004"}
