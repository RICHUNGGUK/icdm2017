Visualizations are important for understanding coastal landscape evolution and its driving processes. Visualizing change in highly dynamic coastal terrain poses a formidable challenge; the combination of natural and anthropogenic forces leads to cycles of retreat and recovery and complex morphology of landforms. In recent years, repeated high-resolution laser terrain scans have generated a time series of point cloud data that represent landscapes at snapshots in time, including the impacts of major storms. In this article, we build on existing approaches for visualizing spatial-temporal data to create a collection of perceptual visualizations to support coastal terrain evolution analysis. We extract terrain features and track their migration; we derive temporal summary maps and heat graphs that quantify the pattern of elevation change and sediment redistribution and use the space-time cube concept to create visualizations of terrain evolution. The space-time cube approach allows us to represent shoreline evolution as an isosurface extracted from a voxel model created by stacking time series of digital elevation models. We illustrate our approach on a series of Light Detection and Ranging surveys of sandy North Carolina barrier islands. Our results reveal terrain changes of shoreline and dune ridge migration, dune breaches and overwash, the formation of new dune ridges, and the construction and destruction of homes, changes which are due to erosion and accretion, hurricanes, and human activities. These events are all visualized within their geographic and temporal contexts.", "paper_title": "Visualizations of coastal terrain time series", "paper_id": "WOS:000337711400006"}
