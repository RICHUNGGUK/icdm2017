Firstly, a layered geometry model based on LOD (Level of Detail) was proposed. Instance technique was applied to the model, which effectively improves the performance of rendering volumetric cloud. Secondly, the 2D textures were used to modulate of cloud appearance, cloud shadow, city glow, which provides additional flexibility. Thirdly, the lighting such as multiple forward scattering was computed in advance. The results were stored in a 3D texture, which simplifies the lighting computation at runtime. Finally, the algorithm was implemented by means of CPU (graphics processing unit). The algorithm proposed is suitable for rendering the cloud covering part or all of the sky, which was applied to a helicopter flight simulator successfully.", "paper_title": "USING INSTANCE FOR LARGE SCALE VOLUMETRIC CLOUDS RENDERING IN REAL-TIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161100036"}
