The recommendation techniques could be used to explore huge volumes of data, identify the items that users probably like, translate the research results into real-world applications and so on. This paper surveys the recent progress in the research of recommendations based on offline data processing, with emphasis on new techniques (such as temporal recommendation, graph-based recommendation and trust-based recommendation), new features (such as serendipitous recommendation) and new research issues (such as tag recommendation and group recommendation). We also provide an extensive review of evaluation measurements, benchmark data sets and available open source tools. Finally, we outline some existing challenges for future research.
