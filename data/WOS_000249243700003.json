Next, based on the well-known Popov criterion with graphical interpretation, a sufficient condition in the frequency domain is proposed to guarantee the globally asymptotical stability of the simplest T-S fuzzy system. A performance comparison is also made between the simplest T-S fuzzy and conventional linear controllers. It is concluded that the simplest T-S fuzzy controller outperforms its linear counterparts, when both the disturbance and sensor noise are considered.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of the simplest Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control system using Popov criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700003"}
