GGBFS inclusion has already been proven to improve several performance characteristics of concrete. GGBFS provides enhanced durability, including high resistance to chloride penetration and protection against alkali silica reaction. In this paper results of an experimental research work on influence of low-reactivity GGBFS (which is largely available in Iran) on the properties of mortars and concretes are reported. In the first stage, influence of GGBFS replacement level and fineness on the compressive strength of mortars was investigated using Taguchi method. The analysis of mean (ANOM) statistical approach was also adopted to develop the optimal conditions. Next, based on the obtained results, concrete mixtures were designed and water penetration, capillary absorption, surface resistivity, and compressive strength tests were carried out on high-strength concrete specimens at different ages up to 90 days. The results indicated that 7-day compressive strength is adversely affected by GGBFS inclusion, while the negative effect is less evident at later ages. Also, it was inferred that use of low-reactivity GGBFS (at moderate levels such as 20% and 30%) can enhance the impermeability of high-strength concrete since 28 days age.", "paper_title": "Influence of Iranian low-reactivity GGBFS on the properties of mortars and concretes by Taguchi method", "paper_id": "WOS:000337302400001"}
