The main mission consists in exploring unknown, isolated and unstructured scenarios, where no Global Positioning System is available. By means of the cooperative localization technique and a behaviour based controller the robots have to return to the initial configuration. The proposed approach relies on distance and orientation measurements between the individual robots, and between the robots and a fixed active beacon. Simulation results are presented.", "paper_title": "Navigation strategies for cooperative localization based on a particle-filter approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000248283800005"}
