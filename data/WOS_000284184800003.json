In this paper we present a high order scheme for determining unknown control parameter and unknown solution of parabolic inverse problem with both integral overspecialization and overspecialization at a point in the spatial domain. In these equations, we first approximate the spatial derivative with a fourth order compact scheme and reduce the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then we apply a fourth order boundary value method for the solution of resulting system of ODEs. So the proposed method has fourth order accuracy in both space and time components and is unconditionally stable due to the favorable stability property of boundary value methods. Several numerical examples and also some comparisons with other methods in the literature will be investigated to confirm the efficiency of the new procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Mi.
