One of the major drawbacks of cloud computing, however, is the lack of robust mechanisms for the users to control the privacy of the data they farm out to the clouds. In this paper, we develop an image encoding scheme that enhances the privacy of image data that is outsourced to the clouds for processing. Unlike previously proposed image encryption schemes, our encoding scheme allows different forms of pixel-level image processing to take place in the clouds while the actual image is not revealed to the cloud provider. Our encoding scheme uses a chaotic map to transform the image after it is masked with an arbitrarily chosen ambient image. We use template matching as a common image processing task to demonstrate the ability of our scheme to perform computations on privacy enhanced images. A simplified prototype of the image processing system was implemented and the experimental results are presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "Privacy aware image template matching in clouds using ambient data", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100027"}
