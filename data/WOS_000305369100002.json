These characteristics of the search spaces increase the possibility of the agents getting trapped in a local optimum, when using a meta-heuristic algorithm. In this paper a diversity index is introduced which together with a few other criteria, can be employed to recognize such traps. By the use of these concepts, a hybridization of the Charged System Search and the Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithms with trap recognition capability is proposed. Five numerical examples are considered to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
