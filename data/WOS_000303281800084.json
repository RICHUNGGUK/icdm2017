Indeed, directional movement of implied volatility is forecasted by being modeled into a function of the option Greeks. The function is structured as a locally stationary model that employs a sliding window, which requires proper selection of window width and sliding width. An artificial neural network is employed for implementing and specifying our methodology. Empirical study in the Korean options market not only illustrates how our directional forecasting methodology is constructed but also shows that the methodology could yield a reasonably strong performance. Several interesting technical notes are discussed for directional forecasting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
