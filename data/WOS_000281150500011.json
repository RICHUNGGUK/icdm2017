In this paper, we propose a definition of more general complex orthogonal designs, which permits arbitrary complex factor with unit modulus in each entry. We prove that the maximal rate is still m+1/2m for n = 2m or 2m - 1 antennas and minimal delay is also lower-bounded by ((2m)(m-1)). Thus, allowing complex factor with unit modulus in each entry will not improve the main performance criterion of space-time block codes.", "paper_title": "The maximal rates and minimal decoding delay of more general complex orthogonal designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000281150500011"}
