A probabilistic neural network is assessed as a classifier and it is demonstrated that relatively simple image processing measurements can be used to obtain high performance vehicle authentication. The proposed system is assisted by a previously developed license plate recognition, a symmetry axis detector and an image phase congruency calculation modules. The reported results indicate a high recognition rate and a fast processing time, making the system suitable for real-time applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
