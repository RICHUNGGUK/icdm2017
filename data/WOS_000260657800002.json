This paper applied model predictive control (MPC) to the Benchmark Simulation Model 1 (BSM1) wastewater treatment process to maintain the effluent quality within regulations-specified limits. Good performance was achieved under steady influent characteristics, especially concerning the nitrogen-related species. In presence of influent disturbances, two approaches have been studied: the addition of a feedforward action based on the measurement of the influent flow rate; the use of nonlinear model predictive controller by addition of a penalty function. The effects of two approaches were visible on the decrease of ammonium and nitrogen concentration which were considered as being of major importance. The results show that MIPC can be effectively used for control in wastewater treatment process. By comparing performances, the nonlinear model predictive control strategy with penalty function demonstrates best with small effluent quality index and acceptable aeration and pumping energy consumption.
