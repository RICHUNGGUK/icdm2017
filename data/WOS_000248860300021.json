Typical natural scenes, however, show strong continuous variations of color, presenting a different, dynamic order that is not captured by existing algorithms which will segment a sky with different intensities and hues of blues or an irregularly illuminated surface as a set of different regions. We present and validate empirically a new, extremely simple approach that shows very satisfying results when applied on such scenes, while not showing poorer performance than traditional methods when applied to standard region-growing problems.
