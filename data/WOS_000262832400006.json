Since most of the wireless networks were initially dimensioned only for data communications, this paper shows how voice over wireless LAN dimensioning could be addressed under the optimal network throughput and the perspective of voice quality, using a simple approach. The maximum number of simultaneous users resulting from throughput is limited by the collisions taking place in the shared medium with the statistical contention protocol. The voice quality is conditioned by the delay and the packet loss in the contention protocol. Both approaches are analyzed within the scope of the voice codecs commonly used in voice over wireless LANs, to conclude that voice dimensioning based on network throughput and voice quality show complementary results. Additionally the use of low rate codecs in voice over wireless LANs is advantageous for the network performance point of view but may produce poor voice quality results. Mid range codecs like G729 could represent a trade-off for quality throughput. For these reasons, voice quality and wireless network throughput have to be taken into account in the network admission control, design and deployment to ensure a satisfactory user experience. The impact of handoff interval of wireless convergent networks on the conversation quality need also be assessed for a proper network design.", "paper_title": "Approach for voice quality and throughput estimation in wireless convergent networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262832400006"}
