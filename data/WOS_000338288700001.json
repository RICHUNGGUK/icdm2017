The hypergraph G is t-intersecting if every two edges of G have at least t vertices in common. A natural variant of a question of Erdos and Lovasz is: For fixed c >= 2 and t >= 1, what is the minimum number of colours that is sufficient to c-strong colour any t-intersecting hypergraphs? The purpose of this note is to describe some open problems related to this question.", "paper_title": "Semi-Strong Colouring of Intersecting Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000338288700001"}
