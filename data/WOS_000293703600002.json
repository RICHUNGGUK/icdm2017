Wireless sensor networks represent a suitable monitoring technology to collect reliable information about the structure's condition, replacing visual inspections, and reducing installation and maintenance time and costs. This article introduces a time synchronized and configurable wireless sensor network for structural health monitoring enabling a highly accurate identification of the modal properties of the monitored structure. The wireless sensor nodes forming the network are equipped with a 3-axis digital accelerometer and a temperature and humidity sensor. The implemented Medium Access Control layer time synchronization protocol (mu-Sync) ensures a highly accurate synchronicity among the samples collected by the nodes, the absolute error being constantly below 10 mu s, also when high sampling frequency (up to 1 kHz) and extended sampling periods (up to 10 minutes) are applied. The experimental results obtained on a wooden model bridge, compared with those derived from acceleration signals acquired by high-quality wired sensors, show that the so synchronized wireless sensor nodes allow a precise identification of the natural frequencies of vibration of the monitored structure (1% maximum relative difference).", "paper_title": "A Synchronized Wireless Sensor Network for Experimental Modal Analysis in Structural Health Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000293703600002"}
