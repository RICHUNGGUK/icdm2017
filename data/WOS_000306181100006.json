It formulates the problem as a combinatorial optimization of assigning discrete materials extracted from the guide source to discrete objects in the target 3D scene. The assignment is optimized to fulfill multiple goals: overall image mood based on several image statistics; spatial material organization and grouping as well as geometric similarity between objects that were assigned to similar materials. To be able to use common uncalibrated images and videos with unknown geometry and lighting as guides, a material estimation derives perceptually plausible reflectance, specularity, glossiness, and texture. Finally, results produced by our method are compared to manual material assignments in a perceptual study.", "paper_title": "3D Material Style Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000306181100006"}
