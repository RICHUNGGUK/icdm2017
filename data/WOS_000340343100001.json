This chapter discusses the two categories of static and dynamic security models, as exemplified by attack graphs and Petri nets, respectively. Also discussed is the significant enhancement that results from extending these models to capture nondeterministic behavior, in stochastic attack graphs and stochastic Petri nets, respectively. The models are evaluated and compared with respect to (i) accuracy and (ii) potential for decision support, and Petri nets are found to be superior to attack graphs in both criteria.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Security Models: Attack Graphs Versus Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000340343100001"}
