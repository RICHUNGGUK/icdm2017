Instead of searching the route in the entire network blindly, position-based routing protocol uses the location information of mobile nodes to confine the route searching space into a smaller estimated range. The smaller route searching space to be searched, the less routing overhead and broadcast storm problem will occur. In this paper, we proposed a location-based routing protocol called LARDAR. There are three important characteristics be used in our protocol to improve the performance. Firstly, we use the location information of destination node to predict a smaller triangle or rectangle request zone that covers the position of destination in the past. The smaller route discovery space reduces the traffic of route request and the probability of collision. Secondly, in order to adapt the precision of the estimated request zone, and reduce the searching range, we applied a dynamic adaptation of request zone technique to trigger intermediate nodes using the location information of destination node to redefine a more precise request zone. Finally, an increasing-exclusive search approach is used to redo route discovery by a progressive increasing search angle basis when route discovery failed. This progressive increased request zone and exclusive search method is helpful to reduce routing overhead. It guarantees that the areas of route rediscovery will never exceed twice the entire network. Simulation results show that LARDAR has lower routing cost and collision than other protocols.", "paper_title": "Location-aware routing protocol with dynamic adaptation of request zone for mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256011800004"}
