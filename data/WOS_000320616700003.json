Drastic illumination changes and the scarceness of suitable landmarks are the main difficulties. This paper attempts to surmount them by deviating from the main trend of using local features. Instead, a global descriptor called landmark-view is defined, which aggregates the most visually-salient landmarks present in each scene. Thus, landmark co-occurrence and spatial and saliency relationships between them are added to the single landmark characterization, based on saliency and color distribution. A suitable framework to compare landmark-views is developed, and it is shown how this remarkably enhances the recognition performance, compared against single landmark recognition. A view-matching model is constructed using logistic regression. Experimentation using 45 views, acquired outdoors, containing 273 landmarks, yielded good recognition results. The overall percentage of correct view classification obtained was 80.6%, indicating the adequacy of the approach.", "paper_title": "OUTDOOR VIEW RECOGNITION BASED ON LANDMARK GROUPING AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000320616700003"}
