Including the Farinelli-Tibiletti ratio and few other indexes recently proposed by the literature, the class of one-sided variability measures achieves the goal. We investigate the forecasting ability of eleven alternatives ratios in portfolio optimization problems. We employ data from security markets to quantify the portfolio's overperformance with respect to a given benchmark.", "paper_title": "Computational asset allocation using one-sided and two-sided variability measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500048"}
