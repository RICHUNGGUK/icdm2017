However, the temporal characteristics of such reasoning remain unclear. In our present study, we have used ERP (Event-related Potential) to further study human inductive reasoning involving sentential tasks. For congruent induction tasks, in which premises and conclusions are related, participants need to synthesize semantic information from the premises, conclusions, as well as background knowledge, while for incongruent induction tasks ( baseline), in which premises and conclusions are unrelated, participants can respond \"no\" immediately. Behavioral data have been obtained that is consistent with expectations. ERPs imply that participants may integrate semantic information within the time window of 350-650 ms. Statistical analysis in the frequency domain has revealed a significant increase in the power of the gamma band (30-50 Hz) for congruent induction tasks in contrast to incongruent induction tasks.
