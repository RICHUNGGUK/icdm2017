Here, we extend these statistics to the simultaneous comparison of more than two sequences. Our suite of statistics contains, first, C-l* and C-l(S), extensions of statistics for pairwise comparison of the joint k-tuple content of all the sequences, and second, (C-2*) over bar, <(C-2(S))over bar> and <(C-2(geo))over bar>, averages of sums of pairwise comparison statistics. The two tasks we consider are, first, to identify sequences that are similar to a set of target sequences, and, second, to measure the similarity within a set of sequences. Results: Our investigation uses both simulated data as well as cis-regulatory module data where the task is to identify cis-regulatory modules with similar transcription factor binding sites. We find that although for real data, all of our statistics show a similar performance, on simulated data the Shepp-type statistics are in some instances outperformed by star-type statistics. The multiple alignment-free statistics are more sensitive to contamination in the data than the pairwise average statistics.", "paper_title": "Multiple alignment-free sequence comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000325997500004"}
