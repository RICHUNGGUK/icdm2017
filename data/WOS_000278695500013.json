With this scientific benchmarking system, the quality of a researcher's papers could be easily located in a percentile scale in corresponding field within certain groups. Several factors, including total number of papers, order of authors, impact of journals, citation count, h-index, e-index, a-index, m-quotient, etc., were also utilized for both quantity and quality analysis. Furthermore, the novel proposed weighted citation analysis was introduced to judge a researcher's contribution to his/her research outcomes. The convenient application and comprehensive evaluation property of this assessment system was thoroughly discussed via a given example.", "paper_title": "Establishment of paper assessment system based on academic disciplinary benchmarks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278695500013"}
