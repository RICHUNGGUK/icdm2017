Painters and cartographers have developed techniques to create such artistic landscapes for centuries, but the process remains difficult and time-consuming. In this work, we derive principles and heuristics for panorama map creation of mountainous terrain from a perceptual and artistic analysis of two panorama maps of Yellowstone National Park. We then present methods to automatically produce landscape renderings in the visual style of the panorama map. Our algorithms rely on United States Geological Survey (USGS) terrain and classification data. Our surface textures are generated using perceptual metrics and artistic considerations, and use the structural information present in the terrain to guide the automatic placement of image space strokes for natural surfaces such as forests, cliffs, snow, and water.", "paper_title": "Artistic Rendering of Mountainous Terrain", "paper_id": "WOS:000270752100004"}
