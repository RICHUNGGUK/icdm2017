This paper studies the geometry of its boundary partial derivative P(d)(K). We show that when K = R(n) and d is even, its boundary partial derivative P(d)(K) lies on the irreducible hypersurface defined by the discriminant A(f) off. We show that when K = {x is an element of R(n) : g(1)(x) = ... = g(m)(x) = 0} is a real algebraic variety, partial derivative P(d) (K) lies on the hypersurface defined by the discriminant Delta(f, g(1), ... ,g(m)) off, g(1), ... ,g(m). We show that when K is a general semialgebraic set, partial derivative P(d)(K) lies on a union of hypersurfaces defined by the discriminantal equations. Explicit formulae for the degrees of these hypersurfaces and discriminants are given. We also prove that typically P(d) (K) does not have a barrier of type - log phi(f) when phi(f) is required to be a polynomial, but such a barrier exists if phi(f) is allowed to be semialgebraic. Some illustrating examples are shown. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Discriminants and nonnegative polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000298620700004"}
