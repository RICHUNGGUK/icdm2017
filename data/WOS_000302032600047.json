Multi-criteria decision approaches are often used for the management of conflicting perspectives. In life cycle approaches, uncertainties are unavoidable and a decision making approach dealing with life-cycle based criteria cannot disregard the uncertainties associated with the evaluation of criteria. It is the purpose of this paper to introduce a decision-making approach, based on PROMETHEE and AHP, to address both of these important issues. Moreover, the proposed approach aims to address two other types of uncertainties, inherent to the use of PROMETHEE and AHP, which arise from the selection of the generalized criterion functions and the selection of preference values, respectively. The proposed approach enhances the robustness of the decision-making approach and enables decisions to be made on a more reliable base. The approach is applied to a case study: the comparative assessment of alternatives bridges taking into account environmental, economical and social criteria evaluated over the complete life-cycle of the bridges.
