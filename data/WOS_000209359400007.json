The article extends our previous work (Mastrogiovanni et al. (2010) International Journal of Machine Consciousness, 3, 91-114) by solving problems making the previous approach hard to apply in real-world scenarios. The proposed solution is based on two conjectures on the way the cognitive capabilities of living beings have evolved, and purposely ignores the human-level skills required for solving complex puzzles. In this spirit, we take inspiration from ethology to introduce a new puzzle, henceforth referred to as the 'The gourd, the monkey, and the rice': then, we argue that our planning approach fails to solve the puzzle as well as the real monkeys fail to solve it, and we suggest a biologically plausible explanation for the reason why this happens.
