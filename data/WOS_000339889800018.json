In this paper we present a study for the generation of multi-view synthetic content, studying several camera setups (planar, cylindrical and hyperbolic) and their configurations. We discuss the different effects obtained varying the parameters of these setups. A study with several users was made to analyze visual perceptions, asking them for their optimal visualization. To create the virtual content, a multi-view system has been integrated in a powerful game engine, which allows us to use the latest graphics hardware advances. This integration is detailed and several demos and videos are attached with this paper, which represent a virtual world for auto-stereoscopic displays and the same scenario in a two-view anaglyph representation for being visualized in any conventional display. In all these demos, the parameters studied can be modified offering the possibility of easily appreciate their effects in a virtual scene.", "paper_title": "Synthetic content generation for auto-stereoscopic displays", "paper_id": "WOS:000339889800018"}
