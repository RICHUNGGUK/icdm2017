In this paper, we demonstrate that MPR selection is an application of Set Covering Problem (SCP). A few optimization methods are developed in this work to find the optimum solution including Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu Search (TS), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and a new greedy algorithm. Extensive simulations are set up to evaluate the developed methods. The new algorithm is named Energy eFficient MPR or EF-MPR in short. The simulation results show that EF-MPR can reduce the number of MPR nodes up to 19%. Moreover, EF-MPR algorithm reduces the power-consumption of network up to 12% and speed up the propagation time by 9%.", "paper_title": "EF-MPR, a new energy eFficient multi-point relay selection algorithm for MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000298297000009"}
