In this paper, the region of nucleus is extracted from an image of uterine cervical cytodiagnosis using the HSI model. The characteristics of the nucleus are extracted from the analysis of morphemetric features, densitometric features, colorimetric features, and textural features based on the detected region of nucleus area. The classification criterion of a nucleus is defined according to the standard categories of the Bethesda system. The fuzzy ART algorithm is used to the extracted nucleus and the results show that the proposed method is efficient in nucleus recognition and uterine cervical Pap-Smears extraction.", "paper_title": "Nucleus classification and recognition of uterine cervical pap-smears using fuzzy ART algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300071"}
