A back/forward sweep neural network (BFNN) algorithm is put forward based on numbering all nodes using breadth first search plan. All neurons use the same excitation function. The BFNN has a clear structure with a high approximation speed and high precision. Each neuron acts as the threshold to its adjacent neuron in front. In BFNN method weights adjusting means voltage adjusting, hence, when the learning process according to BP algorithm ended, the desired voltages are acquired. And then the power flow can be derived. In this paper the convergence of BFNN has also been validated. The proposed BFNN algorithm is proved to have a better approximation effect than using conditional back/forward method by computing power flow in Tongliao 16-bus distribution system in Inner Mongolia.
