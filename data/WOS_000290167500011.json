However, due to the diffusive nature of light propagation, the problem is severely ill-conditioned and highly nonlinear. Even though nonlinear iterative methods have been commonly used, they are computationally expensive especially for three dimensional imaging geometry. Recently, compressed sensing theory has provided a systematic understanding of high resolution reconstruction of sparse objects in many imaging problems; hence, the goal of this paper is to extend the theory to the diffuse optical tomography problem. The main contributions of this paper are to formulate the imaging problem as a joint sparse recovery problem in a compressive sensing framework and to propose a novel noniterative and exact inversion algorithm that achieves the l(0) optimality as the rank of measurement increases to the unknown sparsity level. The algorithm is based on the recently discovered generalized MUSIC criterion, which exploits the advantages of both compressive sensing and array signal processing. A theoretical criterion for optimizing the imaging geometry is provided, and simulation results confirm that the new algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms and reliably reconstructs the optical inhomogeneities when we assume that the optical background is known to a reasonable accuracy.", "paper_title": "Compressive Diffuse Optical Tomography: Noniterative Exact Reconstruction Using Joint Sparsity", "paper_id": "WOS:000290167500011"}
