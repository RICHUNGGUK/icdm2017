Both preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance are considered in this article. By probability argument, the system is described as an abstract Cauchy problem. Using the method of strong continuous semi-group theory, we derive the steady availability of the system. Finally, the optimal time to carry out preventive maintenance is analysed theoretically and numerical examples are presented.", "paper_title": "Availability optimisation of repairable system with preventive maintenance policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000254949400007"}
