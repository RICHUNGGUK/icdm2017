The prior knowledge carries information about the data distribution patterns that reflect different concepts, which may occur in the data stream. The presented method serves as a temporary solution for a classification system after a virtual concept drift and also provides additional information about the concept data distribution for adapting the classification model. Presented detector uses a developed method called simulated recurrence and detector ensembles based on statistical tests. Evaluation is performed on benchmark datasets.", "paper_title": "Concept Drift Detection and Model Selection with Simulated Recurrence and Ensembles of Statistical Detectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000322549500002"}
