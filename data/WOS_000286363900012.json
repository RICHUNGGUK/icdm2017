Phoebus has the ability to dynamically allocate network resources and to use segment-specific transport protocols between gateways, as well as to apply other performance-improving techniques on behalf of the user. We have developed interfaces to Phoebus to allow its use in various real applications and data movement services. This paper extends our earlier work with tests of Phoebus-enabled applications on both real-world networks as well as over configurable network testbeds that allow us to modify latency and loss rates. We demonstrate that Phoebus improves the performance of bulk data transfer in a variety of network configurations and conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
