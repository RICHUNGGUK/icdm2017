In this work, we intensively analyze the characteristics of temporal data dissemination in VCPS. On this basis, we formulate the static and dynamic snapshot consistency requirements on serving real-time requests for temporal data items. Two online algorithms are proposed to enhance the system performance with different requirements. In particular, a reschedule mechanism is developed to make the scheduling adaptable to the dynamic snapshot consistency requirement. A comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Scheduling Temporal Data with Dynamic Snapshot Consistency Requirement in Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000346416300019"}
