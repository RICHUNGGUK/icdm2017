Based on the results obtained from our system we argue that searching for music by tapping the rhythm of a song's melody is intuitive and effective. In this paper we describe two novel algorithms to analyze tapping input. We present results indicating good accuracy rates among a broad spectrum of both trained and untrained users. Query by tapping has an important potential as a form of human-computer communication. We indicate how our algorithms to analyze tapping might be used in other areas such as music education and user authentication.", "paper_title": "Online music search by tapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000240189200009"}
