Design/methodology/approach - Usually, not all parts of a medical image have equal significance. Also, an images background can be combined with noise. This method separates a part of the video which is moving from a part that is stationary. Findings - This process results in the high-quality compression of medical frames. Originality/value - Separating parts of a frame using 2D and 3D wavelet transform maker a valuable contribution to biocybernetics.", "paper_title": "Application of wavelet transform analysis in medical frames compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029100026"}
