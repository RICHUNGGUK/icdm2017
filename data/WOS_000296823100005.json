Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to collect data from 235 managers or owners of manufacturing SMEs in Iran. The data were analyzed by employing factorial analysis and relevant hypotheses were derived and tested by multiple and logistic regression analysis. Findings - EC adoption within SMEs is affected by perceived relative advantage, perceived compatibility, CEO's innovativeness, information intensity, buyer/supplier pressure, support from technology vendors, and competition. Similarly, description on determinants of adoption and non-adoption of different EC applications has been provided. Research limitations/implications - Cross-sectional data of this research tend to have certain limitations when it comes to explaining the direction of causality of the relationships among the variables, which will change overtime. Practical implications - The findings offer valuable insights to managers, IS experts, and policy makers responsible for assisting SMEs with entering into the e-marketplace. Vendors should collaborate with SMEs to enhance the compatibility of EC applications with these businesses. To enhance the receptiveness of EC applications, CEOs, innovativeness and perception toward EC advantages should also be aggrandized. Originality/value - This study is perhaps one of the first to use a wide range of variables in the light of TOE framework to comprehensively assess EC adoption behavior, both in terms of initial and post-adoption within SMEs in developing countries, as well adoption and non-adoption of simple and advanced EC applications such as electronic supply chain management systems.", "paper_title": "Adoption of e-commerce applications in SMEs", "paper_id": "WOS:000296823100005"}
