We assume some TDMA protocol provides a background of synchronized time slots and seek to schedule the routes' links to maximize the number of packets that get delivered to their destinations per time slot. Our approach is to construct an undirected graph G and to heuristically obtain node multicolorings for G that can be turned into efficient link schedules. In G each node represents a link to be scheduled and the edges are set up to represent every possible interference for any given set of interference assumptions. We present two multicoloring-based heuristics and study their performance through extensive simulations. One of the two heuristics is based on relaxing the notion of a node multicoloring by dynamically exploiting the availability of communication opportunities that would otherwise be wasted. We have found that, as a consequence, its performance is significantly superior to the other's. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
