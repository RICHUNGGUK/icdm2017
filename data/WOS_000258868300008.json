While it is important to continue pursuing novel algorithms and protocols to squeeze the most out of the existing design space (sensor nodes), it is equally important to explore a new design paradigm for future sensor networks to reduce the complexity burden on sensor nodes. We propose to exploit capabilities at the network edge (i.e., an edge-based approach). We overview existing approaches to this end and present a novel edge-based routing protocol, called BeamStar, as a case study. We show that exploiting edge capability provides a new dimension of freedom for wireless sensor networking, and is effective in relieving the processing, communication, and storage requirements of sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "Exploiting edge capability for wireless sensor networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000258868300008"}
