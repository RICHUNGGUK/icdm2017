We show that the state complexity of a combined operation can be very different from the composition of the state complexities of the participating individual operations. However, the estimate through individual nondeterministic state complexities for each of the combined operations being considered is very similar to the actual state complexity. Several open problems related to state complexity are also proposed.", "paper_title": "On the state complexity of combined operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240312700003"}
