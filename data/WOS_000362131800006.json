The decision version of this optimization problem is known to be NP-complete even for unweighted graphs and has been studied extensively. We investigate the complexity of the decision CD problem for the family of chordal graphs, showing that it is NP-complete for weighted split graphs, weighted interval graphs and unweighted chordal graphs. We also prove that the problem is NP-complete for weighted cographs. Some polynomial-time solvable cases of the optimization problem are also identified, in particular CD for unweighted split graphs, unweighted proper interval graphs and weighted block graphs.
