The proposed method tries to analyze the errors made by a chunker and formulates an evaluation strategy that brings out the strength and weakness of a chunker in a better way than the existing precision, recall and F score based methods or their variants do. A tree-matching based algorithm of linear time complexity is designed, analyzed, and illustrated by giving examples. Correctness of the algorithm is checked by using a chunker and a set of test sentences.", "paper_title": "A novel method for performance evaluation of text chunking", "paper_id": "WOS:000349889400008"}
