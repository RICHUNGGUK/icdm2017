The robotic skin is a device composed of a network of tactile sensors, whose wiring can be very complex: the control of this complexity is a key problem. In the considered robotic skin, skin elements are grouped into skin patches, which output tactile data that have to be read by a micro-controller. The logical connections between the sensors must be defined in order to route signals through the network. A finite set of micro-controllers is given and a set of constraints is imposed on the given assignment and routing. The considered problem has a combinatorial nature and it can be formulated as a Minimum Constrained Spanning Forest problem with costs on arcs that cannot be a priori defined as they are solution-dependent. The problem is NP-hard. The paper introduces a mathematical formulation and then proposes a Multi-Start Heuristic algorithm and an Ant Colony Optimization approach whose effectiveness is evaluated through experimental tests performed on both real and synthetically generated instances.
