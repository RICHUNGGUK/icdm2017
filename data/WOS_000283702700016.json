The same diffusion process when being imitated by intention is called viral marketing. This process can be modeled by a (directed) graph G = (V, E) with a threshold t(v) for every vertex v is an element of V. where v becomes active once at least t(v) of its (in-)neighbors are already active. A Perfect Target Set is a set of vertices whose activation will eventually activate the entire graph, and the Perfect Target Set Selection Problem (PTSS) asks for the minimum such initial set. It is known (Chen (2008) [6]) that PTSS is hard to approximate, even for some special cases such as bounded-degree graphs, or majority thresholds. We propose a combinatorial model for this dynamic activation process, and use it to represent PTSS and its variants by linear integer programs. This allows one to use standard integer programming solvers for solving small-size PTSS instances. We also show combinatorial lower and upper bounds on the size of the minimum Perfect Target Set. Our upper bound implies that there are always Perfect Target Sets of size at most vertical bar V vertical bar/2 and 2 vertical bar V vertical bar/3 under majority and strict majority thresholds, respectively, both in directed and undirected graphs. This improves the bounds of 0.727 vertical bar V vertical bar and 0.7732 vertical bar V vertical bar found recently by Chang and Lyuu (2010) [5] for majority and strict majority thresholds in directed graphs, and matches their bound under majority thresholds in undirected graphs. Furthermore, our proof is much simpler, and we observe that some of these bounds are tight. One interesting and perhaps surprising implication of our lower bound for undirected graphs, is that it is easy to get a constant factor approximation for PTSS for \"relatively balanced\" graphs (e.g., bounded-degree graphs, nearly regular graphs) with a \"more than majority\" threshold (that is, t(v) = v . deg(v), for every v is an element of V and some constant v > 1/2), whereas no polylogarithmic approximation exists for \"more than majority\" graphs.
