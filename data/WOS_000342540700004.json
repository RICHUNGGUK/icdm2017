Day and Tripathi proved that A(n,k) is pancyclic for n - k >= 2. In this paper, we improve this result, and we demonstrate that A(n,k) is also pancyclic even if it has no more than (k(n-k) - 2) faulty edges for n - k >= 2. Our result is optimal concerning the edge fault-tolerance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
