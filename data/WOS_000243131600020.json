In this paper we present a link-based importance model and efficient algorithms for distributed services collaborating through service calls. We adapt the PageRank algorithm and define a service importance that reflects its activity and its contribution to the quality of other services.", "paper_title": "A link-based ranking model for services", "paper_id": "WOS:000243131600020"}
