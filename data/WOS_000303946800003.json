The subword complexity function of a partial word w over a finite alphabet A assigns to each positive integer, n, the number, p(w)(n), of distinct full words over A that are compatible with factors of length n of w. In this paper, with the help of our so-called hole functions, we construct infinite partial words w such that p(w)(n) = Theta(n(alpha)) for any real number alpha > 1. In addition, these partial words have the property that there exist infinitely many non-negative integers m satisfying p(w)(m + 1) - p(w)(m) >= m(alpha). Combining these results with earlier ones on full words, we show that this represents a class of subword complexity functions not achievable by full words. We also construct infinite partial words with intermediate subword complexity, that is, between polynomial and exponential. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
