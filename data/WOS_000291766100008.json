The architecture is named Distributed Dynamic Quality of Service - DDQoS - and includes models for both the core and the edge of the network. A video quality assessment framework is developed, allowing standard industry metrics like VQM to be used for estimating quality of experience. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
