For each color spanning set, we can construct the convex hull and the smallest axis-aligned enclosing rectangle, etc. Assuming that each point is chosen independently and identically from the subset of points of the same color, we propose an time algorithm to compute the expected area of convex hulls of the color spanning sets and an time algorithm to compute the expected perimeter of convex hulls of the color spanning sets. For the expected perimeter (resp. area) of the smallest perimeter (resp. area) axis-aligned enclosing rectangles of the color spanning sets, we present an (resp. ) time algorithm. We also propose a simple approximation algorithm to compute the expected diameter of the color spanning sets. For the expected distance of the closest pair, we show that it is P-complete to compute and there exists no polynomial time approximation algorithm to compute the probability that the closest pair distance of all color spanning sets equals to a given value unless , even in one dimension and when each color paints two points.", "paper_title": "Expected computations on color spanning sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000350685800005"}
