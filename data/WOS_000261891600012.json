Our algorithm is based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, and our scheme returns an approximate solution, for which the size of error satisfies a given error rate. We propose two Markov chains: one is for approximate sampling, and the other is for perfect sampling based on the monotone coupling from the past algorithm.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM AND PERFECT SAMPLER FOR CLOSED JACKSON NETWORKS WITH SINGLE SERVERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261891600012"}
