We propose autonomous scene scanning by a robot to relieve humans from such a laborious task. In an autonomous setting, detailed scene acquisition is inevitably coupled with scene analysis at the required level of detail. We develop a framework for object-level scene reconstruction coupled with object-centric scene analysis. As a result, the autoscanning and reconstruction will be object-aware, guided by the object analysis. The analysis is, in turn, gradually improved with progressively increased object-wise data fidelity. In realizing such a framework, we drive the robot to execute an iterative analyze-and-validate algorithm which interleaves between object analysis and guided validations. The object analysis incorporates online learning into a robust graph-cut based segmentation framework, achieving a global update of object-level segmentation based on the knowledge gained from robot-operated local validation. Based on the current analysis, the robot performs proactive validation over the scene with physical push and scan refinement, aiming at reducing the uncertainty of both object-level segmentation and object-wise reconstruction. We propose a joint entropy to measure such uncertainty based on segmentation confidence and reconstruction quality, and formulate the selection of validation actions as a maximum information gain problem. The output of our system is a reconstructed scene with both object extraction and object-wise geometry fidelity.", "paper_title": "Autoscanning for Coupled Scene Reconstruction and Proactive Object Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200014"}
