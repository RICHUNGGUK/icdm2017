IDS, as a pattern-based processing unit, extracts useful information from a system that is subjected to modeling. In spite of its excellent potential to solve problems such as classification and modeling compared with other soft-computing tools, finding its simple and fast hardware implementation is still a challenge. This paper describes a new hardware implementation of the IDS method that is based on the memristor crossbar structure. In addition to simplicity, being completely real time, having low latency, and the ability to continue working properly after the occurrence of power failure are some of the advantages of our proposed circuit. Moreover, some of operations in the IDS method have fuzzy nature, and as we will show at the end of this paper, updation of rules in the IDS structure and spiky neural networks are very similar. Therefore, IDS can be considered as a new fuzzy implementation of artificial spiky neural networks as well.", "paper_title": "Memristor Crossbar-Based Hardware Implementation of the IDS Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000297586000008"}
