To this end, we propose an intelligent agent system with a problem solving capability to address the issue of fault inference in sensor network environments. The intelligent agent system is designed and implemented at base-station side. The core of the agent system - problem solver - implements a fault-detection inference engine which harnesses Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate fault probabilities of sensor nodes. To validate the correctness and effectiveness of the intelligent agent system, a set of experiments in a wireless sensor testbed are conducted. The experimental results show that our intelligent agent system is able to precisely estimate the fault probability of sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "Fault reconnaissance agent for sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283813500002"}
