With the increasing scale of system, the number of service rules has significantly increased, which makes traditional centralized control mode fail to keep up with demands. For a distributed WSAN-based smart building system, we design a distributed rule system, in which services are stored and executed by rules in order to avoid system failure caused by server failure or network interruption. For the proposed distributed rule system, we firstly present a minimal set-based rule dissemination algorithm to enhance system reliability by solving the problem of storage and management in a distributed rule system. Secondly, we propose a lightweight rule verification algorithm to verify the consistency of rules, including the detection of the anomaly and conflict. In this way, we can avoid disordered expansion and content inconsistency of rule database. What's more, we also design an efficient rule engine subsystem, in which optimization approaches have been embedded in the components of rule compiling, event filtering and rule matching. Finally, we implement a distributed rule system in a practical smart building system. The experimental results show that the distributed rule system can reduce communication overhead and perform efficiently and flexibly with high event throughput in a lightweight way.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Rule System for Smart Building", "paper_id": "WOS:000364500200001"}
