Since the operation of regular fuzzy neural networks is based on Zadeh's extension principle, we first present a level characterization of the Zadeh's extensions of level-continuous fuzzy-valued functions and consider the continuity of these extensions. On the basis of this, we give characterizations of fuzzy functions which can be approximated by a class of four-layer regular fuzzy neural networks according to supremum-metric and level convergence.
