The IC calculates the bearing angle of a sound source with a mean variance of one degree in a 360 degrees range using four microphones: one pair is used to produce the indication and the other to define the quadrant. An adaptive algorithm decides which pair to use depending on the direction of the incoming signal, in such a way to obtain the best estimate. The IC contains two blocks with 104 stages each. Every stage has a delay unit, a block to reduce the clock speed, and a 10-bit UP/DN counter. The IC measures 2 mm by 2.4 mm, and dissipates 600 mu W at 3.3 V and 200 kHz. It is purely digital and uses a one-bit quantization of the input signals.", "paper_title": "A low-power correlation-derivative CMOS VLSI circuit for bearing estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236131600011"}
