This paper presents an adaptive optimization algorithm in EDCA which strives to provide improved QoS from both delay and throughput perspectives. As a first step towards this goal, a Markov model of the EDCA mechanism has been introduced, which is subsequently used to compute the estimates of throughput and delay. Based on the analytical model that is validated via real-time simulations in OPNET, a new algorithm is proposed that maximizes throughput while decreasing delay and minimizing collision probability for a higher access category.", "paper_title": "Adaptive optimization of EDCA parameters for improved QoS in multimedia applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000322741500012"}
