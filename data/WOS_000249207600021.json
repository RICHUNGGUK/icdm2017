Our techniques combine principles of human visual perception with approaches developed by traditional artists. For our depth manipulation technique, the user loads an image, selects an object and specifies whether the object should appear closer or further away. The system automatically determines luminance or color temperature target values for the object and/or background that achieve the desired depth change. Our approach for creating the illusion of motion exploits the differences between our peripheral vision and our foveal vision by introducing spatial imprecision to the image.", "paper_title": "Perceptually meaningful image editing - Manipulating perceived depth and creating the illusion of motion in 2D images", "paper_id": "WOS:000249207600021"}
