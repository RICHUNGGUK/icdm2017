The jumping varies from regular to chaotic as the model parameters are modified. The resulting irregular behavior, which mimics the state of attention in which a system shows a great adaptability to changing stimulus, is a consequence in the model of short-time presynaptic noise which induces synaptic depression. We discuss results from both a mean-field analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
