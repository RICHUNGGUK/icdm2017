We focus on the model of learning with queries, and study restrictions of the class of unate k-quasi-Horn formulas. This class is known to be learnable with equivalence and membership queries. We prove that any subclass of unate k-quasi-Horn formulas can be properly learned with both types of queries, provided the set of consequents that appear in formulas can be computed efficiently in advance.", "paper_title": "Learning with Queries inside the Class of Unate k-quasi-Horn Formulas", "paper_id": "WOS:000352802100002"}
