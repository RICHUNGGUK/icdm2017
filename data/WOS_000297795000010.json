If the collected data from a process include vagueness due to human subjectively or measurement system, fuzzy control charts are available tools for monitoring and evaluating the process. The main contribution of fuzzy control charts is to provide flexibility to the control limits. When sample mean is too close to the control limits and the used measurement system is not so sensitive, the decision may be faulty. In this paper, the fuzzy standard deviation is firstly introduced to obtain fuzzy (X) over bar over tilde and (S) over tilde control charts and then these fuzzy control charts are employed in food industry to monitor if the processes are under control or not. Additionally, the fuzzy (X) over bar over tilde and (S) over tilde control charts are developed for the case that the population parameters (mu and sigma) are known.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the Packing Process in Food Industry Using Fuzzy (X)over-bar-over tilde and (S)over-tilde Control Charts", "paper_id": "WOS:000297795000010"}
