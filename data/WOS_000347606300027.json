The online exams have been used in three different situations: in an evaluation-proctored exam, in an evaluation-unproctored exam and as a training-homework task. The analysis shows that the students' online mark clearly depends on the way the online exam was performed. It has also been proved that the weight of the online exams in the final mark does not affect the results of the online exams, and that the results obtained in the unproctored environment present a bias towards higher ratings, as well as a greater dispersion of results regarding the case of proctored environment.
