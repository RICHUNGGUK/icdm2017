The two formulas for calculating the predictive squared correlation coefficient Q(2) previously discussed by Schuurmann et al. ire one that adopted by the current OECD guidelines about QSAR validation and based on SS (sum of squares) of the external test set referring to the training set response mean and the other based on SS of the external test set referring to the test set response mean. In addition to these two formulas, another formula is evaluated here, based on SS referring to mean deviations of observed values from the training set mean over the training set instead of the external evaluation set.", "paper_title": "Comments on the Definition of the Q(2) Parameter for QSAR Validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000268138900006"}
