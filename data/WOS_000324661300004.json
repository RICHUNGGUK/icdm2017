In this paper, we explore the content from three media types (image, text, audio) and propose a novel multi-view semi-supervised movie recommendation method, which represents each media type as a view space for movies. The three views of movies are integrated to predict the rating values under the multi-view framework. Furthermore, our method considers the casual users who rate limited movies. The algorithm enriches the user profile with a semi-supervised way when there are only few rating histories. Experiments indicate that the multimedia content analysis reveals the user's profile in a more comprehensive way. Different media types can be a complement to each other for movie recommendation. And the experimental results validate that our semi-supervised method can effectively enrich the user profile for recommendation with limited rating history.", "paper_title": "A Novel Approach Based on Multi-View Content Analysis and Semi-Supervised Enrichment for Movie Recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000324661300004"}
