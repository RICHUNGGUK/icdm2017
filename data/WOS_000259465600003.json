For a given control mesh of a CCSS, by pushing the control points to their limit positions, another linear approximation-a limit mesh of the CCSS is obtained. In general a limit mesh might approximate a CCSS better than the corresponding control mesh. We derive a bound on the distance between a CCSS patch and its limit face in terms of the maximum norm of the second order differences of the control points and a constant that depends only on the valence of the patch. A Subdivision depth estimation formula for the limit mesh approximation is also proposed. For a given error tolerance, fewer Subdivision steps are needed if the refined control mesh is replaced with the corresponding limit mesh. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
