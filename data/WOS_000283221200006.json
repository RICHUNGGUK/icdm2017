This network is called the multiresource multistate information network (MMIN). The one-to-many-targets (i.e. one-to-all-target-subset) reliability problem of the MMIN is considered next under limited cost and capacity constraints. A straightforward, exact algorithm derived from the universal generating function method (UGFM) is developed for this new problem. The correctness and computational complexity of the proposed UGFM will be analysed and proven. One example is given to illustrate how MMIN reliability is evaluated using the proposed UGFM.", "paper_title": "A New Universal Generating Function Method for Estimating the Novel Multiresource Multistate Information Network Reliability", "paper_id": "WOS:000283221200006"}
