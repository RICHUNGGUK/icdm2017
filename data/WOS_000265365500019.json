During this period, many different problems related to palmprint recognition have been addressed. This paper provides an overview of current palmprint research, describing in particular capture devices, preprocessing, verification algorithms, palmprint-related fusion, algorithms especially designed for real-time palmprint identification in large databases and measures for protecting palmprint systems and users' privacy. Finally, some suggestion is offered. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A survey of palmprint recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000265365500019"}
