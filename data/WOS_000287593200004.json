Two credibility-based minimax mean-variance models are proposed. The crisp equivalents of the models to linear programming ones are given in three special cases. In addition, a general solution algorithm is also provided. To help understand the modeling idea and to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, one example is presented.", "paper_title": "Minimax mean-variance models for fuzzy portfolio selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000287593200004"}
