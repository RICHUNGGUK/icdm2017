The Viola-Jones algorithm is an attractive means of meeting the real time requirement, and has been widely implemented on custom hardware, FPGAs and GPUs. We demonstrate a GPU implementation that achieves competitive performance, but with low development costs. Our solution treats the irregularity inherent to the algorithm using a novel dynamic warp scheduling approach that eliminates thread divergence. This new scheme also employs a thread pool mechanism, which significantly alleviates the cost of creating, switching, and terminating threads. Compared to static thread scheduling, our dynamic warp scheduling approach reduces the execution time by a factor of 3. To maximize detection throughput, we also run on multiple GPUs, realizing 95.6 FPS on 5 Fermi CPUs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
