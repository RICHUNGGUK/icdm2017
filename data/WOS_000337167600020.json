As the huge execution time of SPICE-based transistor-level Monte Carlo analysis is impractical for complex designs, there is a need for making accurate Monte Carlo analysis feasible through fast logic-level simulators. This paper presents a new, general logic model of digital CMOS cells featuring technology variation aware timing, and its prototype implementation in a standard hardware-description-language environment. The application of the approach to typical standard cells and test circuits shows very good agreement with SPICE BSIM4 transistor-level simulation both for nominal delay and for statistical Monte Carlo analyses.", "paper_title": "Logic Drivers: A Propagation Delay Modeling Paradigm for Statistical Simulation of Standard Cell Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000337167600020"}
