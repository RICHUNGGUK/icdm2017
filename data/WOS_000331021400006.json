This paper derives the eigenvalue and eigenvector derivatives of a structure based on a dynamic condensation technique. The eigensensitivity of a structure are computed by iteratively updating the derivatives of the condensed system matrices and a transformation matrix. As the condensed model is much smaller than the original full model, the proposed method is quite efficient in the calculation of the eigensensitivity. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by the GARTEUR structure and a cantilever plate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
