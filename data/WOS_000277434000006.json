The main system for consciousness (thalamocortical reverberation circuit) generates whole brain electromagnetic frequencies permanently (1-30 Hz = EEG activity). But we choose a specific frequency band, e.g. SMR (Sensory Motor Rhythm = 13-18 Hz) and these SMR episodes are rewarded by success in a simultaneously watched TV game. SMR is then repeated still more often and brings into electrogenesis and into psyche tendency its own property, which is motor inhibition and increasing attention. This is the aim of the therapeutical learning process.", "paper_title": "BIOFEEDBACK AND BRAIN ACTIVITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000277434000006"}
