Chemical decay or adsorption-like reaction inside the liquid phase is considered. Bessel function expansion is used to solve the second order PDE model with different initial conditions, corresponding to usual experimental practices. Cylindrical geometry is considered since large columns could be adopted to investigate both anisotropic dispersion and adsorption/desorption kinetic mechanisms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
