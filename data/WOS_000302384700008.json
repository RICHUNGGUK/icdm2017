The goal is to compute the charge-control and capacitance-voltage characteristics of quantum wire transistors. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a numerical formulation employing a non-uniform finite difference discretization scheme, in which the wavefunctions and electronic energy levels are obtained by solving the Schrodinger equation through the split-operator method while a relaxation method in the FTCS scheme (\"Forward Time Centered Space\") is used to solve the two-dimensional Poisson equation. Findings - The numerical model is validated by taking previously published results as a benchmark and then applying them to yield the charge-control characteristics and the capacitance-voltage relationship for a split-gate quantum wire device. Originality/value - The paper helps to fulfill the need for C-V models of quantum wire device. To do so, the authors implemented a straightforward calculation method for the two-dimensional electronic carrier density n(x,y). The formulation reduces the computational procedure to a much simpler problem, similar to the one-dimensional quantization case, significantly diminishing running time.", "paper_title": "A novel self consistent calculation approach for the capacitance-voltage characteristics of semiconductor quantum wire transistors based on a split-gate configuration", "paper_id": "WOS:000302384700008"}
