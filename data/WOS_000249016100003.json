A declarative, executable specification language for dynamics within an organisation is proposed as a basis for simulation. Moreover, to be able to specify and analyse dynamic properties within an organisation, another declarative specification language is put forward, which is much more expressive than the executable language for simulations. Supporting tools have been implemented that consist of a software environment for simulation of organisation models and a software environment for analysis of dynamic properties against traces of dynamics within an organisation.", "paper_title": "Specification, analysis and simulation of the dynamics within an organisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000249016100003"}
