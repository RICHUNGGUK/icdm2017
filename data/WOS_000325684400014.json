A discontinuous Lyapunov functional is introduced for the closed-loop systems, which takes full advantage of the sawtooth structure of the time-varying interval delay induced by sample-and-hold and signal transmission. A sufficient condition is proposed to ensure the closed-loop system to be robustly stochastically passive. Then, the problem of robust passive control is solved. Two examples are utilized to illustrate the advantages and effectiveness of the results that are proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Network-Based Robust Passive Control for Fuzzy Systems With Randomly Occurring Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000325684400014"}
