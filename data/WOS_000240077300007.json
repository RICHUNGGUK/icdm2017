An indecomposable graph contains no non-trivial module (modules of cardinality 1 and vertical bar V vertical bar are trivial). We present an algorithm to compute indecomposability preserving elimination sequence, which is faster by a factor of vertical bar V vertical bar compared to the algorithms based on earlier published work. The algorithm is based on a constructive proof of Ille's theorem [9]. The proof uses the properties of X-critical graphs, a generalization of critical indecomposable graphs.", "paper_title": "On indecomposability preserving elimination sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300007"}
