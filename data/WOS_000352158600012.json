The aim of this paper was to study if and how multi-microgrids can contribute to Voltage Control (VC) in medium-voltage distribution grids by means of reactive power generation and/or absorption. The hierarchical control strategy was proposed with the main focus on the tertiary control which was defined as optimal power flow problem. The interior-point algorithm was applied to optimise experimental benchmark grid with the presence of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Moreover, two primary objectives were formulated: active power losses and amount of reactive power used to reach the voltage profile. As a result the active power losses were minimised to the high extent achieving the savings around 22% during entire day.", "paper_title": "Voltage Control of Distribution Grids with Multi-Microgrids Using Reactive Power Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000352158600012"}
