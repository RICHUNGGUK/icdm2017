This study provides empirical evidence on the distinctive influences of information quality on competence-trust, goodwill-trust, exchange-risk and relationship-risk and how these different dimensions influence the intent to use inter-organizational data exchanges. As the performance of a data exchange may vary according to degree of successful completion of a specific transaction on the spot, this study also examines the extent to which expected transaction performance affects the model relationships. A survey is conducted to collect data from 221 business professionals. The study's hypothesized relationships are in general supported by the data and the resulting structural model proved to adequately represent the construct relationships. While these findings contribute to information system design theory, they also benefit professionals by providing insights as to how organizations can deal with the different types of uncertainties related to participating in electronic data exchanges. In addition, these findings help demonstrate the importance of interventions in the design of electronic data exchanges and the benefits expected by enhancing information quality in those settings.
