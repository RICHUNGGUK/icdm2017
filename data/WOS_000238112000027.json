To remove the dependence on the size of time-delays, Lyapunov-Razinnikhin stability theorem and LMI approach are applied to derive the global robust. stability conditions for the neural networks. Then delay-dependent global robust stability criteria are developed based on integrating Lvapunov-Krasovskii functional method and LMI approach. These stability criteria are in term of the solvability of linear matrix inequalities.", "paper_title": "Global robust stability of general recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000027"}
