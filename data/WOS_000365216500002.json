Parameterised Boolean equation systems can be used to solve a variety of problems in verification. We study the capabilities of the abstraction theory by comparing it to an abstraction theory for Generalised Kripke modal Transition Systems (GTSs). We show that for model checking the modal mu-calculus, our abstractions can be exponentially more succinct than GTSs and our theory is as complete as the GTS framework for abstraction. Furthermore, we investigate the completeness of our theory irrespective of the encoded decision problem. We illustrate the potential of our theory through case studies using the first-order modal mu-calculus and a real-time extension thereof, conducted using a prototype implementation of a new syntactic transformation for parameterised Boolean equation systems.", "paper_title": "Abstraction in Fixpoint Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000365216500002"}
