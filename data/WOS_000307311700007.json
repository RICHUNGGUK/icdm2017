With a priori knowledge of JPEG-2000 source coding and channel coding, the proposed joint system integrates authentication into the media error protection components to ensure that every source-decodable media unit is authenticated. By such a dedicated design, the proposed scheme protects both compressed JPEG-2000 codestream and the authentication data from wireless channel impairments. It is fundamentally different from many existing systems that consider the problem of media authentication separately from the other operations in the media transmission system. By utilizing the contextual relationship, such as coding dependency and content importance between media slices for authentication hash appending, the proposed scheme generates an extremely low authentication overhead. Under this joint layered coding framework, an optimal rate allocation algorithm for source coding, channel coding, and media authentication is developed to guarantee end-to-end media quality. Experiment results on JPEG-2000 images validate the proposed scheme and demonstrate that the performance of the proposed scheme is approaching its upper bound, in which case no authentication is applied to the media stream.", "paper_title": "A Joint Layered Scheme for Reliable and Secure Mobile JPEG-2000 Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000307311700007"}
