In this paper, clustering is considered as a cognitive problem, and cognitive features are of vital importance to clustering. In combination with psychological experiment, we propose three cognitive features of clustering and model them as a flexible similarity measurement. Meanwhile a new clustering framework is put forward to integrate the cognitive features by employing the similarity measurement. The two attractive advantages are its low complexity and fitness for various types of data sets, such as data sets of different shapes and densities. Some synthetic and real data sets are employed to exhibit the superiority of the new clustering algorithm.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical clustering driven by cognitive features", "paper_id": "WOS:000332596000009"}
