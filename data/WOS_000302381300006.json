The (k-1)-fault-tolerant diameter of G, denoted by D (k) (G), is defined as D (k) (G)=max {d(G-F)|FaS,V(G) and |F|=k-1}, where G-F denotes the subgraph induced by V(G)-F. The fault-tolerant diameter is one important parameter for measuring the reliability and efficiency of interconnection networks. In this paper, we will give the bounds of fault-tolerant diameter of three family interconnection networks.", "paper_title": "Fault-tolerant diameter for three family interconnection networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000302381300006"}
