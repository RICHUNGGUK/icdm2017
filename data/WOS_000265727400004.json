An improved EM method is presented to model regional color distribution of the target image by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), then, trained by this model, appropriate reference colors are automatically selected from the given source images to color each target region. The generated compelling results prove that our proposed method is applicable to colorize grayscale images and color transfer between chromatic images. A new objective metric considering colorfulness and structural similarity is also proposed to evaluate the quality of the transferred image, which verifies good performance of our method.
