All processes are done in real time. We represent a player with a simplified 3D model consisting of a single plane and a live video texture extracted from multiple cameras. This 3D model is simple enough to be transmitted via a network. A prototype system has been developed and tested at actual soccer stadiums. A 3D video of a typical soccer scene, which includes more than a dozen players, was processed at video rate and transmitted to remote PCs through the internet at 15-24 frames per second.", "paper_title": "Live 3D video in soccer stadium", "paper_id": "WOS:000248574200010"}
