The imaging condition for ship target is very complicated due to the complexity of the ship's movement, and a three-dimensional (3D) rotation occurs for the ship with the oceanic waves. Furthermore, the multi-path effect can not be avoided in most circumstance. In general, the received signal for a 3D rotation ship target can be characterized as multi-component polynomial phase signals (PPS), and the parametric method can be used to obtain the instantaneous ISAR images. In this paper, the received signal is considered as multi-component cubic phase signal, and a new method for ISAR imaging of ship target with 3D rotation by the product high order bilinear matched-phase transform (PHBMT) is proposed. The instantaneous ISAR image is obtained, and the multi-path effect can be eliminated by separating the ISAR image in the range-instantaneous-Doppler domain. Results of real data validate the effectiveness of the new approach presented.", "paper_title": "New approach for ISAR imaging of ship target with 3D rotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000281251300001"}
