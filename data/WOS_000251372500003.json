We present examples in which the Newton iterates satisfy the Wolfe conditions and the Hessian is positive definite at each step and yet the iterates converge to a non-stationary point. These examples answer a question posed by Fletcher in his 1987 book Practical methods of optimization.", "paper_title": "Newton's iterates can converge to non-stationary points", "paper_id": "WOS:000251372500003"}
