In the literature, how to compute the mth order statistics of n correlated random variables is still a problem. This article proposes a recursive algorithm based on statistical min/max operations to compute order statistics for general correlated and not necessarily identically distributed random variables. The algorithm has an O(mn) time complexity and O(m+n) space complexity. A binary tree-based data structure is further developed to allow selective update of the order statistics with O(nm(2)) time. As a vehicle to demonstrate the algorithm, we apply it to the path selection algorithm in at-speed testing. A novel metric multilayer process space coverage metric is proposed to quantitatively gauge the quality of path selection. We then show that such a metric is directly linked to the order statistics, and our recursive algorithm can thus be applied. By employing a branch-and-bound path selection algorithm with these techniques, this article shows that selecting an optimal set of paths for a multimillion-gate design can be performed efficiently. Compared to the state of the art, experimental results show both the efficiency of our algorithms and better quality of our path selection.", "paper_title": "Order Statistics for Correlated Random Variables and Its Application to At-Speed Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000322449700009"}
