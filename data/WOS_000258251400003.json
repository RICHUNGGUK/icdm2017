This paper improves the recently proposed Fixed Hyper-Erlang model (FHE) by introducing an adaptive framework (Adaptive Hyper-Erlang model, AHE) to determine the crucially performance-sensitive model parameters. The adaptive model fits long-tailed traffic data set directly with a mixed Erlang distribution in a new divide-and-conquer manner. Compared with the well-known hyperexponential based models and the Fixed Hyper-Erlang model, the Adaptive Hyper-Erlang model is more flexible and practicable in addition to its accuracy in fitting the tail behavior.", "paper_title": "Segment-based adaptive hyper-Erlang model for long-tailed network traffic approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000258251400003"}
