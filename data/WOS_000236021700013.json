Optimisation of the objective function can be critical in presence of not continuous response variables like, for instance, binary choice or discrete choice models, limited dependent variables, switching regime models. In particular, gradient-based optimisation algorithms can face difficulties when the not continuous response involves discontinuities in the objective function. A simple computational tool is suggested to \"empirically\" solve the problem. The case study is EMM applied to the autoregressive model with exponential marginal distribution (EAR). The proposed solution is also compared with the performance of the Conditional Least Squares estimation, suitable for this autoregressive model, by a set of Monte Carlo experiments.
