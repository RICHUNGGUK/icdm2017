Such an algorithm is considered efficient if its complexity (in terms of the resource one is interested in) is polynomial in the syntactic distance between the initial and the target concept, but only polylogarithmic in the number of variables in the universe. We give an efficient revision algorithm in the model of learning with equivalence and membership queries for threshold functions, and some negative results showing, for instance, that threshold functions cannot be revised efficiently from either type of query alone. The algorithms work in a general revision model where both deletion and addition type revision operators are allowed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
