In this work, our target could be represented by an end-to-end mutual authentication scenario where the smart card could authenticate by itself to a Network Access Server by means of link layer protocols and therefore in absence of IP connectivity. Some previous related models based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol are presented. However, in these works the smart card and terminal implement jointly the supplicant functionality (split supplicant). We consider the native EAP multiplexing model specified by the IETF to propose a new approach in order to avoid this split and to achieve an autonomous and highly independent smart card in the authentication scheme: a self-authenticable smart card.
