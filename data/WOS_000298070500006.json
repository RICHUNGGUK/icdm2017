To allow for real time modes of operation, a collaborative adaptive filtering architecture, using a convex combination of adaptive filters is implemented. The evolution of the mixing parameter within this structure is then used as an indication of the predominant nature of the EEG recordings. Simulations based upon a number of different filter combinations illustrate the suitability of this approach to differentiate between the coma and quasi-brain-death states based upon fundamental signal characteristics.
