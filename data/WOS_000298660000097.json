Hence, based on this conjecture, we derive two optimal three-step eighth-order classes of methods in which there are only four evaluations per full cycle. Analytical proofs of the presented derivative-involved classes are provided. Finally, a number of numerical examples are also proposed to illustrate the accuracy of the contributed methods by comparing with the new existing optimal eighth-order methods without memory in the literature.
