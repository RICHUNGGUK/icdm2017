In this paper, we propose a target-oriented acoustic radiation generation technique (TARGET) for sound field control. For the MIMO system of a given geometry, a series of basic radiation modes, namely, target-oriented radiation modes (TORMs) can be derived using eigenvector analysis. Different TORMs have different contributions to the system control gain, which is defined as the ratio of the acoustic energy generated in the target zone to the transmitter output power. The TARGET can be effectively applied to the sound reproduction and suppression, which correspond the generations of bright and dark zone respectively. In acoustically bright zone generation and sound beamforming, the highest-gain TORM can be employed to determine the optimal source strengths. In active noise control, the strengths of the secondary sources can be derived using low-gain TORMs. Simulation results show that the proposed method has better or comparable performance than the traditional techniques.", "paper_title": "Target-oriented acoustic radiation generation technique for sound field control", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600036"}
