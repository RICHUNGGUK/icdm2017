A ladder lottery L corresponding to a given permutation pi is optimal if L has the minimum number of horizontal lines among the ladder lotteries corresponding to pi. In this paper we show that for any two optimal ladder lotteries L(1) and L(2) of a permutation, there exists a sequence of local modifications which transforms L(1) into L(2). We also give an algorithm to enumerate all optimal ladder lotteries of a given permutation. By setting pi = (n, n - 1,..., 1), the algorithm enumerates all arrangements of n pseudolines efficiently. By implementing the algorithm we compute the number of arrangements of n pseudolines for each n <= 11. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
