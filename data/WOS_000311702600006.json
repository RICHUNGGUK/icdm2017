Furthermore, unlike fingerprint verification, whose performance is assessed today with public benchmarks and protocols, performance of template protection approaches is often evaluated in heterogeneous scenarios, thus making it very difficult to compare existing techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel protection technique for Minutia Cylinder-Code (MCC), which is a well-known local minutiae representation. A sophisticate algorithm is designed to reverse MCC (i.e., recovering original minutiae positions and angles). Systematic experimentations show that the new approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and, at the same time, provides a good protection of minutiae information and is robust against masquerade attacks.", "paper_title": "Noninvertible Minutia Cylinder-Code Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000311702600006"}
