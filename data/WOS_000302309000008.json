Since, in general, there is no computable functional producing such an infinite subsequence, we consider a Pi(0)(2)-corollary, proving the classical existence of a finite monochromatic subsequence of any given length. In order to obtain a program from this proof, we apply two methods for extraction: the refined A-Translation, as proposed by Berger et al. and Godel's Dialectica interpretation. In this article, we compare the resulting programs with respect to their behaviour and complexity and indicate how they reflect the computational content of IPH.", "paper_title": "Exploring the Computational Content of the Infinite Pigeonhole Principle", "paper_id": "WOS:000302309000008"}
