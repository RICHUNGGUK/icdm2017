Preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm is used to solve the large linear systems arising from the finite-difference discretization of three-dimensional groundwater flow problems. CUDA implementing methods for the two most time-consuming operations in PCG, sparse matrix-vector multiplication and vector inner-product, are given. The experimental results show that CUDA can speed up the solving process of the groundwater simulation significantly. 1.8-3.7 speedup can be achieved with different GPUs for a transient groundwater flow problem.", "paper_title": "CUDA-based solver for large-scale groundwater flow simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000302328100002"}
