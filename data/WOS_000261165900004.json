The computation is obtained by the execution of a limited amount of rules in each membrane, and only when they are allowed to execute a derivation step. Indeed, each membrane operates with a certain work frequency that call change across the system. Simple results show that this model is at least m powerful as the usual one, and the goal is to present a few examples that show it giving rise to interesting dynamic behaviors.", "paper_title": "FREQUENCY MEMBRANE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261165900004"}
