Consider a property pi, a c-edge-colored graph G(c) not satisfying pi, and an edge-recoloring cost matrix R= [r(ij)](cxc) where r(ij) >= 0 denotes the cost of changing color i of edge e to color j. Basically, in this kind of problem the idea is to change the colors of one or more edges of G(c) in order to construct a new edge-colored graph such that the total edge-recoloring cost is minimized and property pi is satisfied. We also consider the destruction of potentially undesirable structures with the minimum edge-recoloring cost. In this paper, we are especially concerned with the construction and destruction of properly edge-colored and monochromatic paths, trails and cycles in graphs and digraphs. Some related problems and future directions are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
