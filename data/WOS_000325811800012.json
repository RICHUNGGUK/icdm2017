The use of a single kernel often suffers from occlusion since the available visual information is not sufficient for kernel usage. In order to provide more robust tracking performance, multiple inter-related kernels have thus been utilized for tracking in complicated scenarios. This paper presents an innovative method, which uses projected gradient to facilitate multiple kernels, in finding the best match during tracking under predefined constraints. The adaptive weights are applied to the kernels in order to efficiently compensate the adverse effect introduced by occlusion. An effective scheme is also incorporated to deal with the scale change issue during the object tracking. Moreover, we embed the multiple-kernel tracking into a Kalman filtering-based tracking system to enable fully automatic tracking. Several simulation results have been done to show the robustness of the proposed multiple-kernel tracking and also demonstrate that the overall system can successfully track the video objects under occlusion.", "paper_title": "Tracking Human Under Occlusion Based on Adaptive Multiple Kernels With Projected Gradients", "paper_id": "WOS:000325811800012"}
