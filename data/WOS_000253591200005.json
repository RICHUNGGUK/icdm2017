Pooling design is a very helpful tool for reducing the number of tests for DNA library screening. In this paper, we present new one- and two-stage pooling designs, together with new probabilistic pooling designs. The approach in this paper works for both error-free and error-tolerance scenarios.", "paper_title": "New constructions of one- and two-stage pooling designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000253591200005"}
