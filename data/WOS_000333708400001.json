If a type- job () finds the server busy, it is blocked and routed to a separate type- retrial (orbit) queue that attempts to re-dispatch its jobs at its specific Poisson rate. This creates a system with three dependent queues. Such a queueing system serves as a model for two competing job streams in a carrier sensing multiple access system. We study the queueing system using multi-dimensional probability generating functions, and derive its necessary and sufficient stability conditions while solving a Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem. Various performance measures are calculated and numerical results are presented. In particular, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed multiple access system with two types of jobs and constant retrial rates provides incentives for the users to respect their contracts.", "paper_title": "A retrial system with two input streams and two orbit queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000333708400001"}
