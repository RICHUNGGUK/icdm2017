This also proves existence of a weak solution. The operator acting on the zero-order term is assumed to be the sum of a linear, bounded, symmetric, strongly positive operator and a nonlinear operator that fulfils a certain growth and a Holder-type continuity condition. The operator acting on the first-order time derivative is a nonlinear hemicontinuous operator that fulfils a certain growth condition and is (up to some shift) monotone and coercive.", "paper_title": "Convergence of a Time Discretisation for Doubly Nonlinear Evolution Equations of Second Order", "paper_id": "WOS:000274852100003"}
