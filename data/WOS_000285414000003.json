Classical work in this area is revisited and a new geometric characterization is developed. Applications are considered for classification problems that arise in the high-dimension low-sample-size setting. In that context, we show that Fisher's linear discriminant analysis and canonical correlation do not, in general, coincide and conduct empirical comparisons between the two methods.", "paper_title": "Unit canonical correlations and high-dimensional discriminant analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000285414000003"}
