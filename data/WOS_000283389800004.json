Gaussian noise, singularity points, and larger magnitude noise) in a complex fuzzy fault-diagnosis system. A mapping relationship between fuzzy numbers and crisp real numbers that allows a fuzzy sample set to be transformed into a crisp real sample set is also presented Furthermore, the paper proposes a novel fuzzy robust wavelet support vector classifier (FRWSVC) based on a wavelet base function and develops an adaptive Gaussian particle swarm optimization (AGPSO) algorithm to seek the optimal unknown parameter of the FRWSVC The results of experiments that apply the hybrid diagnosis model based on the FRWSVC and the AGPSO algorithm to fault diagnosis demonstrate that it is both feasible and effective Tests comparing the method proposed in this paper against other fuzzy support vector classifier (FSVC) machines show that it outperforms them. 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Complex system fault diagnosis based on a fuzzy robust wavelet support vector classifier and an adaptive Gaussian particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000283389800004"}
