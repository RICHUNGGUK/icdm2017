A sample of 33 (22 male and I I female) undergraduates on a Business and Management degree used a multimedia system to learn about the operation of a bicycle pump. The system consisted of a labelled diagram of the pump, followed by a description of twelve stages in its operation. The sample was randomly divided into two groups who used either an interactive (1) or a non-interactive (NI) version involving both images and text. The I system differed from the NI system by the incorporation of control of pace, self-assessment questions and an interactive simulation. Students then undertook two different types of tests to assess their learning: one designed to evaluate their memory by recalling facts from the lesson, and another designed to assess their understanding through solving novel diagnostic problems. Students using the I system outperformed those using the NI system in the problem-solving test, and needed less time to complete both memory and problem-solving tests. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that interactive systems facilitate deep learning by actively engaging the learner in the learning process. This suggests that educational designers who seek to foster deep learning (as opposed to mere factual recall) should adopt the incorporation of interactivity as a design principle.
