However, the majority of the existing methods suffer from one or more of the following limitations: (1) difficulty detecting clusters of very low dimensionality embedded in high-dimensional spaces, (2) lack of an automatic mechanism for identifying relevant dimensions for each cluster, (3) lack of an outlier detection mechanism and (4) dependence on a set of parameters that need to be properly tuned. Most of the existing approaches are inadequate for dealing with these four issues in a unified framework. This motivates our effort to propose a fully automatic projected clustering algorithm for high-dimensional categorical data which is capable of facing the four aforementioned issues in a single framework. Our algorithm comprises two phases: (1) outlier handling and (2) clustering in projected spaces. The first phase of the algorithm is based on a probabilistic approach that exploits the beta mixture model to identify and eliminate outlier objects from a data set in a systematic way. In the second phase, the clustering process is based on a novel quality function that allows the identification of projected clusters of low dimensionality embedded in a high-dimensional space without any parameter setting by the user. The suitability of our proposal is demonstrated through empirical studies using synthetic and real data sets.", "paper_title": "Clustering categorical data in projected spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000347948900002"}
