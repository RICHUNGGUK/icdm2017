Druggability estimates and pocket opening analyses indicated binding regions of cyclin T1 residues, Phe 146 and Lys 6, as starting points for the design of small molecules with the potential to inhibit the CDK9/cyclin T1 association. A pharmacophore model was created, based on these two residues and used to select potential inhibitor structures. Binding energies of the inhibitors were estimated with MM-GBSA. A good correlation of MM-GBSA energies and FTMap druggability predictions was observed. Amongst studied compounds a derivative of 2-amino-8-hydroxyquinoline was identified as the best potential candidate to inhibit CDK9/cyclin T1 interactions. 2014 Elsevier Inc.
