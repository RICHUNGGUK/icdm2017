In order to track RFID-tagged products efficiently in the RFID-enabled, large-scale supply chain, this paper first presents the design of a product tracking system that can collaborate with the EPC Network, a suite of network services for RFID data management in the supply chain. Next, we explain a product monitoring procedure that is performed by comparing the actual path of a product with its planned path. Finally, we develop an adaptive product search algorithm based on a reinforcement learning technique to efficiently locate a product deviated from its planned path. Experiment results are provided to show the performance of the search algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
