As part of an automated control software development framework, this article discusses the development of a simulation model generation method. As a basis, the application of knowledge-based engineering (KBE) is suggested, requiring the definition of an ontology to capture the various domain concepts and relationships. The initial knowledge base represents concepts and relations to create models with Modelica, the object-oriented modelling language used to construct the simulation model. The need for physics-based, high-fidelity simulation models using the latest design parameters is illustrated by investigating the model of a quadrotor UAV. The results show that the obtained model can form the basis for control design and that the approach provides means to integrate the dynamics analysis and control design into a modelling framework using a combination of object-oriented component modelling and KBE principles.", "paper_title": "Knowledge-based simulation model generation for control law design applied to a quadrotor UAV", "paper_id": "WOS:000283369600006"}
