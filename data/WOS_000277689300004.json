This model integrated inventory decisions into distribution network design with stochastic market demands. The goal is to select the optimum numbers, locations, and capacities of the opening warehouses so that all customer demands to be satisfied at minimum total costs of the distribution network. We develop a nonlinear mixed-integer model and propose an efficient heuristic solution procedure for the problem. The solution approach is based on Lagrangian relaxation, improved with efficient heuristic to solve complex sub-problems. Computational results indicate that the proposed method yields good solutions with high quality within a reasonable computational time for various real-size problems.", "paper_title": "A LAGRANGIAN-BASED SOLUTION ALGORITHM FOR STRATEGIC SUPPLY CHAIN DISTRIBUTION DESIGN IN UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT (Retracted article.
