In this paper, we propose a multimodal scheme to segment and represent TV video streams. The scheme aims to recover the temporal and structural characteristics of TV programs with visual, auditory, and textual information. In terms of visual cues, we develop a novel concept named program-oriented informative images (POIM) to identify the candidate points correlated with the boundaries of individual programs. For audio cues, a multiscale Kullback-Leibler (K-L) distance is proposed to locate audio scene changes (ASC), and accordingly ASC is aligned with video scene changes to represent candidate boundaries of programs. In addition, latent semantic analysis (LSA) is adopted to calculate the textual content similarity (TCS) between shots to model the inter-program similarity and intra-program dissimilarity in terms of speech content. Finally, we fuse the multimodal features of POIM, ASC, and TCS to detect the boundaries of programs including individual commercials (spots). Towards effective program guide and attracting content browsing, we propose a multimodal representation of individual programs by using POIM images, key frames, and textual keywords in a summarization manner. Extensive experiments are carried out over an open benchmarking dataset TRECVID 2005 corpus and promising results have been achieved. Compared with the electronic program guide (EPG), our solution provides a more generic approach to determine the exact boundaries of diverse TV programs even including dramatic spots.", "paper_title": "A multimodal scheme for program segmentation and representation in broadcast video streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000258767100009"}
