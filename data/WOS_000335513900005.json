We consider deterministic, nondeterministic and alternating machines working within strong, middle and weak space, and processing general or unary inputs. In most cases, we are able to show that the lower bounds for oneway machines remain tight in the real-time case. Memory lower bounds for nonregular acceptance on other devices are also addressed. It is shown that increasing the number of stacks of real-time pushdown automata can result in exponential improvement in the total amount of space usage for nonregular language recognition.", "paper_title": "TIGHT BOUNDS FOR THE SPACE COMPLEXITY OF NONREGULAR LANGUAGE RECOGNITION BY REAL-TIME MACHINES", "paper_id": "WOS:000335513900005"}
