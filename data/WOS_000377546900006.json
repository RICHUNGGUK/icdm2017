Multiple sources use contention for channel access. We investigate distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS), which means that if a source wins the channel contention, it may give up its transmission opportunity if its channels over the two hops are not good. We propose a two-level DOS scheme which includes two-level decisions. Optimal rules in the two levels are theoretically derived.", "paper_title": "Two-Level Distributed Opportunistic Scheduling in DF Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377546900006"}
