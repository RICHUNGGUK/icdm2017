The trend is to eliminate any RF/analog mixers and digitize the RF signal as near as possible to the antenna. In order to digitize directly the analog input signal, a high dynamic-range and high-speed ADC is needed. Continuous-Time Bandpass Delta-Sigma Modulator can meet these requirements, using high-performance multi-bit quantizers. This article presents the design of a high-speed CMOS Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which can be used as a quantizer in Continuous-Time Delta-Sigma Modulator. It is designed in a 130 nm CMOS technology from STMicroelectronics. The main features of the ADC are 3-bit resolution with 4 GHz sampling rate in a 0.8-2 GHz bandwidth.", "paper_title": "Design of a high-speed CMOS multi-bit quantizer for continuous-time Delta-Sigma Modulator applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000258717300010"}
