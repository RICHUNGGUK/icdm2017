This is done by demonstrating the ease of application and computational efficiency of infinite elements. Specifically, this paper introduces a comprehensive set of coordinate and field variable mapping functions for one-dimensional and two-dimensional infinite elements and the computational steps for the solution of the affiliated combined finite-infinite element models. Performance is then benchmarked against various parametric models for deflections and stresses in two examples of solid, unbounded problems: (1) a circular, uniformly-distributed load, and (2) a point load on a semiinfinite, axisymmetrical medium. The results are compared with those from the respective closed-form solution. As an example, when the vertical deflections in Example 2 are compared with the closed form solution, the 45% error level generated with fixed boundaries and 14% generated with spring-supported boundaries is reduced to only 1% with infinite elements, even with a coarse mesh. Furthermore, this increased accuracy is achieved with lower computational costs.
