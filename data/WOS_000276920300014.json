By solving the non-probabilistic set-based reliability problem and analyzing the reliability with fuzziness and randomness, the structural hybrid reliability can be obtained. The presented hybrid model has broad applicability which can handle either linear or non-linear state functions. A comparison among the presented hybrid model, probabilistic and non-probabilistic models, and the conventional probabilistic model is made through two typical numerical examples. The results show that the presented hybrid model, which may ensure structural security, is effective and practical. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
