Specifically, we want dynamic joint aggregation, routing, and scheduling algorithms that have analytically provable performance benefits due to in-network computation as compared to simple data forwarding. To this end, we define a class of functions, the Fully-Multiplexible functions, which includes several functions such as parity, MAX, and kth-order statistics. For such functions we characterize the maximum achievable refresh rate of the network in terms of an underlying graph primitive, the min-mincut. In acyclic wireline networks we show that the maximum refresh rate is achievable by a simple algorithm that is dynamic, distributed, and only dependent on local information. In the case of wireless networks we provide a MaxWeight-like algorithm with dynamic flow-splitting, which is shown to be throughput-optimal.", "paper_title": "Towards a queueing-based framework for in-network function computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000310321300003"}
