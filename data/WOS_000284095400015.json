We establish a nonlinear programming model to integrate all of these preference structures and then employ a genetic algorithm to find the solution to the problem. This model can be reduced to a variety of special models suitable for group decision-making situations in which the preferences are represented in one (or several) of the aforementioned preference structures. Finally, detailed numerical analysis is provided to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Programming Model Integrating Different Preference Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000284095400015"}
