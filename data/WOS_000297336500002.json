These devices enable the electrical manipulation of microfluidics with various advantages, such as low power consumption, flexibility, accuracy, and efficiency. In addressing the need for low-cost and practical fabrication, pin-count reduction has become a key problem to the large-scale integration of EWOD-chip designs. One of the major approaches, broadcast addressing, reduces the pin count by assigning a single control pin to multiple electrodes with mutually compatible control signals. Most previous studies utilize this addressing scheme by scheduling fluidic-level synthesis on pin-constrained chip arrays. However, the associated interconnect routing problem is still not provided in currently available DMF automations, and thus the broadcast-addressing scheme cannot be actually realized. In this paper, we present the first network-flow based pin-count aware routing algorithm for EWOD-chip designs with a broadcast electrode-addressing scheme. Our algorithm simultaneously takes pin-count reduction and wirelength minimization into consideration for higher integration and better design performance. Experimental results show the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm on a set of real-life chip applications.", "paper_title": "A Network-Flow Based Pin-Count Aware Routing Algorithm for Broadcast-Addressing EWOD Chips", "paper_id": "WOS:000297336500002"}
