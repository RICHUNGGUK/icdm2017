Dynamic fuzzy ontologies are ontologies that evolve in time to adapt to the environment in which they are used, and whose taxonomies and relationships among concepts are enriched with fuzzy weights (i.e., numeric values between 0 and 1). Such cognitive artifacts can provide for higher user awareness in learning environments, as well as for greater creative stimulus for knowledge discovery. This paper gives the definitions of dynamic fuzzy ontologies, the details of how fuzzy values are dynamically assigned to concepts and relations, and presents an experimental evaluation of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Using dynamic fuzzy ontologies to understand creative environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000034"}
