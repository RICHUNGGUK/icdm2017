The proposed load balancing game, which is infinite and with perfect information, aims to establish fairness both in system and user level. The optimal or near-optimal solution of the game is approximated by a genetic algorithm and an introduced hybrid population-based simulated annealing algorithm, using the concept of Nash equilibrium. Since all users responses are shown to converge to their near-optimal solution, distribution of users' jobs is \"fair\". Simulations demonstrate near-optimality of the proposed algorithms in terms of makespan and fairness for the proposed load balancing scheme.", "paper_title": "An effective game theoretic static load balancing applied to distributed computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000365236800022"}
