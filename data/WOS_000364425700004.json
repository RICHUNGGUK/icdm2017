We introduce both the upstream and downstream connectivity along with complete description of their working principles and implementation issues. Next we investigate the feasibility of the proposed architectures in the uplink direction in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance. The performance analysis has been carried out in the presence of realistic and non-ideal characteristics of optical and optoelectronic devices used for the setup. The BER is evaluated for both conventional and burst mode receivers, by considering all the noise components viz. ASE noise, thermal noise, shot noise and signal-ASE beat noise. To carry out the total network analysis, a novel steady-state model for RSOA is developed. Suitable steady-state models for erbium-doped fiber amplifier and arrayed waveguide grating have also been considered. The results demonstrate the limits of RSOA-based PON.", "paper_title": "Transmission impairments in long-reach WDM-TDM PON using EDFA and RSOA-based ONUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000364425700004"}
