Productivity-based indices are proposed in addition to current measuring techniques. Such criteria are employed to compare conventional PID and fuzzy-based controllers in copper smelting. This process is mathematically modeled in order to be simulated. The comparison confirms a better performance of the fuzzy controller in dealing with the molten bath temperature within an Isasmelt furnace. In normal operating conditions (online tests), the proposed controller achieves a consistent mean square relative error reduction of 72% between measured values and the temperature setpoint and standard deviation of approximately 60% (from 27.8 degrees C to 11.1 degrees C). The productivity criteria establish a lower consumption of raw materials (13%) and energy supply (29%).", "paper_title": "Holistic Indices for Productivity Control Assessment, Applied to the Comparative Analysis of PID and Fuzzy Controllers Within an Isasmelt Furnace", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600010"}
