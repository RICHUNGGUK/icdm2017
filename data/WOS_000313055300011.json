Segre showed that some values of k (k = 6 and 2(i)) give rise to hyperovals in PG(2, q) for infinitely many q. Segre and Bartocci conjectured that these are the only values of k with this property. We prove this conjecture through the absolute irreducibility of the curves g(k).", "paper_title": "Proof of a conjecture of Segre and Bartocci on monomial hyperovals in projective planes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313055300011"}
