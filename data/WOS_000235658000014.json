However, still lack of solution is proposed for the fundamental problem in this step about how to link two services with heterogeneous message types. It results in that many an available service candidate has to be abandoned in current web service composition systems because the types of their inputs are not compatible with that of request messages. This paper presents a new solution for linking heterogeneous messages automatically when composing web services. It converts request messages to the format of current service's input. As the transforming operation is deployed as the third-party web service, this solution can be integrated into current composition systems seamlessly. Available information in message schema is fully utilized for automated message schema matching and XSLT scripts used to convert data are auto-generated according to the message schema matching rules. This solution has been applied in SEWSIP, a prototype of semantic-based web service composition system, and evaluation of related experiments on it shows well results.", "paper_title": "Transforming heterogeneous messages automatically in web service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000014"}
