This can be of great help for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as an effective way to share information. However, it can be difficult for SMEs to have access to a fully integrated CWE providing different tools (e.g., videoconferencing, instant messaging, etc.). Currently, they may define a CWE as a combination of heterogeneous and non-integrated tools which are not able to share information between them. An integrated CWE would provide SMEs with the necessary means to collaborate, making information exchange easier.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS A SEMANTIC-AWARE COLLABORATIVE WORKING ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000287837900002"}
