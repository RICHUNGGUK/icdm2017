The numerical method is based on a front-tracking method using variable time step. Due to the presence of a moving boundary, the numerical solution of these problems is quite laborious. Analytical solutions, although very convenient, can only be applied to very specific cases. In situations where the thermal-physical properties depend on system variables or where the initial temperature distribution is not of a uniform type the analytical solutions are impossible. The computer approach offers a high degree of convenience, as it produces intermediate results while the calculations are being performed. The outcome of the solidification process is observed and the position of the moving boundary is given at each time step. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
