There are circumstances, such as emergency situations and disaster recovery, when real-time delivery is a fundamental requirement. The problem is challenging due to the limited network capacity, the variable transmission rates and the unpredictability with respect to the network conditions in the mobile peer-to-peer network. In this paper we address the problem of real-time data dissemination of multimedia streams in mobile peer-to-peer networks. Four routing algorithms are proposed based on a packet's deadline, priority or a combination of these metrics. They are simulated under different setups in a mobile peer-to-peer network with Bluetooth connectivity and nodes broadcasting audio and video streams using different priorities. We compare the performance of the algorithms using a number of metrics. Detailed experimental results are presented. Based on these results, propositions on the usage of the algorithms and the design of network requirements are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
