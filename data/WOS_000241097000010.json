The system attempts to simulate the human precedence given to particular financial statistics by using an interchangeable priority system and fuzzy membership scaling. The system receives financial statistics from multiple aspects of a company's characteristics and makes generalised decisions based on the objectives set out by the focal organisation. The hierarchical structure and the membership scaling of the system are directly linked to the focal organisation's profile and their acquisition objectives.
