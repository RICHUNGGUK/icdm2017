The temporal uncertainties and valid time constraints on resources and activities should be taken into consideration in workflow models. Based on introducing time constraints on elements in Fuzzy-timing Petri Nets, a new workflow model named Fuzzy Temporal Workflow Nets (FTWF-nets) is proposed. The calculation of temporal elements in FTWF-nets is given. Time modeling and time possibility analysis of temporal phenomena in FTWF-Nets are also investigated. Finally an example is given to illustrate how to use this approach. Research results show that FTWF-Nets can be used to model temporal information in those workflows which have temporal uncertainties and time constraints on resources and activities, and analyze the time possibility on some typical constraints.", "paper_title": "Workflow analysis based on Fuzzy Temporal Workflow Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800055"}
