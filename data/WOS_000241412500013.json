We consider four RAID1 organizations: basic mirroring, group rotate declustering, interleaved declustering, and chained declustering, where the last three organizations attain a more balanced load than basic mirroring when disk failures occur. We first obtain the number of configurations, A(n, i), which do not result in data loss when i out of n disks have failed. The probability of no data loss in this case is A(n, i)/{n/i} The reliability of each RAID1 organization is the summation over 1 <= i <= n/2 of A(n, i)r(n-1) (1 - r)(i), where r denotes the reliability of each disk. A closed-form expression for A(n, i) is obtained easily for the first three organizations. We present a relatively simple derivation of the expression for A(n, i) for the chained declustering method, which includes a correctness proof. We also discuss the routing of read requests to balance disk loads, especially when there are disk failures, to maximize the attainable throughput.", "paper_title": "Mirrored disk organization reliability analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241412500013"}
