This paper presents some cryptanalytic results on GOST R. Using the rebound attack technique, we achieve collision attacks on the reduced round compression function. Result on up to 9.5 rounds is proposed, the time complexity is 2(176) and the memory requirement is 2(128) bytes. Based on the 9.5-round collision result, a limited birthday distinguisher is presented. More over, a k-collision on 512-bit version of GOST R is constructed which shows the weakness of the structure used in GOST R. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
