It was introduced by Renyi as a measure of information that satisfies almost the same axioms as Kullback-Leibler divergence, and depends on a parameter that is called its order. In particular, the Renyi divergence of order 1 equals the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review and extend the most important properties of Renyi divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence, including convexity, continuity, limits of sigma-algebras, and the relation of the special order 0 to the Gaussian dichotomy and contiguity. We also show how to generalize the Pythagorean inequality to orders different from 1, and we extend the known equivalence between channel capacity and minimax redundancy to continuous channel inputs (for all orders) and present several other minimax results.", "paper_title": "Renyi Divergence and Kullback-Leibler Divergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000341982200007"}
