Conjunctive keyword search scheme enables a user to obtain data containing all of several keywords through only one query. One of the security requirements of conjunctive keyword search schemes is that a malicious adversary should not be able to generate new valid capabilities from the observed capabilities. In this paper we show that conjunctive keyword search schemes are not secure. In particular, given two capabilities corresponding two sets of keywords, an adversary is able to generate a new capability corresponding to the difference set of two keywords sets.", "paper_title": "Difference set attacks on conjunctive keyword search schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241476800005"}
