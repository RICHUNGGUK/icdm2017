Motivated by the paradigm of peer-based intelligent tutoring, we model the learning gains achieved by users when exposed to specific web objects in order to recommend those objects most likely to deliver benefit to new users. We are able to show that this streamlined presentation leads to effective knowledge gains, both through a process of simulated learning and through a user study, for the specific application of caring for children with autism. The value of our framework for peer-driven content selection of health information is emphasized through two additional roles for peers: attaching commentary to web objects and proposing subdivided objects for presentation, both of which are demonstrated to deliver effective learning gains, in simulations. In all, we are offering an opportunity for patients to navigate the deep waters of excessive online information towards effective management of healthcare, through content selection influenced by previous peer experiences.", "paper_title": "Empowering Patients and Caregivers to Manage Healthcare Via Streamlined Presentation of Web Objects Selected by Modeling Learning Benefits Obtained by Similar Peers", "paper_id": "WOS:000360007500012"}
