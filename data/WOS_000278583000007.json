The initial motivation to put forward this method is based on the intrinsic physical properties of the electric anisotropic media whose constitutive parameter permittivity is a tensor matrix that can be modeled as equivalent electric dipole moment. This method employs the method of moments to solve the electric field volume integral equation (VIE) formulated by discretizing the scattering body into tetrahedral volume elements, in which the electrical parameters are assumed constant in each element. Then the VIE is solved directly to obtain the scattered field. Numerical results are given to validate the accuracy and efficiency of this method. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
