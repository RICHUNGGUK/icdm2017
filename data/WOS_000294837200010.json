The proposed algorithm allows each layer of SVC video to choose its appropriate channel in wireless MIMO systems based on channel state information for transmission rate enhancement. Here, this difficult problem is converted into mathematical optimization problem to improve the performance of SVC video transmission. Experimental results show that the transmission rate of the proposed method outperforms the existing scheme.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Resource Allocation for Scalable H.264/AVC Video Transmission over MIMO Wireless Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000294837200010"}
