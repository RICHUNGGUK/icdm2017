Although there is still controversy regarding the decision on which unruptured aneurysms should be treated, this is based primarily on their size. Nonetheless, many large lesions do not rupture whereas some small ones do. It is commonly accepted that hemodynamical factors are important to better understand the natural history of cerebral aneurysms. However, it might not always be practical to carry out a detailed computational analysis of such factors if a prompt assessment is required. Since shape is likely to be dependent on the balance between hemodynamic forces and the aneurysmal surrounding environment, an appropriate morphological 3-D characterization is likely to provide a practical surrogate to quickly evaluate the risk of rupture. In this paper, an efficient and novel methodology for 3-D shape characterization of cerebral aneurysms is described. The aneurysms are isolated by taking into account a portion of their adjacent vessels. Two methods to characterize the morphology of the aneurysms models using moment invariants have been considered: geometrical moment invariants (GMI) and Zernike moment invariants (ZMI). The results have been validated in a database containing 53 patients with a total of 31 ruptured aneurysms and 24 unruptured aneurysms. It has been found that ZMI indices are more robust than GMI, and seem to provide a reliable way to discriminate between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. Correct rupture prediction rates of similar or equal to 80% were achieved in contrast to 66% that is found when the aspect ratio index is considered.", "paper_title": "Morphological characterization of intracranial aneurysms using 3-d moment invariants", "paper_id": "WOS:000249213500012"}
