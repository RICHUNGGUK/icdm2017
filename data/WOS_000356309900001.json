Fingering instabilities initiated at the interface between a low-viscosity fluid and a high-viscosity fluid are analysed at varying capillary numbers and mobility ratios using a finite mobility ratio model.The present work is motivated by the possible development of interfacial instabilities that can occur in porous media during the process of CO2 sequestration but does not pretend to analyse this complex problem. Instead, we present a detailed study of the analogous problem occurring in a Hele-Shaw cell, giving indications of possible plume patterns that can develop during the CO2 injection.The numerical scheme utilises a boundary element method in which the normal velocity at the interface of the two fluids is directly computed through the evaluation of a hypersingular integral. The boundary integral equation is solved using a Neumann convergent series with cubic B-Spline boundary discretisation, exhibiting sixth-order spatial convergence. The convergent series allows the long-term nonlinear dynamics of growing viscous fingers to be explored accurately and efficiently.Simulations in low-mobility ratio regimes reveal large differences in fingering patterns compared with those predicted by previous high-mobility ratio models. Most significantly, classical finger shielding between competing fingers is inhibited. Secondary fingers can possess significant velocity, allowing greater interaction with primary fingers compared with high-mobility ratio flows. Eventually, this interaction can lead to base thinning and the breaking of fingers into separate bubbles.
