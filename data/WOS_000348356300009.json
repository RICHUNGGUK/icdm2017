Our new algorithm computes three harmonic 1-forms, which can be treated as three vector fields, such that both the divergence and circulation of them are zero. By integrating the three harmonic 1-forms over the entire volumes, we can bijectively map the volume to a cuboid domain. We demonstrate the power of the technique by introducing a new application, to transfer the interior structure during the morphing of two given shapes.", "paper_title": "Interior structure transfer via harmonic 1-forms", "paper_id": "WOS:000348356300009"}
