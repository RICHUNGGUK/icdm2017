In this environment, the channel bandwidth of each channel is variant with time in real cases. However, traditional schemes do not consider time-variant bandwidth of each channel to schedule data items. Therefore, the above drawback degrades the performance in generating broadcast programs. In this paper, we address the problem of generating a broadcast program to disseminate data via multiple channels of time-variant bandwidth. In view of the characteristics of time-variant bandwidth, we propose an algorithm using adaptive allocation on time-variant bandwidth to generate the broadcast program to avoid the above drawback to minimize average waiting time. Experimental results show that our approach is able to generate the broadcast programs with high quality and is very efficient in a data broadcasting environment with the time-variant bandwidth.", "paper_title": "A General Framework of Time-Variant Bandwidth Allocation in the Data Broadcasting Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000273707000002"}
