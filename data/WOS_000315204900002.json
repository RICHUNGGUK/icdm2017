They then analyze 103 well-known crowdsourcing web sites using content analysis methods and the hermeneutic reading principle. Based on their analysis, they develop a \"taxonomic theory\" of crowdsourcing by organizing the empirical variants in nine distinct forms of crowdsourcing models. They also discuss key issues and directions, concentrating on the notion of managerial control systems.", "paper_title": "Rules of Crowdsourcing: Models, Issues, and Systems of Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000315204900002"}
