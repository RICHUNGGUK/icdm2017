In this paper, we propose a new geometric modeling scheme, periodic surface, for material design at atomic, molecular, and meso scales. At molecular scale, periodicity of the model allows thousands of particles to be built efficiently. At meso scale, inherent porosity of the model represents morphology of polymer and macromolecule naturally. Model construction and operation methods are developed to build crystal and molecular models based on periodic surfaces.", "paper_title": "Geometric Modeling of nano structures with periodic surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900024"}
