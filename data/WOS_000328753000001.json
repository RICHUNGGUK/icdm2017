Energy consumption is always a major concern in the research field of wireless sensor network. Thus, data aggregation schemes emerged and were deployed for prolonging network lifetime by reducing data transmitted within the network. Meanwhile, along with the wide application of the data aggregation schemes, the security issues of data aggregation have been increasingly drawing attention and the designing of secure data aggregation scheme is becoming a hot spot. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient secure data aggregation scheme, ESMART: energy-efficient slice-mix-aggregate based on the technique of data slicing and mixing. The proposed scheme performs secure data aggregation in a more efficient way while keeping a good performance of privacy preservation. And the simulation result shows that the security performance of ESMART scheme is better than that of some existing and widely used schemes.", "paper_title": "ESMART: Energy-Efficient Slice-Mix-Aggregate for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000328753000001"}
