Then, the numerical approaches to determining membership functions proposed in part I of this paper are used to study the fuzzy description and data clustering problems by mimicking human reasoning process. Finally, illustrative examples show that the framework of AFS theory offers a far more flexible and effective approach to artificial intelligence system analysis and design with applications to knowledge acquisition and representations in practice.
