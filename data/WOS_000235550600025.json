These trajectories are sampled at 1/5th the National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) video frame rate and interpolated using piecewise sequences of cubic Bezier splines. The resulting trajectories are used to control sparse, stick figure animations of sign language resulting in considerable spatiotemporal compression with intelligibility in the range of 90%. This method introduces an additional 5:1 compression in the temporal domain that has not been previously exploited, an is potentially useful in sign language telecommunication, multimedia presentations, and gesture recognition.", "paper_title": "Piecewise parametric interpolation for temporal compression of multijoint movement trajectories", "paper_id": "WOS:000235550600025"}
