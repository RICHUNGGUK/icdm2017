Through a multi-theoretical lens, we utilize operant conditioning and individuals' psychological morals of procedural justice and social norms to study the effectiveness of this countermeasure in addressing the associated agency problem and in promoting compliance with an organization's Internet usage policies. We find that in addition to the blocking module, confirmation and quota modules of an Internet filtering and monitoring system can prevent shirking and promote better compliance through employee empowerment and attention resource replenishment.
