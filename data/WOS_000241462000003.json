Even better if this log is automatic, created on the fly while a scientist or software developer is working in a habitual way, without the need for extra efforts. The CAVES (Collaborative Analysis Versioning Environment System) and CODESH (COllaborative DEvelopment SHell) projects address this problem in a novel way, building on the concepts of virtual state and virtual transition to provide an automatic persistent logbook for sessions of data analysis or software development in a collaborating group. Repositories of sessions can be managed dynamically to record and make available in a controlled way the knowledge accumulated in the course of a scientific or software endeavor.", "paper_title": "Virtual logbooks and collaboration in science and software development", "paper_id": "WOS:000241462000003"}
