In the nineties, Promel and Steger proved that for a graph H with chromatic number k+1 almost all graphs not containing H as a subgraph are k-colorable if and only if H contains a color-critical edge. We strengthen the concept of H-free to induced subgraph containment, proving that if H has coloring number k+1 then almost all H-free graphs can be covered by k graphs that are cliques or independent sets if and only if H is in some well-defined sense critical. The family of critical graphs includes C(4) and C(2k+1) for all k >= 3. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
