To investigate the effect of the LAD stenosis severity on this phenomenon and on haemodynamics in the LIMA and anastomosis region, a numerical LIMA-LAD model was developed based on 3D geometric (obtained from a cast) and hemodynamic data from an experimental pig study. Proximal LAD pressure was used as upstream boundary condition. The model counted 13 outlets (12 septal arteries and the distal LAD) where flow velocities were imposed in systole, while myocardial conductance was imposed in diastole via an implicit scheme. LAD stenoses of 100 (total occlusion), 90, 75 and 0 % area reduction were constructed. Low degree of LAD stenosis was associated with highly competitive flow and low wall shear stress (WSS) in the LIMA, an unfavourable hemodynamic regime which might contribute to WSS-related remodelling of the LIMA and suboptimal long-term LIMA bypass performance.", "paper_title": "Effect of the degree of LAD stenosis on \"competitive flow\" and flow field characteristics in LIMA-to-LAD bypass surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000306953700005"}
