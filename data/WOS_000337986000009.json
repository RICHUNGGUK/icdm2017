The study improves on the AV approach proposed in our prior work [1] to obtain a formulation that performs better on curvilinear and non-cartesian unstructured grids. A dilatation sensor for the AV coefficient, combined with a dilatation-based switch and filter for smoothing, is found to reduce the oscillatory behavior and enable sharp capturing of discontinuities. The work also incorporates the capability for local mesh refinement, which is used in conjunction with AV to obtain improved shock profiles. A mortar element method is used to handle the non-conforming interfaces generated from mesh-refinement of quadrilateral elements. Promising results are demonstrated for 2D test problems.
