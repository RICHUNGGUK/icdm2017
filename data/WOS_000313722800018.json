The mapping of Bi-Seq reads is complex and requires special alignment algorithms. This problem is particularly relevant for SOLiD color space, where the bisulfite conversion C/T changes two adjacent colors into 16 possible combinations. Here, we present an algorithm that efficiently aligns Bi-Seq reads obtained either from SOLiD or Illumina. An accompanying methylation-caller program creates a genomic view of methylated and unmethylated Cs on both DNA strands.", "paper_title": "PASS-bis: a bisulfite aligner suitable for whole methylome analysis of Illumina and SOLiD reads", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722800018"}
