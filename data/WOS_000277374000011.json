The main objective of the simulator is to train students and engineers for dynamic process modeling and analysis, control loop analysis and tuning, and system identification. The software structure consists of various case studies with specific exercises. The case studies cover some common industrial chemical processes. Users can learn different control aspects via working through the well-designed exercises. For convenience, the software is designed as a user-friendly menu-driven framework such that the user can easily navigate through the various case studies and exercises, carry out simulation experiments, visualize the results, and learn in the meanwhile. A tutorial illustrating some of the software features is presented. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
