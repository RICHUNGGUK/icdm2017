This study analyzed canopy reflectance spectra collected at the booting stage by using partial least square regression in combination with discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to establish a classification model for the discrimination of three mega rice cultivars. To improve the model's capability to interpret and sharpen the separation between cultivars, PLS-DA was combined with orthogonal projection to the latent structure (O-PLS) to derive the OPLS-DA models by removing noise and the Y-orthogonal variation. The ground-based high-resolution reflectance spectra (330-1030 nm) were acquired from paddy field experiments during the growing periods, and were recalculated at intervals of 10 nm. With the PLS-DA approach, the total accuracy for discriminating three cultivars in the calibration datasets was 90% and was above 80% for individual cultivars. In the validation datasets, a similar capability for cultivar discrimination was obtained for both pooled and individual cultivars. However, the Y-orthogonal variation might be embedded within the PLS-DA model. Using the OPLS-DA approach, the large variation within rice cultivars (the intra variation) was effectively removed to improve the performance of both group separation and model establishment. The overall accuracy reached 100% in the calibration datasets and had superior discrimination than the PLS-DA model in the validation datasets. Therefore, the OPLS-DA method is recommended for establishing a classification model for the cultivar discrimination of rice in the vegetative phase using remotely sensed canopy reflectance spectra.
