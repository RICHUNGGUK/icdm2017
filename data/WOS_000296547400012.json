First, the new color model is constructed according to the principle of Ockham's razor from a number of available models that take advantage of the subtraction of the primary colors for boosting pattern recognition performance. Second, the novel similarity measure integrates both the angular and the distance information for improving upon the broadly applied similarity measures. Finally, the discriminative color features are extracted from a compact color image representation by means of discriminant analysis with enhanced generalization capabilities. Experiments on the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) version 2 Experiment 4, which contains 12,776 training images, 16,028 controlled target images, and 8,014 uncontrolled query images, show the feasibility of the proposed method.
