Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to evaluation of new service concepts (NSCs). This study proposes an analytic network process (ANP) approach to evaluation of NSCs. ANP is a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method that can accommodate interdependency among decision attributes. The proposed approach measures feasibility of NSCs in terms of strategy, technology, market, implementation, and operation. The derived feasibility values of NSC alternatives are then employed to construct the NSC portfolio matrix, together with customers' preference. The NSC portfolio matrix is expected to aid decision making on concept selection and provide managerial implications for service development. A case of the mobile information and entertainment service is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
