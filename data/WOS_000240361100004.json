Given two sequences S-1 and S-2 and a nested arc-annotation P-1 for S-1, this paper considers the problem of inferring the nested arc-annotation P-2 for S-2 such that (S-1, P-1) and (S-2, P-2) have the largest common substructure. The problem has a direct application in predicting the secondary structure of an RNA sequence given a closely related sequence with known secondary structure. The currently most efficient algorithm for this problem requires O(nm(3)) time and O(nm(2)) space where n is the length of the sequence with known arc-annotation and m is the length of the sequence whose arc-annotation is to be inferred. By using sparsification on a new recursive dynamic programming algorithm and applying a Hirschberg-like traceback technique with compression, we obtain an improved algorithm that runs in min{O(nm(2) + n(2)m), O(nm(2) log n), O(nm(3))} time and min{O(m(2) + mn), O(m(2) log n + n)} space.", "paper_title": "A faster and more space-efficient algorithm for inferring arc-annotations of RNA sequences through alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240361100004"}
