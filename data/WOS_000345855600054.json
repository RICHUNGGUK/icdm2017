In addition to the challenges created by the infinite range of styles, existing modeling and capture techniques are particularly constrained by the geometric and topological complexities. We propose a data-driven method to automatically reconstruct braided hairstyles from input data obtained from a single consumer RGB-D camera. Our approach covers the large variation of repetitive braid structures using a family of compact procedural braid models. From these models, we produce a database of braid patches and use a robust random sampling approach for data fitting. We then recover the input braid structures using a multi-label optimization algorithm and synthesize the intertwining hair strands of the braids. We demonstrate that a minimal capture equipment is sufficient to effectively capture a wide range of complex braids with distinct shapes and structures.", "paper_title": "Capturing Braided Hairstyles", "paper_id": "WOS:000345855600054"}
