At first, a nonlinear system with unmodeled dynamics is decomposed by means of Jacobian linearization to an affine part and a higher-order unknown term. The unknown higher-order term resulted from the decomposition, together with the unmodeled dynamics of the original plant, are modeled by using a feedforward neural network via supervised learning. The optimization problem for nonlinear model predictive control is then formulated as a quadratic programming problem based on successive Jacobian linearization about varying operating points and iteratively solved by using a recurrent neural network called the simplified dual network. Simulation results are included to substantiate the effectiveness and illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Model Predictive Control of Nonlinear Systems With Unmodeled Dynamics Based on Feedforward and Recurrent Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310388400003"}
