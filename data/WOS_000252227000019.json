To address these issues, we propose an information fusion framework based on dynamic Bayesian networks to provideactive, dynamic, purposive and sufficing information fusion in order to arrive at a reliable conclusion with reasonable time and limited resources. The proposed framework is suited to applications where the decision must be made efficiently from dynamically available information of diverse and disparate sources.", "paper_title": "Active and dynamic information fusion for multisensor systems with dynamic Bayesian networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252227000019"}
