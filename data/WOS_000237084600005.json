In the past, some authors have already identified Ginsberg's/Fitting's theory of bilattices as a naturally attractive candidate framework for representing uncertain and potentially conflicting preferences, yet none of the existing approaches addresses the real expressive power of bilattices, which lies hidden in their associated truth and knowledge orders. As a consequence, these approaches have to incorporate additional conventions and 'tricks' into their modus operandi, making the results unintuitive and/or tedious. By contrast, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of (rectangular) bilattices in encoding not just the problem statement, but also its generic solution strategy.", "paper_title": "Preference Modeling by rectangular bilattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000237084600005"}
