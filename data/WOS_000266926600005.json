Since the system is designed for ordinary users in non-studio environments, it is composed of standard hardware components, provides a simple interface, and works in near real-time of 5 similar to 6 frames/sec. The proposed system reconstructs a visual hull from acquired multiple videos and then generates final videos from the model by referring to the camera shots used in film-making. The proposed method utilizes \"Reliability\" to compensate for errors that may have occurred in non-studio environments and to produce the most natural scene from the reconstructed model. By using a virtual camera control system, even non-experts can easily convert the 3D model to movies that look as if they were created by experienced filmmakers.", "paper_title": "Toward cinematizing our daily lives", "paper_id": "WOS:000266926600005"}
