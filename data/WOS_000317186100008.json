We propose to use high-order finite-volume techniques with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to reduce the computational cost. The primary complication comes from a solution state comprised of variables of different dimensions. We develop the algorithms required to extend standard single-dimension block structured AMR to the multi-dimension case. Specifically, algorithms for reduction and injection operations that transfer data between mesh hierarchies of different dimensions are explained in detail. In addition, modifications to the basic AMR algorithm that enable the use of high-order spatial and temporal discretizations are discussed. Preliminary results for a standard 1D+1V Vlasov-Poisson test problem are presented. Results indicate that there is potential for significant savings for some classes of Vlasov problems.
