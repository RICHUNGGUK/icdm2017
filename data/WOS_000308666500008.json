The main finding of the proposed approach is that the structure and parameters of a fuzzy rule base can be generated automatically by the proposed PSO. In this method, the best fitness (f(gbest)) and the number (N-gbest) of active rules of the best particle in current generation, the best fitness (f(pbesti)) which ith particle has achieved so far and the number (N-pbesti) of active rules of it when the best position emerged are utilized to determine the active rules of ith particle in each generation. To increase the diversity of structure, mutation operator is used to change the number of active rules for particles. Compared with some other PSOs with different length of particles, the algorithm has good adaptive performance. To indicate the effectiveness of the give algorithm, a nonlinear function and two time series are used in the simulation experiments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can approximate the nonlinear function and forecast the time series efficiently. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
