Furthermore, we exhibit a technique to determine exact, discrete or bounding values for the intersection numbers of two such regular partitions of a DRG. As an application, we perform a structural investigation on the substructures of finite generalized polygons and, besides some new results, we give unifying, alternative and more elegant proofs of the results in Offer (J Combin Theory Ser A 97: 184-186, 2002) and Offer (Discrete Math 294: 147-160, 2005).", "paper_title": "Regular partitions of (weak) finite generalized polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000253199200006"}
