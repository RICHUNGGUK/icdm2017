Feature selection has been already used by some static classifiers where the facial expression is recognized from one single image. Past work on dynamic facial expression recognition has emphasized the issues of feature extraction and classification, however, less attention has been given to the critical issue of feature selection in the dynamic scenario. The main contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we show that dynamic facial expression recognition can be casted into a classical classification problem. Second, we combine a facial dynamics extractor algorithm with a feature selection scheme for generic classifiers. We show that the paradigm of feature subset selection with a wrapper technique can improve the dynamic recognition of facial expressions. We provide evaluations of performance on real video sequences using five standard machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Bayesian Networks, and Classification Trees.
