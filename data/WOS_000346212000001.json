Many next generation optical access network architectures have been proposed to meet high capacity requirement on a per-user basis. However, the capacity upgrade in access networks, may lead to a huge traffic growth in the aggregation/core network. One way to avoid this problem is to keep the traffic locally (i.e., inside the access network area) as much as possible. It can be obtained by using locality-aware peer-to-peer (P2P) applications for content distribution and has the potential to offload the core segment. However, various optical access network architectures accommodate the P2P traffic in different ways. Thus, it is important to study these differences in order to identify the best architecture option for capacity offloading in the core network, energy efficiency and network resource utilization. By deploying a proper architecture in the access segment along with an efficient traffic locality aware strategy, the extra investment and capacity upgrade of the expensive core network resources needed to support the future traffic expansion can be minimized. However, to the best of our knowledge this kind of assessment is so far not available. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the efficiency of supporting locality-aware P2P video distribution algorithm in three main types of optical access network architectures, i.e., active optical network (AON), wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network (WDM PON) and time/wavelength division multiplexing PON (TWDM PON). Our goal is to provide important design guidelines for the next generation broadband access architectures, while minimizing the need for the core network upgrade. We obtain this objective by utilizing the unique characteristics of each access network architecture in accommodating P2P video delivery applications. We have done an extensive literature study and for the first time we have compared performance of these architectures with respect to the amount of the traffic on the links in different aggregation levels, power consumption taking into account sleep mode functionality at the user premises, and required switching capacity in the nodes. Our results reveal that both active and passive architectures have good ability to localize P2P traffic, whereas they show distinct performance with respect to the other aforementioned aspects. This is caused by the different number of aggregation levels, link capacity, and resource allocation protocols. Considering the overall performance evaluation, it is shown that TWDM PON is the most promising option for the future broadband access, where locality-aware P2P video distribution is applied, thanks to its low energy consumption and required switching capacity of the network equipment needed to deliver this service. This conclusion is against the general intuition because of the PON's centralized control plane and passive infrastructure without switching capability in the field. Our unexpected conclusion can be of particular interest to operators as it is perfectly aligned with next generation optical access architecture identified by Full Service Access Networks (FSAN).
