A buffer-less OBS network can be implemented simply and cost-effectively without the need for either wavelength converters or optical buffers which are, currently, neither cost-effective nor technologically mature. However, this type of OBS networks suffers from relatively high loss probability caused by wavelength contentions at core nodes. This could prevent or, at least, delay the adoption of OBS networks as a solution for the next generation optical Internet. To enhance the performance of buffer-less OBS networks, we propose three approaches: (a) a reactive approach, called Reinforcement Learning-Based Deflection Routing Scheme (RLDRS) that aims to resolve wavelength contentions, after they occur, using deflection routing; (b) a proactive multi-path approach, called Reinforcement Learning-Based Alternative Routing (RLAR), that aims to reduce wavelength contentions; and (c) an approach, called Integrated Reinforcement Learning-based Routing and Contention Resolution (IRLRCR), that combines RLAR and RLDRS to conjointly deal with wavelength contentions proactively and reactively. Simulation results show that both RLAR and RLDRS reduce, effectively, loss probability in buffer-less OBS networks and outperform the existing multi-path and deflection routing approaches, respectively. Moreover, simulation results show that a substantial performance improvement, in terms of loss probability, is obtained using IRLRCR. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
