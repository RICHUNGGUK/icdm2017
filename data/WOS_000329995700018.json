Particularly, in event-driven M2M communications, a large number of devices become activated within a short period of time, which in turn causes high radio congestions and severe access delay. To address this issue, we propose a Fast Adaptive S-ALOHA (FASA) scheme for random access control of M2M communication systems with bursty traffic. Instead of the observation in a single slot, the statistics of consecutive idle and collision slots are used in FASA to accelerate the tracking process of network status that is critical for optimizing S-ALOHA systems. With a design based on drift analysis, the estimate of the number of the active devices under FASA converges fast to the true value. Furthermore, by examining the T-slot drifts, we prove that the proposed FASA scheme is stable as long as the average arrival rate is smaller than e(-1), in the sense that theMarkov chain derived from the scheme is geometrically ergodic. Simulation results demonstrate that under highly bursty traffic, the proposed FASA scheme outperforms traditional additive schemes such as PB-ALOHA and achieves near-optimal performance in reducing access delays. Moreover, compared to multiplicative schemes, FASA shows its robustness under heavy traffic load in addition to better delay performance.", "paper_title": "FASA: Accelerated S-ALOHA Using Access History for Event-Driven M2M Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000329995700018"}
