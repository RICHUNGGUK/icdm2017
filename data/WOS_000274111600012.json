To do so, we can find several different measures and indices in the literature. Recently, the h-index, introduced by Hirsch in 2005, has got a lot of attention from the scientific community for its good properties to measure the scientific production of researchers. Additionally, several different indicators, for example, the g-index, have been developed to try to improve the possible drawbacks of the h-index. In this paper we present a new index, called hg-index, to characterize the scientific output of researchers which is based on both h-index and g-index to try to keep the advantages of both measures as well as to minimize their disadvantages.", "paper_title": "hg-index: a new index to characterize the scientific output of researchers based on the h- and g-indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000274111600012"}
