First, a rigorous Gram-Schmidt row sampling is developed to replace the row sampling algorithm in IES3, leading to a more stable algorithm. Second, to further enhance the efficiency of column sampling, a new scheme based on the idea of locating the interpolation points is presented. Error analyses indicate that the proposed schemes have higher accuracies than the original sampling in IES3, especially when the number of sampled points is small. The IES3 that uses one of these improved algorithms is called improved multilevel matrix QR factorization (IMLMQRF). These IMLMQRFs are applied in the magnetoquasistatic analysis of printed circuits on multilayered lossy medium for extractions of inductances and resistances. The frequency dependency of such parameters is also illustrated.", "paper_title": "On sampling algorithms in multilevel QR factorization method for magnetoquasistatic analysis of integrated circuits over multilayered Lossy substrates", "paper_id": "WOS:000240078200017"}
