In this algorithm, each node locally computes the shortest paths connecting itself to nearby nodes based on some link weight function, and then it selects all the second nodes on the shortest paths as its logical neighbors in the final topology. Any energy model can be employed in LSP to design the link weight function whose value represents the power consumption required in the transmission along a link. We analytically prove that such a simple algorithm maintains network connectivity and guarantees that the minimal energy path between any two nodes is preserved in the final topology. Simulation results show that LSP can reduce the energy consumption, especially in heterogenous networks.", "paper_title": "A shortest-path-based topology control algorithm in wireless multihop networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249927900007"}
