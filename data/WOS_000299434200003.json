The Coflex-F is a recently developed interspinous spacer, the makers of which claim that it can provide stabilisation similar to pedicle screw fixation. Therefore, this study compares the biomechanical behaviour of the Coflex-F device and pedicle screw fixation with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) or anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) surgeries by using finite element analysis. The results show that the Coflex-F device combined with ALIF surgery can provide stability similar to the pedicle screw fixation combined with TLIF or ALIF surgery. Also, the posterior instrumentations (Coflex-F and pedicle screw fixation) combined with TLIF surgery had lower stability than when combined with ALIF surgery.", "paper_title": "Biomechanical differences of Coflex-F and pedicle screw fixation combined with TLIF or ALIF - a finite element study", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434200003"}
