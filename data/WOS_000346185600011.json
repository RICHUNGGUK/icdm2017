The mixer employs an ac-coupled current reuse transconductance stage. It performs well under low supply voltages, and is less sensitive to temperature variations and process spread. The mixer operates at an input radio frequency (RF) band ranging from 10.25 to 13.75 GHz, with a fixed local oscillator (LO) frequency of 12 GHz, which down-converts the RF band to an intermediate frequency (IF) band ranging from dc to 1.75 GHz. The mixer is designed in a 65 nm low power (LP) CMOS process with an active chip area of only 0.0179 mm(2). At a nominal supply voltage of 1.2 V and an IF of 10 MHz, a maximum voltage conversion gain (VCG) of 9.8 dB, a double sideband noise figure (DSB-NF) of 11.6 dB, and a linearity in terms of input 1 dB compression point (P (in,1dB)) of -13 dBm are measured. The mixer draws a current of 5 mA from a 1.2 V supply dissipating a power of only 6 mW.", "paper_title": "Folded down-conversion mixer for a 60 GHz receiver architecture in 65-nm CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000346185600011"}
