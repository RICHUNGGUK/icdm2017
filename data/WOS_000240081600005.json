In this paper, we discuss how to manage a large amount of complex biological data by an object deputy database system which can provide rich semantics and enough flexibility. In our system, the flexible inheritance avoids a lot of data redundancy. Our cross class query mechanism allows users to find the more related data based on complex relationships. In addition, the schema evolution of biological data and their annotation can be easily supported along with biological knowledge accumulation. The experiment shows our approach is feasible and more efficient than the traditional ones.", "paper_title": "Realization of biological data management by object deputy database system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081600005"}
