Theoretically this requires two samples. In this paper we explain that one sample can suffice to determine confidence intervals for both O(A vertical bar B) and O(B vertical bar A). The paper closes with the example of measuring the overlap between the secondary sources in mathematics MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH and with a remark on the estimation of the Jaccard index.", "paper_title": "A note on measuring overlap", "paper_id": "WOS:000245923200006"}
