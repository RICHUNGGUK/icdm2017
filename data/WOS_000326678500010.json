One of the main problems affecting this service is the proliferation of unsolicited messages (usually denoted by spam) which, despite the efforts made by the research community, still remains as an inherent problem affecting this Internet service. In this perspective, this work proposes and explores the concept of a novel symbiotic feature selection approach allowing the exchange of relevant features among distinct collaborating users, in order to improve the behavior of anti-spam filters. For such purpose, several Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are explored as optimization engines able to enhance feature selection strategies within the anti-spam area. The proposed mechanisms are tested using a realistic incremental retraining evaluation procedure and resorting to a novel corpus based on the well-known Enron datasets mixed with recent spam data. The obtained results show that the proposed symbiotic approach is competitive also having the advantage of preserving end-users privacy.", "paper_title": "EMAIL SPAM DETECTION: A SYMBIOTIC FEATURE SELECTION APPROACH FOSTERED BY EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000326678500010"}
