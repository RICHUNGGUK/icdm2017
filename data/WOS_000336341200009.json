A wide variety of biometric modalities have been tested so far but several factors paralyze the accuracy of mono-modal biometric systems. Usually, the analysis of multiple modalities offers better accuracy. An extensive review of biometric technology is presented here. Besides the mono-modal systems, the article also discusses multi-modal biometric systems along with their architecture and information fusion levels. The paper along with the exemplary evidences highlights the potential for biometric technology, market value and prospects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
