Results: To overcome this limitation, we have developed an approximate algorithm, PartTree, to construct a guide tree with an average time complexity of O( N log N). The new MSA method with the PartTree algorithm can align similar to 60 000 sequences in several minutes on a standard desktop computer. The loss of accuracy in MSA caused by this approximation was estimated to be several percent in benchmark tests using Pfam. Availability: The present algorithm has been implemented in the MAFFT sequence alignment package (http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac. jp/mafft/software/).
