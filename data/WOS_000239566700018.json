It has been widely reported that they behave much more nicely than what was expected from the worst-case proved bounds, both in terms of the running time and the output quality. In this article, we investigate this puzzling statement by trying to model the average case of lattice reduction algorithms, starting with the celebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz algorithm (L-3). We discuss what is meant by lattice reduction on the average, and we present extensive experiments on the average case behavior of L-3, in order to give a clearer picture of the differences/similarities between the average and worst cases. Our work is intended to clarify the practical behavior of L-3 and to raise theoretical questions on its average behavior.", "paper_title": "LLL on the average", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566700018"}
