The proposed methodology is based on bibliometric techniques and permits a robust multi-dimensional cluster analysis at different levels. The main goal is to form different clusters, maximizing within-cluster homogeneity and between-cluster heterogeneity. The cluster analysis methodology has been applied to the Spanish public universities and their academic staff in the computer science area. Results show that Spanish public universities fall into four different clusters, whereas academic staff belong into six different clusters. Each cluster is interpreted as providing a characterization of research activity by universities and academic staff, identifying both their strengths and weaknesses. The resulting clusters could have potential implications on research policy, proposing collaborations and alliances among universities, supporting institutions in the processes of strategic planning, and verifying the effectiveness of research policies, among others.", "paper_title": "Cluster methods for assessing research performance: exploring Spanish computer science", "paper_id": "WOS:000327219900005"}
