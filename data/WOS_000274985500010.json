Empirically, it is commonly acknowledged that low selection pressure can prevent an evolutionary algorithm from premature convergence, and is thereby more suitable for wide-gap problems. However, there are few theoretical time complexity studies that actually give the conditions under which a high or a low selection pressure is better. In this paper, we provide a rigorous time complexity analysis showing that low selection pressure is better for the wide-gap problems with two optima. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
