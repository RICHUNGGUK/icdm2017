We have developed a large database of ligand binding sites extracted automatically from the Protein Data Bank. This has been combined with a method for calculating binding site similarity based on geometric hashing to create a relational database for the retrieval of site similarity and binding site superposition. It contains an all-against-all comparison of binding sites and holds known protein-ligand binding sites. which are made accessible to data mining. Here we demonstrate its utility in two structure-based applications: in determining site similarity and in aiding the derivation of a receptor-based pharmacophore model.
