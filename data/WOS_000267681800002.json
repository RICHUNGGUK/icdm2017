One of the greatest difficulties in this respect is achieving a streamlined pipeline from business modeling to execution infrastructures. In this paper we present Evie - an approach for rapid design and deployment of event driven collaborative processes based on significant language extensions to Java that are characterized by abstract and succinct constructs. The focus of this paper is to provide proof of concept of Evie's expressability using a recent benchmark known as service interaction patterns. While the patterns encapsulate the breadth of required business process semantics the Evie language delivers a rapid means of encoding them at an abstract level, and subsequently compiling and executing them to create a fully fledged Java-based execution environment.", "paper_title": "Evie - A developer toolkit for encoding service interaction patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000267681800002"}
