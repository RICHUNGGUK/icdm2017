The method is based on explanatory rules written in a procedural formal language, which build the explanation from predefined natural language texts fragments. For better style, a specific text fragment is randomly selected from a group of synonymous expressions. We have implemented 16 groups of explanatory rules and 74 groups of explanatory texts containing about 200 text fragments,", "paper_title": "Generation of natural language explanations of rules in an expert system", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700032"}
