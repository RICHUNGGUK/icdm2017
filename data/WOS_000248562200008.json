Several characteristic morphological and topological quantities are calculated in a series of image-processing steps and can be used to compare single components as well as whole networks of microvascular structures to each other. The effect of the individual image-processing steps is illustrated and characteristic quantities of measured volume datasets are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Characteristic quantities of microvascular structures in CLSM volume datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000248562200008"}
