It often integrates itself with cloud computing and data centers, which help smart grid to provide high robustness and load balancing. Countries within Europe, North America, and East Asia are undergoing a transformation from an antiquated infrastructure to a smart grid. However, some of the problems arise due to the security and privacy issues of the smart grid. In this manuscript, we propose a novel privacy preserving billing protocol based on the priced oblivious transfer, which guarantees the grid operator to get the correct amount of money without knowing the current energy consumption of each customer. Additionally, we also implement the proposed protocol and provide a performance analysis of it.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of privacy preserving billing protocol for smart grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100015"}
