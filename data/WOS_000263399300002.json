Plenty of diverse abnormal heart sounds with identical main specifications and different details representing the ambient noise are indispensably needed to train, assess and improve the skills of medical students in recognizing and distinguishing the primary symptoms of the cardiac diseases. This paper proposes a versatile multiresolution wavelet-based algorithm to first extract the main statistical characteristics of three well-known heart valve disorders, namely the aortic insufficiency, the aortic stenosis, and the pulmonary stenosis sounds as well as the normal ones. An artificial neural network (ANN) and statistical classifier are then applied alternatively to choose proper exclusive features. Both classification approaches suggest using Daubechies wavelet filter with four vanishing moments within five decomposition levels for the most prominent distinction of the diseases. The proffered ANN is a multilayer perceptron structure with one hidden layer trained by a back-propagation algorithm (MLP-BP) and it elevates the percentage classification accuracy to 94.42. Ultimately, the corresponding main features are manipulated in wavelet domain so as to sequentially regenerate the individual counterparts of the underlying signals. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
