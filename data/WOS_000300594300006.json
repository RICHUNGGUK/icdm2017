In this approach, the FCU operates dynamically as the hardware in connection with an integrated flight and propulsion numerical simulation. The simulator is built based on a state-of-the-art hydraulic test bench which experimentally simulates hydraulic loads imposed on the FCU in flight conditions. For this purpose, an electric motor is employed to drive the FCU gear-typed fuel pump using the reference shaft speed signal that comes from the simulation. The HIL simulator developed in this study is finally used to test the FCU and to investigate the interaction between the FCU and overall aircraft performance. The results of HIL simulation demonstrate the functionality of the proposed HIL simulation during flight maneuvers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
