We describe a recently introduced simple conditional phase gate for photons, which relies on only one second order interference at a polarization dependent beam splitter, thereby making additional stability precautions dispensable. The improved quality of the gate is evaluated by performing full process tomography. The obtained process tomography data is fitted by a model based on experimental parameters of the setup which allows predictions on the performance of the gate in multi-photon experiments.", "paper_title": "Experimental analysis of a simple linear optics phase gate", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862500030"}
