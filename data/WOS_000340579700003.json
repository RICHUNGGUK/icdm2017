Accordingly, the security requirements of a PQKD protocol, i.e., unpredictability and fairness, cannot be satisfied in their protocol. A possible solution is also provided to solve the problem.", "paper_title": "UNITARY OPERATION ATTACK AND THE IMPROVEMENT ON PROBABILISTIC QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579700003"}
