The technique incorporates resource distribution, scheduling, and content-aware video streaming taking advantage of a flexible quality of service functionality offered by IEEE 802.16/WiMAX technology. The proposed technique is thoroughly investigated using network simulator software under various real-life m-Health scenarios, which include streaming video over medium access control layer service connections. It is shown that the technique is fully compatible with the WiMAX standard specification and allows a 9-16% increase in the overall network throughput, which is dependent upon the initial system configuration and the selection of WiMAX user parameters.", "paper_title": "Video Distribution Techniques Over WiMAX Networks for m-Health Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000300260000004"}
