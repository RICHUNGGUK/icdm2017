FFSPAN mines all the frequent sequential patterns in large datasets, and solves the problem of searching frequent sequences in a sequence database by searching frequent items or frequent itemsets. Moreover, the databases that FFSPAN scans keep shrinking quickly, which makes the algorithm more efficient when the sequential patterns are longer. Experiments on standard test data show that FFSPAN is very effective.", "paper_title": "Mining sequential patterns in large datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000084"}
