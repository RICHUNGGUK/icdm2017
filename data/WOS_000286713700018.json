In this system, the state-of-the-art classification techniques based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Wilk's lambda analysis were used to classify biscuits into one of four distinct groups: under-baked, moderately baked, over-baked, and substantially over-baked. The accuracy of the system was compared with standard discriminant analysis using both direct and multi-step classifications. It was discovered that the radial basis SVM after Wilk's lambda was more precise in classification compared to other classifiers. Real-time implementation was achieved by means of multi-core processor with advanced multiple-buffering and multithreading algorithms. The system resulted in correct classification rate of more than 96% for stationary and moving biscuits at 9 m/min. It was discovered that touching and non-touching biscuits did not significantly interfere with accurate assessment of baking. However, image processing of touching biscuits was considerably slower compared to non-touching biscuits, averaging at 36.3 ms and 9.0 ms, respectively. The decrease in speed was due to the complexity of the watershed-based algorithm used to segment touching biscuits. This image computing platform can potentially support the requirements of the high-volume biscuit production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
