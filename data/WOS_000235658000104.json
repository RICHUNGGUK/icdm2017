In this paper, we propose a deployment of sensor network for monitoring water flow in any water distribution network. We cover the issues related with designing such a dedicated sensor network by considering types of sensors required, sensors' functionality, data collection, and providing computation serving as leak detection mechanism. The main focus of this paper is on appropriate network segmentation that provides the base for hierarchical approach to pipes' failure detection. We show a method for sensors allocation to the network in order to facilitate effective pipes monitoring. In general, the identified computational problem belongs to hard problems. The paper shows a heuristic method to build effective hierarchy of the network segmentation.", "paper_title": "On sensor network segmentation for urban water distribution monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000104"}
