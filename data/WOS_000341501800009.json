As wafer fabrication has been increasingly complicated in nano technologies, many factors including recipe, process, tool, and chamber with the multicollinearity affect the yield that are hard to detect and interpret. Although design of experiment (DOE) is a cost effective approach to consider multiple factors simultaneously, it is difficult to follow the design to conduct experiments in real settings. Alternatively, data mining has been widely applied to extract potential useful patterns for manufacturing intelligence. However, because hundreds of factors must be considered simultaneously to accurately characterize the yield performance of newly released technology and tools for diagnosis, data mining requires tremendous time for analysis and often generates too many patterns that are hard to be interpreted by domain experts. To address the needs in real settings, this study aims to develop a retrospective DOE data mining that matches potential designs with a huge amount of data automatically collected in semiconductor manufacturing to enable effective and meaningful knowledge extraction from the data. DOE can detect high-order interactions and show how interconnected factors respond to a wide range of values. To validate the proposed approach, an empirical study was conducted in a semiconductor manufacturing company in Taiwan and the results demonstrated its practical viability.", "paper_title": "An empirical study of design-of-experiment data mining for yield-loss diagnosis for semiconductor manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800009"}
