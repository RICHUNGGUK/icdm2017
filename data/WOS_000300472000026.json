A client can visualize various images of 3D objects from a digital hologram, which are reconstructed on different depth planes. The client's requests for reconstruction depths are sent to the server. The server adaptively encodes and transmits the same object image as the client's reconstructed image. When the client changes the reconstruction depth, only the prediction error of the new image is transmitted. Experimental results show that, in some cases, the proposed algorithm reduces more than half of the distortion at the same bitrate compared with the conventional coding technique.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction Depth Adaptive Coding of Digital Holograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000300472000026"}
