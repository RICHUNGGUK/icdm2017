First, Hamming embedding is employed to alleviate the information loss caused by SIFT quantization. The Hamming distances between keypoints in the same cell are calculated and integrated into the SVM kernel to better discriminate different image samples. Second, to highlight the concept-specific visual information, we propose to weight the visual words according to their informativeness for detecting specific concepts. We show that our proposed kernels can significantly improve the performance of concept detection.", "paper_title": "A Hamming Embedding Kernel with Informative Bag-of-Visual Words for Video Semantic Indexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000334583800004"}
