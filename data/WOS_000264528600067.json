It describes the rationale behind some of the key design decisions that guided the design, development, and implementation of the TMiner component-based data mining framework. TMiner is a flexible framework that can be used as a stand-alone tool or integrated into larger business intelligence (BI) solutions. TMiner is a general-purpose component-based system designed to support the whole KDD process into a single framework and thus facilitate the implementation of complex data mining scenarios.
