This paper proposes a fuzzy mathematical programming model for supply chain planning which considers supply, demand and process uncertainties. The model has been formulated as a fuzzy mixed-integer linear programming model where data are ill-known and modelled by triangular fuzzy numbers. The fuzzy model provides the decision maker with alternative decision plans for different degrees of satisfaction. This proposal is tested by using data from a real automobile supply chain.
