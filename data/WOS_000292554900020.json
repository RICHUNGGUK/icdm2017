Topological network parameters can be calculated over RINs and have been correlated with various aspects of protein structure and function. Here we present a novel web server, RING, to construct physico-chemically valid RINs interactively from PDB files for subsequent visualization in the Cytoscape platform. The additional structure-based parameters secondary structure, solvent accessibility and experimental uncertainty can be combined with information regarding residue conservation, mutual information and residue-based energy scoring functions. Different visualization styles are provided to facilitate visualization and standard plugins can be used to calculate topological parameters in Cytoscape. A sample use case analyzing the active site of glutathione peroxidase is presented.", "paper_title": "RING: networking interacting residues, evolutionary information and energetics in protein structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000292554900020"}
