The trajectories of ball and players convey rich tactic information, so the trajectory extraction and analysis are important for the soccer tactic analysis. Previous research on tactic analysis was generally based on finding object's mosaic trajectory which does not capture the rich semantic information of the real-world trajectory. In this paper, we propose a complete framework to systematically analyze soccer tactics. Specifically, we first propose an efficient real-world trajectory extraction method based on field line detection. Secondly, we define and recognize six typical soccer attack patterns for tactic analysis. With experiments on user study, the proposed method can improve the tactic analysis in terms of the conciseness, clarity, and usability.
