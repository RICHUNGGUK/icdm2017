We should consider interconnect planning as early as possible. We propose a postfloorplanning step to reduce the interconnect cost of a floorplan by searching alternative packings. If a packing contains a rectangular bounding box of a group, of modules, we can rearrange the blocks in the bounding box to obtain a new floorplan with the same area, but possibly with a smaller interconnect cost. Experimental results show that we can reduce the interconnect cost of a packing without any penalty in area.", "paper_title": "Optimizing wirelength searching alternative floorplanning", "paper_id": "WOS:000252962500020"}
