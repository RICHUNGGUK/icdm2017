This problem generalizes the classical Independent Set and Induced Matching problems, among several other problems. We show that Induced Graph Matching is fixed-parameter tractable in on claw-free graphs when is a fixed connected graph, and even admits a polynomial kernel when is a complete graph. Both results rely on a new, strong, and generic algorithmic structure theorem for claw-free graphs. Complementing the above positive results, we prove -hardness of Induced Graph Matching on graphs excluding as an induced subgraph, for any fixed complete graph . In particular, we show that Independent Set is -hard on -free graphs. Finally, we consider the complexity of Induced Graph Matching on a large subclass of claw-free graphs, namely on proper circular-arc graphs. We show that the problem is either polynomial-time solvable or -complete, depending on the connectivity of and the structure of G.", "paper_title": "Parameterized Complexity of Induced Graph Matching on Claw-Free Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000340552300007"}
