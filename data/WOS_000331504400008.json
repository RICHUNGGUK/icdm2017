We first present a practical scheme for collecting feedback frames from the receivers by means of simultaneous acknowledgment (ACK) frames collision. Based on these feedback frames, we design an online linear XOR coding algorithm to retransmit the lost packets. Through simulation results we first show that our proposed coding algorithm outperforms all the existing XOR coding algorithms in terms of retransmission rate. We further show that our proposed coding algorithm has the lowest average decoding delay of all the known network coding schemes. XOR coding and decoding only requires addition over GF(2), hence it enjoys lower encoding and decoding computational complexities. Because of these features such an online XOR coding algorithm is also of interest for delay-sensitive applications such as multicast audio video (AV) streaming, and in battery constrained devices such as smartphones.
