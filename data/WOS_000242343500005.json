In this paper, among many problems in direct conversion receivers, the DC offset problem is studied. The origins of the DC offset are summarized, and three self-mixing mechanisms generating the DC offset are modeled to better understand how the static (or time-invariant) and dynamic (or time-varying) DC offsets are produced from the mechanisms. A DC offset cancellation scheme consisting of a static DC offset canceller and a dynamic DC offset canceller is proposed and verified through simulations.", "paper_title": "DC offsets in direct conversion multistandard wireless receivers: Modeling and cancellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242343500005"}
