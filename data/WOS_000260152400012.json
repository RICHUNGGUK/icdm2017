The common method to solve this problem is to use several simulations with training patterns presented in random order, where voting strategy is used to compute the final performance. Recently, an ordering method based on min-max clustering was introduced to select the presentation order of training patterns based on a single simulation. In this paper, another single simulation method based on genetic algorithm is proposed to obtain the presentation order of training patterns for improving the performance of SFAM. The proposed method is applied to a 40-class individual classification problem using visual evoked potential signals and three other datasets from UCI repository. The proposed method has the advantages of improved classification performance, smaller network size and lower training time compared to the random ordering and min-max methods. When compared to the random ordering method, the new ordering scheme has the additional advantage of requiring only a single simulation. As the proposed method is general, it can also be applied to a fuzzy ARTMAP neural network when it is used as a classifier. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
