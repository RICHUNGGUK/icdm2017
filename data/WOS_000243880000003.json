In the case of 3-SAT, the algorithm has an expected running time of poly(n) center dot (4/3)(n) = 0(1.334(n)). In this paper we present randomized algorithms and show that one of them has 0(1.3302(n)) expected running time, improving Schoning's algorithm. (Note. At this point, the fastest randomized algorithm for 3-SAT is the one given by Iwama and Tamaki [IT] that runs in 0(1.324(n)).)", "paper_title": "Randomized algorithms for 3-SAT", "paper_id": "WOS:000243880000003"}
