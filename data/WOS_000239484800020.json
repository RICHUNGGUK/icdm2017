However, because of some obviously redundant transmissions, its packet overhead is very high. Hence, in this paper, three mechanisms are introduced to reduce its the packet overhead. The three mechanisms are PFCN (Pruning of Far Candidate Nodes), CRN (Combining of Relay Nodes), and PRN (Piggybacking of Relay Nodes). Hence, the enhanced protocol is called PCPGSD (PFCN, CRN, and PRN enhanced GSD). Mathematical analysis and simulation tests both show that PFCN, CRN, and PRN can reduce packet overhead greatly. Simulation results show that PCPGSD outperforms some other typical service discovery protocols up to several times. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
