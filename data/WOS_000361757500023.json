Based on a transcriptomic dataset, COREGNET can be used to: reconstruct a large-scale co-regulatory network, integrate regulation evidences such as transcription factor binding sites and ChIP data, estimate sample-specific regulator activity, identify cooperative transcription factors and analyze the sample-specific combinations of active regulators through an interactive visualization tool. In this study COREGNET was used to identify driver regulators of bladder cancer.", "paper_title": "COREGNET: reconstruction and integrated analysis of co-regulatory networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361757500023"}
