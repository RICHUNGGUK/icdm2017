The article draws on literature from PSD, social psychology and software patterns to derive the social influence patterns, which are then implemented in a conceptual system. This paves the way for an important research track within persuasive systems research. The ultimate aim of these persuasive software patterns was to develop generalizable techniques that could aid the development of social support features in any persuasive system.", "paper_title": "Persuasive software design patterns for social influence", "paper_id": "WOS:000342454500011"}
