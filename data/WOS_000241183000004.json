Conventional spreading codes for OCDMA, known as optical orthogonal codes (OOC) spread the signal in the time domain only, which often results in the requirement of a large chip rate. By spreading in both time and wavelength using two-dimensional OOCs, the chip rate can be reduced considerably. This paper presents an overview of 1-D and 2-D optical orthogonal codes as well as some new results relating to bounds on code size and code construction.", "paper_title": "Codes for optical CDMA", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000004"}
