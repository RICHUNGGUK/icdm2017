These language-based checkers do not understand the semantics of software libraries, and therefore cannot be used to detect errors in the use of libraries. In this paper, we introduce STLlint, a program analysis we have implemented for the C++ Standard Template Library and similar, generic software libraries, and we present the general approach that underlies STLlint. We show that static checking of library semantics differs greatly from checking of language semantics, requiring new representations of program behavior and new algorithms. Major challenges include checking the use of generic algorithms, loop analysis for interfaces, and organizing behavioral specifications for extensibility.
