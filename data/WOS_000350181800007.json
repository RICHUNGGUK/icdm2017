We systematically review online banking adoption literature to propose two research models of factors affecting pre-adoption and post-adoption of the online banking. To test our proposed models, we applied a two-stage random-effects meta-analytic structural equation modeling method to data collected from 25,265 cases from primary empirical studies of online banking adoption. Our findings show that ten factors affect consumers' adoption of the online banking. Furthermore, we show that the relative importance of these factors differs depending on consumers' pre-adoption and post-adoption of the online banking. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
