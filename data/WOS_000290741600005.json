Due to the large number of design options available, it is difficult for designers to make optimal design decisions in the early stages of the design cycle. This paper proposes a novel functional modelling framework for CGRA architectures which makes the design space exploration process easier and faster. The framework allows architecture modelling, application mapping and simulation in a single environment, avoiding development of a complex tool set. The proposed approach provides flexibility which allows users to quickly investigate many design options without remodelling. The usefulness and extensibility of the framework is illustrated by presentation of a case study and associated design metrics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
