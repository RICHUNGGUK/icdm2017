Cells assumed to be scanned are included in the so-called neighbor cell list (NCL). Conventionally, the NCL is managed according to the probability of handover of users to a target cell with fixed threshold. Nevertheless, the size of NCL could be significant if this approach is applied to networks with small cells. In this paper, we exploit knowledge of handover probability among cells derived from a handover history to reduce the amount of scanned cells. We introduce dynamic adaptation of the amount of cells to be scanned according to the quality of signal of a serving cell, measured by the UE. We also investigate impact of relation between the handover probability and the signal level to maximize efficiency of this approach. Further, the NCL management considering either summarized handover history of all UE or individual history of each user is compared in our evaluations. As the results show, both methods notably reduce the amount of cells to be scanned, while call drop rate and outage of the users are still negligible as in the conventional way.
