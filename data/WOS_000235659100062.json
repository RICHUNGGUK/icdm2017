There are lots of different, non-interoperable resources in Metropolis. By using Grid, putting the scientific resources together to form a shared metropolis research platform can facilitate the research processes, which could lead to enhance metropolis technique force and innovation ability, i.e, the integration of various biological databases and the data mining service can greatly help the biologist to search, analyze biological sequences. The architecture of the SRP and its main services are introduced in this paper. The way how to integration of scientific data and archives are discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Grid-enabled metropolis shared research platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100062"}
