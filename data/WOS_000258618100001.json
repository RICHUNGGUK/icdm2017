Existing strategies focus on the asymptotic behavior of the empirical mean and variance (respectively EM and EV), known for some types of nondeterministic processes. In this paper, the theoretical asymptotic behaviors of the EM and EV are studied for large classes of second-order stationary ergodic processes, in the sense of the Wold decomposition scheme, including harmonic and evanescent processes. Minimal rates of convergence for the EM and the EV are derived for these processes; they are used as criteria for assessing the stationarity of textures. The experimental estimation of the rate of convergence is achieved using a nonparametric block sub-sampling method. Our framework is evaluated on synthetic processes with stationary or nonstationary mean and variance and on real textures. It is shown that anomalies in the asymptotic behavior of the empirical estimators allow detecting nonstationarities of the mean and variance of the processes in an objective way.", "paper_title": "Assessment of texture stationarity using the asymptotic behavior of the empirical mean and variance", "paper_id": "WOS:000258618100001"}
