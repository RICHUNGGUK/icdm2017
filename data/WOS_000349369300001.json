Such LBSN data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the human movement from their socio-spatial behavior, in order to improve location-based applications like location recommendation. As users can check-in at new places, traditional work on location prediction that relies on mining a user's historical moving trajectories fails as it is not designed for the cold-start problem of recommending new check-ins. While previous work on LBSNs attempting to utilize a user's social connections for location recommendation observed limited help from social network information. In this work, we propose to address the cold-start location recommendation problem by capturing the correlations between social networks and geographical distance on LBSNs with a geo-social correlation model. The experimental results on a real-world LBSN dataset demonstrate that our approach properly models the geo-social correlations of a user's cold-start check-ins and significantly improves the location recommendation performance.", "paper_title": "Addressing the cold-start problem in location recommendation using geo-social correlations", "paper_id": "WOS:000349369300001"}
