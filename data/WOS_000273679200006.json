Nevertheless, due to its inherent cost concerns, a WiMAX mobile station (MS) should preferably contain fewer radio frequency (RF) chains than antenna elements. This is because the former is often substantially more expensive than the latter. Thus, antenna selection, wherein a subset of antennas is dynamically selected to connect to the limited number of RF chains for transceiving, is a highly appealing performance enhancement technique for multi-antenna WiMAX terminals. In this paper, a novel protocol for antenna selection in space division multiple access (SDMA) transmission is developed for the next-generation IEEE 802.16 mobile stations. Both locally and globally optimal selection rules are considered to-ether with various linear precoding designs at the base station (BS). The proposed protocol can readily accommodate various channel situations (e.g., reciprocal and non-reciprocal channels). As demonstrated by analysis and simulation, the proposed protocol delivers considerable performance improvement over conventional IEEE 802.16 terminals that lack antenna selection capability. Moreover, the proposed protocol leverages the existing signaling method defined in IEEE 802.16, thereby incurring a negligible signaling overhead and requiring only minimal modifications of the standard. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first effort to support antenna selection capability for SDMA transmissions in IEEE 802.16 mobile stations.
