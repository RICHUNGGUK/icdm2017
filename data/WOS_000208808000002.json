Although EIT is cheaper and smaller than other imaging systenis and requires no ionizing radiation, the resolution associated with this technique is intrinsically limited and the image reconstruction algorithms proposed up to now are not efficient enough. In addition to low resolution EIT is an ill-posed inverse problem. Block method in EIT is based on electrical properties of materials and used to enhance image resolution and also to improve the reconstruction algorithm. Recently an inverse solution for EIT based on block method has been developed, however, this method uses non-linear algorithm. The present article provides a non-iterative linear inverse solution for the block approach on EIT. Using linear equations in this new approach provides a fast algorithm and the ability to solve complicated block problems. We have assumed that the subject has a 2D rectangular shape and is made up of identical fixed size blocks and all of the particles of each block have the same electrical conductivities. It is shown by computer simulations that this linear reconstruction algorithm employing the block method results in an accurate identification. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.
