This method requires only one shuffle network, rather than the two shuffle networks which are used in conventional designs. In addition, we use a block parallel decoding scheme by suitably mapping between required memory banks and processing units in order to increase the decoding throughput. The proposed architecture is realized for a 672-bit, rate-1/2 irregular LDPC code on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA device. The design achieves an information throughput of 822 Mb/s at a clock speed of 335 MHz with a maximum of 8 iterations.", "paper_title": "A Reduced-Complexity Architecture for LDPC Layered Decoding Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000290998700017"}
