This study of a behavior defined by its absence (i.e., the not using of information) involved the development of a methodology consisting of an iterative performance of a nine-step heuristic leading to a retroductive recognition of absence, here termed RRA. Principal results: The study concluded with a hierarchical taxonomy of the mechanisms that compel a person not to use information. The six primary mechanisms are: 1. Intrinsic somatic (bodily) conditions 2. Socio-environmental barriers 3. Authoritarian controls 4. Threshold knowledge shortfall 5. Attention shortfall 6. Information filtering. Major conclusions: The resultant taxonomy of CNI appears here as a comprehensive checklist with which information workers such as the teacher, librarian, advertiser, politician, or health care professional can respond efficiently and effectively to situations of nonuse of information. For example, a teacher might ask: \"Why are students not responding to what I present?\" Further, the social implications of any compelled behavior touch the very basis of the social contract, and this paper presents a first step toward understanding the compelled aspects of CNI.
