In this letter, we present the dual OVSF code, which can transmit the variable data rates by suing two different modulated signals without loss of the orthogonality. The bit error rate (BER) performance under a multi-user environment suffering the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and correlations of those codes are evaluated. The results demonstrate that the proposed dual OVSF scheme could provide flexible rates and lower correlation values with a slight increase in complexity.", "paper_title": "Construction of dual OVSF codes with lower correlations", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100065"}
