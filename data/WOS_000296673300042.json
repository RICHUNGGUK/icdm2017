For realization of multi-standard and single-chip transceiver, the prototypes were fabricated by 0.18 mu m CMOS process. The proposed PAs can achieve a tunable impedance matching within a wide frequency range by utilizing a resistive feedback and parallel resonator with an inductor and capacitor array. Therefore, the proposed PA has a realization possibility of isolator-less PA which contributes to decrease die area including external component. In other words, the PAs have tunable impedance matching function at their output ends. With a 3.3-V supply, three power amplifiers can cover frequency ranges of 0.9-3.0 GHz, 2.1-5.8 GHz, and 5.7-9.7 GHz, respectively. The PAs realize P-1dB of 21 dBm, P-sat of 22 dBm, and PAE(peak) of larger than 23%. The proposed PAs present a potential to realize multiband transceivers without isolators.", "paper_title": "Tunable CMOS Power Amplifiers for Reconfigurable Transceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300042"}
