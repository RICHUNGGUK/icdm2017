It is based on looking for linear variations of depth in disparity maps, which are obtained by processing a pair of rectified images from two stereo cameras. By applying least-squares fitting over groups of disparity maps columns to a linear model, free paths are detected by giving a certainty using a fuzzy rule. Experimental results on real outdoor images are also presented.", "paper_title": "FUZZY FREE PATH DETECTION BASED ON DENSE DISPARITY MAPS OBTAINED FROM STEREO CAMERAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302474100005"}
