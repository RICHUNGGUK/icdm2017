Several reasons suggest a generalized problem where the target graph can have some overlapping cliques. We show that the problem remains fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in the combination of both parameters: k and a second parameter t describing somehow the complexity of overlap structure. For this result we need a structural property of twins in graphs enabling a certain elimination scheme that finally leads to a small enough subgraph we can branch on. We also give a nontrivial algorithm for problem minimizing the number of disjoint clusters, based on a concise enumeration of all solutions to the original CLUSTER EDITING problem. This generic scheme may become interesting also for other multicriteria FPT problems.", "paper_title": "Fixed-parameter tractable generalizations of cluster editing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238119900033"}
