The use of identical unit capacitors in parallel to form larger capacitances and careful layout design can provide, in many cases, an accuracy of 0.1%. Unfortunately, this technique can be directly applied only if the filter coefficients are rational numbers. In general, coefficient approximations are required, leading to frequency response errors. In this paper, a new design method, using a genetic algorithm, is proposed to find the optimum capacitance ratio approximations by rational numbers which minimize the total number of unit capacitors for a given acceptable frequency response error, in order to save die area.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Capacitance Ratio Assignment for Low-Sensitivity SC Filter Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000278277000003"}
