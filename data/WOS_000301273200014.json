Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be extended to deal with the digital time delay and integration (DTDI) mosaic images and Lukac and Plataniotis (LP) mosaic images. Experimental results on CFA, DTDI, and LP mosaic images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve high embedding capacity while maintaining good image quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
