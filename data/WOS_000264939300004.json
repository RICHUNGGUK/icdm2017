Since the WWW infrastructure provides only very coarse data exchange mechanisms, we introduce a notation for the design of fine-grained conditional data flows between user interface components. These specifications can be interpreted by a data flow controller that automatically provides the data entities to the specified receivers at run-time, relieving developers of the need to implement user interface data flows manually.", "paper_title": "FINE-GRAINED SPECIFICATION AND CONTROL OF DATA FLOWS IN WEB-BASED USER INTERFACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000264939300004"}
