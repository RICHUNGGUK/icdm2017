Specifically we consider the case when each variable can take values in [d] and that each constraint rejects t out of the d(2) possible input pairs. Then, for some universal constant c, we can, in probabilistic polynomial time, find an assignment whose objective value is, in expectation, within a factor 1 - t/d(2) + ct/d(4) log d of optimal, improving on the trivial bound of 1 - t/d(2).", "paper_title": "EVERY 2-CSP ALLOWS NONTRIVIAL APPROXIMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000261329700006"}
