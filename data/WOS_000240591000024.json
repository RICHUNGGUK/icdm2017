This framework proves useful to the dynamical analysis of computations and biomolecular processes. Here a relational formulation of this framework is presented, where the concepts of attractor and recurrence surface in two variants, respectively relating to the two fundamental modalities. A strong link between recurrence and both existence and extent of attractors, in either variant, is established by a novel characterization theorem.", "paper_title": "A relational view of recurrence and attractors in state transition dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000240591000024"}
