The semantic part is given by a quasi-model of the rewrite rules. In this paper we present a variant of semantic labeling in which the quasi-model condition is only demanded for the usable rules induced by the labeling. Our variant is less powerful in theory but maybe more useful in practice.", "paper_title": "Predictive labeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000240072100024"}
