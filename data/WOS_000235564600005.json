The spatial discretization is accomplished by the spectral collocation method and a third-order Runge-Kutta method is used to integrate the time-dependent terms. For the estimation of the subgrid-scale stress tensor, the Smagorinsky model, the dynamic model, the scale-similarity model and the mixed model are used. Their predicting performance for homogeneous shear flow is compared accordingly. The initial Reynolds number varies from 33 to 99 and the initial shear number is 2. Evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy, the growth rate, the anisotropy component and the subgrid-scale dissipation rate is presented. In addition, the performance of several filters is examined.
