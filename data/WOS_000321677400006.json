In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for auditing received results from an outsourced data stream server through \"unsecure communication channels. In our architecture, the server is considered as a black box and the auditing process is fulfilled by cooperation between the data stream owner and users. Our method imposes an ignorable overhead on the user and needs no change in the structure of the server. The probabilistic modeling of the system proves algorithms convergence and the experimental evaluations show very acceptable results.", "paper_title": "A MODEL TO OVERCOME INTEGRITY CHALLENGES OF AN UNTRUSTED DSMS SERVER", "paper_id": "WOS:000321677400006"}
