The method uses dual-Schur domain decomposition to divide a large finite element mesh into a number of smaller subdomains, which are solved independently using a suitable mesh-size and time-step to capture the local spatial and temporal scales of the problem. Continuity of the solution between subdomains is enforced by Lagrange multipliers. It is shown that the proposed method is stable, accurate and computationally more efficient than using a uniform time-step for the entire mesh. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate and corroborate these properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
