In this paper, the upper bound on the size of variable-weight OOCs is improved, a cyclic t-(v, W, lambda, Q) packing is introduced to construct a variable-weight OOC, an upper bound for the number of blocks of t-(v, W, lambda, Q) packings is obtained, and an equivalence between optimal cyclic packing and optimal variable-weight optical orthogonal code is established. Recursive constructions for optimal 2-CP(W, 1, Q; v)s are also presented. By using skew starters and these constructions, infinite classes of optimal (v, W, 1, {1/2, 1/2})-OOCs are obtained for W = {3, 4}, and {4, 5}.", "paper_title": "Optimal Variable-Weight Optical Orthogonal Codes via Difference Packings", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700030"}
