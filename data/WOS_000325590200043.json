The process of missing data satisfies a discrete-time Markov chain with two state components. By using Lyapunov functional approach, some delay-dependent synchronization criteria are first obtained and formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, sufficient conditions on the existence of feedback controllers are derived by employing these newly obtained synchronization criteria. The controller gains can be achieved by solving a set of LMIs. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the design method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
