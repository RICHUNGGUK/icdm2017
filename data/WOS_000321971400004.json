We discuss the defects of global features in present methods and the advantages of local features in object recognition, and briefly explore state-of-the-art recognition methods using local features, especially the main approaches of local feature extraction and object representation. To clearly explain these methods, the problem of local feature extraction is divided into feature region detection, feature region description, and feature space optimization. The main components and merits of these steps are presented. Technologies for object presentation are classified into three types: vector space, sliding window, and structure relationship models. Future development trends are discussed briefly.", "paper_title": "A review of object representation based on local features", "paper_id": "WOS:000321971400004"}
