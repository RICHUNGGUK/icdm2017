However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) and uncertainty of the time series, the k nearest neighbor search over directly indexed precise time series usually encounters serious problems, such as the \"dimensionality curse\" and \"trust ability curse\". Conventionally, many dimensionality reduction techniques and uncertainty processing strategies are proposed separately to break such drawbacks by reducing the dimensionality of time series and simulating the data uncertainty. However, among all the proposed methods, there are no indexing mechanisms to support k nearest neighbor queries over very large uncertain time-series databases. In this paper, we re-investigate PLA for approximating and indexing uncertain time series. In particular, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced PLA-space, and this function leads to a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original uncertain time series, which can lead to no false negatives during the search. In the following, based on five lemmas, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds using R-tree to improve the k nearest neighbor query efficiency. Finally, extensive experiments over synthetic data sets have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PLA together with the proposed lemmas, in terms of both pruning power and wall clock time, compared with the baseline algorithm.", "paper_title": "Efficient k-NN Searching over Large Uncertain Time Series Database", "paper_id": "WOS:000209590300005"}
