This mapping revolution can transform the landscape of the Web into a geographic Web, where information can be organized geographically, so that users can understand information in the proper context. In this paper, we describe a geographic information retrieval system that is able to search for location-specific information in Singapore-based Web sites. The user is able to view their search locations on a satellite map instead of the two-dimensional maps currently used in street directories. The Web-based search engine is able to search for locations based on area names, building names, and groups of landmark types, business names, and business categories. Furthermore, the user is also able to use their current coordinates as a parameter so that the search engine is able to return results in order of the distance from the user's current location.
