The queuenumber qn(G) is the minimum number of queues required in a queue layout of G. The Cartesian product of two graphs G(1) = (V-1 E-1) and G(2) = (V-2, E-2), denoted by G(1) x G(2), is the graph with {< v(1), v(2)>: v(1) is an element of V-1 and v(2) is an element of V-2) as its vertex set and an edge (< u(1),u(2)>), < u(1),u(2)>) belongs to G(1) x G(2) if and only if either (u(1), v(1)) E El and u(2) = v(2) or (u(2), v(2)) is an element of E-2 and u(1) = v(1). Let T-k1,(k2,...,kn) denote the ndimensional toroidal grid defined by the Cartesian product of n cycles with varied lengths, i.e. T-k1,(k2,...,kn) = C-k1 x C-k2 x ... x C-kn where C-k1 is a cycle of length k(i) >= 3. If k(1) =k(2) = ... = k(n) = k, the graph is also called the k-ary n-cube and is denoted by Q(n)(k). In this paper, we deal with queue layouts of toroidal grids and show the following bound: qn(T-k1,(k2,...,kn)) <= 2n - 2 if n >= 2 and k(i) >= 3 for all i = 1, 2,...,n. In particular, for n = 2 and k(1), k(2) >= 3, we acquire qn(T-k1,(k2)) = 2. Recently, Pai et al. (Inform. Process. Lett. 110 (2009) pp.50-56) showed that qn(Q(n)(k)) <= 2n - 1 if n >= 1 and k >= 9. Thus, our result improves the bound of qn(Q(n)(k)) when n >= 2 and k >= 9.", "paper_title": "Queue Layouts of Toroidal Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738600004"}
