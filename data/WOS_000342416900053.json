Using the smoothing of Renyi entropy of order 2, we derive security bounds for L-1 distinguishability and modified mutual information criterion under the classical and quantum setting, and have derived these exponential decreasing rates. These results are extended to the case when we apply epsilon-almost dual universal(2) hash functions. Furthermore, we apply this analysis to the secret key generation with error correction.", "paper_title": "Large Deviation Analysis for Quantum Security via Smoothing of Renyi Entropy of Order 2", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900053"}
