In the current version of IEEE 802.15.4 standard, each node can enter the sleep mode only during the inactive portion of superframe. In our scheme, the coordinator dynamically determines duty cycle and adjusts the interval of sleep mode by varying BO (Beacon Order) based on the arrival rate of packets in the network observed. Analytical results show that our scheme with a proper adjustment of BO can increase the average sleep time and shorten the energy consumption.", "paper_title": "An adaptive energy saving mechanism for the IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000006"}
