In this context, the development of advanced HDTV and 3DTV formats is being successfully adopted by the consumer market, having a strong impact in the way that traditional broadcasting contents are displayed to final users. Together with the above advances in video technology, multichannel spatial audio has also experienced a considerable impulse within the audiovisual industry. However, the need for specific production tools and loudspeaker setups corresponding to multiple competing audio formats seems to be an important factor affecting their adoption by the consumer community. Moreover, it is well-known that the perceived audio quality is highly influenced by the reproduction context, where the existing multimodal interaction between audio and video plays a very important role. This paper presents a formal evaluation of the perceived sound quality provided by several spatial audio formats accompanied with video in the context of television broadcasting. Stereo, advanced surround formats and 3D Binaural sound are evaluated considering a set of representative broadcasting contents (sports, movies, music and animation) to assess their impact on the perceptual attributes contemplated within the international recommendations.", "paper_title": "Subjective quality assessment of multichannel audio accompanied with video in representative broadcasting genres", "paper_id": "WOS:000355809300003"}
