It is shown that, although the new kernel reduces the process of edge distortion, it nonetheless produces artifacts in the processed image. After examining the source of this problem, an analytical scheme is devised to obtain a spatially varying kernel that adapts itself to the diffusivity function. The proposed spatially varying Laplacian kernel is then used in various nonlinear diffusion filters starting from the classical Perona-Malik filter to the more recent ones. The effectiveness of the new kernel in terms of quantitative and qualitative measures is demonstrated by applying it to noisy images.", "paper_title": "An Edge-Adapting Laplacian Kernel For Nonlinear Diffusion Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800012"}
