An ideal CDS protocol for MANETs should create a small CDS and adapt to nodal mobility. Unfortunately, none of the CDS protocols capable of mobility handling have been shown to create a sub-optimal CDS in the past. In this paper, we first prove that our timer-based CDS protocols create a CDS with a sub-optimal size. Although the approximation factors of our timer-based protocols are not the best known result, our protocols can easily accommodate nodal mobility. In addition, we propose the Extended Mobility Handling (EMH) procedures for timer-based CDS protocols to further enhance CDS maintenance in MANETs. Simulation results show that our protocols incorporating EMH successfully prolong the CDS service time while maintaining a competitive size of CDS in MANETs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
