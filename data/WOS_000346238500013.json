A successful grasp is largely determined by the object representation and the corresponding grasp planning strategy. With the help of RGBD camera, the point cloud of the object can be obtained conveniently. However, the large amount of point cloud is often unorganized with some inevitable noise. It may result in the geometry of the object imprecise and lead to some poor grasp planning. In this paper, a parametric model-superquadric is chosen to represent the shape of an object. We firstly recover the superquadric of an object from the raw point cloud in a single view with conjugate gradient method. Then a force-closure grasp planning strategy is applied to this object to obtain stable grasp configurations. Finally we store the grasp parameters as grasp experience in a grasp dataset which can be used for future grasping tasks. The performance of the proposed grasping system is represented both in simulation and actual experiment scenario successfully.", "paper_title": "A system of robotic grasping with experience acquisition", "paper_id": "WOS:000346238500013"}
