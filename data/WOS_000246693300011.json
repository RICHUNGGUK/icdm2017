The generic optimum universal switch block design problem is to design a (k, W)-USB with the minimum number of switches for every pair of (k, W). This problem was first proposed and solved for k = 4 in Chang et al. [1996], and then solved for even W or for k <= 6 in Shyu et al. [2000] and Fan et al. [2002b]. No optimum (k, W)-USB is known for k >= 7 and odd W >= 3. But it is already known that when W is a large odd number, a near-optimum (k, W)-USB can be obtained by a disjoint union of(W - f(2)(k))/2 copies of the optimum (k, 2)-USB and a noncompound (k, f(2)(k))-USB, where the value of f(2)(k) is unknown for k >= 8. In this article, we show that f(2)(k) = k+3-i/3 where 1 <= i <= 6 and i k (mod 6), and present an explicit design for the noncompound (k, f(2)(k))-USB. Combining these two results we obtain the exact designs of (k, W)-USBs for all k >= 7 and odd W >= 3. The new (k, W)-USB designs also yield an efficient detailed routing algorithm.", "paper_title": "The exact channel density and compound design for generic universal switch blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000246693300011"}
