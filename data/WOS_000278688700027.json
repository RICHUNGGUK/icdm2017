The general continuous optimal control problem for a class of hybrid dynamical systems is considered, and it is detailed that how to replace the problem by one in measure space and solve the equivalent finite-dimensional linear problem in a straightforward manner. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm could substantially reduce the solving time, compared with the other techniques.", "paper_title": "A NUMERICAL SCHEME FOR APPROXIMATE OPTIMAL CONTROL OF NONLINEAR HYBRID SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278688700027"}
