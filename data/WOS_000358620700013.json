We describe a new methodology to assess the vulnerability of a circuit to such attacks, taking into account built-in protection mechanisms. Our method is based on accurate modeling of fault effects and detection status expressed by Boolean satisfiability (SAT) formulas. Vulnerability is quantified based on the number of solutions of these formulas, which are determined by an efficient #SAT solver. We demonstrate the applicability of this method for design space exploration of a pseudo random number generator and for calculating the attack success rate in a multiplier circuit protected by robust error-detecting codes.", "paper_title": "Formal Vulnerability Analysis of Security Components", "paper_id": "WOS:000358620700013"}
