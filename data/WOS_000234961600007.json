A coordinate transformation is first derived to cancel the velocity quadratic terms, An observer is then designed to globally exponentially/asymptotically estimate the measured velocities. The controller synthesis is based on Lyapunov's direct method and the backstepping technique. Our proposed controller storks for both internally damped and un-damped cases. Simulations illustrate the soundness of the proposed controller. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
