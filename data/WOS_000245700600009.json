There are service disciplines that can provide end-to-end bandwidth and delay guarantees. However, they are designed to operate with expensive output quenching switches or with combined input-output queuing (CIOQ) switches that require very complicated fabric work with a CIOQ packet switch to provide the same end-to-end QoS guarantees as service disciplines that only work with output queuing (CIOQ) switches that require very complicated fabric schedulers. We propose a novel service discipline, the Framed-deadline Scheduler (FDS), for connection oriented networks. FDS can work with a CIOQ packet switch to provided the same end-to-end QoS guarantees as service disciplines that only work with output queuing switches. The fabric scheduler of the CIOQ switch and the implementation of FDS has O(1) complexity. Hence, FDS is a scalable service discipline that can provide end-to-end QoS guarantee for real-time traffic in hig-speed networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
