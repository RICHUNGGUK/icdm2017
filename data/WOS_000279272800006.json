Rothemund and Winfree showed that uniquely assembling a full N x N square (a square where there is a bond between any two adjacent tiles) at temperature 1 requires N 2 distinct tile types, and conjectured that the minimum number of tile types needed to self-assemble an N x N square (not a full square) is 2N - 1. Our lower bounds imply that a tile system that uniquely assembles an N x N square without binding domains mismatches, requires at least 2N - 1 tile types.", "paper_title": "Two Lower Bounds for Self-Assemblies at Temperature 1", "paper_id": "WOS:000279272800006"}
