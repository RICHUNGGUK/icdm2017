Hence, 3G transmission security has become a popular issue. Recently, Dimitriadis and Polemi proposed a lightweight IDM3G protocol for mutual authentication between users and their service providers. However, many multimedia services require safeguards during transmission over 3G networks to protect the digital rights of music and video, for example. Unfortunately, the Dimitriadis and Polemi protocol does not address this requirement in their protocol, which means their protocol can not be directly applied to design a fair and secure digital rights management mechanism. Therefore, in this paper, we try to improve their protocol by integrating the identity management 3G (IDM3G) and then propose a fair and secure digital rights management mechanism for multimedia content or services over 3G networks. Using our proposed scheme enables service providers to provide time-bounded multimedia content or services and guarantees user privacy, data integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation, as well as forward secrecy and backward secrecy of transferred digital rights with low computation costs.
