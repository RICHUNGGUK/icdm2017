A pilot experiment has been realized with the aim to verify whether there are correlations between the emotional characterization of music excerpts and human movement. Subjects were asked to move a laser pointer on a white wall in front of them while listening to musical excerpts classified with respect to the type of emotions they can induce. Trajectories obtained moving the laser pointer have been recorded with a video camera and have been analyzed in a static and global way by using the EyesWeb platform. Results highlight a difference between trajectories associated to music stimuli classified as \"fast\" and \"slow\", in term of smoothness/angularity, suggesting the existence of a strong link between the emotional characterization of the musical excerpts listened to and the movement performed.", "paper_title": "Subject interfaces: Measuring bodily activation during an emotional experience of music", "paper_id": "WOS:000237042600030"}
