Concepts and theories related to engagement from a variety of disciplines are reviewed. We describe a platform for conducting studies into long-term interactions between humans and virtual agents and present the results of two longitudinal, randomized, controlled experiments in which the effect of manipulations of agent behavior on user engagement was assessed.", "paper_title": "MAINTAINING ENGAGEMENT IN LONG-TERM INTERVENTIONS WITH RELATIONAL AGENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279635100009"}
