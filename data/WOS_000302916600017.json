For a wide range of images, the new algorithm is capable of generating roughly uniform subregions and nicely preserving local image boundaries. The undersegmentation error is effectively limited in a controllable manner. Moreover, VCells is very efficient with core computational cost at O(K root n(c) center dot N) in which K, n(c), and N are the number of iterations, superpixels, and pixels, respectively. Extensive qualitative discussions are provided, together with the high-quality segmentation results of VCells on a wide range of complex images. The simplicity and efficiency of our model are demonstrated by complexity analysis, time, and accuracy evaluations.", "paper_title": "VCells: Simple and Efficient Superpixels Using Edge-Weighted Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations", "paper_id": "WOS:000302916600017"}
