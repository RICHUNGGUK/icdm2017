To achieve fault-tolerance in the distributed systems, healthy processors need to reach a common agreement before performing certain special tasks, even if faults exist in many circumstances. This problem is called as the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem and it must be addressed. In general, the traditional BA problem is solved in well-defined networks. However, the MANETs (Mobile Ad-hoc Network) are increasing in popularity and its network topology is dynamic in nature. in this paper, the BA problem is re-examined in MANETs. Our protocol uses the minimum number of message exchanges to reach an agreement within the distributed system while tolerating the maximum number of faulty processors in MANETs.
