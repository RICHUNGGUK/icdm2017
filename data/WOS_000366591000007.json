Rayleigh Damping model is also used in order to take the effect of internal damping mechanisms into account and thus, to fill in the gap between the designed layouts and those in reality. The success of the proposed algorithm is illustrated through several numerical experiments by revealing a set of various designed optimal layouts besides their corresponding energy distributions.", "paper_title": "Energy management through topology optimization of composites microstructure using projected gradient method", "paper_id": "WOS:000366591000007"}
