By firstly revealing the drawbacks of Harten's original LTS TVD scheme, and reasoning the occurrence of the spurious oscillations, a modified formulation of its characteristic transformation is proposed and a high resolution, strongly robust LTS TVD scheme is formulated. The modified scheme is proven to be capable of taking larger number of time steps than the original one. Following the modified strategy, the LTS TVD schemes for Yee's upwind TVD scheme and Yee-Roe-Davis's symmetric TVD scheme are constructed. The family of the LTS schemes is then extended to multidimensional by time splitting procedure, and the associated boundary condition treatment suitable for the LTS scheme is also imposed. The numerical experiments on Sod's shock tube problem, inviscid flows over NACA0012 airfoil and ONERA M6 wing are performed to validate the developed schemes. Computational efficiencies for the respective schemes under different CFL numbers are also evaluated and compared. The results reveal that the improvement is sizable as compared to the respective single time step schemes, especially for the CFL number ranging from 1.0 to 4.0.
