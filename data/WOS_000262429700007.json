Uncorrelated features are desirable in recognition tasks since they contain minimum redundancy and ensure independence of features. The UMLDA aims to extract uncorrelated discriminative features directly from tensorial data through solving a tensor-to-vector projection. The solution consists of sequential iterative processes based on the alternating projection method, and an adaptive regularization procedure is incorporated to enhance the performance in the small sample size (SSS) scenario. A simple nearest-neighbor classifier is employed for classification. Furthermore, exploiting the complementary information from differently initialized and regularized UMLDA recognizers, an aggregation scheme is adopted to combine them at the matching score level, resulting in enhanced generalization performance while alleviating the regularization parameter selection problem. The UMLDA-based recognition algorithm is then empirically shown on face and gait recognition tasks to outperform four multilinear subspace solutions (MPCA, DATER, GTDA, TR1DA) and four linear subspace solutions (Bayesian, LDA, ULDA, R-JD-LDA).", "paper_title": "Uncorrelated Multilinear Discriminant Analysis With Regularization and Aggregation for Tensor Object Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429700007"}
