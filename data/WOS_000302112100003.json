Block-structured grids are used to fit the complex domain of the extrusion. A finite volume method (FVM) model for aluminium extrusion numerical simulation using non-orthogonal structured grids was established. Design/methodology/approach - The influences of the elements' nonorthogonality on the governing equations discretization of the metal flow in aluminium extrusion processes were fully considered to ensure the simulation accuracy. Volume-of-fluid (VOF) scheme was used to catch the free surface of the unsteady flow: Rigid slip boundary condition was applied on non-orthogonal grids. Findings - This paper involved a simulation of a typical aluminium extrusion process by the FVM scheme. By comparing the simulation by the FVM model established in this paper with the ones simulated by the finite element method (FEM) software Deform-3D and the corresponding experiments, the correctness and efficiency of the FVM model for aluminium alloy profile extrusion processes in this paper was proved. Originality/value - This paper uses the FVM widely used in CFD to calculate the aluminium profile extrusion processes avoiding the remeshing and mesh distortion during aluminium profile extrusion processes simulation when using the finite element method. Block-structured grids with the advantage of simple data structure, small storage and high numerical efficiency are used to fit the complex domain of the extrusion.", "paper_title": "Aluminum alloy profile extrusion simulation using finite volume method on nonorthogonal structured grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000302112100003"}
