Millions of users use web applications to obtain information, perform financial transactions, have fun, socialize, and communicate. Unfortunately, web applications are also frequently targeted by attackers. Recent data from SANS institute estimates that up to 60% of Internet attacks target web applications. In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of a large number of web vulnerability reports with the aim of understanding how input validation flaws have evolved in the last decade. In particular, we are interested in finding out if developers are more aware of web security problems today than they used to be in the past. Our results suggest that the complexity of the attacks have not changed significantly and that many web problems are still simple in nature. Hence, despite awareness programs provided by organizations such as MITRE, SANS Institute and OWASP, application developers seem to be either not aware of these classes of vulnerabilities, or unable to implement effective countermeasures. Therefore, we believe that there is a growing need for languages and application platforms that attack the root of the problem and secure applications by design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
