The general formulas for all the desired probabilities and three ETCs when k screening variables are allocated into r-stages are derived. The optimal allocation combination for each ETC is determined based on the criterion of minimum ETC. Finally, we give two examples to illustrate the selection of the optimal allocation combination for the SQSP.", "paper_title": "The optimal allocation combination for the two-sided sequential screening procedure based on the individual misclassification error", "paper_id": "WOS:000335853000013"}
