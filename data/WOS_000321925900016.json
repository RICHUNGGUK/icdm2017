In this paper, we introduce a notion of the restricted p-isometry constants (0 < p <= 1) and derive a p-RIP condition for exact reconstruction of LMR via Schatten-p quasi-norm minimization. In particular, we determine how many random, Gaussian measurements are needed for the p-RIP condition to hold with high probability, which gives a theoretical result that it needs fewer measurements with small p for exact recovery via Schatten-p quasi-norm minimization than when p = 1.", "paper_title": "Restricted p-Isometry Properties of Nonconvex Matrix Recovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000321925900016"}
