The foraging behavior of some species of bacteria like Escherichia coli can be hypothetically modeled as an optimization process. A group of bacteria search for nutrients in a way that maximizes the energy obtained per unit time spent during the foraging. The proposed approach aims at driving the bacteria through the edge pixels. The direction of movement of the bacteria is found using a direction probability matrix, computed using derivatives along the possible directions. Rules defining the derivatives are devised to ensure that the variation of intensity due to noise is discarded. Quantitative analysis of the feasibility of the proposed approach and its comparison with other standard edge detection operators in terms of kappa and entropy are given. The effect of initial values of parameters of BFA on the edge detection is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
