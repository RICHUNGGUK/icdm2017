When the handset roams out of WLAN coverage, the DM's cellular interface is used to maintain the call by anchoring it through an enterprise PSTN gateway/PBX. Soft handoff can be achieved in this case if the gateway supports basic conference bridging, since a new leg of the call can be established to the conference bridge while the existing media stream path is active. Unfortunately this requires that all intra-enterprise calls be routed through the gateway when the call is established. In this paper we consider a SIP based architecture to perform conferenced dual-mode handoff and propose a much more scalable mechanism for short-delay environments, whereby active calls are handed off into the conference bridge prior to the initiation of the vertical handoff. Results are presented which are taken from a dual-mode handset testbed, from analytic models, and from simulations which characterize the scalability of the proposed mechanism.", "paper_title": "Dynamically anchored conferencing handoff for dual-mode cellular/WLAN handsets", "paper_id": "WOS:000260250700007"}
