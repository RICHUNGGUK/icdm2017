Power consumption and area are crucial in this application, since one ADC is associated with each read channel. The read-channel specifications of the probe storage device require an ADC with seven bits of resolution at a rate of 100 kSample/s. Five different ADC architectures have been implemented for the desired specifications: a first- and a second order discrete-time a second order continuous-time and a cyclic ADC. The system and circuit design methods of each architecture are presented. The different architectures are compared based on the measurement results of the five fabricated circuits.", "paper_title": "Compact and low power ADCs for a MEMS-based probe storage device", "paper_id": "WOS:000320888500003"}
