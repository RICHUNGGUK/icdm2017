These equations present the velocity and acceleration response spectra at 5% damping ratio as continuous period functions, within range of 0.1 to 4 seconds. So far many equations have been presented and the recent suggested proportions are functions of several parameters. In this research, due to easy usage and lack of information in Iran, only the magnitude of earthquake, the distance between earthquake source and the location and the ground type are used as important factors. Iranian plateau is divided into two zones: Alborz-Central Iran and Zagros, each of which is divided into rock and soil region according to the ground type. Regarding the fact that the occurred and reported earthquakes in Iran are shallow, surface wave magnitude (Ms) is used in this study. Moreover, hypocentral distance is considered as distance between the earthquake source and the location. To obtain the velocity and acceleration response spectra, a Gene Expression Programming(GEP) algorithm is used which utilizes no constant regression model and the model is acquired smartly as a continuous period function. The consequences show a consistency with high proportionality coefficient among the observed and anticipated results.", "paper_title": "Ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for elastic response spectra in the Iranian plateau using Gene Expression Programming (GEP)", "paper_id": "WOS:000336491200020"}
