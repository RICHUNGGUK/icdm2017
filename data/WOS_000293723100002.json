However, there is no perfect durability test method till now. In this research an alternative method, which is based on the cumulative moisture loss percent of the concrete specimens after oven-drying, was proposed to estimate the durability performance of the concrete. Two temperatures were considered for the oven-drying tests: 100 degrees C and 200 degrees C. Test results showed that oven-drying at 200 C was obviously an unsuitable procedure to preserve the fragile microstructure of cement-based materials. By contrast, experimental results through oven-drying at 100 degrees C allowed estimating the moisture loss percent of cement-based materials in a more rational manner. Moreover, the magnitudes of the cumulative moisture loss percent obtained from oven-drying tests at 100 degrees C for 48 hours have good correlations with the data of other well-known methods, namely, electrical resistance test, water permeability test, and mercury intrusion porosimetry test. This investigation established that regarding the oven-drying test as one of the tests for evaluating the potential durability of concrete is considerably practicable.", "paper_title": "Feasibility of utilizing oven-drying test to estimate the durability performance of concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000293723100002"}
