As opposed to object categorization, this task is focused on capturing fine image differences in a pose-dependent fashion. Our research addresses this particular family of problems and is centered around the concept of learning from example pairs. Formally, we construct a parameterized visual similarity function optimally separating the pairs of images that depict the objects of the same class or identity from the pairs representing different object classes/identities. It combines various image distances that are quantified by comparing local descriptor responses at the corresponding locations in both paired images. To find the best combinations, we train ensembles of so-called Kernel Regression Trees which model the desired similarity function as a hierarchy of fuzzy decision stumps. The obtained function is then used within a k-NN-like framework to address complex multi-classification problems. Through the experiments with several image datasets we demonstrate the numerous advantages of the proposed approach: high classification accuracy, scalability, ease of interpretation and the independence of the feature representation.
