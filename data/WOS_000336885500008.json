The assumption is that mobile nodes require the same quality of services as fixed nodes. However, due to the mobility feature within a mobile network, it is difficult to achieve this goal. Besides, routing methods in a mobile IPv6 network deliver packets from a correspondent node to the mobile node and vice versa via specific tunnel. In the tunnel, packets are encapsulated and routers do not have any access to the original packets. This results in the situation where resource reservation cannot be handled at the routers. For this purpose, a new cross layer design called Resource Reservation over Mobile Application (ROMA) is proposed. In this design, modified mobility signaling collects QoS parameters through the network. Then, these parameters are used to make the desired level of QoS for real-time applications. Traffic engineering is also proposed based on effective envelope algorithm to improve network resource utilization. It allows a fraction of traffic to exceed QoS requirements. Simulation is used to evaluate the proposed approach by considering parameters such as the number of reservation request messages, link throughput, and end-to-end delay. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances the link utilization, while maximizing the link throughput in comparison with recent works. The proposed approach also reduces the traffic reroute time when router or link failure occurs in network.", "paper_title": "A Novel Resource Reservation Based on Cross Layer Design over Mobile Internet Protocol Version 6", "paper_id": "WOS:000336885500008"}
