The presented optimisation procedure aims at minimising the cost of infrastructure expansion for any given scenario of future demand. The optimisation procedure is designed as a matheuristic - a hybridisation of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and a simulated annealing based scheduler. The optimisation procedure is iterative in nature and has the following distinctive features. Each iteration starts with generating a MILP model and finding a minimal cost infrastructure expansion for this model. Then, the scheduler analyses the MILP solution by constructing a schedule. In constructing this schedule, the scheduler reduces its search space using the MILP solution. The scheduler identifies bottlenecks in the infrastructure, which are used for generating a new MILP model at the next iteration. The MILP and the scheduler use different levels of data aggregation and their interaction mechanism is designed as a solution process of a bi-criteria optimisation problem. The computational experiments on data, originating from the world's largest coal exporter, shows the ability of the developed matheuristic to solve industrial-scaled instances of the problem.
