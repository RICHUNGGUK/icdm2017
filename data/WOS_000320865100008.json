A great similarity between the security requirements of the image robust digest and biometric template is found through the analysis and comparison between the vulnerability of the robust hash-based image authentication system and the biometric authentication system. A security improvement scheme of image robust hash is proposed in this paper based on fuzzy commitment scheme, which is originally a biometric template protection scheme. In our scheme, it is unnecessary to store the image robust digest in the database directly. In addition, the matching operation can be implemented in the cryptographic field. Many security weaknesses, such as the weakness induced by the poor diffusion of an image robust hash algorithm, can be overcome. The experimental results have also proved the feasibility of our scheme.", "paper_title": "Improve the security of image robust hash using fuzzy commitment scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000320865100008"}
