LDHC and LDH6A genes were located in tandem on chromosome 11. while LDH6B and LDH6C genes were on chromosomes 15 and 12, respectively Opossum LDHC and LDH6B genes were located in tandem with the opossum LDHA gene on chromosome 5 and contained 7 (LDHA and LDHC) of 8 (LDH6B) exons An amino acid sequence prediction for the opossum LDH6B subunit gave an extended N-terminal sequence. similar to the human and mouse LDH6B sequences, which may support the export of this enzyme into mitochondria. The platypus genome contained at least 3 LDH genes encoding LDHA, LDHB and LDH6B subunits. Phylogenetic studies and sequence analyses indicated that LDHA, LDHB and LDH6B genes are present in all mammalian genomes examined, including a monotreme species (platypus), whereas the LDHC gene may have arisen more recently in marsupial mammals (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Computational analyses of mammalian lactate dehydrogenases: Human, mouse, opossum and platypus LDHs", "paper_id": "WOS:000271136300006"}
