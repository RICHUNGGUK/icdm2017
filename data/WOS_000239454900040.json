In order to design a clinically based MIR system, the MIR specific x-ray properties in breast tissue must be analyzed to determine which are diagnostically useful. Developing MIR as an imaging modality also requires developing new phantoms that incorporate x-ray refraction and ultrasmall angle scatter in addition to traditional x-ray absorption. Three breast cancer specimens were imaged using MIR to demonstrate its MIR specific x-ray properties. An uncompressed anthropomorphic breast phantom with an imbedded low absorption contrast acrylic sphere was imaged to provide a physical model of how the unique properties of MIR can be utilized to improve upon conventional mammography and illustrate how these can be used to design a clinically useful imaging system.", "paper_title": "Application of the Multiple Image Radiography method to breast imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900040"}
