It is seen that the flow is very sensitive to Re. A continuous adjoint based method is formulated and implemented for the design of airfoils at low Reynolds numbers. The airfoil shape is parametrized with a non-Uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). Optimization studies are carried out using different objective functions namely: (1) minimize drag (2) maximize lift, (3) maximize lift to drag ratio, (4) minimize drag and maximize lift and (5) minimize drag at constant lift. The effect of Reynolds number and definition of the objective function on the optimization process is investigated. Very interesting shapes are discovered at low Re. It is found that, for the range of Re studied, none of the objective functions considered show a clear preference with respect to the maximum lift that can be achieved. The five objective functions result in fairly diverse geometries. With the addition of an inverse constraint on the volume of the airfoil the range of optimal shapes, produced by different objective functions, is smaller. The non-monotonic behavior of the objective functions with respect to the design variables is demonstrated. The effect of the number of design parameters on the optimal shapes is studied. As expected, richer design space leads to geometries with better aerodynamic properties. This study demonstrates the need to consider several objective functions to achieve an optimal design when an algorithm that seeks local optima is used.
