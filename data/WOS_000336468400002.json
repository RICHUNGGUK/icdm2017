Computational models replicating such human ability may contribute to the practical use of robots in daily human living environments; however, primarily because of scalability problems that conventional machine learning algorithms suffer from, sensory-motor information processing in robotic applications has typically been achieved via modal-dependent processes. In this paper, we propose a novel computational framework enabling the integration of sensory-motor time-series data and the self-organization of multimodal fused representations based on a deep learning approach. To evaluate our proposed model, we conducted two behavior-learning experiments utilizing a humanoid robot; the experiments consisted of object manipulation and bell-ringing tasks. From our experimental results, we show that large amounts of sensory-motor information, including raw RGB images, sound spectrums, and joint angles, are directly fused to generate higher-level multimodal representations. Further, we demonstrated that our proposed framework realizes the following three functions: (1) cross-modal memory retrieval utilizing the information complementation capability of the deep autoencoder; (2) noise-robust behavior recognition utilizing the generalization capability of multimodal features; and (3) multimodal causality acquisition and sensory-motor prediction based on the acquired causality.
