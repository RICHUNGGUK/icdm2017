Traditional weighting models such as BM25 and Language model can only take advantage of query terms. IR is a complex process that may be affected by a series of heterogeneous features. It is necessary to refine first-pass retrieval results by taking rich features into account. Traditional heuristic re-ranking approaches can only take advantage of a small number of homogeneous features that may affect information retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a regression-based document re-ranking approach for IR, in which we use SVM regression model to learn a re-ranking function automatically. Under this regression-based framework, we can take advantage of rich features to re-rank the firs-pass retrieved documents by traditional weighting models. We conduct a series of experiments on four standard IR collections in two different languages. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can significantly improve the retrieval performance over the first-pass retrieval. Moreover, by refining the first-pass retrieved document set, the traditional pseudo relevant feedback approaches can also be enhanced. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
