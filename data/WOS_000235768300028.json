However, it is common to see a far from optimal local alignment when attempting to model a face that is quite different from training faces. In this paper, we present a novel component-based AAM algorithm. By modelling three components inside the face area, then combining them with a global AAM, face alignment achieves both local as well as global optimality. We also utilize local projection models to locate face contour points. Compared to the original AAM, our experiment shows that this new algorithm is more accurate in shape localization as the decoupling allows more flexibility. Its insensitivity to different face background patterns is also clearly manifested.", "paper_title": "Component-based active appearance models for face modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300028"}
