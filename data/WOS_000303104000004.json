In order to properly manage product cost and initialization performance, vendors face serious challenges in system design and analysis. Thus, the timing analysis of system initialization and crash recovery for a segment-based flash translation layer has become an important research topic. This article focuses on system initialization, crash recovery, and timing analysis. The timing analysis of system initialization involves the relationship between the size of the main memory and the system initialization time. The timing analysis of crash recovery explains the worst case recovery time. The experiments in this study show that the timing analysis of system initialization and crash recovery can be applied to the segment-based flash translation layer.", "paper_title": "Timing Analysis of System Initialization and Crash Recovery for a Segment-Based Flash Translation Layer", "paper_id": "WOS:000303104000004"}
