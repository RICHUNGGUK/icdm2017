An important aspect of WSANs is coordination. Unlike conventional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), sensor and actuator nodes must work hand-in-hand to collect and forward data, and act on any sensed data collaboratively, promptly and reliably. To this end, this paper reviews current state-of-the-art techniques that address this fundamental problem: More specifically, we review techniques in the following areas: (i) sensor-actuator coordination, (ii) routing protocols, (iii) transport protocols, and (iv) actuator-to-actuator coordination protocols. We provide an extensive qualitative comparison of their key features, advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we present unresolved problems and future research directions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
