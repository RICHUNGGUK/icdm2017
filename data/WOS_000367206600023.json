This results in variation in the speed and power consumption of a circuit. As a solution to process-induced variations, circuits are conventionally implemented with conservative design margins to guarantee the target frequency of each hardware component in manufactured multiprocessor chips. This approach, referred to as worst-case design, results in a considerable circuit upsizing, in turn reducing the number of dies on a wafer. This work deals with the design of real-time systems for streaming applications (e.g., video decoders) constrained by a throughput requirement (e.g., frames per second) with reduced design margins, referred to as better-than-worst-case design. To this end, the first contribution of this work is a complete modeling framework that captures a streaming application mapped to an NoC-based multiprocessor system with voltage-frequency islands under process-induced die-to-die and within-die frequency variations. The framework is used to analyze the impact of variations in the frequency of hardware components on application throughput at the system level. The second contribution of this work is a methodology to use the proposed framework and estimate the impact of reducing circuit design margins on the number of good dies that satisfy the throughput requirement of a real-time streaming application. We show on both synthetic and real applications that the proposed better-than-worst-case design approach can increase the number of good dies by up to 9.6% and 18.8% for designs with and without fixed SRAM and IO blocks, respectively.", "paper_title": "Maximizing the Number of Good Dies for Streaming Applications in NoC-Based MPSoCs Under Process Variation", "paper_id": "WOS:000367206600023"}
