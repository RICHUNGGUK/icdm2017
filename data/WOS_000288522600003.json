However, they have been mainly focusing on dealing with one or two separate proxy situations each. In this article, the authors proposed the generalization of the (t(1)/n(1) - t(2)/n(2)) proxy signature scheme based on the factorization of the square root modulo of a composite number. This scheme can be applied to every proxy situation. The (t(1)/n(1) - t(2)/n(2)) proxy signature scheme allows the original group of original signers to delegate their signing capability to a designated proxy group of proxy signers. Any verifier can verify the proxy signatures on the messages with the knowledge of the identities of the actual original signers and the actual proxy signers. Furthermore, all possible attacks that have been analyzed so far have failed to break the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "GENERALIZATION OF PROXY SIGNATURE BASED ON FACTORIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600003"}
