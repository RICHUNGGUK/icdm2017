We introduce a three-index vehicle-flow formulation of the problem, which is strengthened with valid inequalities, and we derive a branch-and-cut algorithm capable of providing tight lower bounds and solving small-to medium-size instances in short to moderate computing times. Furthermore, we present a hybrid metaheuristic capable of providing high quality solutions in short computing times. The two algorithms are tested on several instances from the CVRP literature modified to mimic the two problems that motivate our study.", "paper_title": "Exact and Heuristic Algorithms for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems with Quadratic Costs Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000366057400005"}
