This research aims to overcome these problems. Design/methodology/approach - This research deals with parallel explicit finite element simulation with domain decomposition for seismic response analysis of immersed tunnel, which is the non-linear and time-dependent behavior of complex structures in engineering. A domain decomposition method based on parallel contact algorithm and dynamic-explicit time integration procedure are used, and the latter is used for the solution of the semi-discrete equations of motion, which is very suited for parallel processing. Using the high performance computer SGI Onyx3800, the seismic response analysis of the immersed tunnel in Shanghai is processed with more than 1.2 million nodes and more than 1 million elements in final finite element model. Findings - The results show numerical scalability of this algorithm and reveal the dangerous joints in this immersed tunnel under Tangshan seismic acceleration, and it could also provide references for the antiseismic design of the immersed tunnel. Originality/value - With the increasing demands in the scale, accuracy and speed of numerical simulation in geotechnical engineering, parallel computing has its great application in this area. This paper fulfils an identified method need, and it is believed more and more research work will be devoted to this research field in the near future.", "paper_title": "Parallel computing for seismic response analysis of immersed tunnel with domain decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000245516700010"}
