Using data collected from 322 IT employees and their supervisors in Chinese software companies, we also examine the impact of the Confucian work ethic on deviant behavior. The results suggest that both co-workers' production deviance and the Confucian work ethic have impacts on individuals' production deviance. The influence of IT co-workers' production deviance was greater in high team climates and low team climates than in neutral team climates. The Confucian work ethic has no significant influence on production deviance in low team climates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Does IT team climate matter?
