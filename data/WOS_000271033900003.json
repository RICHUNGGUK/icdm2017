The disturbance are supposed to include two parts. One is generated by an exogenous system, which can represent the harmonic signals with modelling perturbations in structural system. The other part is external excitation in H(2)-norm context. The disturbance observers based on regional pole placement and D-stability theory are presented, which can be designed separately from the controller design. By integrating the disturbance observer with TSMC law, the disturbance with the exogenous system can be estimated and compensated, and external excitation can be attenuated in finite time. Finally, simulations for a four-degree-of-freedom building model excited by 1940 El Centro earthquake excitation are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and compare the proposed results with the previous schemes with accuracy.", "paper_title": "Composite disturbance-observer-based control and terminal sliding mode control for uncertain structural systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033900003"}
