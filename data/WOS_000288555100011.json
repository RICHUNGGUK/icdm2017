Scheduling as a packet prioritizing mechanism at Data Link Layer (DLL) contributes to QoS guarantee provisioning significantly. In this paper, a novel packet scheduler is developed in wireless cellular networks. The proposed scheme provides QoS-guaranteed service for the applications running on the sensor nodes in all the three aspects of QoS, i.e. data rate, packet loss and packet delay with regard to jitter simultaneously. We establish a three-dimensional space with certain basis vectors for QoS and introduce the efficient point of performance in terms of QoS provisioning in that space. Then we develop a generalized metric, the QoS-deviation, which is the Euclidean distance between the QoS work point of flows and the QoS efficient point in the proposed space. Based on this metric, a novel scheduling approach, namely AQDC, is designed which makes it possible to tune the trade-off between QoS provisioning and throughput optimization in an adaptive manner depending on the current Cell QoS-deviation level (CDL). Furthermore, we also develop another scheduler, namely ARTC, which is the residual-time version of the AQDC scheduler. Finally, a QoS-deviation-based CAC policy will be introduced which can be applied to all schedulers without any consideration about their structure and can be employed in cellular packet switched networks.", "paper_title": "Adaptive QoS scheduling in wireless cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000288555100011"}
