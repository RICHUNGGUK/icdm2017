The imperfect measurement output is subject to probabilistic data missing and sensor saturations. The missing phenomenon of the sensor measurement is governed by a stochastic variable satisfying the Bernoulli random binary distribution law, and the sensor saturation is considered to reflect the limited capacity of the communication networks. The parameter uncertainties are assumed to be norm-bounded and enter into the linear part of the system model in both directions. Through available but imperfect output measurements, a state estimator is designed to estimate the system states in the presence of data missing, sensor saturation, parameter uncertainties as well as stochastic perturbations. By defining an energy-like functional and conducting some stochastic analysis, several sufficient criteria in terms of matrix inequalities are established, which not only ensure the existence of the desired estimator gains but also guarantee the globally robustly asymptotic stability in the mean square of the estimation error dynamics. Finally, two numerical examples are exploited to show the effectiveness of the design method proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Robust state estimation for two-dimensional stochastic time-delay systems with missing measurements and sensor saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000329309800010"}
