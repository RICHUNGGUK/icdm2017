By the multiple Lyapunov functions theory, sufficient condition is developed to ensure robustly global stability and a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level for the resulting closed-loop networks in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A convex optimization problem is formulated to determine the optimal state feedback H-infinity controller which guarantees the optimal H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
