A breast partitioning scheme is derived from simple geometric primitives and well-defined anatomical points. Relevant measurements can be extrapolated from breast partition. Our method has been tested on a number of breast 3D models acquired by means of a commercial scanner on real clinical cases.", "paper_title": "Objective outcome evaluation of breast surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300095"}
