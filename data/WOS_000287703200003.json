The generation of 2.5 Gb/s optical DPSK and PSK signals, fiber propagation and wireless transmission over 15 GHz subcarrier are illustrated with very low sensitivity of -26 and -32 dBm, respectively. Moreover, based on the wireless polarization diversity techniques, we successfully performed the transmission of 1.3 Gb/s uncompressed high definition television (HDTV) signals with high quality.", "paper_title": "Heterodyne mixing and polarization diversity techniques in radio over fiber system with high sensitivity and dispersion tolerance", "paper_id": "WOS:000287703200003"}
