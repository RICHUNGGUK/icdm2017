Inclusions are foreign objects that are naturally formed in raw stock during the formation of diamond (see Fig. 1). The algorithm proposed in the present paper performs a full reconstruction of three-dimensional models of inclusions from photo images. Three-dimensional models of inclusions are based on a voxel representation. The algorithm performs the coloring of voxels and the segmentation of a voxel grid and constructs polygonal models of inclusions. Experiments carried out on real and synthetic data show that the algorithm can reconstruct three-dimensional models of medium- and large-size inclusions, which may serve as a first approximation for the methods of refinement of the shape of inclusions.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of opaque inclusions in objects with high refractive index", "paper_id": "WOS:000339911900004"}
