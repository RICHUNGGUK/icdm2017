As helicopters are highly unstable and exhibit complicated dynamical behavior, it is particularly difficult to design controllers that achieve high performance over a broad flight regime. While these aircraft are notoriously difficult to control, there are expert human pilots who are nonetheless capable of demonstrating a wide variety of maneuvers, including aerobatic maneuvers at the edge of the helicopter's performance envelope. In this paper, we present algorithms for modeling and control that leverage these demonstrations to build high-performance control systems for autonomous helicopters. More specifically, we detail our experiences with the Stanford Autonomous Helicopter, which is now capable of extreme aerobatic flight meeting or exceeding the performance of our own expert pilot.", "paper_title": "Apprenticeship Learning for Helicopter Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000267716300031"}
