Cloud Computing technology can reduce the heavy burden of managing numerous complicated data from a local home server. However, it also brings serious security vulnerabilities, because all operations of the Smart Home are managed by a third-party service provider and the data is stored in a outdoor centralized storage facility. Specially, the security of home security systems for Cloud-based Smart Homes should be carefully reconsidered. This is because the home security system is a crucial factor towards maintaining the safety of home. In this paper, we propose a security mechanism that supports user authentication and data confidentiality for Cloud-based Smart Home Security Systems (C-SHSS). In particular, we suggest a dynamic delegation of authority for allowing temporary visitors' access to the C-SHSS. Then, we present a remote control system for Cloud-based Smart Homes by applying the proposed security mechanism and by implementing Android-based home security control app.", "paper_title": "A Remote Control System for Cloud-Based Smart Homes Supporting Dynamic User Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000345885500020"}
