In this paper, we consider the problem of how to support video multicast with MD video in ad hoc networks. We follow an application-centric, cross-layer routing approach with the objective of minimizing the overall video distortion. We propose an MD video multicast scheme where multiple source trees are used. Furthermore, each video description is coded into multiple layers in order to cope with diversity in wireless link bandwidths. Based on this multicast model, we formulate the cross-layer multicast routing as a combinatorial optimization problem and propose an efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based metaheuristic solution procedure. Performance comparison with existing approaches show significant gains for a wide range of network operating conditions.", "paper_title": "Multiple description video multicast in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000236147100006"}
