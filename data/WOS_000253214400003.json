In particular, AFR systems offer capabilities for recognising high-level geometrical entities, features, in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. However, the recognition performances of most of the existing AFR systems are limited to the requirements of specific applications. This paper presents automatic knowledge acquisition techniques to support the development of AFR systems that could be deployed in different application domains. In particular, a method to generate automatically feature recognition rules is proposed. These rules are formed by applying an inductive learning algorithm on training data consisting of feature examples. In addition, a technique for defining automatically feature hints from such rule sets is described. The knowledge acquisition techniques presented in this study are implemented within a prototype feature recognition system and its capabilities are verified on two benchmarking parts.", "paper_title": "Knowledge acquisition techniques for feature recognition in CAD models", "paper_id": "WOS:000253214400003"}
