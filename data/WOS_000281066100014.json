The method does not require a priori symmetric information. More significantly, periodic structure can be adjusted automatically during the iteration process. In this article, we apply our method to AB linear diblock copolymer melt, thus reproduce all known stable phases, and reveal some meta-stable phases. It is worthy to point out that we also give an efficient strategy to estimating initial values for diblock copolymer system. Finally, by comparing with Matsen-Schick's method, we show some advantages of our method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
