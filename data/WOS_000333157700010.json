In this network, service provider not only offers downloading services, but also pre-pushes resources to users for caching. Users can download their demanded resources while working as servers for uploading the cached data. Also the mobile characteristic makes high package losing probability in this network. So we study how the service provider pre-pushes or the user downloads resources efficiently and effectively while considering the package losing in this paper. We build utility models for service provider and user, and solve the models using Bellman's theory to achieve Nash Equilibrium which shows the service provider's optimal pre-pushing speed and user's optimal downloading speed. The numerical simulation demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed pre-pushing and downloading scheme by comparing to the traditional scheme.", "paper_title": "Novel Pre-pushing & Downloading Model in Mobile Peer-assisted Streaming Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000333157700010"}
