However, originally Ethernet was not devised to scale in such environments: its design does not contemplate essential requirements of larger and more complex networks, such as the need for resilience, scalability, or even integrated control features. Furthermore, its spanning-tree based forwarding results in slow convergence and weak resource efficiency. Specifically focusing on Ethernet's forwarding behaviour, this survey covers solutions that enhance the Ethernet's path computation, allowing it to scale in larger, more complex environments. General notions concerning the application of Ethernet in Metro areas are also provided, as a specific example of Ethernet's application in large scale networks.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Advanced Ethernet Forwarding Approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000275620400008"}
