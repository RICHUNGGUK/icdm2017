The identification of the protein-coding region in transcript sequences is a prerequisite for systematic amino acid-level analysis and more specifically for domain identification. In this article, we present FrameDP, a self-training integrative pipeline for predicting CDS in transcripts which can adapt itself to different levels of sequence qualities.", "paper_title": "FrameDP: sensitive peptide detection on noisy matured sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000263834600020"}
