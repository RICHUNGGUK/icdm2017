To partially address these challenges, we present a novel target tracking algorithm that can be deployed on various sensor nodes and invoked dynamically when needed by the presence of targets. We also demonstrate that an auction-based mechanism can be used to provide efficient and localized wireless sensor network congestion management for bursty traffic of abstract services based just on user-assigned priorities to different services and the quality of information provided by the services. We present results from using this auction mechanism to resolve congestion caused by packets from competing target tracking missions.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Service Execution in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278227500004"}
