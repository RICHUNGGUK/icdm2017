In our setting p(1), P-2,...,p(m) may be arbitrary points (possibly, with rational and/or irrational coefficients) and the dimension n may be any arbitrary fixed integer. We reduce this last problem to an ILP to which our general integer programming algorithm applies. It performs 0(m log D) arithmetic operations, where D is a bound on the norm of the domain elements. For the special case of problem dimension two, we propose an elementary algorithm that takes advantage of the specific geometry of the problem and appears to be optimal. It implies an efficient algorithm for digital line segment recognition. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
