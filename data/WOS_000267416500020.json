Design/methodology/approach - Owing to the complexity of uncertain neutral time-delay systems, some conclusions for system stability and stabilization are complicated non-linear matrix inequality (NLMI). Through virtual state feedback control, a sliding mode controller is designed to guarantee state trajectories from any initial condition are attracted to the sliding mode plane in a finite time and remain there for all subsequent time, which can avoid the complicated NLMI Furthermore, a delay-independent sufficient condition for the design of robust stable sliding mode plane is obtained in term of LMI. Findings - The sliding mode controller for uncertain neutral time-delay systems is designed and a delay-independent sufficient condition for the design of robust stable sliding mode plane is obtained. Research limitations/implications - The main limitations are that external disturbance must meet matched condition. Practical implications - A useful control strategy for uncertain neutral systems with time-delays. Originality/value - The virtual state feedback control is designed so to avoid the complicated NLMI.", "paper_title": "Sliding mode control for uncertain neutral system with time-delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000267416500020"}
