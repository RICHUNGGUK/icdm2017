This paper designs an agent-based regional agricultural economy decision support system (RAEDSS) to deal with complex decision problems. It introduces the architecture of the system, including interface agents, management agents, functional agents, model agents, information agents and knowledge agents and their interactions. Since dynamic analysis, evaluation, forecast, optimization and decision of regional agricultural economy are the central task of RAEDSS, this paper gives a detailed discussion on the decision processes and internal mechanisms in the system. Meanwhile, agent-based modeling is introduced to simulate and evaluate policy impact on rural development in different scenarios as an important part in RAEDSS. The simulation result shows that this agent-based agricultural development model is able to perform regeneration and is able to produce likely-to-occur projections of reality. The related issue such as building an agent based on the theory of classifier systems is also surveyed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
