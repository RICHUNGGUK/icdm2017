In the last decades, clinical cancer research shifted toward molecular targeted therapies which have limited side effects in comparison to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Antiangiogenic therapy is one of the most promising cancer treatment methods. The dynamical model for tumor growth under angiogenic stimulator/inhibitor control was posed by Hahnfeldt et al. in 1999; it was investigated and partly modified many times. In this paper, a modified version of the originally published model is used to describe a continuous infusion therapy. In order to generalize individualized therapies a robust control method is proposed using H-infinity methodology. Uncertainty weighting functions are determined based on the real pathophysiological case and simulations are performed on different tumor volumes to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.
