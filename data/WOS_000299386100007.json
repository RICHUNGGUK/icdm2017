Range-based localization methods either require a higher node density (i.e., at least three other localized neighbors must exist) than required for assuring connectedness or a high-accuracy power-intensive ranging device such as a sonar or laser range finder which exceeds the form factor and power capabilities of a typical ad-hoc node. Our approach exploits the readily available directionality information provided by a physical layer using optical wireless and uses a limited number of GPS-enabled nodes, requiring a very low node density (2-connectedness, independent of the dimension of space) and no ranging technique. We investigate the extent and accuracy of localization with respect to varying node designs (e.g., increased number of transceivers with better directionality) and density of GPS-enabled and ordinary nodes as well as messaging overhead per re-localization. Although denser deployments are desirable for higher accuracy, our method still works well with sparse networks with little message overhead and small number of anchor nodes (as little as 2). We also present a proof-of-concept prototype of our FSO-based localization techniques and show the validity of our approach even with three transceivers per node.", "paper_title": "Optical wireless localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000299386100007"}
