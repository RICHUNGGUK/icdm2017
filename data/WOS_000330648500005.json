In particular, a new Gabor-PHOG (GPHOG) image descriptor created by enhancing the local features of an image using multiple Gabor filters is first introduced for feature extraction. Second, a comparative assessment of the classification performance of the GPHOG descriptor is made in grayscale and six different color spaces to further propose two novel color GPHOG descriptors that perform well on different object and scene image categories. Finally, an innovative Fused Color GPHOG (FC-GPHOG) descriptor is presented by integrating the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features of the GPHOG descriptors in the six color spaces to combine color, shape and local feature information. Feature extraction for the proposed descriptors employs PCA and Enhanced Fisher Model (EFM), and the nearest neighbor rule is used for final classification. Experimental results using the MIT Scene dataset and the Caltech 256 object categories dataset show that the proposed new FC-GPHOG descriptor achieves a classification performance better than or comparable to other popular image descriptors, such as the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) based Pyramid Histograms of visual Words descriptor, Color SIFT four Concentric Circles, Spatial Envelope, and Local Binary Patterns.", "paper_title": "New color GPHOG descriptors for object and scene image classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000330648500005"}
