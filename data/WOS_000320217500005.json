This method was tested by simulated data and standard sample data, respectively. Urinary sample data generated from control and acetaminophen (APAP)-treated rats by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-MS) were also used to investigate the feasibility of this method. All the results demonstrated that the MSOP method could eliminate the exogenous metabolites effectively. What's more, the metabolism peaks calculated from dosed group with MSOP method were identified to be the metabolites of APAP, which further indicated that the MSOP method was effective and reliable to eliminate the interfering signals of exogenous metabolites in real metabonomics research. Therefore, the MSOP method would be of great significance in metabonomics research especially for study in TCM. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
