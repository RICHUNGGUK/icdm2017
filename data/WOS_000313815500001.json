In this case, the class model representing the structure of requirements is called a requirements metamodel, and requirements themselves are object-based models of natural language requirements. In this paper, we show that such object-oriented requirements are well suited to support a large class of requirements metrics. We define a requirements metamodel and use an automated measurement approach proposed in our previous work to specify requirements metrics. We show that it is possible to integrate 78 metrics from 11 different papers in the proposed framework. The software that computes the requirements metric values is fully generated from the specification of metrics.", "paper_title": "Automated measurement of models of requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000313815500001"}
