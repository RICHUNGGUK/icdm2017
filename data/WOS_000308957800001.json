Our main results are constant-round protocols that exhibit linear communication and a (practically) linear number of exponentiations with simulation-based security. At the heart of these constructions is a technique based on a combination of a perfectly hiding commitment and an oblivious pseudorandom function evaluation protocol. Our protocols readily transform into protocols that are UC secure, and we discuss how to perform these transformations.", "paper_title": "Efficient Set Operations in the Presence of Malicious Adversaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000308957800001"}
