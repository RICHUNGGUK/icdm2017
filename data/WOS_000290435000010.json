These limitations prevent the application of modern signal processing techniques to pre-process the collected sensor data for energy and bandwidth efficient transmission over sensor networks. This tutorial introduces communication and networking generalists without a background in wavelet signal processing to low-memory wavelet transform techniques. We first explain the one-dimensional wavelet transform (including the lifting scheme for in-place computation), the two-dimensional wavelet transform, as well as the evaluation of wavelet transforms with fixed-point arithmetic. Then, we explain the fractional wavelet filter technique which computes wavelet transforms with 16 bit integers and requires less than 1.5 kByte of RAM for a 256 x 256 gray scale image. We present case studies illustrating the use of these low-memory wavelet techniques in conjunction with image coding systems to achieve image compression competitive to the JPEG2000 standard on resource-constrained wireless sensor nodes. We make the C-code software for the techniques introduced in this tutorial freely available.", "paper_title": "Low-Memory Wavelet Transforms for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Tutorial", "paper_id": "WOS:000290435000010"}
