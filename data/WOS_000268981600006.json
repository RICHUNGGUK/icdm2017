Existing roadmap methods have been successful at planning a robot path for the purpose of moving from an initial to a final configuration in a workspace by a minimum distance. But they are not directly applicable to robots whose primary objective is to gather target information with an on-board sensor. In this paper, a novel information roadmap method is developed in which obstacles, targets, sensor's platform and field-of-view are represented as closed and bounded subsets of an Euclidean workspace. The information roadmap is sampled from a normalized information theoretic function that favors samples with a high expected value of information in configuration space. The method is applied to a landmine classification problem to plan the path of a robotic ground-penetrating radar, based on prior remote measurements and other geospatial data. Experiments show that paths obtained from the information roadmap exhibit a classification efficiency several times higher than that of existing search strategies. Also, the information roadmap can be used to deploy non-overpass capable robots that must avoid targets as well as obstacles.", "paper_title": "An Information Roadmap Method for Robotic Sensor Path Planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000268981600006"}
