We have developed a hardware monitor that operates in parallel to an embedded processor and detects any attack that causes the embedded processor to deviate from its originally programmed behavior. We explore several different characteristics that can be used for monitoring and quantify trade-offs between these approaches. Our results show that our proposed hash-based monitoring pattern can detect attacks within one instruction cycle at lower memory requirements than traditional approaches that use control flow information.", "paper_title": "Hardware Support for Secure Processing in Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000276852300012"}
