With aim of actualization of the scheduling problems, many researchers have recently considered realistic assumptions in their problems. Two of the most applied assumptions are to consider sequence-dependent setup times and machine availability constraints (MACs). In this paper, we deal with a specific case of MACs caused by preventive maintenance (PM) operations. Contrary to the previous papers considering fixed or/and conservative policies, we consider flexible PM operations, in which PM operations may be postponed or expedited as required. A simple technique is employed to schedule production jobs along with the flexible MACs caused by PM. To solve the given problem, we present a novel meta-heuristic method based on the artificial immune algorithm (AIA) incorporating some advanced features. For further enhancement, the proposed AIA is hybridized with a simple and fast simulated annealing (SA). To evaluate the proposed algorithms, we compare our proposed AIA with three well-known algorithms taken from the literature. Finally, we find that the proposed AIA outperforms other algorithms.
