Our approach emphasizes a mid-level concept representation, in which intended affects of the image publisher is characterized by a large pool of visual concepts (termed PACs) detected from image content directly instead of textual metadata, evoked viewer affects are represented by concepts (termed VACs) mined from online comments, and statistical methods are used to model the correlations among these two types of concepts. We demonstrate the utilities of such approaches by developing an end-to-end Assistive Comment Robot application, which further includes components for multi-sentence comment generation, interactive interfaces, and relevance feedback functions. Through user studies, we showed machine suggested comments were accepted by users for online posting in 90 percent of completed user sessions, while very favorable results were also observed in various dimensions (plausibility, preference, and realism) when assessing the quality of the generated image comments.", "paper_title": "Assistive Image Comment Robot-A Novel Mid-Level Concept-Based Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000360797200009"}
