Computational intelligence (CI) offers models and algorithms that can contribute greatly to design formalization and automation. This paper surveys CI concepts and approaches applicable to product design engineering. Taxonomy of the surveyed literature is presented according to the generally recognized areas in both product design engineering and CI. Some research issues that arise from the broad perspective presented in the paper have been signaled but not fully pursued. No survey of such a broad field can be complete; however, the material presented in the paper is a summary of state-of-the-art CI concepts and approaches in product design engineering.", "paper_title": "Computational intelligence in product design engineering: Review and trends", "paper_id": "WOS:000249023700003"}
