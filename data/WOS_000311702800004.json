It is based on the modeling of the system in a fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno representation derived from a physical model. With this representation, the design of a fuzzy observer with unknown inputs of polynomial types is obtained via a LMI formulation. Main advantages of the proposed method are that neither specific sensor, excepted standard ones, nor special operating conditions such as steady state regime are required. Some realistic simulations show the efficiency of the proposed technique. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
