It has become a pressing research issue to realize the organic amalgamation and harmonious symbiosis among humans, computers, and things in the hyper world, which consists of the social world, the physical world, and the information world (cyber world). In this paper, the notion of Wisdom Web of Things (W2T) is proposed in order to address this issue. As inspired by the material cycle in the physical world, the W2T focuses on the data cycle, namely \"from things to data, information, knowledge, wisdom, services, humans, and then back to things.\" A W2T data cycle system is designed to implement such a cycle, which is, technologically speaking, a practical way to realize the harmonious symbiosis of humans, computers, and things in the emerging hyper world.", "paper_title": "Research challenges and perspectives on Wisdom Web of Things (W2T)", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500013"}
