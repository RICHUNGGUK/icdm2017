The algorithm analyzes the pipelined circuit and determines the intermediate registers that can be removed. An efficient subsidiary algorithm is presented that computes the minimum feasible clock period of a circuit containing multi-clock cycle paths. Experiments with a pipelined adder and multiplier verify that the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of intermediate registers without degrading performance, even when delay variations exist.", "paper_title": "Multi-clock cycle paths and clock scheduling for reducing the area of pipelined circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600008"}
