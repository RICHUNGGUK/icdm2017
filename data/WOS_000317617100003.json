(Comput Vis Image Underst 71:281-293, 1998), which defined a continuous analog for a 4-dimensional digital object. Here, we construct a cell complex that has the same topological information as the original 4-dimensional digital object.", "paper_title": "A continuous analog for 4-dimensional objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000317617100003"}
