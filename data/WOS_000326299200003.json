Interface design for deaf people presents specific problems, since it needs to be based on visual communication, incorporating unusual forms of interaction, in particular gesture-based ones. Standard solutions for model-driven development of visual interfaces lack specific constructs for structuring these more sophisticated forms of interaction. This paper discusses such issues in the context of the development of a deaf-centered e-learning environment. Sign Languages enter this context as a suitable alternative communication code, both in video form and through one of their most successful written forms, namely SignWriting.", "paper_title": "Stories and signs in an e-learning environment for deaf people", "paper_id": "WOS:000326299200003"}
