The used meteorological data set to develop the models for estimation of daily evaporation includes daily air temperature, evaporation, solar radiation, air pressure, relative humidity, and wind speed measured at synoptic stations of Tabriz and Urmia cities which have almost distinct climatologic conditions. The obtained results denote to the superiority of the ANN models on the classic models. Also based on the comparisons, the MLP network performs better than the RBNN and Elman network so that in the next step, sensitivity analysis is performed by the Partial Derivation (PaD) and Weights methods on the MLP outputs. Sensitivity analysis results show although air temperature, solar radiation and the amount of evaporation at previous time step are the effective parameters in estimation of daily evaporation at both regions, due to the climatologic condition wind speed and relative humidity are other predominant parameters in Tabriz and Urmia, respectively.
