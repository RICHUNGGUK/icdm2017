We propose a predictive model of individual-level IT adaptation by integrating adaptation-specific constructs from the technology acceptance model and adaptive structuration theory. The hypothesized model is empirically validated using data collected from a study of MyYahoo web portal usage. Our findings suggest that (1) the key determinants of adaptation behavior are adaptation usefulness, ease of adaptation, and IT adaptability, (2) the outcome of adaptation is enhanced IT usage, and (3) the effect of IT adaptation on usage is moderated by users' extent of work adaptation.", "paper_title": "INDIVIDUAL ADAPTATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000271789700004"}
