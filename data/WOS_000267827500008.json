Using the discrete gradient and the extended second order derivative, we define the discrete Hessian matrix. We construct a sequence of sets, where each set is composed of discrete Hessian matrices. We first show some new properties of SC (1) functions. Then, we prove that for SC (1) functions the sequence of the set of discrete Hessian matrices is uniformly convergent to the generalized Hessian matrix.", "paper_title": "Constructing a sequence of discrete Hessian matrices of an SC (1) function uniformly convergent to the generalized Hessian matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000267827500008"}
