Multiple descriptions of the same phenomena may use very different information granulations, complicating any comparison or synthesis of those descriptions. One method for solving this problem is to transform all observations to a common granulation; however, this granulation must be adequate to capture all important facets of the phenomena. Determining this \"natural\" granulation could be done by inductively learning and comparing multiple granular representations of the phenomenon, but this requires a dedicated learning architecture. We present the Granular Neural Network, a novel adaptive neural network architecture that employs granular values and operations at the level of individual neurons. The Granular Neural Network is based on the multiplayer perceptron architecture and the backpropagation learning algorithm with momentum. It uses the operations of linguistic arithmetic to manipulate granular connection weights, which are represented by linguistic terms. We test the performance of the Granular Neural Network on three well-known benchmark datasets, and then explore its use in determining the \"natural\" granularity of a dataset (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
