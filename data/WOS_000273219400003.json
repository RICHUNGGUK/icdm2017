In this scenario, it is difficult to use new virtual reality devices if they have not been taken into account since the beginning. This paper shows how to manage virtual reality devices as federate resources in a virtual world using the HLA-RTI standard architecture. This approach has been used as a framework to build simulators for training workers in civil engineering. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
