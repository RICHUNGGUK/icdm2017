For this purpose, term- and style-based classification techniques are evaluated over a large collection of chat messages. Prediction accuracies up to 84.2% are achieved, illustrating the applicability of these techniques to gender prediction. Moreover, the reverse problem is exploited, and the effect of gender on the writing style is discussed.", "paper_title": "Chat mining for gender prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200029"}
