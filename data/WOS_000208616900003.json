In order to achieve better performance, it is important to develop effective modeling by utilizing prior knowledge. In this article, we extend the graph regularization approaches to a more general case where the regularization is imposed on the factorized variational distributions, instead of posterior distributions implicitly involved in EM-like algorithms. In this way, the problem modeling can be more flexible, and we can choose any factor in the problem domain to impose graph regularization wherever there are similarity constraints among the instances. We formulate the problem formally and show its geometrical background in manifold learning. We also design two practically effective algorithms and analyze their properties such as the convergence. Finally, we apply our approach to image annotation and show the performance improvement of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Variational Inference with Graph Regularization for Image Annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000208616900003"}
