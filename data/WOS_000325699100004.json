The method first estimates a cubic spline curve fit for the boundary points using the gray-level information of the nearby pixels, and then computes the sum of the spline segments' lengths. In this model, the second derivatives and y coordinates at the knots are required in the computation; the spline polynomial coefficients need not be computed explicitly. We provide the algorithm pseudo code for estimation and preprocessing, both taking linear time. Implementation shows that the proposed model gains a smaller relative error than other state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Curve length estimation based on cubic spline interpolation in gray-scale images", "paper_id": "WOS:000325699100004"}
