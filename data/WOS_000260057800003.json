CGS adopts Pearson's correlation coefficient as the correlation measure to take into account the occurrence distributions of graphs. However, the CGS problem poses significant challenges, since every subgraph of a graph in the database is a candidate, but the number of subgraphs is exponential. We derive two necessary conditions that set bounds on the occurrence probability of a candidate in the database. With this result, we devise an efficient algorithm that mines the candidate set from a much smaller projected database, and thus, we are able to obtain a significantly smaller set of candidates. Three heuristic rules are further developed to refine the candidate set. We also make use of the bounds to directly answer high-support queries without mining the candidates. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm. Finally, we show that our algorithm provides a general solution when most of the commonly used correlation measures are used to generalize the CGS problem.", "paper_title": "Efficient Correlation Search from Graph Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000260057800003"}
