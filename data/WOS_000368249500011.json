The purpose of this paper is to propose new agent-based proactive migration method and system for Big Data Environment (BDE). Design/methodology/approach - First, the authors have designed new relative fusion method for making decision based on fuzzy-neural network. The method can make the fusion belief degree to be improved. Then the authors have proposed agent-based proactive migrating method with service discovery and key frames selection strategy. Finally, the authors have designed the application system, which can support proactive seamless migration function for big data. The method has innovation in which mobile service task of big data can dynamically follow its mobile user from one device to another device. Findings - The authors have proposed agent-based proactive migrating method with service discovery and key frames selection strategy. The method has innovation in which mobile service task of big data can dynamically follow its mobile user from one device to another device. The designed system is convenient to work and use during mobility, and which is useful or helpful for mobile user in the BDE. Originality/value - The authors have clarified and realizes how to transfer service tasks among different distances in Big Data Environment (BDE). The authors have given a formal description and classification of the mobile service task, which is independent of the realization mechanism. In the designed and developed application system, the new idea adopts fuzzy-neural control theory to make decision for task-oriented proactive seamless migration application.", "paper_title": "New agent-based proactive migration method and system for Big Data Environment (BDE)", "paper_id": "WOS:000368249500011"}
