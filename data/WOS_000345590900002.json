We argue for a shift from a 'human in the loop' philosophy for visual analytics to a 'human is the loop' viewpoint, where the focus is on recognizing analysts' work processes, and seamlessly fitting analytics into that existing interactive process. We survey a range of projects that provide visual analytic support contextually in the sensemaking loop, and outline a research agenda along with future challenges.", "paper_title": "The human is the loop: new directions for visual analytics", "paper_id": "WOS:000345590900002"}
