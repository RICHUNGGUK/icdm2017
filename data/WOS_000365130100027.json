We found that German researchers are more capable of publishing higher-quality papers than Chinese counterparts. Both China and Germany get benefit from collaboration in raising publication productivity. The collaboration helps improve Chinese researchers' citation impact and capability of publishing in higher-quality journals. Research capacities of German institutions are more evenly distributed than Chinese counterparts. Chinese institutions that are most active in collaborating with German counterparts are mainly those in leading positions in China, whereas those in disadvantageous situation are still isolated from the international community.", "paper_title": "Academic publishing and collaboration between China and Germany in physics", "paper_id": "WOS:000365130100027"}
