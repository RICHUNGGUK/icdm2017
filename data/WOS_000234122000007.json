The systems predict the future values of such streams from past values and are composed at runtime out of a large and extensible set of communicating components that are in turn constructed using RPS's extensible sensor, prediction, wavelet, and communication libraries. This paper describes the design, implementation, and performance of RPS. We have used RPS extensively to evaluate predictive models and build online prediction systems for host load, Windows performance data, and network bandwidth. The computation and communication overheads involved in such systems are quite low.", "paper_title": "Design, implementation, and performance of an extensible toolkit for resource prediction in distributed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000234122000007"}
