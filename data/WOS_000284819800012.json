The analytic result shows that the number of outcome portfolios created by students is more than that of process portfolios. The five types of e-portfolio tabulation, in order of those most commonly created by students, are combination-based, content item-based, work-based, course unit-based, and time-based. The combination-based type incorporates the advantages of other tabulation types, while the content item-based and work-based types are better for clearly classifying data and step-by-step organization of it. Future research may further explore factors related to students' decision of tabulation type, the difficulties they face in the process, and their mentality as they adopt a portfolio type.
