The unique characteristics and constraints of wireless sensor networks (WSN) make this problem especially challenging. Sensors can detect outliers for a plethora of reasons and these reasons need to be inferred in real time. Here, we survey the current state of research in this area, compare them and present some future directions for smarter handling of outliers in WSN.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Methods for Finding Outliers in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000350554700007"}
