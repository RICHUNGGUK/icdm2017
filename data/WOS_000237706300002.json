The equations of motion for turbulent boundary layers at the solid surfaces are coupled with the potential flow in the bulk of the fluid, and a mixed BEM-finite difference technique is used to model the wave motion and the corresponding boundary layer flow. A mixing-length theory is used for turbulence modelling. The model results are in good agreement with previous physical and numerical experiments. Although the technique is presented for a standing surface wave, it can be easily applied to other free surface problems.
