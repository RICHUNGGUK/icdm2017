This operationalisation intends to provide an interdisciplinary framework for the specification of meaningful usability for idiosyncratic technological artefacts build up during the creative process of these works. Design/methodology/approach - The design of the questionnaire was based on semi-structured interviews with seven composers. The resulting questionnaire was used for an online survey targeting composers registered at electroacoustic and mixed music online associations. Data were collected from 33 composers. Findings - This article demonstrates the relevance of Boisot's knowledge management model in order to categorize the knowledge involved during the creative process of electroacoustic and mixed music with spatialisation. Research limitations/implications - In terms of Boisot's model operationalisation, the authors identified limitations with regards to composers' ability to discriminate between different levels of abstraction and diffusion. Since multiple agents, both human and non-human, are involved in the creative process of electroacoustic and mixed music, further studies should address their interaction throughout the creative process. Originality/value - Based on the findings of the survey, the authors propose the concept of significant knowledge as an extension of significant properties in order to provide a meaningful usability of digital objects. Since similar technologies are used in theatre, dance, and fine arts, the authors expect this research to benefit the artistic community at large in terms of preservation.", "paper_title": "Archiving electroacoustic and mixed music Significant knowledge involved in the creative process of works with spatialisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000312362600002"}
