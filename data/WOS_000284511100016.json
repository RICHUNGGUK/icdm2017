Abdalla et al.'s compiler is certainly elegant in its genericness, symmetry, simplicity and efficiency. However, this compiler is not as secure as claimed. Under a reasonable assumption, the GKE protocol constructed by the compiler (from a 2-party protocol) fails to achieve implicit key authentication. We here reveal this security problem with the compiler and show how to address it. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
