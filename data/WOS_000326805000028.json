The remote frame buffer (RFB) protocol and motion JPEG (M-JPEG) protocol are assigned to handle remote display tasks in the slow-motion region and high-motion region, respectively. Graphic processing units (GPU) are utilized to do a part of a real-time JPEG compression task. A novel quality of experience (QoE)-based high-motion detection algorithm is also proposed to reduce the network bandwidth consumption and the server-side computing resource consumption. The continuity of screen delivery remains whenever the JPEG compression is applied to different screen regions. The proposed hybrid remote display approach has many good features which have been justified by comprehensive simulation studies.", "paper_title": "An optimized hybrid remote display protocol using GPU-assisted M-JPEG encoding and novel high-motion detection algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000326805000028"}
