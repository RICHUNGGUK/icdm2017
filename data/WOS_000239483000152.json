The SPSA-based MFNN control algorithm employed in the ANC system is first derived. Following this, computer simulations are carried out to verify that the SPSA-based MFNN control algorithm is effective for a nonlinear ANC system. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to significantly reduce disturbances without the need to model the secondary-path and has better tracking ability under variable secondary-path. This observation implies that the SPSA-based MFNN controller frees the ANC system from the modeling of the secondary-path.", "paper_title": "Model-free control of a nonlinear ANC system with a SPSA-based neural network controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000152"}
