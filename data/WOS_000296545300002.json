Fuzzy Lyapunov functions have been fruitfully used in the literature for local analysis of Takagi-Sugeno models, a particular class of the polynomial fuzzy ones. Based on a recent Taylor-series approach which allows a polynomial fuzzy model to exactly represent a nonlinear model in a compact set of the state space, it is shown that a refinement of the polynomial Lyapunov function so as to make it share the fuzzy structure of the model proves advantageous. Conditions thus obtained are tested via available SOS software. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
