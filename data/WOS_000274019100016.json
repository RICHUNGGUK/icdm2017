The proposed method, using the concept of LOOP DOMAIN, greatly reduces the complexity of enumeration. The initial graph is transformed into a graph in loop domain where the spanning tree enumeration is then carried out. Subsequently spanning trees of initial graph are generated. The proposed method eliminates all the two degree vertices in a graph. This finds application in power system distribution networks, which have substantial number of two degree vertices. The consequent reduction in size of graph and its corresponding trees is highly desirable. The proposed method is demonstrated on a 33 vertex system and reduction incomplexity is evaluated.", "paper_title": "Efficient Spanning Tree Enumeration Using Loop Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000274019100016"}
