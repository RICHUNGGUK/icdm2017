Both state feedback and output feedback control protocols are proposed, under which all the followers will asymptotically converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders. Using tools from matrix, graph and Lyapunov stability theories, sufficient conditions for containment of linear multi-agent systems with exogenous disturbances are obtained by designing exogenous disturbance observers. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
