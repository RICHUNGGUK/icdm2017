In this paper, normative multiagent systems for secure knowledge management based on access-control policies are studied. It is shown how distributed access control is realized by means of local policies of access-control systems for documents of knowledge providers, and by means of global community policies regulating these local policies. Moreover, it is shown how such a virtual community of multiple knowledge providers respects the autonomy of the knowledge providers.", "paper_title": "Security policies for sharing knowledge in virtual communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000237457600004"}
