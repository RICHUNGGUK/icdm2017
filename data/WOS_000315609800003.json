The process of achieving a goal can be represented as interlinked means-end chains of user goals that have been traditionally visualized as hierarchies. Evidence in recent literature suggests that a network structure would be more appropriate and provide insight into a user's process of seeking a goal. We investigated user goal means-end chains for the eBay online auction system, and produced its structure as a goal network. To analyze this network and assess the importance of various goals, social network analysis measures were used (specifically, degree and flow-betweenness centrality). In addition, goal networks for users with low and high IS value were created and differences in goal importance in the two groups were considered. Results revealed that the most important user goals are closely related to key features of the auction system; users with high IS value want to use eBay to buy, sell, and bid for products, while users with low IS value seem to avoid using eBay because of uncertain price bidding. As such, the results of our study suggest that differences in IS value may be due to differences in IS usage. IS designers, marketers, and providers of online auction system can use our findings to design and promote better systems for their users. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
