While a true fusion of the management has been effectively done, it was not the case 5 years after for several databases, and in particular the ADT (admission, discharge, transfer). in order to truly realize the fusion, a new ADT service has been built using state of the art technology and standards in order to replace the existing seven services. This paper presents the results of the redesign and development of the new ADT service. The data model, based on HL7 RIM, is described and the technologies selected are. presented. Finally, a status after 1 year of production is presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
