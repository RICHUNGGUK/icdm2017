A declarative approach to this problem relies on the notion of repair, that is, a database that satisfies integrity constraints and is obtained from the original inconsistent database by \"minimally\" adding and/or deleting tuples. Consistent answers to a user query are those answers that are in the evaluation of the query over each repair. Motivated by the fact that computing consistent answers from inconsistent databases is in general intractable, the present paper investigates techniques that allow to localize the difficult part of the computation on a small fragment of the database at hand, called \"affected\" part. Based on a number of localization results, an approach to query answering from inconsistent data is presented, in which the query is evaluated over each of the repairs of the affected part only, augmented with the part that is not affected. Single query results are then suitably recombined. For some relevant settings, techniques are also discussed to factorize repairs into components that can be processed independently of one another, thereby guaranteeing exponential gain w.r.t. the basic approach, which is not based on localization. The effectiveness of the results is demonstrated for consistent query answering over expressive schemas, based on logic programming specifications as proposed in the literature.", "paper_title": "Repair localization for query answering from inconsistent databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000257819600005"}
