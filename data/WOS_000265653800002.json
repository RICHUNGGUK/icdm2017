In this study, the strategies are tested in a constructive-deconstructive heuristic for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with hard time windows and random travel times. Comparisons of the solution quality provided by these strategies to a more conventional approach were performed on randomly generated instances up to 100 requests with static and dynamic (time-dependent) travel times and different degrees of dynamism. The results indicate the advantages of the strategies both in terms of lost requests and number of vehicles.", "paper_title": "Waiting and Buffering Strategies for the Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows", "paper_id": "WOS:000265653800002"}
