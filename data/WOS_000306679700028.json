In addition, it provides a systematic model verification procedure by model transformation into PNs. In this paper, we first analyze pros and cons of currently available process modeling methods. We then discuss details of the proposed exCPM, and demonstrate its modeling and verification capabilities with case studies.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL MODELING METHODOLOGY FOR COLLABORATIVE ENTERPRISE PROCESSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679700028"}
