To design the schemes, some useful measurement bases with the aid of Hurwitz matrix equation are constructed, which have no restrictions on the coefficients of the prepared state. Through a four-particle projective measurement and two-step three-particle projective measurement under the novel sets of mutually orthogonal basis vectors, the remote preparation can be realized with the probability 50% and 100% in general case, respectively. To improve the probability, the special ensembles of the prepared state that the success probability reaches up to 100% are discussed for the first scheme by the permutation group. Furthermore, the present schemes are extended to the nonmaximally entangled quantum channel.", "paper_title": "SCHEMES FOR REMOTELY PREPARING AN ARBITRARY FIVE-QUBIT BROWN-TYPE STATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000324407200007"}
