In order to achieve the sustainable development, the most critically negative impact, i.e., waste EEEs (WEEEs) must be properly handled such as disposed, remanufactured, recycled to name a few. Among suggested solutions for resolving this issue, closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management has been proved as a highly potential candidate due to its efficiency, effectiveness and economics. This paper presents a model of multi EEEs CLSC systems with fuzzy parameters. The proposed model is transformed into the equivalent auxiliary crisp model by an appropriate approach, and the final preferred compromise solutions are also found. Finally, a numerical example is conducted to illustrate the applicability and provide better insights about the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the Fuzzy Closed-Loop Supply Chain for Electrical and Electronic Equipments", "paper_id": "WOS:000318195300002"}
