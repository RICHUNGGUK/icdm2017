First, aiming to accomplish the whole closed-loop control with only position measurements, a linear filter is involved to generate a pseudo velocity error signal. Second, different from previous strategies, the arctangent function with error-gain is applied to ensure the boundedness of the torque control input, and an explicit system stability proof is made by using the theory of singularly perturbed systems. Moreover, a fuzzy self-tuning PD regulator, which guarantees the continuous stability of the overall closed-loop system, is added to obtain an adaptive performance in tackling the disturbances during tracking control. Simulation showed that the proposed controller gains more satisfactory tracking results than the others, with a better dynamic response performance and stronger anti-disturbance capability.", "paper_title": "Saturated output feedback tracking control for robot manipulators via fuzzy self-tumng", "paper_id": "WOS:000285525700004"}
