One arguable yet popular assumption about fragment-based design is that the fragment binding mode remains conserved upon chemical expansion. For instance, the question of the binding conservation upon fragmentation of a molecule is still unclear. A number of papers have challenged this hypothesis by means of experimental techniques, with controversial results, \"underlining\" the idea that a simple generalization, maybe, is not possible. From a computational standpoint, the issue has been rarely addressed and mostly to test novel protocols on limited data sets. To fill this gap, we here report on a computational retrospective study concerned with the in silico deconstruction of leadlike compounds, active on the pharmaceutically relevant enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta.", "paper_title": "In Silico Deconstruction of ATP-Competitive Inhibitors of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 beta", "paper_id": "WOS:000312563800013"}
