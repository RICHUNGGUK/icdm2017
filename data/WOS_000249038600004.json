In order to evaluate the power efficiency across a number of design variables, a compact macro-model of a regulator is created and validated. A key focus of the study is on the characteristics of the active and passive devices that are needed in order to maximize the efficiency of an on-chip regulator. With the macro-model, geometric programming is used to find the optimal characteristics for a given set of constraints such as load condition, process technology, and area. The achievable efficiencies for various current loads and across a range of technologies from 0.35-mu m to 90-nm CMOS process are analyzed. The power efficiency is found to be strongly dependent on the inductor technology and over 70% efficiency is possible with advanced inductor technologies.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of fully-integrated switching regulators for CMOS process technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000249038600004"}
