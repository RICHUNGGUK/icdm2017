We present the general outlook and more specific findings about authors, works and journals, subtopics and keywords and also important relations between them based on scientometric approaches like the strongest and main citation paths, the main themes on citation path based on key-words, results of co-authorship analysis in form of the most prominent islands of citing authors, groups of collaborating authors, two-mode cores of authors and works. We investigate the nature of citing of authors, important journals and citing of works between them, journals preferred by authors and expose hierarchy of similar collaborating authors, based on keywords they use. We perform temporal analysis on one important journal as well. We give a comprehensive scientometric insight into the field of topological indices.", "paper_title": "Network Analysis of Publications on Topological Indices from the Web of Science", "paper_id": "WOS:000340518700003"}
