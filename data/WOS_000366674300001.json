To adapt applications for focal planes of large format and high density, a new structure of CDS circuit occupying small layout area is proposed, whose power dissipation has been optimized by using MOSFETs in operation of subthreshold region, which leads to 720 nW. Then the noise calculation model is established, based on which the noise analysis has been carried out by the approaches of transfer function and numerical simulations using SIMULINK and Verilog-A. The results are in good agreement, demonstrating the validity of the present noise calculation model. Thermal noise plays a dominant role in the long wave situation while 1/f noise is the majority in the medium wave situation. The total noise of long wave is smaller than medium wave, both of which increase with the integration capacitor and integration time increasing.", "paper_title": "A New CDS Structure for High Density FPA with Low Power", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674300001"}
