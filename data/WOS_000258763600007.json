In this paper, a module that employs the structural effect for controlling behavior is constructed using coupled nonuniform van der Pol oscillators. We first examine the synchrony of two types of oscillators focusing on number; then, an oscillator module that changes its synchrony from structural disposition is constructed. Oscillators are mutually arranged on a ring-shaped network, and an additional connection is used for transformation. The stability of this system is also discussed, and finally, the procedure for designing this structure-sensitive module using more than three types of oscillators is described.", "paper_title": "Network structure for control of coupled multiple nonlinear oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000258763600007"}
