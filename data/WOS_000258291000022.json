Foundational work by Chen, Fox and Lyndon established properties of the Lyndon circ-UMFF, which is based on lexicographic ordering. Commencing with the circ-UMFF related to V-order, we then proved analogous factorization families for a further 32 Block-like binary orders. Here we distinguish between UMFFs and circ-UMFFs, and then study the structural properties of circ-UMFFs. These properties give rise to the complete construction of any circ-UMFF. We prove that any circ-UMFF is a totally ordered set and a factorization over it must be monotonic. We define atom words and initiate a study of u,v-atoms. Applications of circ-UMFFs arise in string algorithmics.", "paper_title": "Properties and construction of unique maximal factorization families for strings", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291000022"}
