However, the conventional deterministic design could become less meaningful or even unacceptable when considering the perturbations of design variables and noises of system parameters. To overcome this drawback, a robust design methodology is presented in this paper to address the effects of parametric uncertainties of foam-filled thin-walled structure on design optimization, in which different sigma criteria are adopted to measure the variations. The Kriging modeling technique is used to construct the corresponding surrogate models of mean and standard deviation for different crashworthiness criteria. A sequential sampling approach is introduced to improve the fitness accuracy of these surrogate models. Finally, a gradient-based sequential quadratic program (SQP) method is employed from 20 different initial points to obtain a quasi-global robust optimum solution. The optimal solutions were verified by using the Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the presented robust optimization method is fairly effective and efficient, the crashworthiness and robustness of the foam-filled thin-walled structure can be improved significantly.", "paper_title": "Robust optimization of foam-filled thin-walled structure based on sequential Kriging metamodel", "paper_id": "WOS:000336286800002"}
