Most researchers solve face tracking using particle filter, meanshift and their derivatives. Unlike the traditional methods, in this study, face tracking is treated as an optimisation problem and a new meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm, differential harmony search (DHS), is introduced to solve face tracking problems. We compare the speed and accuracy of the proposed method with particle filter, meanshift and improved harmony search. Experimental results show that DHS-based tracker is faster and more accurate and it is easy to handle the parameters tuning. Furthermore, to improve the reliability of tracking, multiple visual cues are applied to DHS-based tracking system and experimental results demonstrate the increased robustness achieved by fusing multiple cues.", "paper_title": "Face tracking based on differential harmony search", "paper_id": "WOS:000349308600009"}
