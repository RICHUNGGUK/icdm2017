State-of-the-art schemes have demonstrated the effectiveness of their data forwarding strategies by exploiting known vehicular traffic statistics (e.g., densities and speeds). These results are encouraging, however, further improvements can be made by taking advantage of the growing popularity of GPS-based navigation systems. This paper presents the first attempt to effectively utilize vehicles' trajectory information in a privacy-preserving manner. In our design, such trajectory information is combined with the vehicular traffic statistics for a better performance. In a distributed way, each individual vehicle computes its end-to-end expected delivery delay to the Internet access points based on its position on its vehicle trajectory and exchanges this delay with neighboring vehicles to determine the best next-hop vehicle. For the accurate end-to-end delay computation, this paper also proposes a link delay model to estimate the packet forwarding delay on a road segment. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, it is shown that our link delay model provides the accurate link delay estimation and our forwarding design outperforms the existing scheme in terms of both the data delivery delay and packet delivery ratio.", "paper_title": "Trajectory-Based Data Forwarding for Light-Traffic Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000288755400005"}
