In order to make cluster analysis helpful for users, visualization of cluster solutions is of utmost importance. Here, we present the new R package gcExplorer for the interactive exploration of gene clusters. gcExplorer facilitates the interpretation of cluster results and allows to investigate extensive information about clusters.", "paper_title": "gcExplorer: interactive exploration of gene clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000265094400020"}
