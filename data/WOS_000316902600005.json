The preregulated circuit based on the regulation characteristic of zener diode extends the supply range and increases power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). Compensated by the base-emitter voltage (V-BE) linearization technique, the temperature stability of the bandgap circuit is improved further. The proposed circuit is implemented in a 0.4 mu m bipolar CMOS DMOS (BCD) process and Spice simulation has been done for validation. The results of simulation and test show that the supply range of this circuit can reach 7.2 V to 40 V and 159 mu V/V of supply voltage dependence; the temperature coefficient is just 3.5 ppm/degrees C over a wide temperature of -40 degrees C to 125 degrees C and PSRR is up to -94 dB at 1 kHz. For the perfective performance, this circuit can be used in wide temperature and wide supply range integrated circuit design.", "paper_title": "A WIDE SUPPLY RANGE BANDGAP VOLTAGE REFERENCE WITH CURVATURE COMPENSATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000316902600005"}
