The paper claimed that closed-form expressions for E(X-k) are possible only for certain special cases: when the parameter of the distribution is assumed to be an integer or when k = 2 (the latter represented as an infinite sum). In this note, we show that one can derive simple expressions for E(X-k) for all even k >= 2 without any restriction on the parameter of the distribution. The expressions only involve the gamma function and its derivatives.", "paper_title": "Moments of the scaled burr type X distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000253261200009"}
