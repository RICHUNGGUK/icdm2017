The application of these models has become common practice, but the development of diagnostic tools has lagged behind. influence. ME calculates standardized measures of influential data for the point estimates of generalized mixed effects models, such as DFBETAS, Cook's distance, as well as percentile change and a test for changing levels of significance. influence. ME calculates these measures of influence while accounting for the nesting structure of the data. The package and measures of influential data are introduced, a practical example is given, and strategies for dealing with influential data are suggested.", "paper_title": "influence.ME: Tools for Detecting Influential Data in Mixed Effects Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000313198000006"}
