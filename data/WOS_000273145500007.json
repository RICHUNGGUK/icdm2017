Numerical tests are performed with reference to the Barcelona Basic Model (BBM), one of the most popular elasto-plastic models for unsaturated soils, by using eight explicit Runge-Kutta algorithms of various order as well as a novel application of the extrapolation method described in the companion paper. Initially, the results obtained from the lowest order Runge-Kutta scheme (i.e. Modified Euler) as well as the extrapolation method are checked against accurate solutions of a number of BBM paths involving changes of strains and suction. Subsequently, the efficiency and accuracy of all algorithms are assessed for generic increments of strains and suction, while the difference between two alternative error control methods is also analysed. The results presented, although strictly valid for the Barcelona Basic Model, are expected to be general and relevant to other similar unsaturated elasto-plastic models formulated in terms of two independent stress variables such as net stress and suction.
