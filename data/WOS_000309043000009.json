Existing test case generation tools have limits in finding solutions to the deep call structure of the source code. In our approach, the complex call structure is simplified by reusing unit test cases of called functions. As unit test cases represent the characteristics of the called function, the internal behaviors of called functions are replaced by the test cases. This approach can be applicable to existing test tools for simplifying the process of generation and enhancing their capabilities.", "paper_title": "A Function Interaction Testing by Reusing Characterized Test Cases", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043000009"}
