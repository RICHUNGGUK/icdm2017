The aim of the work is to analyze the suitability of this system for facial recognition purposes. The facial data of a set of 20 people were acquired with the photogrammetric system developed by the authors, and different CAD 3D models were reconstructed for each person. The results are quantified by aligning the models and calculating mean distances and standard deviations between them using two different methods. The former considers the entire face; the latter is based on a few fiducial points of the face.", "paper_title": "Digital photogrammetry for facial recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000242762800010"}
