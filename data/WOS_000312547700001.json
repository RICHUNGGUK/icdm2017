Therefore, for creating new drugs, several methods have been suggested in recent years. In several laboratories in the world, some new methods for the derivations of the parameters were constructed and used for studies on quantitative structure-activity/property relationships of chiral molecules. The algorithms reviewed in this paper involve Zargeb group chiral indices, chiral molecular connectivity index, chiral topological charge index, chiral A(m) index, chiral indices based on the matrixes, chiral indices based on chiral product, conformation-independent chirality code, conformation-dependent chirality code, quantitative two-dimensional chirality degrees of benzenoids, and so on.
