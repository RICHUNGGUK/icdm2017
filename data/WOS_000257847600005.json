X can also be viewed as a language for describing nets by composition of basic components connected by wires. These features make X an expressive platform on which many different (applicative) programming paradigms can be mapped. In this paper we will present the syntax and reduction rules for X; in order to demonstrate its expressive power, we will show how elaborate calculi can be embedded, such as the lambda-calculus, Bloo and Rose's calculus of explicit substitutions lambda x, Parigot's lambda mu and Curien and Herbelin's lambda mu mu. X was first presented in Lengrand (2003), where it was called the lambda xi-calculus. It can be seen as the pure untyped computational content of the reduction system for the implicative classical sequent calculus of Urban (2000).", "paper_title": "Computation with classical sequents", "paper_id": "WOS:000257847600005"}
