Much important research has been invested in decreasing the number of collisions in order to obtain faster algorithms for communication in such networks. This paper proposes a novel approach for wireless communication, which embraces collisions rather than avoiding them, over an additive channel. It introduces a coding technique called Bounded-Contention Coding (BCC) that allows collisions to be successfully decoded by the receiving nodes into the original transmissions and whose complexity depends on a bound on the contention among the transmitters. BCC enables deterministic local broadcast in a network with nodes and at most transmitters with information of bits each within bits of communication with full-duplex radios, and bits, with high probability, with half-duplex radios. When combined with random linear network coding, BCC gives global broadcast within bits, with high probability. This also holds in dynamic networks that can change arbitrarily over time by a worst-case adversary. When no bound on the contention is given, it is shown how to probabilistically estimate it and obtain global broadcast that is adaptive to the true contention in the network.", "paper_title": "Bounded-Contention Coding for the additive network model", "paper_id": "WOS:000361993800001"}
