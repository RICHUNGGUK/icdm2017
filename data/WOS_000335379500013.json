Despite the tremendous improvements done in the field, all existing approaches still face a common limitation which is intrinsically connected with the formation of the ultrasound images. Specifically, the reduced lateral resolution and the absence of phase information in the lateral direction highly limit the accuracy in the computation of lateral displacements. In this context, this paper introduces a novel setup for the estimation of cardiac motion with ultrasound. The framework includes an unconventional beamforming technique and a dedicated motion estimation algorithm. The beamformer aims at introducing phase information in the lateral direction by producing transverse oscillations. The estimator directly exploits the phase information in the two directions by decomposing the image into two 2-D single-orthant analytic signals. An in silico evaluation of the proposed framework is presented on five ultra-realistic simulated echocardiographic sequences, where the proposed motion estimator is contrasted against other two phase-based solutions exploiting the presence of transverse oscillations and against block-matching on standard images. An implementation of the new beamforming strategy on a research ultrasound platform is also shown along with a preliminary in vivo evaluation on one healthy subject.", "paper_title": "A New Technique for the Estimation of Cardiac Motion in Echocardiography Based on Transverse Oscillations: A Preliminary Evaluation In Silico and a Feasibility Demonstration In Vivo", "paper_id": "WOS:000335379500013"}
