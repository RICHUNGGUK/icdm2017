We examine a 5 month long log of user activity and traffic volume collected by a wireless network service provider operating hotspots in restaurants, serviced apartments, hotels and airports all over Australia. We categorize users based on their account time limits to analyze the impact of account stratification on the overall user behavior. A similarity index is developed to compare two datasets of unknown distributions which we then use to quantitatively compare how similar or different various types of accounts are. The user population of the network is found to be highly fluctuating, hence user specific, population independent metrics are proposed to account for this transience. We also introduce metrics to measure account time and data utilization. Key user and traffic statistics are presented for reference.", "paper_title": "Characterization of user activity and traffic in a commercial nationwide Wi-Fi hotspot network: global and individual metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000323924800020"}
