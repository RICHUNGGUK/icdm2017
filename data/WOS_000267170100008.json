It is remarked that if the Lorenz curve L(X) of X is above the Lorenz curve L(Y) of Y, then the g-index g(X) of X is larger than or equal to the g-index g(Y) of Y. We indicate that this is a good property for so-called impact measures which is not shared by other impact measures such as the h-index. If L(X) = L(Y) and Sigma(N)(j=1)x(j) = Sigma(N)(j=1)y(j) we prove that g(X) >= g(Y). We can even show that g(X) > g(Y) in case of integer values x(i) and y(j) and we also investigate this property for other impact measures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
