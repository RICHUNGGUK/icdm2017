Existing approaches, such as the n-gram indexing methods, create indexes full of redundancies. In this paper, a numeric index construction method is used for efficient content-based melody retrieval. Music phrases are adopted as the basic unit for processing, with each phrase having a unique numeric index. The proposed method significantly reduces the required processing time and storage for retrieval and indexing. For similarity matching, an approach that solves the problems caused by the complex interaction of substitution, insertion, and deletion errors is proposed. The proposed approach is compared with n-gram method and its effectiveness in melody retrieval is demonstrated. In addition, extensive experiments show its robustness against various kinds of query error.", "paper_title": "A NUMERIC INDEXING AND ACCESS MECHANISM FOR MELODY RETRIEVAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626800035"}
