In this work, the potentials of reset control in networked control systems are investigated. Specifically, stability conditions are developed for the case in which network-induced delays are time-varying. To this end, it is shown how a network-based reset control system may be represented as a discrete-time reset control system. In addition, both state-dependent and time-dependent discrete-time reset compensators are analyzed. Finally, a case study is developed and simulation results are discussed, showing the superior performance of reset compensation.", "paper_title": "Network-Based Reset Control Systems With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600050"}
