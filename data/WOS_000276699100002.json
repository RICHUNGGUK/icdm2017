The new method also enhances the repair quality by adoption of a flexible edit strategy to support shifting symbols unrestrictedly, as well as inserting and deleting symbols, in order to repair invalid input strings. Experimental results show that the new method excels existing works in repair quality and efficiency.", "paper_title": "LR error repair using the A* algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000276699100002"}
