Under the assumption of independent Rayleigh-fading channels for different receivers, as the total number of receivers a goes to infinity, the maximum number of active receivers is shown to be arbitrarily close to 1n(P 1n n)/R-min with probability approaching 1, where P is the total transmit power.", "paper_title": "On the optimal number of active receivers in fading broadcast channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000253602200030"}
