Studies show that DRAMs contribute to a significant part of overall system power consumption. One of the main challenges in low-power DRAM design is the inevitable refresh process. Due to process variation, memory cells exhibit retention time variations. Current DRAMs use a single refresh period determined by the cell with the largest leakage. Since prolonging refresh intervals introduces retention errors, a set of previous works adopt conventional error-correcting code (ECC) to correct retention errors. However, these approaches introduce significant area and energy overheads. In this article, we propose a novel error correction framework for retention errors in DRAMs, called SECRET (selective error correction for refresh energy reduction). The key observations we make are that retention errors are hard errors rather than soft errors, and only few DRAM cells have large leakage. Therefore, instead of equipping error correction capability for all memory cells as existing ECC schemes, we only allocate error correction information to leaky cells under a refresh interval. Our SECRET framework contains two parts: an offline phase to identify memory cells with retention errors given a target error rate and a low-overhead error correction mechanism. The experimental results show that among all test cases performed, the proposed SECRET framework can reduce refresh power by 87.2% and overall DRAM power up to 18.57% with negligible area and performance overheads.", "paper_title": "SECRET: A Selective Error Correction Framework for Refresh Energy Reduction in DRAMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000357952000011"}
