The tablets often contain mixtures of drugs such as sulfadiazine, sulfadimidine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfanilamide and trimethoprim. Thus, a simple, rapid and inexpensive method for the simultaneous determination of these drugs was researched and developed with the aid of chemometrics methods comparing the classical least squares (CLS), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS) models. UV-spectra were collected in the 200-350 nm range from a set of samples containing aqueous ethanolic solutions (pH=9.9) of drug mixtures prepared from the above compounds with the aid of an orthogonal array design. Initial studies of the UV-spectra of the individual compounds showed that satisfactory linear regression calibration models could be constructed in the concentration range of approximately 1.0-24.0 mg l(-1) for all compounds with LOD values in the range of ca. 0.2-1.0 mg l(-1) for each of the five drugs. These studies also indicated the significant spectral overlap of the UV-spectra of the drugs showing the need for chemometrics modeling for simultaneous analysis of the mixtures. Calibration models for the three multivariate methods were constructed with the use of die raw and derivative spectral data sets. These were verified with the aid of UV-spectral data obtained from a separately prepared set of drug mixture samples. The %RPE values for analysis of the individual drugs in mixtures were in the range of 2-10 with %Recoveries being close to 100 for the PCR and PLS models while the CLS method performed relatively poorly. The four PCR and the PLS models constructed could not be distinguished on prediction performance for practical purposes, and the PCR calibration based on the raw data matrix was utilised to illustrate successfully the application of the proposed method for analysis of the drugs in commonly available pharmaceutical tablets.
