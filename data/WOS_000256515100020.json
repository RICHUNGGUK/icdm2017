Typically, CNNs can be implemented using VLSI circuits, but this would unavoidably require additional hardware. On the other hand, we can also implement CNNs purely by software; this, however, would result in very low performance when given a large CNN problem size. Nowadays, conventional desktop computers are usually equipped with programmable graphics processing units (GPUs) that can support parallel data processing. This paper introduces a GPU-based CNN simulator. In detail, we carefully organize the CNN data as 4-channel textures, and efficiently implement the CNN computation as fragment programs running in parallel on a GPU. In this way, we can create a high performance but low-cost CNN simulator. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the resultant GPU-based CNN simulator can run 8-17 times faster than a CPU-based CNN simulator. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
