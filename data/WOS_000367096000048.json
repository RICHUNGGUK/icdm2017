However, the existing research on physical-layer network coding (PNC), usually assumes that the symbol timing of the nodes is fully synchronized and hardly investigates the unavoidable symbol timing errors. Similar to many telecommunication systems, symbol timing plays a critical role in PNC and precise alignment has to be provided for the encoding. In this work, we propose a novel symbol timing algorithm with a low oversampling factor (samples per symbol) based on the a priori knowledge of the transmitted pulse shape. The proposed algorithm has the dual advantages of the low oversampling rate and high precision. The mean square error (MSE) performance is verified by simulations to be at least one order of magnitude better than that of the conventional optimum phase (OP) algorithm for a signal noise ratio (SNR) greater than 5 dB.", "paper_title": "Node Symbol Timing Error Estimator for Physical-Layer Network-Coded Relay", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000048"}
