Its main focus is on providing a common framework for the implementation of the many IGA methods for the discretization of partial differential equations currently studied, mainly based on B-Splines and Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), while being flexible enough to allow users to implement new and more general methods with a relatively small effort. This paper presents the philosophy at the basis of the design of GeoPDEs and its relation to a quite comprehensive, abstract definition of IGA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
