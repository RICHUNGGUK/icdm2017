These programs have tremendous challenges on the signature-based antivirus products. Machine learning techniques are applicable for detecting unknown malicious programs without knowing their signatures. In this paper, a layered classification method is developed to detect malwares with a two-layer framework. The low-level-classifier is employed to identify whether the programs perform any malicious functions according to the API-calls of the programs; the up-level-classifier is applied to detect malwares according to the function identification. A hybrid structure called Type-Function, constituting of the classification results of low-level-classifier and up-level-classifier, is proposed to describe the malware. This method is compared with Naive Bayes, decision tree, and boosting using a comprehensive test dataset containing 16,135 malwares and 1800 benign programs. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other algorithms in terms of detection accuracy. Moreover, the Type-Function structure is proved as an unprejudiced and effective method for malware description.
