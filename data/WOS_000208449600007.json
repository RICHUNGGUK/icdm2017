The CSA is employed to improve the harmony memory members in the HS method. The hybrid optimisation algorithm is further used to optimise Sugeno fuzzy classification systems for the Fisher Iris data and wine data classification. Computer simulations results demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our new approach.", "paper_title": "Fusion of clonal selection algorithm and harmony search method in optimisation of fuzzy classification systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000208449600007"}
