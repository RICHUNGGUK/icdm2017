I argue that this idea has an objective analog in information science-the tf*idf (term frequency, inverse document frequency) formula used to weight indexing terms in document retrieval. Here, tf*idf is used to weight terms from five bibliometric distributions in the context of the seed terms that generated them. The distributions include the descriptors co-assigned with a descriptor, the descriptors and identifiers assigned to an author, two examples of cited authors and their co-citees, and the books and journals cited with a famous book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. In each case, the highest-ranked terms are contrasted with lowest-ranked terms. In two cases, pennant diagrams, a new way of displaying bibliometric data, augment the tabular results. Clear qualitative differences between the sets of terms are intuitively well-explained by relevance theory.", "paper_title": "Some new tests of relevance theory in information science", "paper_id": "WOS:000277418400005"}
