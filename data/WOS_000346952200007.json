This paper presents a hybrid structure that combines set of experience knowledge structures (SOEKS) and evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), to solve multiple optimization problems. The proposed structure uses experience that is derived from a former decision event to improve the evolutionary algorithm's ability to find optimal solutions rapidly and efficiently. It is embedded in a smart experience-based data analysis system (SEDAS) introduced in the paper. Experimental illustrative results of SEDAS application to solve a travelling salesman problem show that our new proposed hybrid model can find optimal or close to true Pareto-optimal solutions in a fast and efficient way.
