In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient error correction scheme for real-time communications with QoS requirements in wireless networks. The QoS requirement of a message stream is modeled with (m, k) constraint, implying that at least m messages should be sent to a receiver during any window of k periods. The proposed scheme adaptively selects an error correcting code in an energy-efficient manner so that it maximizes the number of QoS provisionings per unit energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Energy-aware error correction for QoS-provisioning real-time communications in wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257990300017"}
