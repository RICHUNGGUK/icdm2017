The realization of explicit interaction in ubiquitous or pervasive computing environments introduces a physical distribution of input devices, and technology embedded into the environment of the user. To fulfill the requirements of emerging trends in mobile interaction, common approaches for system design need adaptations and extensions. This paper presents the adaptation and extension of the Model-View-Controller approach to design applications of remote, complementary, duplicated and detached user interface elements.
