The use of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents is essential to ensure the integration of heterogeneous information systems. XML is widely used because of its platform-independence and the ability it offers to separate content from presentation. It is also used as a medium for form documents that are used over the flow of business processes. Recently most business processes have been managed by a software system, the Business Process Management (BPM) system. Change management of XML documents - recording and tracing the history of the documents - is important in e-business environments where multiple companies are involved. In this paper, we propose a new method of storing documents whereby changes are detected automatically and document versions are reconstructed upon user request. In addition, this method has allowed a model to recover documents even after a system error. A prototype system was implemented on top of a workflow system and an experiment was carried out to test the efficiency of our method. Our approach provides efficient storage and convenient management of documents. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
