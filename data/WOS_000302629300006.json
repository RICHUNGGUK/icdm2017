Using Schatzki's work as a starting point, this conceptual paper explores the practice approach, and its actual and potential application to different fields in information science. The paper begins by discussing definitions of practice, and charting differences in how authors have emphasized different aspects within the theory, such as the body, materiality, routine and knowing. Examples drawn from a study of family photography illustrate the discussion. The paper also locates a familiar concept, communities of practice, in the wider development of the theory. It then evaluates the practice approach as a perspective. The last sections of the paper examine the ways in which the practice approach has begun to be used in the study of information behaviour. The paper concludes that recasting this field as the study of information in social practice - in other words, as about exploring how information activities are woven through social practices - could be a highly productive perspective.", "paper_title": "An exploration of the practice approach and its place in information science", "paper_id": "WOS:000302629300006"}
