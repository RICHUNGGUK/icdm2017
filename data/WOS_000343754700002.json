We show that with probability tending to one as n -> infinity, this occurs at the very moment the last zero row or zero column disappears. We prove a related result for random symmetric Bernoulli matrices, and give quantitative bounds for some related problems. These results extend earlier work by Costello and Vu [10].", "paper_title": "Hitting Time Theorems for Random Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000343754700002"}
