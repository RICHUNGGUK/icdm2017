To improve fault diagnosis performance, it is essential to reduce the dimensionality of collected data. This paper presents a modified discrete binary ant colony optimization (MDBACO) to optimize discrete combinational problems, and then further combines it with SVM to accomplishing fault feature selection. The tests of optimizing benchmark functions show the developed MDBACO is valid and effective. The fault diagnosis results and comparisons of simulations based on Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) prove the feature selection method based on MDBACO and SVM can find the essential fault variables quickly and exactly, and greatly increases the fault diagnosis correct rates as irrelevant variables are eliminated properly.", "paper_title": "A modified discrete binary ant colony optimization and its application in chemical process fault diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300112"}
