These operators jointly render the algorithm implicit with respect to propagation of the shear Alfven wave to leading order. As a result, the maximum stable time step is increased by up to a factor of three for many practical applications. The additional computational cost is trivial for the linear mode of operation and adds only approximately 30% additional execution time per step for nonlinear calculations. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
