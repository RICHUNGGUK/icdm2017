Building green data center networks providing cloud computing services is an emerging trend in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry, because of Global Warming and the potential GHG emissions resulting from cloud services. As one of the first worldwide initiatives provisioning ICT services entirely based on renewable energy such as solar, wind and hydroelectricity across Canada and around the world, the GreenStar Network (GSN) was developed to dynamically transport user services to be processed in data centers built in proximity to green energy sources, reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of ICT equipments. Regarding the current approach, which focuses mainly in reducing energy consumption at the micro-level through energy efficiency improvements, the overall energy consumption will eventually increase due to the growing demand from new services and users, resulting in an increase in GHG emissions. Based on the cooperation between Mantychore FP7 and the GSN, our approach is, therefore, much broader and more appropriate because it focuses on GHG emission reductions at the macro-level. This article presents some outcomes of our implementation of such a network model, which spans multiple green nodes in Canada, Europe and the USA. The network provides cloud computing services based on dynamic provision of network slices through relocation of virtual data centers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
