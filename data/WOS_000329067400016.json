The proposed design successfully solves the long discharging path problem in conventional explicit type pulse-triggered FF (P-FF) designs and achieves better speed and power performance. Based on post-layout simulation results using TSMC CMOS 90-nm technology, the proposed design outperforms the conventional P-FF design data-close-to-output (ep-DCO) by 8.2% in data-to-Q delay. In the mean time, the performance edges on power and power-delay-product metrics are 22.7% and 29.7%, respectively.", "paper_title": "Low-Power Pulse-Triggered Flip-Flop Design Based on a Signal Feed-Through Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000329067400016"}
