It has often been observed that the marginal distributions of such time series have heavy tails; thus we examine the BL-GARCH model in a general setting under some non-normal distributions. We investigate some probabilistic properties of this model and we conduct a Monte Carlo experiment to evaluate the small-sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methodology for various models. Finally, within-sample estimation properties were studied using SP 500 daily returns, when the features of interest manifest as volatility clustering and leverage effects. The main results suggest that the Student-t BL-GARCH seems highly appropriate to describe the SP 500 daily returns.", "paper_title": "BL-GARCH models with elliptical distributed innovations", "paper_id": "WOS:000278439300005"}
