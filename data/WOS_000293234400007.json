A next-generation electronic-design-automation methodology improves timing closure through clock-network synthesis and placement of flip-flops and latches to avoid timing disruptions or immediately recover from them. When evaluated on large cpu designs, the methodology saw double-digit improvements in timing, wirelength, and area versus current technology.", "paper_title": "PHYSICAL SYNTHESIS WITH CLOCK-NETWORK OPTIMIZATION FOR LARGE SYSTEMS ON CHIPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293234400007"}
