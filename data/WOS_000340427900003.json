In ACO(MV), the decision variables of an optimization problem can be explicitly declared as continuous, ordinal, or categorical, which allows the algorithm to treat them adequately. ACO(MV) includes three solution generation mechanisms: a continuous optimization mechanism (ACO(R)), a continuous relaxation mechanism (ACO(MV)-o) for ordinal variables, and a categorical optimization mechanism (ACO(MV)-c) for categorical variables. Together, these mechanisms allow ACO(MV) to tackle mixed-variable optimization problems. We also define a novel procedure to generate artificial, mixed-variable benchmark functions, and we use it to automatically tune ACO(MV)'s parameters. The tuned ACO(MV) is tested on various real-world continuous and mixed-variable engineering optimization problems. Comparisons with results from the literature demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ACO(MV) on mixed-variable optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Ant Colony Optimization for Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340427900003"}
