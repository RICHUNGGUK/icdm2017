The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is a powerful tool for the analysis of nonstationary signals, especially, chirp-like signal. Thus, it has become an active area in the signal processing community, with many applications of radar, communication, electronic warfare, and information security. Therefore, it is necessary for us to generalize the theorem for Fourier domain analysis of decimation and interpolation. Firstly, this paper defines the digital frequency in the fractional Fourier domain (FRFD) through the sampling theorems with FRFT. Secondly, FRFD analysis of decimation and interpolation is proposed in this paper with digital frequency in FRFD followed by the studies of interpolation filter and decimation filter in FRFD. Using these results, FRFD analysis of the sampling rate conversion by a rational factor is illustrated. The noble identities of decimation and interpolation in FRFD are then deduced using previous results and the fractional convolution theorem. The proposed theorems in this study are the bases for the generalizations of the multirate signal processing in FRFD, which can advance the filter banks theorems in FRFD. Finally, the theorems introduced in this paper are validated by simulations.", "paper_title": "Fractional Fourier domain analysis of decimation and interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000249266300001"}
