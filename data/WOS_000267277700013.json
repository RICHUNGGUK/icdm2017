To point out the versatility of this approach, a nonlinear (Kerr-effect) finite crystal is considered. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a new route for obtaining the scattered field by nonlinear obstacles is proposed. The basic idea consists in simulating the real incident field (e.g. plane waves) by a virtual field emitted by an appropriate antenna, located in a meshed domain, and encompassing or lying above the obstacles. This latest problem is then solved by a finite element method that is well suited to take into account the material inhomogeneities due to the nonlinearity of the permittivity. Findings - The transmission through a finite Kerr crystal doped by a microcavity is given and a resonant wavelength is obtained. At this resonant wavelength, it is shown that the nonlinearity has a large influence on the behaviour of the electromagnetic wave. Originality/value - Introducing the concept of virtual antenna, the paper proposes a rigorous treatment of the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a bounded nonlinear obstacle of arbitrary shape.", "paper_title": "Scattering by a two-dimensional doped photonic crystal presenting an optical Kerr effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000267277700013"}
