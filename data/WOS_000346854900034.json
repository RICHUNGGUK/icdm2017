Although the minimization of total variation (TV) regularized functionals is among the most popular methods for edge-preserving image restoration, such methods were only very recently applied to cyclic structures. However, as for Euclidean data, TV regularized variational methods suffer from the so-called staircasing effect. This effect can be avoided by involving higher order derivatives into the functional. This is the first paper which uses higher order differences of cyclic data in regularization terms of energy functionals for image restoration. We introduce absolute higher order differences for S-1-valued data in a sound way which is independent of the chosen representation system on the circle. Our absolute cyclic first order difference is just the geodesic distance between points. Similar to the geodesic distances, the absolute cyclic second order differences have only values in [0, pi]. We update the cyclic variational TV approach by our new cyclic second order differences. To minimize the corresponding functional we apply a cyclic proximal point method which was recently successfully proposed for Hadamard manifolds. Choosing appropriate cycles this algorithm can be implemented in an efficient way. The main steps require the evaluation of proximal mappings of our cyclic differences for which we provide analytical expressions. Under certain conditions we prove the convergence of our algorithm. Various numerical examples with artificial as well as real-world data demonstrate the advantageous performance of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Second Order Differences of Cyclic Data and Applications in Variational Denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000346854900034"}
