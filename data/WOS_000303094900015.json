SVCs have demonstrated a wide range of applications in commerce. SVCs are in general tamper-resistant, but they are very computationally weak and their security mechanisms are also weak against side-channel attacks. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure stored-value card system. With the help of pre-computations, stored-value cards in our scheme are only required to perform simple arithmetic operations and bitwise comparisons. Our system especially for SVCs is secure with unbounded computational leakage resilience. Our novel scheme provides a practical solution to side-channel attacks for light-weight devices.
