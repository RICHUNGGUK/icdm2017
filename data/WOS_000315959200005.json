Computation of the disparity map, a vital step in extracting depth information from stereo images, requires a significant amount of computational resources. As such, existing software implementations require high-end hardware platforms to achieve real-time frame rates, suggesting that dedicated hardware mechanisms might be more suitable for embedded applications. In this paper, we present a disparity map computation architecture targeting embedded stereo vision applications with hard real-time requirements. The architecture integrates a hardware edge detection mechanism that reduces the search space, improving the overall performance, and is configurable in terms of various application parameters, making it suitable for a number of application environments. The paper also presents a study on the impact of the various parameters in terms of the performance and hardware/power overheads. An experimental prototype of the architecture was implemented on the Xilinx ML505 FPGA Evaluation Platform, achieving 50 Frames Per Second (fps) for 1,280 x 1,024 image sizes. Moreover, the quality of the disparity maps generated by the proposed system is comparable to other existing hardware implementations featuring local stereo correspondence methods.", "paper_title": "Edge-Directed Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Disparity Map Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000315959200005"}
