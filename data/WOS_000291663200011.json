The proposed approach offers a simple test flow and does not require intensive interactions between a BIST controller and a tester. The scheme rests on partitioning of rows and columns of the memory array by employing low cost test logic. It is designed to meet requirements of at-speed test thus enabling detection of timing defects. Experimental results confirm high diagnostic accuracy of the proposed scheme and its time efficiency.", "paper_title": "BIST-Based Fault Diagnosis for Read-Only Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000291663200011"}
