It was first presented in Edinburgh, during the Ninth Workshop on Membrane Computing (WMC9). In this paper, the models, simulators and formats included in P-Lingua in version 2.0 are explained. We focus on the stochastic model, associated simulators and updated features. Finally, we present one of the first applications based on P-Lingua: a tool for describing and simulating ecosystems.", "paper_title": "P-Lingua 2.0: A software framework for cell-like P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000267551700005"}
