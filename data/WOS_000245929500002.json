In this paper, we consider a state feedback control problem of the automaton. First, we introduce two transition systems as semantics of the automaton. Next, using these transition systems, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a predicate to be control-invariant. Finally, we show that there always exists the supremal control-invariant subpredicate for any predicate.", "paper_title": "Control-invariance of sampled-data hybrid systems with clocked events and jitters", "paper_id": "WOS:000245929500002"}
