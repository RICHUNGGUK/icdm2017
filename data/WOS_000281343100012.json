Inspired by the ultra-wideband impulse radio, a novel theoretical synthesis method of the neuron for application to spike-pattern division multiplex communications in an artificial pulse-coupled neural network is presented. Also, a novel heuristic learning algorithm of the neuron for realization of better communication performances is presented. In addition, fundamental comparisons to existing impulse radio sequence design methods are given.", "paper_title": "Theoretical and Heuristic Synthesis of Digital Spiking Neurons for Spike-Pattern-Division Multiplexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000281343100012"}
