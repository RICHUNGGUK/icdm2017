In the past, people from either a musical or AI background have tended to solve the problem by means of implementing a computerized version of musical analysis. Previous attempts are discussed and then attention is focused on a non-analytical solution first reported by J.A.Gabura. A practical way to carry it out is discussed as well as its limitations in relation to examples. References are made to the MusicXML format as needed.", "paper_title": "About the determination of key of a musical excerpt", "paper_id": "WOS:000237806800007"}
