In consequence, the present study focuses on teachers' perceived usefulness of ICT for teaching and learning and is aimed at describing its structure and relations to self-efficacy, ICT use, and teachers' age. By means of Bayesian analysis, we specified confirmatory factor-analytic and structural equation models to a large-scale data set of N = 1190 Norwegian teachers. Our results supported the hypothesized four-factor structure of teachers' perceived usefulness of ICT, signifying different facets of ICT-related teaching goals in classrooms. Moreover, it was possible to disentangle general and specific components of the construct in nested factor models. In support of existing research, we found positive relations to self-efficacy and ICT use, but a negative relation to teachers' age. Our study provides evidence on a multidimensional conceptualization of teachers' perceived usefulness of ICT for teaching and learning, and verifies the relations to teacher-related characteristics. Implications for the measurement and modeling of the construct, and future research directions are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
