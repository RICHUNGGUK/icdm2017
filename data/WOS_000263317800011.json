The rules governing the evolution of the embedded proteins are inspired from brane calculi. We use some basic operations of brane calculi, namely, exo, endo, bud, mate, pino, wrap in the formalism of membrane Computing. We also use rules allowing the movement of proteins. to pass through membranes and attach to and detach from the membranes. Combining the two kinds of operations, namely, brane calculi operations as well as protein movement operations, we have obtained some universality results Of P systems. We have also identified some decidable sub-classes of P systems by restricting the use of the protein movement rules. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
