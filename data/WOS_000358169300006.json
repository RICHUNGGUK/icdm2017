The optical network unit (ONU) is the best candidate to implement energy-saving adjustments in EPON. Turning off the ONU transmitter (Tx)/receiver (Rx) for substantial time is a common method to achieve the energy saving. However, setting overlong sleep duration decreases the QoS, while short sleep duration increases the ONU power consumption. The challenging issue is how to balance the trade-off between achieving energy saving and guaranteeing QoS. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced EPON architecture and a QoS-aware energy-saving mechanism to reduce ONU energy consumption and guarantee an overall QoS metric based on the ITU-T standards requirements. To achieve the energy saving in the upstream/downstream direction, two sleep durations are defined for the ONU's Tx/Rx to generate four ONU modes including active, transmission, doze, and sleep. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the energy efficiency 44 % in average to fulfill the QoS metrics in terms of packet loss, delay and jitter, and the buffer requirement.", "paper_title": "QoS-aware energy-efficient mechanism for sleeping mode ONUs in enhanced EPON", "paper_id": "WOS:000358169300006"}
