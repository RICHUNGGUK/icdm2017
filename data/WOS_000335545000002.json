Instead, ISD visualisations focus on presenting a more mechanical/technical perspective, ultimately restricting an opportunity to better analyse the process. Objective: With particular focus on Requirements Elicitation this study utilises the narrative network technique to visualise the ISD process as a live routine with the aim to detail the ideal and actual aspects of ISD. The ideal aspect consists of the abstract, generalised understandings of the human actors regarding enacting a routine. Being a live routine, the reality is that adjustments/variations are a common occurrence and need to be taken into account. Enabling the opportunity to identify patterns of action within the routine, the study also incorporates organisational mindfulness to provide further social analysis of these patterns of action. Method: In light of the lack of theoretical maturity around the viewing of an ISD process as a 'live routine', this exploratory research sought to build theory using a single instrumental case study spanning over 3 years (several ISD projects) and a variety of methods (e.g. workshop, experiment). Results: Visualising the ISD process as a live routine it was possible to identify a number of patterns of action. These patterns were triangulated against the organisational mindfulness analysis of the case data to highlight underlying mindless behaviours. A rule was then implemented (experimentally) during the first iteration of a new ISD project and notable improvements in the ISD process were observed. Furthermore, the knock on organisational impact of the experimental implementation of the rule is also examined. Conclusion: From a practitioner perspective the study provides an alternative method for analysing the ISD process of an organisation and highlights the benefits of observing the ISD process as a live routine. From an academic perspective, contributions are made to both the ISD and Organisational body of knowledge. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
