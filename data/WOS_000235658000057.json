In spite of it, scientific work had been known for being solitary work, in which human interaction happened only in small groups within a research domain. Nowadays, due to technology improvements, scientific data from different sources is available, communication between researchers is facilitated and scientific information creation and exchange is faster than in the past. However, the focus on information exchange is too limited to create systems that enable true cooperation and knowledge management in scientific environments. To facilitate a more expressive exchanging, sharing and dissemination of knowledge and its management, we create a scientific knowledge management environment in which researchers may share their data, experiences, ideas, process definition and execution, and obtain all the necessary information to execute their tasks, make decisions, learn and disseminate knowledge.", "paper_title": "GCC: A knowledge management environment for research centers and universities", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000057"}
