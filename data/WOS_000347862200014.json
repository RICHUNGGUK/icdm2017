By proposing a quantization principle, the time-varying transition rate matrix (TRM) is quantized into a series of finite TRMs with norm bounded uncertainties. Then, the difficulties of the time-varying TRM confronted in system analysis and synthesis can be overcome. New criteria for stochastic admissibility analysis as well as controller synthesis are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is shown by numerical examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
