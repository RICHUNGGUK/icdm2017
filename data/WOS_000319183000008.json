Although these fuzzy quasi-metrics are not deduced explicitly from a quasi-metric, they possess interesting properties related to completeness. For instance, we prove that they are balanced and complete in the sense of Doitchinov and that only one of them is right K-sequentially complete. We also observe that compatible fuzzy quasi-metrics for the Sorgenfrey line cannot be left (weakly right) K-sequentially complete. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
