Design/methodology/approach - RHP based approach is composed of a series of periodical short-time sub-optimizations instead of global optimization. Each of the sub-optimizations is modeled by a mixed-integer-programming and solved by a branch and bound algorithm with terminal penalty. Findings - The RHP method is found to be effective and efficient. The size of the rolling horizon is positively correlated to the total weighted area of ships. Research limitations/implications - Precision of short-time predictions is the main limitation. Originality/value - This procedure promotes the navigation capacity of the Three Gorges Project and proposes a solution to the lockage-scheduling problem of the Three Gorges Project.", "paper_title": "The rolling horizon procedure on deterministic lockage co-scheduling to the two dams of the Three Gorges Project", "paper_id": "WOS:000281928100020"}
