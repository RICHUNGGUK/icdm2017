We solve each step of Newton's system by the product integration technique. Also, we provide the sufficient conditions for convergence of the numerical method. Finally, we give a test problem to illustrate the applicability and accuracy of the presented method. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
