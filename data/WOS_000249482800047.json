In many studies, several forms of context have been used without explicit association to the context concept. This paper attempts to clarify the relationship between context and group work. In particular, a framework is proposed to understand context as connected to other concepts used in group work. The framework is useful to analyze some groupware systems from the context perspective and to obtain some insight on possible improvements for users. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
