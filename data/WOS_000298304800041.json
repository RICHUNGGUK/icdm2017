In this paper, we consider decentralized supervisory control of TDESs where enforcement decisions of local supervisors are fused by the AND rule or the OR rule. We derive existence conditions of a decentralized supervisor under these decision fusion rules.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Supervisory Control of Timed Discrete Event Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800041"}
