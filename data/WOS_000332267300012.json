The methodology presented relies on a two-stage prediction strategy which introduces a calibration stage in order to relieve the effects of uncertainty on simulator input parameters. Early assessment of the response time and quality of the results obtained constitute a key component in this method. This automatic and intelligent process of identification of lengthy simulations that slow down the course of the predictions presents a very high hit ratio. However, discarding certain simulations from the adjustment process (based on evolutionary algorithms) could lead to loss of accuracy in our predictions. A strong statistical study to analyze the impact of this action on our final predictions is reported. This study is based on a real fire which burnt 13,000 ha in the region of Catalonia (north-east of Spain) in the summer of 2012. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
