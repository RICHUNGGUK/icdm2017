To control the Hopf bifurcation, a hybrid control strategy is proposed and the onset of an inherent bifurcation is delayed (advanced) when such a bifurcation is undesired (desired). Furthermore, the dynamic behaviors of the controlled system can also be changed by choosing appropriate control parameters. Numerical simulation results confirm that the new control strategy is efficient in controlling Hopf bifurcation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
