In this paper we bring a structured overview of those data aspects on which decisions need to be made, and we show that different nodes in a data exchange are dependent upon decisions made by another node with respect to these data aspects. Communicating the decisions on data aspects can happen via architectural descriptions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
