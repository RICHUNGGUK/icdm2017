Lossless data hiding is a special type of data hiding technique that guarantees not only the secret data but the cover media can be reconstructed without any distortion. In this paper, a novel path optional lossless data hiding scheme based on the joint neighboring coding (JNC) of the vector quantization (VQ) index table is proposed. The proposed scheme generates a VQ index table based on the cover image first. Next, according to an initial key and secret data content, different adjacent indices may be chosen to perform joint neighboring coding for each index and hide secret data. Finally, an appropriate output codestream is generated based on the minimal length principle. Our main contributions lie in three aspects: (1) the method combines the novel path-based shift method with the traditional JNC method to improve the capacity and stego image quality simultaneously. (2) The secret data extraction and cover image recovering processes are separated and both can be publicized to users. (3) The method is path optional to meet various users' requirements. To testify the superiority of the proposed method, we compare it with the side match VQ(SMVQ)-based and modified fast correlation VQ (MFCVQ)-based algorithms. According to the experimental results, the proposed scheme outperforms the SMVQ-based and MFCVQ-based algorithms in four aspects, i.e., hiding capacity, stego image quality, transmission efficiency and security level.
