This methodology particularly targets the e-learning and Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) communities as they need such structures to sustain the production of e-learning resources tailored to learners' needs. This paper details the steps to transform textual resources, particularly textual learning objects (LOs), into domain concept maps, and it explains how this abstract structure is transformed into a formal domain ontology. A methodology is also presented to evaluate the results of ontology learning. The paper shows how such structures (domain concept maps and formal ontologies) make it possible to bridge the gap between e-learning and Intelligent Tutoring Systems by providing a common domain model.", "paper_title": "Building Domain Ontologies from Text for Educational Purposes", "paper_id": "WOS:000207847000006"}
