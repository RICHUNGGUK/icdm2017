I. e., intuitively, A is nontrivial for E if there are arbitrarily complex sets in E which can be reduced to A. Similarly, a set A is nontrivial for the polynomial-exponential-time class EXP = DTIME(2(poly)) if for any k >= 1 there is a set (B) over cap (k) is an element of EXP such that (B) over cap (k) is reducible to A and (B) over cap (k) is not an element of DTIME(2(nk)). We show that these notions are independent, namely, there are sets A(1) and A(2) in E such that A(1) is nontrivial for E but trivial for EXP and A(2) is nontrivial for EXP but trivial for E. In fact, the latter can be strengthened to show that there is a set A is an element of E which is weakly EXP-hard in the sense of Lutz (SIAM J.
