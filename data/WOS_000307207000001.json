The hybrid algorithm combines an exact constraint programming algorithm and a tabu search heuristic. An important component of the tabu search heuristic consists of three scheduling procedures that are executed sequentially. Experiments show that the constraint programming algorithm is sometimes able to accept or reject incoming requests, and that the hybrid method outperforms each of the two algorithms when they are executed alone.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Tabu Search and Constraint Programming Algorithm for the Dynamic Dial-a-Ride Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000307207000001"}
