Each cubic helical segment r(k)(xi) connecting p(k-1) and p(k) is constructed such that its end tangents are symmetric with respect to the displacement vector Delta p(k) = p(k) - p(k-1). The existence condition of such a segment r(k)(xi) is formulated in terms of the configuration involving Delta P-k and the Frenet frame of r(k)(xi) at p(k-1). A Frenet-frame-continuous spline is obtained by matching the Frenet frames of sequentially constructed segments at their juncture points. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
