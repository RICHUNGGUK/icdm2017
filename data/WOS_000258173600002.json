While it is known that the asymptotic almost sure diameter drops from linear to poly-logarithmic as the exponent s decreases below 2 [4, 9], the asymptotic almost sure mixing time drops from N(2) only to N(s-1) (up to poly-logarithmic factors).", "paper_title": "Long-range percolation mixing time", "paper_id": "WOS:000258173600002"}
