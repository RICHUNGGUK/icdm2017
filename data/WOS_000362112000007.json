However, their high dimensionality resists them from matching faster and being used in a low-end device. In this paper we propose an efficient and feasible learning method to select discriminative binary patterns for constructing a compact local descriptor. In the selection, a searching tree with Branch&Bound is used instead of the exhaustive enumeration, in order to avoid tremendous computation in training. New local descriptors are constructed based on the selected patterns. The efficiency of selecting binary patterns has been confirmed by the evaluation of these new local descriptors' performance in experiments of image matching and object recognition.", "paper_title": "Selecting Discriminative Binary Patterns for a Local Feature", "paper_id": "WOS:000362112000007"}
