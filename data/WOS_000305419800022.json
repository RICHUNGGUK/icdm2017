Classifying the read mixture to separate the two allows for more precise analysis to be performed. Results: We present a technique, with an associated tool Xenome, which performs fast, accurate and specific classification of xenograft-derived sequence read data. We have evaluated it on RNA-Seq data from human, mouse and human-in-mouse xenograft datasets.", "paper_title": "Xenome-a tool for classifying reads from xenograft samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000305419800022"}
