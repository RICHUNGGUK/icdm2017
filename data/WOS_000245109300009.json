Unsmooth motion is frequently observed in a haptic system using brakes during a wall-following task. Since it is generally known that a haptic system using brakes is passive due to brake's characteristics, its energy behavior has seldom been investigated. However, force distribution at the end effector reveals that the unsmooth motion of a haptic system using brakes represents active behavior of the system in the specific direction. A force control scheme is proposed that computes the gain for smooth motion by considering the energy behavior of a system. Experiments show that smooth wall following is possible with a proposed force control scheme.", "paper_title": "Energy-based control of a haptic device using brakes", "paper_id": "WOS:000245109300009"}
