The method reconstructs the geometry of the road by a smoothing variational cubic spline, computes the curvature function of this spline and approximates the curvature function using a polygonal function formed by trapezoids on the abscises axis. This method permits to obtain alignments that can be used to study any road system that has certain characteristics. (C) 2014 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
