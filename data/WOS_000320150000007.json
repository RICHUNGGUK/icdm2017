However, existing algorithms to compute the MS complex are restricted to either piecewise linear or discrete scalar fields. This paper presents a new combinatorial algorithm to compute MS complexes for two-dimensional piecewise bilinear functions defined on quadrilateral meshes. We derive a new invariant of the gradient flow within a bilinear cell and use it to develop a provably correct computation, unaffected by numerical instabilities. This includes a combinatorial algorithm to detect and classify critical points as well as a way to determine the asymptotes of cell-based saddles and their intersection with cell edges. Finally, we introduce a simple data structure to compute and store integral lines on quadrilateral meshes which by construction prevents intersections and allows to enforce constraints on the gradient flow that preserve known invariants.
