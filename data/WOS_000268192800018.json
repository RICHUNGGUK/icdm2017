A substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) BFN is designed and fabricated on a single Rogers 5880 substrate. This device is not only marked by features of conventional BFN, such as Butler matrix, but also has additional benefits, e.g. more compact configuration and higher radiation efficiency. Measured and simulated results based on the proposed structure are in a good agreement, which indicates that this novel type of BFN has good characteristics and presents an excellent candidate in the development of intelligent microwave and millimeter-wave multibeam antenna systems.", "paper_title": "Design of a multimode beamforming network based on the scattering matrix analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000268192800018"}
