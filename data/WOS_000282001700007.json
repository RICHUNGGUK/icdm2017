Compressed sensing is a lossless coding strategy for analog sources by means of multiplication by real-valued matrices. In this paper we study almost lossless analog compression for analog memoryless sources in an information-theoretic framework, in which the compressor or decompressor is constrained by various regularity conditions, in particular linearity of the compressor and Lipschitz continuity of the decompressor. The fundamental limit is shown to the information dimension proposed by Renyi in 1959.", "paper_title": "Renyi Information Dimension: Fundamental Limits of Almost Lossless Analog Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700007"}
