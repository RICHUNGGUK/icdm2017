We consider a multi-objective function for the planners, which simultaneously maximizes land prices and reduces incompatibility among adjacent land uses for an area. Land price of each and every plot of real estate developer is also optimized in response to the rules set by city development authorities. The differences in opinions of these two stakeholders are highlighted for a case study area of Bangladesh. The ultimate goal is to look for a computationally easy and efficient tool for generating and evaluating feasible land use plans to facilitate the allocation decision. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
