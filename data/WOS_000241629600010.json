Scientists hope that such analysis may, for example, describe relationships between gene function and clinical events such as death or recovery. Methods are available for relating gene expression to measurements that are categorized or continuous, but there is less work in relating expressions to an observed event time such as time to death, response or relapse. When gene expressions are measured over time, there are methods for differentiating temporal patterns. However, methods have not yet been proposed for the survival analysis of longitudinally collected microarrays. Results: We describe an approach for the survival analysis of longitudinal gene expression data. We construct a measure of association between the time to an event and gene expressions collected over time. Statistical significance is addressed using permutations and control of the false discovery rate. Our proposed method is illustrated on a dataset from a multi-center research study of inflammation and response to injury that aims to uncover the biological reasons why patients can have dramatically different outcomes after suffering a traumatic injury (www.gluegrant.org).", "paper_title": "Survival analysis of longitudinal microarrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000241629600010"}
