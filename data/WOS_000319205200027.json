Correct and anatomically precise localization of an epileptic focus is essential to decide if resection of brain tissue is possible. The inverse problem in EEG-based source localization is to determine the location of the brain sources that are responsible for the measured potentials at the scalp electrodes. We propose a new global optimization method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the epileptic spike EEG source localization inverse problem. In a forward problem a modified subtraction method is proposed to reduce the computational time. The good accuracy and fast convergence are demonstrated for 2D and 3D cases with realistic head models. The results from the new method are promising for use in the pre-surgical clinic in the future.
