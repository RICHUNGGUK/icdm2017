The best running time so far is O(d2(O(k7 log k)) by Giesen and Wagner after the adaptive neighborhood graph is constructed. Given the adaptive neighborhood graph, the PCA-based algorithm outputs the true dimension in O(d2(O(k))) time, provided that P satisfies a standard sampling condition as in previous results. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach. A further advantage is that both the algorithm and its analysis can be generalized to the noisy case, in which small perturbations of the samples and a small portion of outliers are allowed.", "paper_title": "PROVABLE DIMENSION DETECTION USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262258600003"}
