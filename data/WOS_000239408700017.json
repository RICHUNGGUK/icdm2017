By using a version of the decoder that corrects also erasures, the codes can replace maximum-distance separable (MDS) outer codes in concatenated constructions, thus resulting in linear-time encodable and decodable codes that approach the Zyablov bound or the capacity of memoryless channels. The presented construction improves on an earlier result by Guruswami and Indyk in that any rate and relative minimum distance that lies below the Singleton bound is attainable for. a significantly smaller alphabet size.", "paper_title": "Improved nearly-MDS expander codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408700017"}
