In the new method, the pulses operated as FRFT will propagate in a new domain, in which the waveform in time domain will keep nearly unchanged through the transmission. The novel method achieves a 400 km optical transmission for an optical pulse with the full width at the 1/e point of peak power of 80 ps without any dispersion compensation and the pulse offers a nice performance with negligible nonlinear distortion. Compared with the soliton communication, this scheme shows more advantages on linear and nonlinear distortions without strict restriction to input pulses.", "paper_title": "A minimum distortion transmission scheme under combined effects of chromatic dispersion and SPM based on optical time-domain fractional Fourier transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283589400003"}
