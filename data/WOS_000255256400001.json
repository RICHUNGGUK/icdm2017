Instead of the conventional flat vector representation for a face, a neural network approach-based technique is proposed to transform the Localised Gabor Feature (LGF) vectors extracted from human facial components into Human Face Tree Structure (HFTS) to represent a human face. A structural training algorithm is assigned to train and recognize the face identity in this HFTS representation with the corresponding LGF vectors. By benchmarking using the tested public face databases presented in this paper, our approach is able to achieve accuracy up to 90% under different scenarios of lighting conditions and posture orientations.", "paper_title": "Human face recognition by adaptive processing of tree structures representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255256400001"}
