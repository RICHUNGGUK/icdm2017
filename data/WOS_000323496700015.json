However, existing efforts mainly focus on informatization of hospitals or medical institutions within the organizations, and few are directly oriented to the patients, their families, and other ordinary people. The strong demand for various medical and public health care services from customers calls for the creation of powerful individual-oriented personalized health care service systems. Service computing and related technologies can greatly help one in fulfilling this task. In this paper, we present PHISP: a Public-oriented Health care Information Service Platform, which is based on such technologies. It can support numerous health care tasks, provide individuals with many intelligent and personalized services, and support basic remote health care and guardianship. In order to realize the personalized customization and active recommendation of intelligent services for individuals, several key techniques for service composition are integrated, which can support branch and parallel control structures in the process models of composite services and are highlighted in this paper.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of a Web-Service-Based Public-Oriented Personalized Health Care Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000323496700015"}
