Iijima, Matsuo, Chao and Tsujii gave such homomorphisms for a large class of elliptic curves by working over We extend their results and demonstrate that they can be applied to the GLV method. In general we expect our method to require about 0.75 the time of previous best methods (except for subfield curves, for which Frobenius expansions can be used). We give detailed implementation results which show that the method runs in between 0.70 and 0.83 the time of the previous best methods for elliptic curve point multiplication on general curves.", "paper_title": "Endomorphisms for Faster Elliptic Curve Cryptography on a Large Class of Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000289212500002"}
