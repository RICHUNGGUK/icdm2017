In this study, the previously used pulse width (200 mu s) was used in pattern recognition testing on the forearm and was compared with the short pulse width (80 mu s) used for stimulation. A cathodic pulse with a frequency of 100pps, which was suggested to be suitable in our previous study, was used. Experimental results on neurologically intact subjects suggested that the previously used pulse width was suitable and that a short pulse width would not be effective for stabilizing the stimulation amplitude or for improving the pattern recognition ability of our method.", "paper_title": "A Basic Study on Stimulation Pulse Width Determination for Dynamic Presentation of Electrocutaneous Sensation Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000267639600015"}
