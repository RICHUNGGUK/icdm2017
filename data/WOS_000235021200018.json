A similarity index was introduced as a robust measure of similarity between two maps or between two selections of spots within the maps. A searching algorithm was used to identify the spots that may play an important role in toxicity mechanism. The highest correlation coefficients obtained between the similarity index and biological parameter were larger than 0.9.", "paper_title": "Proteomic maps-toxicity relationship of halocarbons studied with similarity index and genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000235021200018"}
