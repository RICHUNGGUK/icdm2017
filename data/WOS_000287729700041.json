By resorting to this model, the manager of the SC can design planning strategies to satisfy customer orders, under strict deadlines and human resource constraints. After describing the model, we introduce criteria which optimize the processing time and supply a more accurate description of working behavior. Finally, we conclude presenting some numerical simulations which demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model to reach correct decisions in managing a SC. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
