Multilevel visualisation is actually a desirable feature for facilitating the monitoring of computationally expensive runs involving several hundreds of computers during hours or even days. In this paper we present two components of a future multilevel monitoring system: MusEAc, a high level, audio monitoring allowing to listen to a run and tune it in real time and GridVis, a lower lever, more precise a posteriori visualisation tool that lets the user understand why the algorithm has performed well or bad.", "paper_title": "Visual and Audio Monitoring of Island Based Parallel Evolutionary Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000366156100002"}
