A novel decision forest learning algorithm named FDF is proposed in this paper to represent multi-level semantic knowledge of the relationship between the data and information implicated. FDF provides their users with just a single set of rules by redefining information gain of information theory, then each tree in the decision forest is constructed in the down-top learning framework, and the number of trees and stopping criteria can be set automatically. When no existing tree match test samples, FDF will build new logical rules for this and thus realize scalable construction process. Empirical studies on a set of natural domains show that decision forest has clear advantages with respect to probabilistic performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
