About 429 employees from 19 software production companies that use the model took part in the study. Multivariate analysis methods, such as factorial analysis, were used to identify the interdependence between multiple variables. This led us to six factors: software project development, quality and productivity, professional career, team/working environment, problem identification and analysis and modeling. Three different analysis dimensions (country, company's maturity level and company size) were investigated to assess the impact of the CMMI model on the six factors, which were defined for each of these dimensions.", "paper_title": "A comparative analysis of CMMI software project management by Brazilian, Indian and Chinese companies", "paper_id": "WOS:000276746300001"}
