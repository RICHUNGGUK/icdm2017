This is due to (1) the lack of convexity and (2) the lack of smoothness (and even continuity). The classic approach consists in minimizing instead a convex surrogate. In this paper, we propose to replace the usually considered deterministic decision rule by a stochastic one, which allows obtaining a smooth risk (generalizing the expected binary loss, and more generally the cost-sensitive loss). Practically, this (empirical) risk is minimized by performing a gradient descent in the function space linearly spanned by a base learner (a.k.a. boosting). We provide a convergence analysis of the resulting algorithm and experiment it on a bunch of synthetic and real-world data sets (with noiseless and noisy domains, compared to convex and non-convex boosters).", "paper_title": "Soft-max boosting", "paper_id": "WOS:000359747100007"}
