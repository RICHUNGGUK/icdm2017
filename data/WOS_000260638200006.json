A related question is whether, given a class of lambda models. there are a minimal lambda-theory and a minimal sensible lambda-theory represented by it. In this paper, we give a positive answer to this question for the class of graph models a la Plotkin, Scott and Engeler. In particular, we build two graph models whose theories are the set Of equations satisfied in, respectively, any graph model and any sensible graph model. We conjecture that the least sensible graph theory, where 'graph theory' means 'lambda-theory of a graph model', is equal to H, while in one of the main results of the paper we show the non-existence of a graph model whose equational theory is exactly the lambda beta theory. Another related question is whether, given a class of lambda models, there is a maximal sensible lambda-theory represented by it. In the main result of the paper, we characterise the greatest sensible graph theory as the lambda-theory B generated by equating lambda-terms with the same Bohm tree. This result is a consequence of the main technical theorem of the paper, which says that all the equations between solvable lambda-terms that have different Bohm trees fail in every sensible graph model. A further result of the paper is the existence of a continuum of different sensible graph theories strictly included in B.", "paper_title": "Graph lambda theories", "paper_id": "WOS:000260638200006"}
