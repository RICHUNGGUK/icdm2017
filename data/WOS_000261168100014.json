MRPS is a procedure for multiparty collaboration with each other to remote preparation of a known quantum state to a distant party. We show that it is possible to achieve unity fidelity remote preparation of the polarization state using optical elements. This protocol may be used for converging the split information at one point.", "paper_title": "MULTIPARTY REMOTE STATE PREPARATION WITH LINEAR OPTICAL ELEMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261168100014"}
