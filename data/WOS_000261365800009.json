The main issues such as: two temperature-dependent state surfaces of void ratio and degree of saturation which are used to present the coupling effects of temperature, moisture content and deformation of skeleton; the new thermoelastoplastic constitutive law, etc. are briefly mentioned. The Bubnov-Galerkin integral form of field equations has been developed as the basis of spatial and temporal discretized matrix form. The single-step integration in time is described. The numerical solution algorithm of the finite element package, theta-STOCK, is presented. Some application cases are presented and discussed to show the strong ability of presented model and the prepared numerical package. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
