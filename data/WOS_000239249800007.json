Although piconet construction is a well-defined process specified in Bluetooth standards, scatternet formation policies and algorithms are not well specified. Among many solution proposals for this problem, only a few of them focus on efficient usage of bandwidth in the resulting scatternets. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm for the scatternet formation problem that dynamically constructs and maintains a scatternet based on estimated traffic flow rates between nodes. The algorithm is adaptive to changes and maintains a constructed scatternet for bandwidth-efficiency when nodes come and go or when traffic flow rates change. Based on simulations, the paper also presents the improvements in bandwidth-efficiency and reduction in energy consumption provided by the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Distributed construction and maintenance of bandwidth and energy efficient bluetooth scatternets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239249800007"}
