We also borrowed some technical ideas from MicroPsi, one of the concrete implementations of PSI theory by Joscha Bach. The proposed emotional model is then applied to control a virtual robot living in a game world inspired by Minecraft. Simulation experiments have been performed and evaluated for three different scenarios. The emergent emotions fit quite well with these circumstances. The dynamics of this affective model are also analyzed using Lewis's dynamic theory of emotions. Evidences of phase transitions suggested by Lewis are observed in simulations, including trigger, self-amplification and self-stabilization phases. These experiment results show that the proposed model is a quite promising approach of modeling both emotion emergence and dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
