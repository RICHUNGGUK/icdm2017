In this problem, the compactness of the subdistricts, the dissimilarity measure of districts and an equity measure of salesmen profit are considered as part of the objective function, and the salesman travel cost on each subdistrict is approximated by the Beardwood-Halton-Hammersley formula. An adaptive large neighbourhood search rnetaheuristic is developed for the problem. It was tested on modified Solomon and Gehring & Homberger instances. Computational results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
