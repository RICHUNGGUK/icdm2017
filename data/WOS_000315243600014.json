The proposed technique is based on Bayes' theorem, in which the device-parameters of a chip, such as the threshold voltage of transistors, are estimated by current signatures obtained in a regular IDDQ testing framework. Neither additional circuit implementation nor additional measurement is required for the purpose of parameter estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can achieve 10-mV accuracy in threshold voltage estimations.", "paper_title": "Device-Parameter Estimation through IDDQ Signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000315243600014"}
