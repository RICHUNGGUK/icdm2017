An efficient technique to address the increased PAPR problem is the partial transmit sequences (PTS) approach. A significant drawback of PTS is the fact that it multiplies the transmitted symbol with weighting factors selected by the transmitter. Since the weighting factors are required for decoding, they are explicitly transmitted, in most cases. This paper proposes a new low-complexity technique for retrieving the weighting factors in the receiver. The proposed decoder uses the predefined values of pilot tones and explores all the permissible combinations of weighting factors in order to identify the factor combination employed by the transmitter. The proposed decoder requires no additional pilot tones or explicit transmission of side information, therefore no data rate loss is implied. Furthermore this paper presents a digital very large scale integration implementation of the proposed PTS decoder and demonstrates its low-power properties.", "paper_title": "A Low-Complexity PTS-based PAPR Reduction Technique for OFDM Signals without Transmission of Side Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000267367200003"}
