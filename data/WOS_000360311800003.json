In this paper, a case study of the ShuangXing Yuan deep excavation engineering located in Yingkou, China, is examined to investigate the deformation characteristics of buildings located in concave or convex positions of the excavation. It was found that the affected areas of soil settlement near the concave and convex location were much different from the middle of the excavation. Due to the corner effect, the adjacent building was not only suffered from settlement but also torsional deformation. The settlement pattern in the corner location of excavation is a three-dimensional surface and cracks in buildings induced by significant differential settlement and torsional deformation can appear when buildings are located in the main affected-areas of the corner effect of excavation. In addition, the embedded depth of foundation has a great impact on building settlement at the corner of excavation and it must be considered in the process of excavation design.", "paper_title": "Researches on the Influence on Neighboring Buildings by Concave and Convex Location Effect of Excavations in Soft Soil Area", "paper_id": "WOS:000360311800003"}
