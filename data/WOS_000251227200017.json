In order to efficiently store data in the system, this paper introduces an optimal share transfer problem, and proves it to be, generally, NP-hard. It is also shown that the problem can be resolved into a Steiner tree problem. Finally, through computational experiments we perform the comparison of heuristic algorithms for the Steiner tree problem.", "paper_title": "An optimal share transfer problem on secret sharing storage systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251227200017"}
