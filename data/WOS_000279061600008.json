One of the simplest broadcasting algorithms under Byzantine failures is referred to as a certified propagation algorithm (CPA), which is the only algorithm we know that does not use any global knowledge of the network topology. Hence, it is worth focusing on a graph-theoretic parameter such that CPA will work correctly. Using the theory of maximum adjacency (MA) ordering, a new graph-theoretic parameter for CPA is proposed. Within a factor of two, this parameter approximates the largest t such that CPA works for t-locally bounded Byzantine faults. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
