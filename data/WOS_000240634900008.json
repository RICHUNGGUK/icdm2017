The particular nature of secure system design has considerable impact on the simulation requirements and design flow. We present two key contributions. We will first show that rigorous design of secure digital systems requires a multilevel validation approach, meaning validation at multiple steps in the design flow. Indeed, an attacker chooses the easiest entry point and does not stick with one abstraction level. Second, we show the use of a cosimulation and codesign environment called GEZEL that can support this type of multilevel validation. We will illustrate this multilevel design validation strategy with the verification of security of the ThumbPod-2 device.", "paper_title": "Multilevel design validation in a secure embedded system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240634900008"}
