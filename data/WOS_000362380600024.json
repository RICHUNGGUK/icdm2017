This work is focused on introducing methods for ordering finitely generated sets as a generalization of those methods previously defined for ordering intervals. In addition, these orders between finitely generated sets are also improved to present orders between finite interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets. Finally, finite interval-valued hesitant fuzzy preference relations are introduced and used to define a new order between finite interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
