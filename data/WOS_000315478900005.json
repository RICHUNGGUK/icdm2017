In this study, 23 novel AHAS inhibitors were identified through molecular docking followed by similarity search. The determined IC50 values range from 0.385 +/- 0.026 mu M to >200 mu M against bacterium AHAS. Five of the identified compounds show significant in vitro activity against H37Rv strains (MICs in the range of 2.5-80 mg/L) and clinical MTB strains, including MDR and XDR isolates. More impressively, compounds 5 and 7 can enhance the killing ability against macrophages infected pathogen remarkably. This study suggests our discovered inhibitors can be further developed as novel anti-MTB therapeutics targeting AHAS.", "paper_title": "Discovery of Novel Acetohydroxyacid Synthase Inhibitors as Active Agents against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Virtual Screening and Bioassay", "paper_id": "WOS:000315478900005"}
