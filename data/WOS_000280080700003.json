The control of such distributed systems is very challenging and usual approaches for contact arrayed system don't produce satisfactory results. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning control approaches in order to position and convey an object. Reinforcement learning is a popular approach to find controllers that are tailored exactly to the system without any prior model. We show how to apply reinforcement learning in a decentralized perspective and in order to address the global-local trade-off. The simulation results demonstrate that the reinforcement learning method is a promising way to design control laws for such distributed systems.", "paper_title": "Designing Decentralized Controllers for Distributed-Air-Jet MEMS-Based Micromanipulators by Reinforcement Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000280080700003"}
