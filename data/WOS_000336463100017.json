The extra edge-connectivity is an important parameters for the reliability evaluation of interconnection networks. In this paper, we explore g-extra-edge-connectivity (lambda(g)(FQ(n))) of the folded hypercube FQ(n) for g <= n (denote g by Sigma(s)(i)=(0)2(ti), where t(0) = [log(2)g] and t(i) = [log(2) (g - Sigma(i-1)(r=0) 2(tr))]). We show that lambda(g)(FQ(n)) = g(n +1) - (Sigma(s)(i=0)t(i)2(ti) + Sigma(s)(i=0)2 .i .2(ti)) for n >= 6. This result generalizes the previous results by Zhu et al. (2007) for lambda(3)(FQ(n)), and by Hsieh and Tsai (in press) for lambda(4)(FQ(n)), and so on. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
