By introducing between-class scatter constraint and label information into two-dimensional locality preserving projections (2D-LPP) algorithm, 2D-DLPP successfully finds the subspace which can best discriminate different pattern classes. So the subspace obtained by 2D-DLPP has more discriminant power than 2D-LPP, and is more suitable for recognition tasks. The proposed method was applied to facial expression recognition tasks on JAFFE and Colin-Kanade database and compared with other three widely used two-dimensional methods: 2D-PCA, 2D-LDA and 2D-LPP. The high recognition rates show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
