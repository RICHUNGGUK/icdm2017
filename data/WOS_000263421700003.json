A tank-pair model is a system that consists of two tanks and a single input single output controller. which regulates the inflows of the two tanks to acquire the two uniform levels under the specified inflow constraints. According to a quantized observation of the N tank levels, some discrete events are generated, and based on certain event feedback strategy, switching the location of the tank-pair can control all the N tanks in a time-sharing manner to acquire the N levels uniformity. Different from some existing scheduling strategies, this Study proposes a fuzzy scheduling strategy (FSS) for Such generalized switched server systems. Special measures are taken to reduce the N-inputs two-outputs fuzzy inference to a two-inputs one-output one, which greatly facilitates fuzzy scheduler design. Simulation results show that the proposed FSS strategy Outperforms over the three existing scheduling strategies as a whole, and they also show that the proposed FSS strategy demonstrates high robustness over system heterogeneity.
