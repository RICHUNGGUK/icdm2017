We analyze the numerical behavior of these limiters applied to a pair of model problems, comparing the error of the approximate solutions, and discuss each limiter's advantages and disadvantages. We then introduce a series of coupled p-enrichment schemes that may be used as standalone dynamic p-enrichment strategies, or may be augmented via any in the family of variable-in-p slope limiters presented.
