In the next time period, user can automatically get another K-times authentication permission. If a user tries to show credential beyond K times in one time period, anyone can identify the dishonest user (the violator). But identifying violators is not enough for some systems, where it is also desirable to revoke violators' credentials for preventing them from abusing the anonymous property again. However, the problem of revoking credential without trusted third party has not been solved efficiently and practically. To solve it, we present an efficient scheme with efficient revocation of violator's credential. In fact, our method also solves an interesting problem-leaking information in a statistic zero-knowledge way, so our solution to the revocation problem outperforms all prior solutions. For achieving it, we use the special zero-knowledge proof with special information leak for revoking the violator's credential, but it can still be proven to be perfect statistic zero knowledge for guaranteeing the honest user's anonymity. Comparing with existing schemes, our scheme is efficient, and moreover, our method of revoking violator's credential is more practical with the least additional costs.", "paper_title": "Periodic K-Times Anonymous Authentication With Efficient Revocation of Violator's Credential", "paper_id": "WOS:000349620800005"}
