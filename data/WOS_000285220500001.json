MCRC software is developed for chemometric analysis of chromatographic data; however, it may also be used for other types of multivariate data. It consists of five groups of techniques for preprocessing, chemical rank determination, local rank analysis, multivariate resolution and peak integration. This software has the ability of the analysis of complex multi-component chromatographic signals of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The software allows a user to apply the implemented methods in an easy way and it gives a straightforward possibility to visualize the obtained results. The main features of the presented software are providing a number of preprocessing techniques, implementation of different chemical rank determination methods, usage of iterative and non-iterative resolution techniques and a user-friendly environment with a variety of graphical outputs. The implementation of the MCRC software is demonstrated by the analysis of an overlapped peak cluster of simulated GC-MS data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
