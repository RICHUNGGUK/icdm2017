It is assumed that in certain areas covered by multiple overlapping wireless networks there are a certain number of mobile clients that consume networks resources by use of the available communication services (e. g., voice or data transmission) delivered by network providers. Moreover, it is assumed that the continuity of communication services may be assured by the use of common handover techniques supporting client mobility (e. g., Mobile IPv6, IEEE 802.21, etc.). The task of mobility and resource management consists of making decisions concerning the moment and the network to which particular clients should be handed over in order to optimize certain quality criterion (e. g., utilization of network resources). In this article we show that gathering knowledge about client movements and prediction of their future positions may significantly improve the overall quality of the services delivered and network resource utilization.", "paper_title": "User Assignment and Movement Prediction in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304453800007"}
