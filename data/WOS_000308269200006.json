In this micromechanical model, a simple classical constitutive model is employed for the solid phase, such that the distinct mechanical properties of porous geomaterials can be subsequently and satisfactorily predicted without the use of additional parameters. Furthermore, the FFT-based model automatically satisfies the periodic boundary condition of the micromechanics scheme. The efficacy of the model is shown by applications to Lixhe chalk and Vosges sandstone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
