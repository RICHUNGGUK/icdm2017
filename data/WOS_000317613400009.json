Resilience is the ability of a system or enterprise to minimize the effects of a disruption. Although resilient manufacturing enterprises have been investigated in many different areas, there has been little analytical investigation into real-time control policies for resiliency. Our goal is to study the real-time resilient control for manufacturing systems through mathematical analysis. To achieve this, we start with developing a model for a general manufacturing network. Then, the optimal control problem is developed for a simple type of serial network called a Decreasing Storage Cost and Decreasing Capacity (DSCDC) network given disruptions with advance warning. It is then shown that the results of the DSCDC network can be generalized to more general serial networks.", "paper_title": "Resilient Control for Serial Manufacturing Networks With Advance Notice of Disruptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000317613400009"}
