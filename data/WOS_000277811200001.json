A simple algorithm to generate it is based on flips of diagonal edges in convex quads. We characterize the effect of a single edge flip in a triangulation on the geometric Laplacian of the triangulation, which leads to a simpler and shorter proof of a theorem of Rippa that the Dirichlet energy of any piecewise-linear scalar function on a triangulation obtains its minimum on the Delaunay triangulation. Using Rippa's theorem, we provide a spectral characterization of the Delaunay triangulation, namely that the spectrum of the geometric Laplacian is minimized on this triangulation. This spectral theorem then leads to a simpler proof of a theorem of Musin that the harmonic index also obtains its minimum on the Delaunay triangulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.
