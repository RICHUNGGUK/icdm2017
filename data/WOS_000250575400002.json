We also obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for an L-fuzzifying neighborhood structure, in a vector space X, to be an L-fuzzifying neighborhood structure of zero for a fuzzifying vector topology. Finally, we prove that the category of fuzzifying topological vector spaces on completely distributive lattices is topological over the category of vector spaces.", "paper_title": "Fuzzifying topological vector spaces on completely distributive lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000250575400002"}
