As briefly exposing tactile receptors to subsensory vibration is known to enhance tactile sensitivity thanks to a phenomenon called stochastic resonance in the somatosensory system, applying white-noise vibration to a fingertip is expected to improve the sense of touch and associated motor skills. Against such a background, a prototype of a wearable device called a sensorimotor enhancer is proposed here. The device is attached to the radial side of the fingertip and stimulates tactile receptors by applying vibration from a lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric stack actuator. This design keeps the palmar region free, thereby helping to maintain the wearer's manipulative ability. Sensory and motor tests involving 11 human subjects were conducted to determine the efficacy of the device, and the results confirmed its usefulness.", "paper_title": "Wearable Sensorimotor Enhancer for Fingertip Based on Stochastic Resonance Effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000317645600007"}
