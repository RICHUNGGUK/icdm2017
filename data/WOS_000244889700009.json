It has also been employed by Applegate, Bixby, Chvatal, and Cook for solving the latter to optimality by the branch-and-cut method. There is a close natural connection between the two polyhedra. Until now, it was not known whether there are facets in TT-form of the GTSP polyhedron which are not facets of the STSP polytope as well. In this paper we give an affirmative answer to this question for n >= 9. We provide a general method for proving the existence of such facets, at the core of which lies the construction of a continuous curve on a polyhedron. This curve starts in a vertex, walks along edges, and ends in a vertex not adjacent to the starting vertex. Thus there must have been a third vertex on the way.", "paper_title": "On the graphical relaxation of the symmetric traveling salesman polytope", "paper_id": "WOS:000244889700009"}
