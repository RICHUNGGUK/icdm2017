In recent years, it has become more and more common to classify all patent documents using the International Patent Classification (IPC), a complex hierarchical classification system comprised of eight sections, 128 classes, 648 subclasses, about 7200 main groups, and approximately 72,000 subgroups. So far, however, no patent categorization method has been developed that can classify patents down to the subgroup level (the bottom level of the IPC). Therefore, this paper presents a novel categorization method, the three phase categorization (TPC) algorithm, which classifies patents down to the subgroup level with reasonable accuracy. The experimental results for the TPC algorithm, using the WIPO-alpha collection, indicate that our classification method can achieve 36.07% accuracy at the subgroup level. This is approximately a 25,764-fold improvement over a random guess. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
