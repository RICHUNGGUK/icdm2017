Currently, the information obtained from the maize tassel mainly depends on human labor, which is subjective and labor-intensive. Recent researches have introduced several image-based approaches to overcome the shortage with a modest degree of success. However, due to the variation of cultivar, pose and illumination, and the clustered background, characterizing the maize tassel trait with computer vision remains a challenging problem. To this end, an automatic fine-grained machine vision system termed mTASSEL is developed in this paper. We proposed to characterize the maize tassel with multi-view representations that combine multiple feature views and different channel views, which can alleviate the influence of environmental variations. In addition to the total tassel number trait, some fine-grained tassel traits, including the tassel color, branch number, length, width, perimeter and diameter, are further characterized to execute the time-series monitoring. To boost the related research, a relatively large-scale maize tassel dataset (10 sequences with 16,031 samples) is first constructed by our team. The experimental results demonstrate that both system modules significantly outperform other state-of-the-art approaches by large margins (26.0% for the detection and 7.8% for the segmentation). Results of this research can serve the automatic growth stage detection, accurate yield estimation and machine detasseling, as well as the field-based phenotyping research. The dataset and source code of the system are available online. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
