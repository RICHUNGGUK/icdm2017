Mobile service operators can recommend new content and information to users who opt in to receive such information directly through push messages at any time or place. However, as mobile push messages sent to users can cause interruptions, such as alarms, users who receive irrelevant push messages may become dissatisfied with their mobile Web service and even their service provider. In this paper, we propose a mobile content recommender system for sending personalized mobile push messages with content that users are likely to find relevant. This system learns users' preferences from contents and keywords in their usage logs and recommends items that match these preferences or those of similar users. We analyzed (a) customer feedback on personalized content dissemination, and (b) the relationship between customer feedback and mobile Web usage of customers subscribing to a Korean mobile service provider. Push messages with personalized recommendations resulted in more positive feedback from customers, and the mobile Web usage of these customers increased.", "paper_title": "Mobile push personalization and user experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000261613000007"}
