A more general view of k-anonymity is clustering with a constraint of the minimum number of objects in every cluster. Most existing approaches to achieving k-anonymity by clustering are for numerical (or ordinal) attributes. In this paper, we study achieving k-anonymity by clustering in attribute hierarchical structures. We define generalisation distances between tuples to characterise distortions by generalisations and discuss the properties of the distances. We conclude that the generalisation distance is a metric distance. We propose an efficient clustering-based algorithm for k-anonymisation. We experimentally show that the proposed method is more scalable and causes significantly less distortions than an optimal global recoding k-anonymity method.", "paper_title": "Achieving k-anonymity by clustering in attribute hierarchical structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241158200039"}
