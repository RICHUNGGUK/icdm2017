In an MMDA, the within-class graph and between-class graph are, respectively, designed to characterize the within-class compactness and the between-class separability, seeking for the discriminant matrix to simultaneously maximize the between-class scatter and minimize the within-class scatter. In addition, in an MMDA, the within-class graph can represent the sub-manifold information, while the between-class graph can represent the multi-manifold information. The proposed MMDA is extensively examined by using the FERET, AR and ORL face databases, and the PolyU finger-knuckle-print databases. The experimental results demonstrate that an MMDA is effective in feature extraction, leading to promising image recognition performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
