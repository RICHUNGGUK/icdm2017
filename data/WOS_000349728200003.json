To estimate the output of positive T-S fuzzy systems, error-bounding positive filters are constructed. A new performance characterization is first established to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the filtering error system with the el-induced performance. Moreover, sufficient conditions expressed by linear programming problems are derived to design the required filters. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
