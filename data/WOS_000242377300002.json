We propose an evaluation method based on Kendall's tau, a metric of rank correlation. The method is inexpensive, robust, and representation independent. We show that Kendall's tau correlates reliably with human ratings and reading times.", "paper_title": "Automatic evaluation of information ordering: Kendall's Tau", "paper_id": "WOS:000242377300002"}
