We define two simplification operators on Morse complexes, which work in arbitrary dimensions, and we define their inverse refinement operators. We describe how simplification and refinement operators affect Morse complexes on M, and we show that these operators form a complete set of atomic operators to create and update Morse complexes on M. Thus, any operator that modifies Morse complexes on M can be expressed as a suitable sequence of the atomic simplification and refinement operators we have defined. The simplification and refinement operators also provide a suitable basis for the construction of a multi-resolution representation of Morse complexes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
