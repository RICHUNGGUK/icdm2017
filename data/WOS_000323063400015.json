The idea of the presented method is constructed based on the extending 0-cut and 1-cut solution of original fully fuzzy linear systems (FFLS). We also define a fuzzy solution of FFLS and establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of a fuzzy solution.", "paper_title": "A new method for solving an arbitrary fully fuzzy linear system", "paper_id": "WOS:000323063400015"}
