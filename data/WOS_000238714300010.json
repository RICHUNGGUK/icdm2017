Differential cascode voltage switch logic (DCVSL) has circuit topologies susceptible to the leakage currents. In this paper, we propose a new circuit style to effectively handle the leakage problems in PD/SOI DCVSL. The proposed low-swing DCVSL (LS-DCVSL) uses the small internal swing to prevent the body of evaluation transistors from being charged to high voltage and, hence, suppress the leakages in DCVSL. Simulation results show that the proposed LS-DCVSL five-input XOR circuit is 33% faster than DCVSL five-input XOR circuit. In addition, the proposed circuit does not experience noise margin reduction due to pass-gate leakage.", "paper_title": "A leakage-tolerant low-swing circuit style in partially depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000238714300010"}
