KSC is a high-order statistical method and can efficiently extract image feature coefficients. Contourlet method has the decomposition property of orientation and the energy variation for images. Further, using the shrinkage threshold that is determined by the sparse prior distribution of feature coefficients extracted in the contourlet transform field, the unknown noise contained in MMW image can be reduced efficiently. In test, an artificial MMW image and a true MMW are respectively used to validate our method, further, compared this method with other denoising methods, the simulation results show this method proposed here can obtain the better quality of image restoration.
