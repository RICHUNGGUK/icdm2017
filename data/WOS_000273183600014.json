For the higher order Hirota equation resonance between the solitary waves and linear radiation causes radiation loss. Soliton perturbation theory is used to determine the details of the evolving wave and its tail. An analytical expression for the solitary wave tail is derived and compared to numerical solutions. An excellent comparison between numerical and theoretical solutions is obtained for both right- and left-moving waves. Also, a two-parameter family of higher order asymptotic embedded solitons is identified. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
