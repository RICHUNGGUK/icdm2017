These technologies make possible achieving more efficient information management, improving agent-user communication processes, and facilitating accurate access to relevant resources. Other tools used are fuzzy linguistic modelling techniques (which make possible easing the interaction between users and system) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for semiautomatic thesaurus generation. Also, RSS feeds are used as \"current awareness bulletins\" to generate personalized bibliographic alerts.", "paper_title": "A Semantic Model of Selective Dissemination of Information for Digital Libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000263495300005"}
