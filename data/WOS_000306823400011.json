Suction is not involved explicitly in the constitutive model for unsaturated soils. The loading-collapse yield surface is derived based on the proposed volume change equation in the plane of the effective degree of saturation and the Bishop effective stress. The proposed volume change equation and the corresponding yield surface are generalised to three-dimensional stress states by incorporating with the Modified Cam-clay model, following the same procedure introduced in the Sheng-Fredlund-Gens (SFG) model. The basic properties and performance of the proposed constitutive model are then illustrated through numerical examples with various drying/wetting/loading paths. Finally, the proposed model is validated against a variety of experimental data including drained and undrained tests, isotropic and triaxial tests and reconstituted and compacted soils.
