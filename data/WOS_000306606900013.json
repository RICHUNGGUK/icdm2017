We combine the HLSVC interface advection algorithm with a two phase flow solver in order to numerically capture deforming bubbles and drops whose actual volume (s) fluctuate about fixed \"target\" volume (s). Three novel developments are described: (1) a new method for enforcing a volume constraint in which the number of bubbles and drops can change due to merging or splitting, (2) a new, second order, semi-lagrangian narrow band level set reinitialization algorithm, and (3) validation of a two-phase flow numerical method by comparison with linear stability analysis results for a co-flowing liquid jet in gas. The new interface capturing method is tested on benchmark problems in which the velocity is prescribed (passive advection of interfaces) and in which the velocity is determined by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flow. The error in interface position when using the hybrid level set-volume constraint method is reported for many benchmark problems in polar coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, and on an adaptive grid in which one criteria of adaptivity is the magnitude of the interface curvature.
