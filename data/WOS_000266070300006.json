The interface will let the student obtain 3D results with stereo cameras in an easy way and without previous theory knowledge. The didactic and ease to obtain results in the first learning stage is demonstrated to be a good training for students motivation in order to learn the theoretical bases. The package developed (stereo interface) is formed by a vision system or a library of stereo pair images, and an application based on Windows (TM) and MATLAB (R) with its image processing and GUIDE toolboxes. MATLAB (R) allows interactive visual communication among students and perception system to understand, by means of the experimentation, the most important features related to the stereo theory, (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals.
