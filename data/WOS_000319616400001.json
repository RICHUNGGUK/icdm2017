By realizing it, an attempt has been made to model the ETC of 2-phase PRPCs based on a genetic fuzzy approach. The model performance is rigorously tested in three stages to establish its practical applicability: based on experimental data (not used in model development) cited in literature, new measured thermal conductivities of flexible mould composites and finally by assessing the feasibility of values of missing data in the reported in-complete data set based on the developed model. Estimations of ETC by the proposed model are shown reasonable, even better compare to existing models and suggesting a generic model applicable to a wide range of 2-phase PRPCs.", "paper_title": "A genetic fuzzy based modeling of effective thermal conductivity for polymer composites", "paper_id": "WOS:000319616400001"}
