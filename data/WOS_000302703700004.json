In this paper, we propose totally corrective asymmetric boosting algorithms for real-time object detection. Our algorithms differ from Viola and Jones' detection framework in two ways. Firstly, our boosting algorithms explicitly optimize asymmetric loss of objectives, while AdaBoost used by Viola and Jones optimizes a symmetric loss. Secondly, by carefully deriving the Lagrange duals of the optimization problems, we design more efficient boosting in that the coefficients of the selected weak classifiers are updated in a totally corrective fashion, in contrast to the stagewise optimization commonly used by most boosting algorithms. Column generation is employed to solve the proposed optimization problems. Unlike conventional boosting, the proposed boosting algorithms are able to de-select those irrelevant weak classifiers in the ensemble while training a classification cascade. This results in improved detection performance as well as fewer weak classifiers in the learned strong classifier. Compared with AsymBoost of Viola and Jones, our proposed asymmetric boosting is nonheuristic and the training procedure is much simpler. Experiments on face and pedestrian detection demonstrate that our methods have superior detection performance than some of the state-of-the-art object detectors.", "paper_title": "Fast and Robust Object Detection Using Asymmetric Totally Corrective Boosting", "paper_id": "WOS:000302703700004"}
