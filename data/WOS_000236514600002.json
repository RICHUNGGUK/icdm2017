We propose a data structure that classifies the segmented voxels into categories, so that whenever the model has to be traversed, only the selected categories are visited and the empty and non-selected voxels are skipped. This strategy is based on: (i) a decision tree, called the rendering decision tree (RDT), which represents the hierarchy of the classification process and (ii) an intermediate run-length encoding (RLE) of the classified voxel model. The traversal of the voxel model given a user query consists of two steps: first, the RDT is traversed and the set of selected categories computed; next, the RLE is visited, but the non-selected runs are skipped and only the voxels of the original model that are codified are accessed in selected runs of the RLE. This strategy has been used to render a voxel model by back-to-front traversal and splatting as well as to construct 3D textures for hardware-driven 3D texture mapping. The results show that the voxel model traversal is significantly accelerated.", "paper_title": "Decision trees for accelerating unimodal, hybrid and multimodal rendering models", "paper_id": "WOS:000236514600002"}
