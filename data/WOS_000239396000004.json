Our quantum carry-lookahead (QCLA) adder accepts two n-bit numbers and adds them in O (log n) depth using O(n) ancillary qubits. We present both in-place and out-of-place versions, as well as versions that add modulo 2(n) and modulo 2(n) - 1. Previously, the linear-depth ripple-carry addition circuit has been the method of choice. Our work reduces the cost of addition dramatically with only a slight increase in the number of required qubits. The QCLA adder can be used within current modular multiplication circuits to reduce substantially the run-time of Shor's algorithm.", "paper_title": "A logarithmic-depth quantum carry-lookahead adder", "paper_id": "WOS:000239396000004"}
