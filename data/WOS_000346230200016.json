In this paper, we propose a location management scheme based on Domain Name System (DNS) for PMIPv6. In this proposed scheme, DNS as a location manager provides PMIPv6 for global mobility. In addition, a paging extension scheme is introduced to PMIPv6 in order to support large numbers of mobile terminals and enhance network scalability. To evaluate the proposed location management scheme, we establish an analytical model, also formulate the location update and the paging cost, and analyse the influence of the different factors on the total signalling cost. The performance results show how the total signal cost changes under various parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
