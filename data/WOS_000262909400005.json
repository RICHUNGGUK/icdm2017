This call be achieved by Putting redundant sensor nodes to sleep. In this paper, we propose a precise and energy-aware coverage control protocol, named Area-based Collaborative Sleeping (ACOS). The ACOS protocol, based on the net sensing area of a sensor, controls the mode of sensors to maximize the coverage, minimize the energy Consumption, and to extend the lifetime of the sensor network. The simulation shows that our protocol has better coverage of file surveillance area while waking fewer sensors, than other state-of-the-art sleeping protocols. It extends the lifetime of sensor networks significantly.", "paper_title": "ACOS: An Area-based Collaborative Sleeping Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262909400005"}
