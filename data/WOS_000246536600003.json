In this paper we devise a dynamic version of Tree Adjoining Grammar (DVTAG) that encodes a strong notion of incrementality directly into the operations of the formal system. After discussing the basic features of DVTAG, we address the issue of building of a wide coverage grammar and present novel data for English and Italian.", "paper_title": "Building a wide coverage dynamic grammar", "paper_id": "WOS:000246536600003"}
