The aim is to find a quantitative tool to interpret the linkographs. This study examines if the differences in the design processes and the design outcomes can be reflected in the entropic interpretations. The results show that the overall entropy of one design condition is slightly higher than the other. Further, there are indications that the change of entropy might reflect design outcomes.", "paper_title": "Comparing entropy measures of idea links in design protocols: Linkography entropy measurement and analysis of differently conditioned design sessions", "paper_id": "WOS:000249790100004"}
