This study extends the technology acceptance model (TAM) by introducing e-service quality dimensions, trust and enjoyment in the development of a theoretical model to study customers' repurchase intentions within the context of online shopping. Design/methodology/approach - Data collected from 360 PCHome online shopping customers provides strong support for the proposed research model. PLS (partial least squares, PLS-Graph version 3.0) is used to analyse the measurement and structural models. Findings - The study shows that trust, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and enjoyment are significant positive predictors of customers' repurchase intentions. Research limitations/implications - The data are collected from a single online shopping store the generalisation of the model and findings to other online stores requires additional research. Our findings imply that the five dimensions of e-service quality are possibly among the most important antecedents of customers' trust in online vendors. Practical implications - Online vendors should ensure that they provide adequate utilitarian and hedonic value for customers instead of focusing on just one of these aspects in their web site development. Originality/value - Customer loyalty is critical to the online vendor's survival and success. The study provides evidence that online trust is built through order fulfilment, privacy, responsiveness and contact.", "paper_title": "Determinants of customer repurchase intention in online shopping", "paper_id": "WOS:000270768100007"}
