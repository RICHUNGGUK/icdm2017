We also create the relationships among these measures between type-2 fuzzy sets. Several examples are used to present the calculation of these similarity, inclusion measure and entropy between type-2 fuzzy sets. The comparison results show that the proposed similarity measure presents better than those of Hung and Yang (2004) and Yang and Lin (2009). Moreover, measuring the similarity between type-2 fuzzy sets is important in clustering. We also use the proposed similarity measure as a clustering method for type-2 fuzzy sets.", "paper_title": "ON SIMILARITY, INCLUSION MEASURE AND ENTROPY BETWEEN TYPE-2 FUZZY SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000304094900007"}
