This approach was later extended to a support vector regression (SVR) model called epsilon-SVR. However, the method requires that the error parameter c be set a priori. This is only possible if the desired accuracy of the approximation can be specified in advance. In this paper, we analyze the solution space for epsilon-SVR and propose a new solution path algorithm, called E-path algorithm, which traces the solution path with respect to the hyperparameter E rather than A. Although both two solution path algorithms possess the desirable piecewise linearity property, our c-path algorithm overcomes some limitations of the original lambda-path algorithm and has more advantages. It is thus more appealing for practical use.", "paper_title": "A New Solution Path Algorithm in Support Vector Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000260119900008"}
