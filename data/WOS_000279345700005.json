A systematic approach to the construction of subtree pattern matchers by deterministic pushdown automata, which read subject trees in prefix and postfix notation, is presented. The method is analogous to the construction of string pattern matchers: for a given pattern, a nondeterministic pushdown automaton is created and is then determinised. In addition, it is shown that the size of the resulting deterministic pushdown automata directly corresponds to the size of the existing string pattern matchers based on finite automata.", "paper_title": "Subtree Matching by Pushdown Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000279345700005"}
