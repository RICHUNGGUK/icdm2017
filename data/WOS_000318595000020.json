Distributed precoding through multiple relay nodes can be used to enhance the received signal power at the destination node and to mitigate the signal leakage to the eavesdropper, simultaneously. Due to individual power constraints at relay nodes, the distributed precoding scalar at each relay node is equivalent to a distributed precoding angle. An iterative algorithm is proposed to find the suboptimum distributed precoding angles at all the relay nodes, where the channel state information (CSI) sharing overhead among the relay nodes can also be substantially reduced. Each relay node receives the equivalent CSI from its preceding relay node, computes its distributed precoding angle, and updates the equivalent CSI for the next relay node. Compared with the simple decode-and-forward relaying protocol with random distributed precoding, the proposed iterative distributed precoding algorithm is able to further improve on the secrecy capacity of the multirelay wiretap system with an acceptable CSI sharing overhead.", "paper_title": "Secrecy Capacity Enhancement With Distributed Precoding in Multirelay Wiretap Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000318595000020"}
