These events and disasters have brought the tourists and relevant organizations enormous loss of life and property. The main reasons are the lack of holistic coordination among different departments and response for social responsibility. In the process of prevention and response of tourism emergency, the local governments need to take synergic action. Meanwhile, the positive participation in the tourism emergency rescue is one of the ways to share social responsibility. This paper aims to examine the early-warning management of regional tourism emergencies, in order to minimize the loss on both tourists' life and money, from the perspective of systematic thinking. Design/methodology/approach - The paper establishes a regional tourism emergency response model based on holistic assessment approach and Bayesian network technology. It analyzes most critical factors of regional tourism emergency and the mutual influence among them. Thereafter, it employs the Bayesian network technology to assess the influence of several factors on the final magnitude of casualties holistically. Based on this, the paper proposes the response principle and the response process to regional tourism emergency. Findings - This paper constructs the \"FRES\" principle about the holistic response to regional tourism emergency, including \"fulfillment of social responsibility\", \"rapid action\", \"experience accumulation\" and \"synergic response\". Based on this principle, the paper suggests a general process on the holistic response to regional tourism emergency. Finally, the paper takes the mudslides emergency in Taiwan on October 23, 2010 as an example to conduct an empirical analysis. The paper gives an optimal holistic solution to the responding process of this event in the light of the \"FRES\" principle. Originality/value - This paper explains the social responsibility related to the regional tourism emergencies and employs the Bayesian network technology to analyze the systematical responding process to tourism emergency. It proposes originally a \"FRES\" principle and a general process on the response to regional tourism emergency which are proven to be effective in systematical response to regional tourism events. The research results can facilitate the various local governments to jointly fulfill their social responsibilities and optimize the management of regional tourism emergencies in a holistic way.", "paper_title": "Early-warning management of regional tourism emergency: a holistic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000334146900012"}
