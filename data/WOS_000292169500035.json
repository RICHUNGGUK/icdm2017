The purpose of this paper is to develop a new method, the intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE method, for solving multi-criteria decision-making problems. Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy set (A-IFS) characteristics are simultaneously concerned with the degree of membership, degree of non-membership, and intuitionistic index, and people can use A-IFS to describe uncertain situations in decision-making problems. We use the proposed method to rank all alternatives and determine the best alternative. The proposed method can also use imperfect or insufficient knowledge of data to deal with decision-making problems. Finally, two practical examples are given that illustrate the procedure of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
