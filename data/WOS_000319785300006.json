The Enterprise Desktop Grid Computing (EDGC) paradigm addresses the potential for harvesting the idle computing resources of an organization's desktop PCs to support the execution of the company's large-scale applications. In these environments, the accuracy of response-time predictions is essential for effective metascheduling that maximizes resource usage without harming the performance of the parallel and local applications. However, this accuracy is a major challenge due to the heterogeneity and non-dedicated nature of EDGC resources. In this paper, two new prediction techniques are presented based on the state of resources. A thorough analysis by linear regression demonstrated that the proposed techniques capture the real behavior of the parallel applications better than other common techniques in the literature. Moreover, it is possible to reduce deviations with a proper modeling of prediction errors, and thus, a Self-adjustable Correction method (SAC) for detecting and correcting the prediction deviations was proposed with the ability to adapt to the changes in load conditions. An extensive evaluation in a real environment was conducted to validate the SAC method. The results show that the use of SAC increases the accuracy of response-time predictions by 35%. The cost of predictions with self-correction and its accuracy in a real environment was analyzed using a combination of the proposed techniques. The results demonstrate that the cost of prediction's is negligible and the combined use of the prediction techniques is preferable. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
