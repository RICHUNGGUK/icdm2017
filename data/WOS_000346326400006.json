In this paper we present the components of this architecture, responsible for resource discovery and mapping of virtual topologies over a federated multi-domain network virtualization environment. We subsequently introduce a method for the efficient mapping of user requests for virtual networks onto a substrate infrastructure, adopting a semantic-based approach to address the problem. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is evaluated via simulation and critically compared against common non-semantic-based solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
