However, this task is hampered by the fact that biomedical signals exhibit a complex behavior characterized by strong nonlinear and non-stationary properties that cannot always be perceived by simple visual examination. New processing methods need be considered. In this context, we propose a signal processing method, based on empirical mode decomposition and artificial neural networks, to analyze electroretinograms, i.e., the retinal response to a light flash, with the aim to detect and classify retinal diseases. The present application focuses on two retinal pathologies: achromatopsia, which is a cone disease, and congenital stationary night blindness, which affects the photoreceptoral signal transmission. The results indicate that, under suitable conditions, the method proposed here has the potential to provide a powerful tool for routine clinical examinations, since it is able to recognize with high level of confidence the eventual presence of one of the two pathologies.", "paper_title": "Empirical mode decomposition and neural network for the classification of electroretinographic data", "paper_id": "WOS:000338201900006"}
