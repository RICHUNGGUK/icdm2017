Specifically, we harness the competitive minimax methodology developed in earlier studies, in order to derive a universal version of Forney's classical erasure/list decoder, which in the erasure case, optimally trades off between the probability of erasure and the probability of undetected error. The proposed universal erasure decoder guarantees universal achievability of a certain fraction C of the optimum error exponents of these probabilities (in a sense to be made precise in the sequel). A single-letter expression for which depends solely on the coding rate and the Neyman-Pearson threshold (to be defined), is provided. The example of the binary-symmetric channel is studied in full detail, and some conclusions are drawn.", "paper_title": "Minimax universal decoding with an erasure option", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034600003"}
