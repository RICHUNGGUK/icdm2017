The schemes run in time for graphs embedded on both orientable and nonorientable surfaces. This work generalizes the PTAS framework from planar graphs to bounded-genus graphs: any problem that is shown to be approximable by the planar PTAS framework of Borradaile et al. (ACM Trans. Algorithms 5(3), 2009) will also be approximable in bounded-genus graphs by our extension.", "paper_title": "Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes for Subset-Connectivity Problems in Bounded-Genus Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000330032200001"}
