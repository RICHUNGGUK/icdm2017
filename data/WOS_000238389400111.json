Recently, some studies have done on extraction of the prediction rules with some success. In this paper, we demonstrated a decompositional approach for rule extraction from nonlinear neural networks. We also compared the prediction rules to the ones extracted by other approaches and methods. Empirical experiments are also shown.", "paper_title": "Predictability of rules in HIV-1 protease cleavage site analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400111"}
