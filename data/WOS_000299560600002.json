In the present study these indices have been further explored by defining additional novel parameters to model n-octanol-water partition coefficient (two data sets; n = 168 and 139), water solubility (n = 193), molar refractivity (n = 166), and aromatic substituent constants pi, MR, sigma(m), and sigma(p) (n = 99). All the models developed in the present study have undergone rigorous internal and external validation tests and the models have high statistical significance and prediction potential. In terms of Q(2) and r(2) values the models developed for the datasets of whole molecules are better than those previously reported, with topochemically arrived unique (TAU) indices on the same datasets of chemicals. An attempt has also been made to develop models using non-ETA topological and information indices. Interestingly, ETA and non-ETA models have been found to have similar predictive capacity.", "paper_title": "On some novel extended topochemical atom (ETA) parameters for effective encoding of chemical information and modelling of fundamental physicochemical properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000299560600002"}
