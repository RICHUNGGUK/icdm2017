This system utilizes an existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package, Active Server Pages programming, Hyper Text Markup Language web page, and a database in the development of a user-friendly interface for the e-learning system. The structure of this learning system includes three components: a pre-processor which creates and defines the problems, a control program which links CFD package; searches for the identical problem with previously executed results or creates a new CFD execution and then saves the results in the database, and a post-processor which yields a graphic presentation of the computational results. This system would provide engineering students with a solid comprehension of the physical phenomena by changing the input parameters of a specific problem. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
