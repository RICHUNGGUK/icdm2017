In addition to the operators known from ALCNHR+, a restricted existential predicate restriction operator for concrete domains is supported. In order to capture the semantic of complicated knowledge reasoning model, the expressive language ALCNHR+K(D) is introduced. It cannot only be able to represent knowledge about concrete domain and constraints, but also rules in some sense of closed world semantic model hypothesis. The paper investigates an extension to description logic based knowledge reasoning by means o f decomposing and rewriting complicated hybrid concepts into partitions. We present an approach that automatically decomposes the whole knowledge base into description logic compatible and constraints solver. Our arguments are two-fold. First, complex description logics with powerful representation ability lack effectively reasoning ability and second, how to reason with the combination of inferences from distributed heterogeneous reasoner.", "paper_title": "The expressive language ALCNHR plus K(D) for knowledge reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000237016800008"}
