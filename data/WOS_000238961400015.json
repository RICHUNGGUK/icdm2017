First. the problem is converted into an unconstrained optimization problem by using linear-algebraic techniques. Next, the unconstrained optimization problem is solved by applying an efficient quasi-Newton algorithm with closed-form formula for gradient evaluation. The coordinate transformation matrix obtained is then used to synthesize the optimal 2-D state-space filter structure that minimizes the L-2-sensitivity measure subject to L-2-norm dynamic-range scaling constraints. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the utility of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Optimal synthesis of a class of 2-D digital filters with minimum L-2-sensitivity and no overflow oscillations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961400015"}
