In order to study its approximation capability, a theorem of integral representation of functions is developed by using integral transform. Using the developed representation, an approximation order estimation for the bell-shaped neural networks is obtained. The obtained result reveals that the approximation accurately of the bell-shaped neural networks depends not only on the number of hidden neurons, but also on the smoothness of target functions.", "paper_title": "Integral transform and its application to neural network approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000010"}
