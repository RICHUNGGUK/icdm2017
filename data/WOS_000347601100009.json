Our algorithm runs in 1.3160(n)n(0(1)) time for a graph with n vertices, which is the currently fastest known time for the EDGE DOMINATING SET problem. By designing new branching rules based upon conceptually simple local structures, which we call clique-producing vertices and cycles, we obtain an algorithm that is simpler than the previously fastest known algorithm and has an improved time bound as well.
