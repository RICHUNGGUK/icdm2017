In the case of safety-critical market for avionics, military, medical and automotive applications, OpenGL SC, the safety critical profile of the OpenGL standard plays the major role for graphical interfaces. In this paper, we present an efficient way of implementing OpenGL SC 3D graphics API for the environments with hardware-supported OpenGL 1.1 and its multi-texture extension facility, which is widely available on recent embedded systems. Our approach achieved the OpenGL SC features at the low development cost on the embedded systems and also on general personal computers. Our final result shows its compliance with the OpenGL SC standard specification. From the efficiency point of view, we measured its execution times for various application programs, to show a remarkable speed-up.", "paper_title": "OpenGL SC Implementation on the OpenGL Hardware", "paper_id": "WOS:000310397700029"}
