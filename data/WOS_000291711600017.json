This control method integrates both model reference technique and exact linearization. In addition, it employs disturbance compensating mechanics to control the system to follow a linear reference model which has pole placement (on the left of the complex plane), even though modelling error, disturbance and noise exist. The simulation results of the 2DOF planar robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATION MODEL REFERENCE ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND EXACT LINEARIZATION WITH DISTURBANCE REJECTION FOR CONTROL OF ROBOT MANIPULATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711600017"}
