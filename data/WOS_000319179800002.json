Considering a logarithmic quantiser and Markovian packet dropout, the NCS is modelled as a Markov jump linear system (MJLS) with quantisation error. Further, a new definition of finite-frequency stochastic H index is given, which gives a measurement of sensitivity. Subsequently, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the MJLS can achieve such a performance. By virtue of the obtained conditions, the fault detection filters (FDFs) are designed in finite-frequency domain, which are valid in characterising the disturbance attenuation performance and finite-frequency fault sensitivity performance. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the method and its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Fault detection for networked control systems subject to quantisation and packet dropout", "paper_id": "WOS:000319179800002"}
