A review of the literature was conducted to understand the extant knowledge surrounding the topic of nurses' usage of clinical decision support systems. The common themes that emerged from the review of literature on clinical decision support systems usage by nurses include (1) nurse factors affecting usage, (2) patient factors affecting usage, (3) technology and design factors affecting usage, and (4) organizational factors affecting usage. Two major implications are that these systems may not be designed to support nursing practice and may not be having the intended effect on patient care and quality.", "paper_title": "Nurses' Use of Clinical Decision Support A Literature Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000348188500001"}
