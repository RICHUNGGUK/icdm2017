The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). Machines are provided with different capability. The machines with speed s can schedule all jobs, while the other machines with speed 1 can only process partial jobs. Online algorithms for any 0 < s < a are provided in the paper. For the case of k=1 and m=2, and the case of some values of s, k=1 and m=3, the algorithms are the best possible, where k is the number of machines with hierarchy 1, and m is the number of machines. Lower bounds for some special cases are also presented.", "paper_title": "Online scheduling on uniform machines with two hierarchies", "paper_id": "WOS:000309347400013"}
