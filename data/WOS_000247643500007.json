Therefore, a JPEG 2000 encoder with the feature of scalability is favorable for its ability of meeting different throughput requirements. On the other hand, the large amounts of data streams underline the importance of bandwidth optimization in designing the encoder. The initial specification, especially in terms of loop organization and array indices, describes the data manipulations and, subsequently, influences the outcome of the architecture implementation. Therefore, there is a clear need for the exploiting support, and we believe the emphasis should lie on the loop level steering. In this paper, we apply loop transformation techniques to a scalable embedded JPEG 2000 encoder design during the architectural exploration stage, considering not only the balance of throughput among different blocks, but also the reduction of data transfer. The architecture is prototyped onto Xilinx FPGA. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A scalable embedded JPEG 2000 architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000247643500007"}
