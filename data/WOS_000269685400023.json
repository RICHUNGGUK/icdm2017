By using both the lower bound and the upper bound of the time-varying delay of the delayed networks, a Lyapunov function is constructed. Based on this new Lyapunov function, a delay dependent condition is established in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) to guarantee the dynamics of the estimation error being globally asymptotically stable. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "DELAY-DEPENDENT STATE ESTIMATION FOR TIME-VARYING DELAYED NEURAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400023"}
