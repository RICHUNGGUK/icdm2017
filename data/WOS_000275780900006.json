However, competences Such as for instance sequences of actions, where actions depend on each other, require memory and thus a representation of state. In these cases a simple direct link between sensory perception and the motor commands may not be enough to accomplish the desired tasks. The contribution of this paper to knowledge is to show how fundamental, simple NARMAX models of behaviour can be used in a bootstrapping process to generate complex behaviours that were so far beyond reach. We argue that as the complexity of the task increases, it is important to estimate the current state of the robot and integrate this information into the system identification process. To achieve this we propose a novel method which relates distinctive locations in the environment to the state of the robot, using an unsupervised clustering algorithm. Once we estimate the current state of the robot accurately, we combine the state information with the perception of the robot through a bootstrapping method to generate more complex robot tasks: We obtain a polynomial model which models the complex task as a function of predefined low level sensor-motor controllers and raw sensory data. The proposed method has been used to teach Scitos G5 mobile robots a number of complex tasks, such as advanced obstacle avoidance, or complex route learning.
