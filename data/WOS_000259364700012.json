With strong demands on product designs for overhead control and performance requirements, vendors must have an effective design for the mapping of logical block addresses (LBAs) and physical addresses of data over flash memory. This paper targets such an essential issue by proposing a configurable mapping method that could trade the main-memory overhead with the system performance under the best needs of vendors. A series of experiments is conducted to provide insights on different configurations and the proposed method, compared to existing implementations.", "paper_title": "Configurable flash-memory management: Performance versus overheads", "paper_id": "WOS:000259364700012"}
