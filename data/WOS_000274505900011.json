The Merkle-Damgard with a Permutation (MDP) was shown to preserve unforgeability and pseudorandom oracle property. In this paper, we consider the most basic security properties of hash functions, namely collision resistance, second-preimage resistance, and preimage-resistance. We first show which of these properties are preserved by MDP in the dedicated-key setting. We also identify the properties preserved by four variants of MDR and five other variants of Merkle-Damgard iterated hash functions. As a result. for the ten hash functions we analyze, we obtain their complete MPP characteristics.", "paper_title": "MPP Characteristics of Variants of Merkle-Damgard Iterated Hash Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000274505900011"}
