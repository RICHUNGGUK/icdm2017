With a few additional constructions, the undecidability of topological mixing and the undecidability of topological transitivity follow. Furthermore, sets of topologically mixing cellular automata and non-sensitive cellular automata are recursively inseparable. It follows that Devaney's chaos and Knudsen's chaos are undecidable dynamical properties.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity and Topological Mixing are Undecidable for Reversible One-dimensional Cellular Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000276557000006"}
