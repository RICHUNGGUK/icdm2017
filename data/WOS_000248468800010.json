The planar subdivisions are modeled by hypermaps. The formal specifications of hypermaps and segmentation are developed in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. The proofs are assisted by the Coq system. The final program is written in C. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
