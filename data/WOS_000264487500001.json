In this paper, we propose a generalized query model suitable for expressing queries of different types, and investigate efficient processing techniques for this new framework. We exploit sequential access and data sharing by developing new storage and query processing techniques to leverage inter-query concurrency. Our experimental results, based on the Corel dataset, indicate that the proposed optimization can significantly reduce average response time in a multiuser environment, and achieve better retrieval precision and recall compared to two recent techniques.", "paper_title": "Efficiently support concurrent queries in multiuser CBIR systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264487500001"}
