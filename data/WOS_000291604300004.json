In other words it is the edge set of a spanning complete r-partite subhypergraph of K(n)(r). An r-cut cover is a collection of r-cuts such that each edge of K(n)(r) is in at least one of the cuts. While in the graph case r = 2 any 2-cut cover on average covers each edge at least 2 - 0(1) times, when r is odd we exhibit an r-cut cover in which each edge is covered exactly once. When r is even no such decomposition can exist, but we can bound the average number of times an edge is cut in an r-cut cover between 1+ 1 1/r+1 and 1+0(1)/logr(1)logr. The upper bound construction can be reformulated in terms of a natural polyhedral problem or as a probability problem, and we solve the latter asymptotically.", "paper_title": "Covering Complete r-Graphs with Spanning Complete r-Partite r-Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000291604300004"}
