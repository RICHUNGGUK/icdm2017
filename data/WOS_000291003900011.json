However, the extent to which interference can be aligned over a finite number of signalling dimensions remains unknown. Another important concern for interference alignment schemes is the requirement of global channel knowledge. In this work, we provide examples of iterative algorithms that utilize the reciprocity of wireless networks to achieve interference alignment with only local channel knowledge at each node. These algorithms also provide numerical insights into the feasibility of interference alignment that are not yet available in theory.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Numerical Approach to Interference Alignment and Applications to Wireless Interference Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900011"}
