Mainly due to the uncertain control coefficients, the problem has remained unsolved and its major difficulty stems from the inapplicability of the commonly used high-gain like observer. By introducing an appropriate state transformation and a thoroughly novel observer based on high-gain K-filters, the backstepping design approach is successfully proposed to the output-feedback controller for this class of systems. It is shown that the global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed by the appropriate choice of the control parameters.", "paper_title": "Global stabilization by output feedback for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain control coefficients and unmeasured states dependent growth", "paper_id": "WOS:000259676700008"}
