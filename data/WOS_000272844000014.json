Its dynamic force field, unique bidirectionality, and constrained diffusion-based level set evolution provide great freedom in contour initialization and show significant improvements in initialization independency compared to other edge-based techniques. It can handle more sophisticated topological changes than splitting and merging. It provides new potentials for edge-based active contour methods, particularly when detecting and localizing objects with unknown location, geometry, and topology.", "paper_title": "Active Contouring Based on Gradient Vector Interaction and Constrained Level Set Diffusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000272844000014"}
