The CT SDM can accommodate a single-ended input and has high input impedance, so that it can be directly driven by a single-ended condenser microphone. A current-sensing boosted OTA-C integrator with capacitive feedforward compensation is employed in the CT SDM to achieve high input impedance and high linearity with low power consumption. Fabricated in a -m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, a circuit prototype of the CT SDM achieves a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 74.2 dB, with 10-kHz bandwidth and -W power consumption.", "paper_title": "A microphone readout interface with 74-dB SNDR", "paper_id": "WOS:000342426000024"}
