The shallow water equations with eddy viscosity, bottom friction forces and wind shear stresses are used for modelling the water flow whereas, a transport-diffusion equation is used for modelling the advection and dispersion of pollutant concentration. The adaptive finite volume method uses simple centred-type discretization for the source terms, can handle complex topography using unstructured grids and satisfies the conservation property. The adaptation criteria are based on monitoring the pollutant concentration in the computational domain during its dispersion process. The emphasis in this paper is on the application of the proposed method for numerical simulation of pollution dispersion in the Strait of Gibraltar. Results are presented using different tidal conditions and wind-induced flow fields in the Strait. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
