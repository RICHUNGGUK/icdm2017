In this paper, a general construction of optimal and perfect difference systems of sets based on q-ary sequences of period n = -1 (mod q) with difference- balanced property is presented, where q is a prime power. This works for all the known q-ary sequences with ideal autocorrelation, and generalizes the earlier construction based on ternary sequences with ideal autocorrelation. In addition, we construct another class of optimal and perfect difference systems of sets, employing decimation of q-ary d-form sequences of period q (m) -1 with difference-balanced property, which generalizes the previous construction from power functions.", "paper_title": "Optimal and perfect difference systems of sets from q-ary sequences with difference-balanced property", "paper_id": "WOS:000280072200008"}
