Various frameworks support different overlay topologies and routing schemes for event dissemination, but attention is now turning to the nonfunctional attributes (such as quality of service) of such systems. Although many research efforts are starting to address the need for adaptation and QoS, no taxonomies or comprehensive surveys of adaptive middleware, which provide support for service guarantees, exist yet. To tackle this knowledge gap, the authors examine existing event-based middleware efforts, focusing on quality of service and adaptation.", "paper_title": "A taxonomy of QoS-aware, adaptive event-dissemination middleware", "paper_id": "WOS:000247796700009"}
