Reduction of computational overhead and decrease of packet queueing delay are two critical issues in the design of a packet scheduler for efficiently delivering relative differentiated services over such high-speed networks. In this paper, we propose a new packet scheduler called multi-level dynamic deficit round-robin (MLDDRR). MLDDRR considers packet size and priority at the same time in making scheduling decision. Thus, MLDDRR can deliver relatively small delays not only for traffic of high priority but also for short packets of each class. Because MLDDRR acts like the shortest job first scheduler, MLDDRR call reduce average queueing delay for each class and also provide a better service for real-time applications with a large amount of short packets. MLDDRR also exploits concurrency and pipelining approach to speedup scheduling decision. Furthermore, MLDDRR call protect the traffic of the highest priority from serious performance degradation due to bursts of low priority traffic or high link utilization, and simultaneously prevent the traffic of the lowest priority from starvation. MLDDRR allows network operators to simply change the level of delay differentiation by adjusting parameters. Complexity analysis and extensive simulation results are presented and illustrate that MLDDRR is a high-performance packet scheduler and suitable for being deployed in future high-speed networks to provide relative delay differentiated service.
