The goal of this paper is to apply parameterized ideas to approximation. We begin exploration of parameterized approximation problems, where the problem in question is a parameterized decision problem, and the required approximation factor is treated as a second parameter for the problem.", "paper_title": "Parameterized approximation problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241482800011"}
