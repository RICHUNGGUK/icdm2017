The model consists of the p-system with variable gamma representing the different gases. The main result is the convergence of a front tracking algorithm to a weak solution, thereby giving existence as well. This convergence holds for general initial data with a total variation satisfying a specific bound. The result is illustrated by numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Front tracking for a model of immiscible gas flow with large data", "paper_id": "WOS:000277283100006"}
