(i) We describe a data structure for vertical ray shooting in P that has O(log(2)n) query time and uses O(n log(2)n) storage. (ii) We give an algorithm to compute in O(n log(3)n) time a depth order on P if it exists. (iii) We give an algorithm to verify in O(n log(3)n) time whether a given order on P is a valid depth order. All three results improve on previous results.", "paper_title": "Vertical ray shooting and computing depth orders for fat objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000256452600011"}
