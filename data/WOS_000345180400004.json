Hence -Bp > B-q means that disbelief in p is more close at hand (obtainable with less far-reaching changes in belief) than belief in not-q. The logic of epistemic proximity is investigated, and it is used to construct a uniform operation of belief change that has the standard operations as special cases, specified with success conditions such as Bp for revision and {-Bp(1),...,-Bp(n)} for multiple contraction. Standard entrenchment relations are obtained by defining p to be less entrenched than q if and only if -Bp > -Bq. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
