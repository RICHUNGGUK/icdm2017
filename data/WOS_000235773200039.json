We employ a reconstruction based approach using MRF-MAP formalism, and use approximate optimization using graph cuts to carry out the reconstruction. We also use the same formalism to investigate high resolution expansions from single images by deconvolution assuming that the point spread function is known. We present a method for the estimation of the point spread function for a given camera. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain super-resolution preserving high frequency details well beyond the predicted limits of magnification.", "paper_title": "Super resolution using graph-cut", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200039"}
