The purpose of this article was to describe the development of a comprehensive, Web-based data management system for a multisite randomized behavioral intervention trial. Strategies used to create this study-specific data management system included interdisciplinary collaboration, design mapping, feasibility assessments, and input from an advisory board of former patients with characteristics similar to the targeted population. The resulting data management system and development strategies provide a template for other behavioral intervention studies.", "paper_title": "Development and Use of a Web-Based Data Management System for a Randomized Clinical Trial of Adolescents and Young Adults", "paper_id": "WOS:000291927300003"}
