We expanded this research by examining habit's antecedents and investigating the simultaneous effect of habit and prior IT use on continued IT use. We found that the research model was relatively robust over four specific use activities of one software application. Indeed, prior IT use, satisfaction, and importance significantly influenced IT habits. Also, while prior IT use predicted continued IT use in the combined data set, habit only predicted continued IT use for activities with higher habit levels. Practical implications are discussed.
