Modulo the O(log n) additive term, this achieves the information-theoretic optimum for string compression. We also observe that optimal compression is not possible for sets more complex than PSPACE/poly because for any time-constructible superpolynomial function t, there is a set A computable in space t(n) such that at least one string x of length n requires compressed(x) to be of length 2 log(|A (=n) |).", "paper_title": "On Optimal Language Compression for Sets in PSPACE/poly", "paper_id": "WOS:000352814700008"}
