After defining five linguistic varieties and 24 different registers based on these linguistic varieties, we collected texts for Peykare to do a linguistic analysis, including cross-register differences. For tokenization of Persian, we propose a descriptive generalization to normalize orthographic variations existing in texts. To annotate Peykare, we use EAGLES guidelines which result to have a hierarchy in the part-of-speech tags. To this aim, we apply a semi-automatic approach for the annotation methodology. In the paper, we also give a special attention to the Ezafe construction and homographs which are important in Persian text analyses.", "paper_title": "Lessons from building a Persian written corpus: Peykare", "paper_id": "WOS:000289850000003"}
