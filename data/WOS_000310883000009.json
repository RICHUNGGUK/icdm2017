The optimization procedure to determine unloading terminal optimal utilization, for each terminal configuration and operation strategy (existing and future situation) is also shown, due to the fact that ports (terminals) operation under an optimal capacity provides prompt accommodation of vessels with the minimum port waiting time and maximum use of berth facilities. For the purpose of a comprehensive analysis, three different river terminal simulation models have been developed due to the number of unloading devices and their operation strategy. Some of the obtained results have been applied and verified on the existing system.", "paper_title": "Optimal utilization of the terminal for bulk cargo unloading", "paper_id": "WOS:000310883000009"}
