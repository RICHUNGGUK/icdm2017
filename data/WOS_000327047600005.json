This paper proposes Potential Based Routing (PBR) as a secondary best-effort routing mechanism to boost availability of copies in ICN architectures. The control overhead issue of the PBR is evaluated through both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. In addition, the paper provides the PBR with a recovery mechanism from a failure, which can reduce the control overhead traffic by at least 40% in the simulation environment. Lastly, it is demonstrated how an ICN architecture can benefit from this PBR in terms of cache hit and delay reduction ratios. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
