While this is effective for a static camera with a fixed or a slowly varying background, it fails to handle any fast, dynamic movement in the background. In this paper, we propose a generalised framework, called region-based MoG (RMoG), that takes into consideration neighbouring pixels while generating the model of the observed scene. The model equations are derived from expectation maximisation theory for batch mode, and stochastic approximation is used for online mode updates. We evaluate our region-based approach against ten sequences containing dynamic backgrounds, and show that the region-based approach provides a performance improvement over the traditional single pixel MoG. For feature and region sizes that are equal, the effect of increasing the learning rate is to reduce both true and false positives. Comparison with four state-of-the art approaches shows that RMoG outperforms the others in reducing false positives whilst still maintaining reasonable foreground definition. Lastly, using the ChangeDetection (CDNet 2014) benchmark, we evaluated RMoG against numerous surveillance scenes and found it to be amongst the leading performers for dynamic background scenes, whilst providing comparable performance for other commonly occurring surveillance scenes.
