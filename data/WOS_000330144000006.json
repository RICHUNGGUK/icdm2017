In order to ascertain the optimal methods for winter wheat biomass estimation, this study compared the utility of univariate techniques involving narrow band vegetation indices and red-edge position (REP), as well as multivariate calibration techniques involving the partial least square regression (PLSR) analyses using band depth parameters, and the combination of band depth parameters and hyperspectral indices including narrow band indices and REP. Narrow band indices were calculated in the form of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) using all possible two-band combinations for selecting optimal narrow band indices. Band depth, band depth ratio (BDR), normalized band depth index, and band depth normalized to area extracted from a red absorption region (550 nm-750 nm) were utilized as band depth parameters. The results indicated that: (1) Compared with the traditional NDVI and SAVI constructed with bands at 670 nm and 800 nm and REP, the selected narrow band indices (optimal NDVI-like and optimal SAVI-like) produced higher estimation accuracy of the winter wheat biomass; (2) the PLSR models based on band depth parameters produced lower root mean square error, relative to the models based on the selected narrow band indices; and (3) the PLSR model based on the combination of optimal NDV1-like and BDR produced the best estimated result of the winter wheat biomass (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.177 kg/m(2)). The results of this study suggest that PLSR analysis using the combination of optimal NDVI-like and band depth parameters could significantly improve estimation accuracy of winter wheat biomass.
