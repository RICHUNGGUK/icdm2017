One of the key purposes of bank regulation is to internalize the social costs of potential bank failures via capital charges. This study proposes a method to evaluate and allocate the systemic risk to different countries/regions using a Susceptible-Infected-Removable (SIR) type of epidemic spreading model and the Shapley value (SV) in game theory. The paper also explores features of a constructed bank network using real globe-wide banking data.", "paper_title": "MEASUREMENT AND INTERNALIZATION OF SYSTEMIC RISK IN A GLOBAL BANKING NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000316808000006"}
