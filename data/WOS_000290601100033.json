This approach takes advantage of the packet-based transmission of the network in NCSs and as a consequence the control law can be designed with explicit compensation for the network-induced delay, data packet dropout and data packet disorder in both forward and backward channels. Under the Markov chain assumption of the network-induced delay (data packet dropout as well), the sufficient and necessary conditions for the stochastic stability and stabilization of the closed-loop system are obtained. A numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "STOCHASTIC STABILIZATION OF PACKET-BASED NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100033"}
