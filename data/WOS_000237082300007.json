While TuningFork was originally designed and tested for use with a particular real-time Java Virtual Machine, the architecture has been designed from the ground up for extensibility by leveraging the Eclipse plug-in architecture. This allows different client programs to design custom data formats, new visualization and analysis components, and new export formats. The TuningFork views allow the visualization of data from time scales of microseconds to minutes, enabling rapid understanding and analysis of system behavior.", "paper_title": "Demonstration: On-line visualization and analysis of real-time systems with TuningFork", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082300007"}
