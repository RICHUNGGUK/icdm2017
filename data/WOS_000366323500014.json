These methods, however, fail to characterize the stochastic behaviors of a specific individual system. In this paper, by utilizing system-level observation history, a dynamic reliability assessment method for MSSs is put forth. The proposed recursive Bayesian formula is able to dynamically update the reliability function of a specific MSS over time by incorporating system-level inspection data. The dynamic reliability function, state probabilities, and remaining useful life distribution of an MSS in residual lifetime are derived for two common cases: the degradation of components follows a homogeneous continuous time Markov process, and a non-homogeneous continuous time Markov process. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated via two numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Reliability Assessment for Multi-State Systems Utilizing System-Level Inspection Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000366323500014"}
