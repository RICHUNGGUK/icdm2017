Both the multihop nature and the large per packet channel access overhead can lead to its low channel efficiency. The problem may get even worse when there are many applications transmitting packets with small data payloads, e.g., Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Previously, the use of multiple parallel channels and employing packet concatenation were treated as separate solutions to these problems. However, there is no available work on the integrated design and performance analysis of a complete scheduler architecture combining these two schemes. In this paper, we propose a scheduler that concatenates small packets into large frames and sends them through multiple parallel channels with an intelligent channel selection algorithm between neighboring nodes. Besides the expected capacity improvements, we also derive delay bounds for this scheduler. Based on the delay bound formula, call admission control (CAC) of a broad range of scheduling algorithms can be obtained. We demonstrate the significant capacity and resequencing delay improvements of this novel design with a voice-data traffic mixing example, via both numerical and simulation results. It is shown that the proposed packet concatenation and channel selection algorithms greatly outperform the round-robin scheduler in a multihop scenario.", "paper_title": "A Multichannel Scheduler for High-Speed Wireless Backhaul Links with Packet Concatenation", "paper_id": "WOS:000273447600005"}
