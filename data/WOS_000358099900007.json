A Fourier-descriptor method was applied on mango images acquired by a CCD camera, to grade the fruits by their shapes. The method was able to correctly classify 98.3% using DA and 100% using SVM. It is also possible to estimate the weight of the mangoes from their images by applying the Cylinder approximation analysis method. The scatter plot between the estimated and actual values of the weight shows high correlation, with R-2 equal to 94.0%. The high prediction accuracy obtained shows that this simple formula is adequate for the prediction of fruit weight and volume (measured volume using the cylinder method). The correlation formula derived based on the collected data is determined as w = 2.256 V - 157.7 where w is estimated weight in grams and V is estimated volume. Overall result for weight grading using our proposed method yields 95% accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
