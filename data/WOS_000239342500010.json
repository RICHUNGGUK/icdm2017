The Mediterranean dietary pattern has become customary to be represented in the form of a pyramid, the base of which refers to foods which are suggested to be consumed most frequently and the top of the pyramid to those foods consumed rarely Recently, an index (diet score) that estimates the adherence level to Mediterranean diet was developed and associated with cardiovascular disease risk and biomarkers. in this work we present a computer program that can easily calculate this diet score, as well as its association with cardiovascular disease risk. The application of this software to the general public might be a useful tool for the reduction of the disease burden related with nutritional habits at population level.
