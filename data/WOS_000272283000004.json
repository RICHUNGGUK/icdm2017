In this paper, we investigate resource placement in the three-dimensional torus network which is the underlying interconnection network in most current multicomputer. We show that there exists an irregular distance-1 placement only for tori of the form 2 x 3i x 6j, i, j is an element of N In addition, we present a new formal proof for the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of irregular distance-d placement in 3D tori.
