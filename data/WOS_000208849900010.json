There are some criteria to determine Hadamard inequivalence. Among them, one of the most commonly used is the 4-profile criterion. In this paper, a reformulation of this criterion in the cocyclic framework is given. The improvements obtained in the computation of the 4-profile of a cocyclic Hadamard matrix are indicated.", "paper_title": "On an inequivalence criterion for cocyclic Hadamard matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000208849900010"}
