Pinning control is suggested to stabilize the homogenous stationary state of the whole coupled network. The complicated coupled problem is reduced to two independent problems: clarifying the stable regions of the coupled network and specifying the eigenvalue distribution of the asymmetric coupling and control matrices. The dependence of the controllability on both pinning density and pinning strength is studied.", "paper_title": "STABILITY AND CONTROLLABILITY OF ASYMMETRIC COMPLEX DYNAMICAL NETWORKS: EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263880100005"}
