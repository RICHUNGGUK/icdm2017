We believe this is important because, for airborne and spaceborne remote sensing missions, power and/or energy can be in practice as relevant as performance. In this sense, this paper investigates whether several recent low-power multithreaded architectures, from ARM and NVIDIA, can be a practical alternative in this domain to a standard high-performance multicore processor, using the RX anomaly detector as a case study.", "paper_title": "Exploring the performance-power-energy balance of low-power multicore and manycore architectures for anomaly detection in remote sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000353786700020"}
