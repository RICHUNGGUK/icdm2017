We argue that the initial recommendation power located on the objects should be determined by both of their degree and the user's tastes. By introducing a tunable parameter, the user taste effects on the configuration of initial recommendation power distribution are investigated. The numerical results indicate that the presented algorithm could improve the accuracy, measured by the average ranking score. More importantly, we find that when the data is sparse, the algorithm should give more recommendation power to the objects whose degrees are close to the user's tastes, while when the data becomes dense, it should as sign more power on the objects whose degrees are significantly different from user's tastes.", "paper_title": "EFFECTS OF USER'S TASTES ON PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000273425100004"}
