The variable coefficients of the preserved method result after nullifying the phase-lag, the dissipative error and the first derivative of the phase-lag. We can see the efficiency of the new method through its local truncation error. Furthermore, we compare the new method's efficiency to other numerical methods. This is shown through the integration of the two-body problem with various eccentricities and of four other initial value problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
