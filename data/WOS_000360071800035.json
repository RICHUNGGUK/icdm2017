This paper presents the design and annotation of the Violent Scene Detection dataset, a corpus targeting the detection of physical violence in Hollywood movies. We discuss definitions of physical violence and provide a simple and objective definition which was used to annotate a set of 18 movies, thus resulting in the largest freely-available dataset for such a task. We discuss borderline cases and compare with annotations based on a subjective definition which requires multiple annotators. We provide a detailed analysis of the corpus, in particular regarding the relationship between violence and a set of key audio and visual concepts which were also annotated. The VSD dataset results from two years of benchmarking in the framework of the MediaEval initiative. We provide results from the 2011 and 2012 benchmarks as a validation of the dataset and as a state-of-the-art baseline.
