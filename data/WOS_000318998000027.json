ICNP (R) is a systemic coding system that can support the development of nursing information systems. Translation of the standardized terminology preferred terms into local terms is an important first step in the translation process. The purpose of this case report is to describe the translation strategy used and challenges faced in translating ICNP (R) Version 2 preferred terms from English to traditional Chinese. Methods: A modified Delphi strategy using forward translation and expert consensus was conducted to facilitate semantic and cultural translation and validation of the ICNP (R) and to make the process generalizable. A nursing informatics expert completed the initial forward translation. Five nursing experts with rich clinical and academic experiences joined this process and validated the initial translation. The nursing experts' consensus was then used to finalize the traditional Chinese terms. Results: A total of 1863 preferred terms from the ICNP (R) Version 2 were translated from English into traditional Chinese. Majority agreement from two or more nursing experts was achieved for 98.3% (n = 1832) of the preferred term translations. Less than 2% (n = 31) of terms had no majority agreement. Translation challenges include the following: (1) changes in code structure of preferred terms from the ICNP (R) beta 2 version to Verson 2, (2) inability to identify resources to complete the translation that fully met ICNP recommendations for terminology translators, (3) ambiguous preferred term descriptions, and (4) ambiguous preferred term names. Conclusions: Most of the ICNP (R) Version 2 preferred terms were translated from English into traditional Chinese with majority consensus. For the terms without consensus, we recommend that all synonyms be included in the ICNP (R) translation. In countries like Taiwan where nursing education occurs in English, it is recommended that English terms are displayed along with the translated official language to help nurses to interpret and use the terminology correctly.
