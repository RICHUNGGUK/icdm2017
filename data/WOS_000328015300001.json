However, performances of machine emotion recognition studies are difficult to interpret because benchmarks have not been established. To provide such a benchmark, we compared machine with human emotion recognition. We gathered facial expressions, speech, and physiological signals from 17 individuals expressing 5 different emotional states. Support vector machines achieved an 82% recognition accuracy based on physiological and facial features. In experiments with 75 humans on the same data, a maximum recognition accuracy of 62.8% was obtained. As machines outperformed humans, automated emotion recognition might be ready to be tested in more practical applications.", "paper_title": "Machines Outperform Laypersons in Recognizing Emotions Elicited by Autobiographical Recollection", "paper_id": "WOS:000328015300001"}
