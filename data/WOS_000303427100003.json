The cipher has very low memory requirements and uses only simple and fast arithmetic operations. The paper discusses in detail the PP-1 cipher design, including the S-box construction, the permutation and the round key scheduling. The quality of the PP-1 cipher is evaluated with respect to differential and linear cryptanalysis. Its quality is compared to the quality of a comparative algorithm with the same block length, as well as to the quality of the class of balanced Feistel ciphers, and in particular to DES quality.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of PP-1 Cipher Resistance against Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis in Comparison to a DES-like Cipher", "paper_id": "WOS:000303427100003"}
