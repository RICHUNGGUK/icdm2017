Although the regression analysis has been used as a daily clinical means to estimate the fetal weight on the basis of ultrasound measurements, it still lacks enough accuracy for low-birth-weight fetuses. The ineffectiveness is mainly due to the large inter-or intraobserver variability in measurements and the inappropriateness of the regression analysis. A novel method based oil the support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to improve the weight estimation accuracy for fetuses of less than 2500 g. Here, fuzzy logic is introduced into SVR (termed FSVR) to limit the contribution of inaccurate training data to the model establishment, and thus, to enhance the robustness of FSVR to noisy data. To guarantee the generalization performance of the FSVR model, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) is utilized to obtain the optimal parameters for the FSVR, which is referred to as the evolutionary fuzzy support vector regression (EFSVR) model. Compared with regression formulas, back-propagation neural network, and SVR, EFSVR achieves the lowest mean absolute percent error (6.6%) and the highest correlation coefficient (0.902) between the estimated fetal weight and the actual birth weight. The EFSVR model produces significant improvement (1.9%4.2%) on the accuracy of fetal weight estimation over several widely used formulas. Experiments show the potential of EFSVR in clinical prenatal care.", "paper_title": "Fetal Weight Estimation Using the Evolutionary Fuzzy Support Vector Regression for Low-Birth-Weight Fetuses", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429100008"}
