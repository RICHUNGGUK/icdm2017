This paper proposes some operations and a possibility degree of trapezium clouds, as well as several new aggregation operators: the trapezium cloud weighted arithmetic averaging operator, the trapezium cloud ordered weighted arithmetic averaging operator, and the trapezium cloud hybrid arithmetic operator. Moreover, a method with Atanassov's interval-valued intuitionistic linguistic numbers (AIVILNs) based on trapezium clouds is presented, which can provide solutions to multicriteria group decision-making problems with Atanassov's interval-valued intuitionistic linguistic information. In this method, AIVILNs are first converted into trapezium clouds and aggregated by trapezium cloud aggregation operators. Then, the ranking of alternatives is determined by the possibility degree matrix of trapezium clouds. Finally, an illustrative example confirming the validity and feasibility of the proposed method is given.", "paper_title": "Atanassov's Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Linguistic Multicriteria Group Decision-Making Method Based on the Trapezium Cloud Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000355764700005"}
