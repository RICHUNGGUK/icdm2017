The SIK has proved more efficient and easier to be adapted than traditional keys for targeted diagnosis. Since it is hard and time-consuming for taxonomists to design SIK manually, a Web-based tool, SlKey, was developed for both experts and non-experts to acquire or revise SIK rapidly and conveniently. SlKey operates on secondary use of existing identification keys with logical reasoning and involves construction of computerized taxonomic knowledge base, tree-tracing for crossing nodes and generation of sub-keys. Currently a software called InsectlD has been developed for the computerization of dichotomous keys while SlKey offers online, real-time auto-generation of SlKs for user-defined group of taxa. The principles, construction methods and testing of SlKey were described in this paper. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
