This analytical framework was used as a basis of a questionnaire survey among eParticipation initiatives at the European, national, regional, and local levels. It has been concluded that, in most cases, eParticipation simply provided a suitable alternative channel for participatory activities and did not challenge institutionalized centers of power.", "paper_title": "Understanding eParticipation State of Play in Europe", "paper_id": "WOS:000314505700009"}
