The authors propose a community mining system that helps to find communities of researchers by using bibliography data. The basic concept of this system is to provide interactive visualization of communities both local and global communities. We implemented this concept using actual bibliography data and present a case study using the proposed system.", "paper_title": "Exploration of researchers' social network for discovering communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000239588900049"}
