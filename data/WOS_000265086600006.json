A query to a metric space consists of a pair of points and asks for the distance between these points. We study the number of queries to metric spaces (M, d) and (N, rho) needed to decide whether (M, d) is L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, rho) or epsilon-far from being L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, rho). When (M, d) is epsilon-far from being L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, rho), we allow an o(1) probability of error (i.e., returning the wrong answer \"L-bilipschitz embeddable\"). However, no error is allowed when (M, d) is L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, rho). That is, algorithms with only one-sided errors are studied in this paper. When vertical bar M vertical bar <= vertical bar N vertical bar are both finite, we give an upper bound of O(root 1n vertical bar N vertical bar/epsilon vertical bar M vertical bar (vertical bar M vertical bar(2) + vertical bar N vertical bar(2)))on the number of queries for determining with one-sided error whether (M, d) is L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, rho) or epsilon-far from being L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, rho). For the special case of finite vertical bar M vertical bar = vertical bar N vertical bar, the above upper bound evaluates to O(vertical bar N vertical bar(3/2) root 1n vertical bar N vertical bar/epsilon). We also prove a lower bound of Omega(vertical bar N vertical bar(3/2)) for the special case when vertical bar M vertical bar = vertical bar N vertical bar are finite and L = 1; which coincides with testing isometry between finite metric spaces. For finite vertical bar M vertical bar = vertical bar N vertical bar, the upper and lower bounds thus match up to a multiplicative factor of at most root 1n vertical bar N vertical bar/epsilon, which depends only sublogarithmically in vertical bar N vertical bar. We also investigate the case when (N, rho) is not necessarily finite. Our results are based on techniques developed in an earlier work on testing graph isomorphism.", "paper_title": "TESTING EMBEDDABILITY BETWEEN METRIC SPACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000265086600006"}
