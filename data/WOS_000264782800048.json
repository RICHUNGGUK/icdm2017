QED uses a matrix called the house of quality (HoQ) to translate customer requirements (CRs) into engineering characteristics (ECs). Constructing the HoQ, which includes determining the importance weights of CRs, the correlation matrix among ECs and the relationship matrix between CRs and ECs, is an important issue in the application of QFD. However, decision-makers (DMs) participating the construction of HoQ tend to give their individual judgments in multi-format or multi-granularity depending on their different knowledge, experience, culture and circumstance. Furthermore, these judgments are more difficult to assess with the precise quantitative forms due to the vagueness and uncertainty existed in the early stage of new product development. In this paper, a group decision-making approach incorporating with two optimization models (i.e. logarithmic least squares model and weighted least squares model) is proposed to aggregate these multi-format and multi-granularity linguistic judgments. Fuzzy set theory is utilized to address the uncertainty in the decision-making process. The proposed method is illustrated with a real-world case of horizontal directional drilling machine. The application indicates that the group decision-making method may be a promising tool for constructing the HoQ. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
