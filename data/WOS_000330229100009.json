However, wireless communications infrastructure between BVs and the smart grid also introduce severe and unprecedented security vulnerabilities. In this article, we discuss V2G network architectures and present state-of-the-art security, including different security challenges during V2G power and communications interactions. Then we report on our context-aware authentication solution for V2G communications in the smart grid. Finally, we describe several open issues for secure V2G networks.", "paper_title": "SECURING VEHICLE-TO-GRID COMMUNICATIONS IN THE SMART GRID", "paper_id": "WOS:000330229100009"}
