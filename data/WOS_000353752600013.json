New hierarchical height function algorithms for interface normal and curvature (Bornia et al., 2011) are adapted and integrated into the Volume of Fluid component of our Navier-Stokes-Maxwell code for magnetic fluids and charge-free quasi-static magnetic fields. Accuracy and convergence results are presented for highly elongated ellipses characteristic of magnetic fluids, for static non-magnetic fluid droplets, and for magnetic fluid droplets elongated by an imposed uniform field. The code is applied to Magnetic Drug Targeting to demonstrate the response of magnetically controlled fluid regions to an imposed quadratic flow profile in a model vein. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
