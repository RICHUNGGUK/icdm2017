The process is carried out in three steps. First, texture coordinates are locally displaced to minimize the misalignment of adjacent texture patches. Second, color discontinuities between different texture patches at each corner of the mesh faces are resolved. We minimize a global energy function over the mesh to ensure continuous color transitions and fit the color gradient at each corner of the mesh faces. Finally, the color adjustment at the corners is propagated over the texture patch for each face by solving a Poisson equation with mixed boundary conditions. By means of the proposed processing techniques, the visibility of seams is minimized while fine details are preserved in image-based texture maps. This can be used as a last refinement stage in image-based 3D reconstruction pipelines. The proposed color adjustment algorithm is tested on a variety of real-world datasets and compares very favorably with known methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
