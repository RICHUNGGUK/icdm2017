The main feature of this method is that, as opposed to other known algorithms, the pressure is determined by just solving one Poisson equation per time step, which greatly reduces the computational cost. The stability of the method is proved and the performance of the method is numerically illustrated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
