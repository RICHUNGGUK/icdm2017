The principles of alpha-level sets and backpropagation through time approach are also briefly discussed. We next employ these two methods to derive an explicit learning algorithm for the feedback parameters of the LIFBDFS. With this training algorithm, our LIFBDFS indeed becomes a potential candidate in solving real-time modeling and prediction problems.", "paper_title": "A linguistic information feed-back-based dynamical fuzzy system (LIFBDFS) with learning algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000264550900002"}
