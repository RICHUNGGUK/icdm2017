A theoretical model based on conservation equations (following the one proposed by Da Silva and Rodrigues (2001)) is used for an initial evaluation of the process performance. Activated carbon is the adsorbent considered, simulating adsorption equilibrium and kinetics with the equations proposed by Kikkinides, Yang, and Cho (1993). According to the simulated results, it is possible to recover carbon dioxide with high purity (>93%) from a mixture with 13% carbon dioxide at 40 degrees C, with higher recovery (>90%) and a lower power consumption (<0.12 kWh/kgCO(2)) than other processes with rinse step reaching the same purity. Although these results are theoretical, they show the potential advantages of this process for CO2 capture. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
