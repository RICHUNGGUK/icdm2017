With the method of moving spheres, we show the existence and the exact form of its solution in the case p <= (n + alpha)/(n - beta), q <= (n + beta/(n - alpha); and with the method of moving planes, we prove the symmetry and monotonicity of its solution in the case 1/p+1 + 1/q+1 = n-alpha/2n+beta-alpha + n-beta/2n+alpha-beta.
