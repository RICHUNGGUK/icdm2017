VOD networks mean local networks to provide VOD services to communities in a scale about 500 to 1000 users simultaneously. Many VOD networks could cooperate through external networks link internet. The cooperation requires not only huge local bandwidth but great backbone bandwidth. This paper presents prediction algorithms to reduce the cost in external communications which is very important for VOD operators. Basic algorithms can reduce overall costs about 30% and well trained ANN can provide extra 10% performance.", "paper_title": "Prediction algorithms in large scale VOD network collaborations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400072"}
