However, the dense and random deployment of small-cells (e.g., micro, pico and femtocells) raises important questions about the energy consumption for HetNets. In this paper, we study the optimal energy efficiency of a two-tier heterogeneous network consists of a macro-cell and many small-cells under coverage performance constraints for different spectrum deployments (including orthogonal and co-channel spectrum deployments). Firstly, we derive the closed-form expressions of coverage performance for each tier based on stochastic geometry. Then the relationship between energy efficiency and the density of small-cells for the two-tier network is evaluated, the optimal density of small-cells that maximize energy efficiency under coverage performance constraints for the two-tier network is obtained. The theoretical analysis is validated by simulations.The results show that the energy efficiency of the two-tier networks with orthogonal spectrum deployment is better than that with co-channel spectrum deployment. The results also show that the optimal density of small-cells for maximal energy efficiency is only dependent on the coverage performance of small-cells in orthogonal spectrum deployment scenario. However, in co-channel spectrum deployment scenario, the optimal density of small-cells for maximal energy efficiency is jointly decided by the coverage performance of both macro-cell and small-cell. This work provides an essential understanding for successful deployment of green heterogeneous networks.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficiency Study for Two-tier Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet) Under Coverage Performance Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000321870400011"}
