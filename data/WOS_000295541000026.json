It is assumed that there are two different job types, where each job type can be processed on a unique subset of machines. We provide an optimal offline algorithm to solve the problem in constant time and an online algorithm with a competitive ratio that equals the lower bound. We show that the worst competitive ratio is obtained for an inclusive job-machine structure in which the first job type can be processed on any of the m machines while the second job type can be processed only on a subset of m/2 machines. Moreover, we show that our online algorithm is 1-competitive if the machines are not flexible, i.e., each machine can process only a single job type. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
