However, the accuracy and the accessibility of the methods play an important role. Two nonlinear homogenization methods for microstructured solid materials are investigated in this work: the pRBMOR (Fritzen and Leuschner, 2013; Fritzen et al., 2014) and the NUTFA (Sepe et al., 2013). Both methods are based on ideas of the nonuniform transformation field analysis (NTFA; Michel and Suquet, 2003, 2004). A detailed comparison with respect to accuracy, storage requirements and the evolution of the reduced degrees of freedom is carried out. Numerical examples for two- and three-dimensional problems undergoing nonproportional load paths are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
