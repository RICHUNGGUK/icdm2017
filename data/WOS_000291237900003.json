Existing approaches have implementation issues, such as the requirement for modifications to the MAC layer or queuing operations of TAPs, limitations on the network topology, high packet loss rates and overheads, and difficulty in measuring the effective link capacities between TAPs. To address these issues, we propose an effective and practical approach that enforces fairness in wireless backhaul networks by estimating the target sending rates for TAPs dynamically. We also extend our approach to multi-rate, multi-weight, non-saturated and split wireless backhaul networks. Moreover, to speed up the convergence time, we provide a good estimation for our approach's initial sending rate based on the network topology and the transport layer protocol. We evaluate the performance of proposed approach via ns-2 simulations. The results demonstrate that the approach works well in various network topologies and achieves a rapid convergence time.", "paper_title": "Fairness Provisioning in Multi-hop Wireless Backhaul Networks: A Dynamic Estimation Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000291237900003"}
