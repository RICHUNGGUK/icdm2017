In this paper, we introduce a new relationship among maximum instantaneous current, IR-drops and sleep transistor networks from a temporal viewpoint. Based on this relationship, we propose an algorithm to reduce the total sizes of sleep transistors in distributed sleep transistor network designs with the consideration of decoupling capacitances is taken. Our method achieves significantly better results than previous works on sleep transistor sizes.", "paper_title": "Sleep Transistor Sizing for Leakage Power Minimization Considering Temporal Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000282543700011"}
