Within a relative performance point of view, if DMUs operating in different environments are compared, the units that operate in less desirable environments are at a disadvantage. In order to ensure that the performance comparison is reasonable within an efficiency measurement approach, a two-stage framework is presented in this research. The first stage uses multivariate methods (robust PCA, fuzzy clustering, and discriminant analysis) to group the DMUs based on the values of the environmental (non-discretionary) variables. The second stage incorporates one of the several efficiency measurement models to carry out relative performance analysis. The concept of local and global frontiers is explored and its significance towards making strategic resource allocation decisions is addressed. The approach proposed in this research is used to evaluate the efficiency performance of Greek municipalities that has been previously analyzed in the literature.", "paper_title": "Using Multivariate Methods to Incorporate Environmental Variables for Local and Global Efficiency Performance Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000283637900004"}
