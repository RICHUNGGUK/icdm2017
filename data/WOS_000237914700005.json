The main feature of GASAT is that it includes a recombination stage based on a specific crossover and a tabu search stage. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the different components of GASAT and to compare its overall performance with state-of-the-art SAT algorithms. These experiments show that GASAT provides very competitive results.", "paper_title": "GASAT: A genetic local search algorithm for the satisfiability problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000237914700005"}
