The model considers the optimal location of the new industrial facility to integrate its wastewater discharge to the environment with the surrounding watershed through a disjunctive formulation. The pollutants discharged for the new plant are tracked simultaneously with the other discharges to the watershed (i.e., residential, sanitary, industrial and extractions), and the natural phenomena that affect the composition of the watershed (i.e., evaporation, filtration, etc.), in addition to the chemical reactions that are carried out in the rivers. The objective function consists in minimizing the total annual cost that is constituted by the installation of the new plant cost (including the transportation for raw materials, products and services, as well as the land cost), the wastewater treatment costs (including the piping cost) and the fresh sources cost. Two example problems were used to show the applicability of the proposed methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
