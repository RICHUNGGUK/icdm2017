In this survey, we discuss the issues that must be addressed in the development of a Web clustering engine, including acquisition and preprocessing of search results, their clustering and visualization. Search results clustering, the core of the system, has specific requirements that cannot be addressed by classical clustering algorithms. We emphasize the role played by the quality of the cluster labels as opposed to optimizing only the clustering structure. We highlight the main characteristics of a number of existing Web clustering engines and also discuss how to evaluate their retrieval performance. Some directions for future research are finally presented.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Web Clustering Engines", "paper_id": "WOS:000268468500004"}
