The first one is operated in the form of a matrix and is actually a modified version of the Simplex method. The second one is based upon the idea of a basic cell set and a rotational sort method, which not only inherits the advantages of the first one, but also reduces the computational burden. Numerical simulations show that the tracking performance of the two proposed data assignment algorithms is almost identical, and the second one is preferred when a large number of targets are tracked.
