The task is to determine the allocation of powers and subcarriers for users to ensure that the user outage probabilities are as low as possible. We formulate a min-max outage probability problem and solve it under the constraint that the transmit power spectrum at each base station is flat. In particular, we obtain a subchannel allocation algorithm that has complexity O(L log L) in L, the number of users in the cell. We also consider suboptimal but implementable approaches with and without the flat transmit power spectrum constraint. We conclude that the flat transmit spectrum approach has merit, and warrants further study.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Allocation of Subcarriers and Transmit Powers in an OFDMA Cellular Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000271951500008"}
