Whereas existing gait databases include at most 185 subjects, we construct a larger gait database that includes 4007 subjects (2135 males and 1872 females) with ages ranging from 1 to 94 years. The dataset allows us to determine statistically significant performance differences between currently proposed gait features. In addition, the dependences of gait-recognition performance on gender and age group are investigated and the results provide several novel insights, such as the gradual change in recognition performance with human growth.", "paper_title": "The OU-ISIR Gait Database Comprising the Large Population Dataset and Performance Evaluation of Gait Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000308711100009"}
