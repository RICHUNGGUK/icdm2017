In this paper we investigate solution algorithms in conjunction with high-order Spectral Difference discretization for the Euler equations, using such techniques as multigrid and matrix-free implicit relaxation methods In particular we present a novel hybrid multilevel relaxation method that combines (optionally matrix-free) implicit relaxation techniques with explicit multistage smoothing using geometric multigrid. Furthermore, we discuss efficient implementation of these concepts using such tools as automatic differentiation (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A hybrid multilevel method for high-order discretization of the Euler equations on unstructured meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000276784300020"}
