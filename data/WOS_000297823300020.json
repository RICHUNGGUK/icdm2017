The procedure applies sequentially an intensification strategy to improve locally a current solution and a diversification strategy destroying more extensively a current solution to recover a new one. To search more extensively the feasible domain, a hybrid method is specified where the local search procedure is used to improve each offspring solution generated with a steady state genetic algorithm. The numerical results using 35 most widely used benchmark problems indicate that the line search procedure can reduce to 1% the average gap to the best-known solutions of the problems using an average solution time of 0.64 s. The hybrid method can reach the best-known solution for 31 of the 35 benchmark problems, and improve the best-known solution of three others, but using more computational effort.
