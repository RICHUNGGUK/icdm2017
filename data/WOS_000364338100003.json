Unfortunately, power consumption of accelerometers used in conventional HAR is relatively high compared to the amount of power that can be harvested practically, which limits energy harvesting's usefulness. Here, the authors present and evaluate an energy-harvesting wearable sensor architecture, HAR from Kinetic Energy (HARKE), that doesn't require using an accelerometer. Using off-the-shelf products, the authors demonstrate that a kinetic harvester's voltage exhibits distinguishable patterns to distinctly infer human activities accurately while consuming a fraction of the limited harvested energy.", "paper_title": "Energy-Harvesting Wearables for Activity-Aware Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000364338100003"}
