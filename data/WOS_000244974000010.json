The network induced delays of the NCSs are considered as interval variables governed by a Markov chain. Using the upper and lower bounds of the delays, a discrete-time Markovian jump system with norm-bounded uncertainties is presented to model the NCSs. Based on this model, the H,,, state feedback controller can be constructed via a set of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is given to show the proposed results.", "paper_title": "H-infinity control of networked control systems via LMI approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000244974000010"}
