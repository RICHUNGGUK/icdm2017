The anonymity of proposed scheme is secure against outer attackers and inner attackers simultaneously. Based on the first construction, we also present a dual-anonymous multireceiver encryption that supports the security properties such as identity privacy of both sender and receiver, sender undeniability, forward security, and forward anonymity, which has a perfect premise for privacy-carrying e-mail systems. We design a deployment in a secure e-mail delivery system and give some experimental results. We evaluate the performance in theoretical analysis and practical assessment, and show that our proposed schemes achieve an effective balance in strong security, low computation cost, and light communication load.", "paper_title": "Efficient Constructions of Anonymous Multireceiver Encryption Protocol and Their Deployment in Group E-mail Systems With Privacy Preservation", "paper_id": "WOS:000321641800007"}
