The base algorithm currently used for MCTS is UCT. We propose an alternative MCTS algorithm: sequential halving applied to Trees (SHOT). It has multiple advantages over UCT: it spends less time in the tree, it uses less memory, it is parameter free, at equal time settings it beats UCT for a complex combinatorial game and it can be efficiently parallelized.", "paper_title": "Sequential Halving Applied to Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000351542300010"}
