However, most of these approaches are inflexible to adapt to spam dynamically. This paper proposes a novel approach to counter spam based on. spam behavior recognition using Decision Tree learned from data maintained during transfer sessions. A classification is set up according to email transfer patterns enabling normal servers to detect malicious connections before mail body delivered, which contributes much to save network bandwidth wasted by spams. An integrated Anti-Spam framework is founded combining the Behavior Classification with a Bayesian classification. Experiments show that the Behavior Classification has high precision rate with acceptable recall rate considering its bandwidth saving feature. The integrated filter has a higher recall rate than either of the sub-modules, and the precision rate remains quite close to the Bayesian Classification.", "paper_title": "Spam behavior recognition based on session layer data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000160"}
