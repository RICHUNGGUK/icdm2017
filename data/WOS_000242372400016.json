In order to improve the algorithm performance, we focus on considering two key issues that are load balancing and resource-sharing degree when computing the working and backup paths. We also investigate the trap situations and present a solution method, because the trap situations may lead to high blocking probability (BP). Simulations results show that, DPSP can provide complete protection for the double-link failures; with respect to the previous work, DPSP not only can effectively avoid the trap situations but also is able to obtain higher resource utilization ratio and lower BP.
