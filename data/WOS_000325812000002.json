It has been greatly used to support customer relationship management (CRM) such as customer identification, one-to-one marketing, fraud detection, and lifetime value analysis. Although previous studies showed themselves efficient and accurate in certain CRM classification applications, most of them took demographic, RFM-type, or activity attributes as classification criteria and seldom took temporal relationship among these attributes into account. To bridge this gap, this study takes customer temporal behavior data, called time-interval sequences, as classification criteria and develops a two-stage classification framework. In the first stage, time-interval sequential patterns are discovered from customer temporal databases. Then, a time-interval sequence classifier optimized by the particle swam optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to achieve high classification accuracy in the second stage. The experiment results indicate the proposed time-interval sequence classification framework is efficient and accurate to predict the class label of new customer temporal data.", "paper_title": "A time-interval sequence classification method", "paper_id": "WOS:000325812000002"}
