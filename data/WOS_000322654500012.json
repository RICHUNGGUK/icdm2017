To enable tumor blood flow variability to be assessed in vivo by imaging, a tracer kinetic model that accounts for flow dispersion is developed for use with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) CT. The proposed model adopts a multiple-pathway approach and allows for the quantification of relative dispersion in the blood flow distribution, which reflects flow variability in the tumor vasculature. Monte Carlo simulation experiments were performed to study the possibility of reducing the number of model parameters based on the Akaike information criterion approach and to explore possible noise and tissue conditions in which the model might be applicable. The model was used for region-of-interest analysis and to generate perfusion parameter maps for three patient DCE CT cases with cerebral tumors, to illustrate clinical applicability.", "paper_title": "Assessment of Tumor Blood Flow Distribution by Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced CT", "paper_id": "WOS:000322654500012"}
