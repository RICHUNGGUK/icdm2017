These devices provide a marker-less body pose estimation by means of skeletal data consisting of 3D positions of body joints. These can be further used for pose, gesture or action recognition. In this work, an evolutionary algorithm is used to determine the optimal subset of skeleton joints, taking into account the topological structure of the skeleton, in order to improve the final success rate. The proposed method has been validated using a state-of-the-art RGB action recognition approach, and applying it to the MSR-Action3D dataset. Results show that the proposed algorithm is able to significantly improve the initial recognition rate and to yield similar or better success rates than the state-of-the-art methods.
