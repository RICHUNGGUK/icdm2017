KDWUD has become very critical for effective and efficient managing of the activities related to e-business, e-services, c-education, personalization, web site management and so on. Mining web access logs that contain, substantial data about user access patterns on one or more web localities is an emerging research area. In this paper, we present a survey of the recent developments in this area with a particular focus on Sequential Patterns and Clustering patterns in order to understand the navigational behavior of the users.", "paper_title": "Knowledge discovery from web usage data: Extraction and applications of sequential and clustering patterns - A survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272000016"}
