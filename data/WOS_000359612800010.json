The passive scheme monitors network background traffic data and system status whereas the active scheme monitors download/upload speed from equipment to the active measurement server. The proposed scheme was used for performance analysis of a mobile network. The proposed scheme provides novel functions unavailable in existing schemes such as TTC, SpeedTest and NTU.", "paper_title": "Integrated Active and Passive Measurement and Analysis of Mobile Network Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000359612800010"}
