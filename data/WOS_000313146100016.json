In this paper, different from traditional methods which focus on making full use of slacks of non-critical gates, an efficient min-cut based voltage assignment algorithm concentrating on critical gates is proposed. And then this algorithm is integrated into a searching engine to auto-select rational voltages for dual-vdd system. Experimental results show that our search engine can always achieve good pair of dual-vdd, and our min-cut based algorithm outperformed previous works for voltage assignment both on power consumption and runtime.", "paper_title": "Novel Voltage Choice and Min-Cut Based Assignment for Dual-VDD System", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100016"}
