The changes from the original version of the CVP method concern the velocity and the pressure correction equations that are used in the solution procedure and the topology of the grid where the method is applied. The improved CVP scheme is faster, simpler and more stable than the original version of the method. The efficiency and the accuracy of the new scheme are tested and validated through comparison of predictions and of computational time, with numerical results obtained with the SIMPLE method. Moreover, we present extensive comparisons of the results of the improved CVP scheme with numerical and experimental data from various researchers that show excellent agreement for a wide range of benchmark 2D and 3D laminar internal flow problems such as flow over a backward facing step, flow in square, circular and elliptical curved ducts and pulsating flow.
