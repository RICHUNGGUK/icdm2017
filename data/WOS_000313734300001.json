The imbalanced data classification problem occurs when the number of samples in one class, usually the class of interest, is much lower than the number in the other classes. Many classification models have been studied in the data-mining research community. However, they all assume that the input data are stationary and bounded in size, so that resampling techniques and postadjustment by measuring the classification cost can be applied. In this paper, we devise a new scheme that extends a popular stream classification algorithm to the analysis of WSNs for reducing the adverse effects of the imbalanced class in the data.. is new scheme is resource light at the algorithm level and does not require any data preprocessing. It uses weighted naive Bayes predictors at the decision tree leaves to effectively reduce the impact of imbalanced classes. Experiments show that our modified algorithm outperforms the original stream classification algorithm.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Classification Decision Trees by Using Weighted Naive Bayes Predictors to Reduce the Imbalanced Class Problem in Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000313734300001"}
