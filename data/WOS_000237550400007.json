The sensor networks literature presents an alphabet soup of medium access control protocols with almost all of the works focusing only on energy efficiency. There is much more innovative work to be done at the MAC layer, but current efforts are not addressing the hard unsolved problems. Majority of the works appearing in the literature are \"least publishable incremental improvements\" over the popular S-MAC [1] protocol. In this paper we present research directions for future medium access research. We identify some open issues and discuss possible solutions.", "paper_title": "Medium access control issues in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237550400007"}
