The algorithm uses a digraph where the vertices represent the data to be clustered. The weight of the edge represents the acceptance rate between the two data connected by the edge. The pheromone on the edges is adaptively updated by the ants passing through it. Some edges with less pheromone are progressively removed under a list of thresholds in the process. Strong connected components of the final digraph are extracted as clusters. Experimental results on several real datasets and benchmarks indicate that the algorithm can find clusters more quickly and with better quality than K-means and LF. In addition, when the database is changed, the algorithm can dynamically modify the clusters accordingly to maintain its accuracy.", "paper_title": "An ant clustering method for a dynamic database", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100018"}
