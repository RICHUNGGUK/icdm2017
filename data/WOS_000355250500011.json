However, this evaluation process is often a tedious, time-consuming, and manual simulation process whereas many simulation parameters have to be configured before the simulations run. We formulate the tightness evaluation as constrained optimization problems for delay bound and backlog bounds, respectively. The well-defined problems enable a fully automated configuration searching process, which can be guided by a heuristic algorithm with cycle-accurate simulations integrated. This is a fully automated procedure and thus provides a promising path to automatic design space exploration in similar contexts. Experimental results over various topologies and traffic patterns indicate that our method is effective in finding the configuration for best tightness up to 98%, even when up to 50 parameters are configured in a multidimensional discrete search space under complex constraints.", "paper_title": "Heuristics-Aided Tightness Evaluation of Analytical Bounds in Networks-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000355250500011"}
