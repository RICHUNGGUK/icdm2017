In comparison with salts of unsubstituted 6-nitraminotetrazine, -NH2 substitution strengthens the hydrogen bonding interaction and other intramolecular interactions (such as charge transfer, binding energy, second-order perturbation energy and dispersion energy), -N-3 has tiny effects on these interactions, and other groups weaken these interactions, with weakening decreasing in the order -NO2>-NF2>-ONO2. The ability of the cations to produce strong intramolecular interactions decreases in the order NH3OH+>N2H5+>NH4+>C(NH2)(3)(+), which is contrary to the order of the basicity of bases. Stronger intramolecular interactions lead to more stable salts. All substituent groups improved the chemical stability except -ONO2, while cations had no effect on chemical stability. All substituent groups were helpful in improving aromaticity, in the sequence -ONO2>-NF2>-NO2>-N-3>-NH2.", "paper_title": "Theoretical studies on the stability of salts formed by 3-substituted 6-nitraminotetrazines with different cations", "paper_id": "WOS:000345626700010"}
