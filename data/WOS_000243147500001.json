In this article, we propose a synthesis scheme to reduce the duplication cost by allowing inverters in Domino logic under certain timing constraints for both simple and complex gates. Moreover, we can include the logic duplication minimization during technology mapping for synthesis of Domino circuits with complex gates. In order to guarantee the robustness of such Domino circuits, we perform the logic optimization as a postlayout step. Experimental results show significant reduction in duplication cost, which translates into significant improvements in area and power. As a byproduct, the timing performance is also improved owing to smaller layout area and/or logic depth.", "paper_title": "Postlayout optimization for synthesis of Domino circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000243147500001"}
