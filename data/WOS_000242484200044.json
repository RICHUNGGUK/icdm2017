Both the level and the power of the proposed test associated with the hypotheses are controllable and they are completely independent of the unknown variances. The two-stage procedure is a design-oriented procedure that satisfies certain probability requirements and simultaneously determines the required sample sizes for an experiment while the one-stage procedure is a data-analysis procedure after the data have been collected, which can supplement the two-stage procedure when the later has to end its experiment sooner than its required experimental process is completed. Tables needed for implementing these procedures are given. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
