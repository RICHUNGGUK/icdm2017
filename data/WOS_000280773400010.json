Let w be a finite word of length n with period p and where the maximal length of its unbordered factors equals k. A word is called unbordered if it possesses no nonempty proper prefix which is also a suffix of that word. Suppose k < p in w. It is known that n <= 2k - 2 if w has an unbordered prefix u of length k. We show that if n = 2k - 2, then u ends in ab(i), with two different letters a and b and i >= 1, and b(i) occurs exactly once in w. This answers a conjecture by Harju and the second author of this paper about a structural property of maximal Duval extensions. Moreover, we show here that i < k/3, which in turn leads us to the solution of a special case of a problem raised by Ehrenfeucht and Silberger in 1979.", "paper_title": "ON THE RELATION BETWEEN PERIODICITY AND UNBORDERED FACTORS OF FINITE WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280773400010"}
