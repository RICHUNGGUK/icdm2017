Of interest is how the joint distribution, and in particular the correlation, of the values users assign to components of a bundle affect its odds of success. The results offer insight and guidelines for deciding when bundling new Internet technologies or services can help improve their overall adoption. In particular, successful outcomes appear to require a minimum level of value correlation.", "paper_title": "Adoption of Bundled Services with Network Externalities and Correlated Affinities", "paper_id": "WOS:000344307600006"}
