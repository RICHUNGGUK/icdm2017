Design/methodology/approach - The design specifications are derived according to application overall requirements. Critical issues which have considerable impacts on the machine's performance, such as operation mode, rotor structure and slot/pole combination, are analyzed based on literature review. The proposed machine is optimized, and the losses and efficiency are computed, using 2-D finite element analysis (FEA). Findings - Before detailed sizing optimization, machine type selection is fully discussed. Aspects such as brushless ac (BLAC) operation mode, rpm rotor structure and combination of 12-slot/10-pole are quite suitable for EPS application. Consequently, a 12-slot/10-pole sinusoidally excited IPM machine with concentrated windings is selected, since it is convenient to obtain sinusoidal back electromotive force (back-EMF), minimum cogging torque and torque ripple, short end windings and high efficiency, as well as simple rotor assembly. The estimated excellent performance confirms that the proposed machine can be an attractive solution for EPS. Research limitations/implications - The excitation current is ideal sinusoidal, while some harmonic components are neglected. Besides, in future, the experimental test should be carried out for validation. Originality/value - A reasonable design procedure, where the motor type selection should be first addressed before detailed sizing design, is carried out. A 12-slot/10-pole sinusoidally excited IPM machine with concentrated windings is provided as a quite competitive candidate for EPS application.", "paper_title": "Design issues of an IPM motor for EPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300535100006"}
