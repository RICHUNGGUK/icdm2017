We make three contributions in this paper: 1) We formulate a deadline-driven resource allocation problem based on the cloud environment facilitated with VM resource isolation technology, and also propose a novel solution with polynomial time, which could minimize users' payment in terms of their expected deadlines. 2) By analyzing the upper bound of task execution length based on the possibly inaccurate workload prediction, we further propose an error-tolerant method to guarantee task's completion within its deadline. 3) We validate its effectiveness over a real VM-facilitated cluster environment under different levels of competition. In our experiment, by tuning algorithmic input deadline based on our derived bound, task execution length can always be limited within its deadline in the sufficient-supply situation; the mean execution length still keeps 70 percent as high as user-specified deadline under the severe competition. Under the original-deadline-based solution, about 52.5 percent of tasks are completed within 0.95-1.0 as high as their deadlines, which still conforms to the deadline-guaranteed requirement. Only 20 percent of tasks violate deadlines, yet most (17.5 percent) are still finished within 1.05 times of deadlines.", "paper_title": "Error-Tolerant Resource Allocation and Payment Minimization for Cloud System", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499900005"}
