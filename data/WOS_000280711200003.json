Statistically-founded comparisons are made between our three proposed approaches and seven conventional classifiers over seven datasets from the UCI Machine Learning database. We also make comparisons with other reported evolutionary computation techniques. On almost all the benchmark datasets, the MOGP approaches give better or identical performance to the best of the conventional methods. Of our proposed MOGP-based algorithms, we conclude that hierarchical feature extraction performs best on multi-classification problems.", "paper_title": "Domain-independent feature extraction for multi-classification using multi-objective genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000280711200003"}
