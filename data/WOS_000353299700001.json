To provide better quality of care, and value for money, billions of dollars are being spent on bettering information systems in healthcare organizations. Strategic Information System Planning (SISP) is instrumental in making informed decisions to achieve the health organizations' goals and objectives. This paper undertakes a systematic review to gain insight into existing studies on SISP in healthcare organizations. Our systematic review of papers on SISP from 1985 to 2011 examines the background and trend of research into SISP in the healthcare industry, classification of topics in SISP, as well as sets of tools and guidelines to aid practitioners and the research community alike.", "paper_title": "Strategic Information System Planning in Healthcare Organizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000353299700001"}
