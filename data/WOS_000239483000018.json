We apply two classifiers using features extracted from complementary feature subspaces learned by principal component analysis (PCA). The two classifiers employ the same classification model named a polynomial neural network (PNN). The outputs of the two classifiers are fused to make the final decision. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated in experimentals.", "paper_title": "Combining classifiers for robust face detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000018"}
