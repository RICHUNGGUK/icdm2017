In the field of secure biometric authentication, one branch is to combine the biometrics and cryptography. Among all the solutions in this branch, fuzzy commitment scheme is a pioneer and effective security primitive. In this paper, we propose a novel binary length-fixed feature generation method of fingerprint. The alignment procedure, which is thought as a difficult task in the encrypted domain, is avoided in the proposed method due to the employment of minutiae triplets. Using the generated binary feature as input and based on fuzzy commitment scheme, we construct the biometric cryptosystems by combining various of error correction codes, including BCH code, a concatenated code of BCH code and Reed-Solomon code, and LDPC code. Experiments conducted on three fingerprint databases, including one in-house and two public domain, demonstrate that the proposed binary feature generation method is effective and promising, and the biometric cryptosystem constructed by the feature outperforms most of the existing biometric cryptosystems in terms of ZeroFAR and security strength. For instance, in the whole FVC2002 DB2, a 4.58% ZeroFAR is achieved by the proposed biometric cryptosystem with the security strength 48 bits. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
