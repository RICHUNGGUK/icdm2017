To improve energy efficiency, existing air indexing schemes for data broadcast have focused on reducing tuning time only, i.e., the duration that a mobile client stays active in data accesses. On the other hand, existing broadcast scheduling schemes have aimed at reducing access latency through nonflat data broadcast to improve responsiveness only. Not much work has addressed the energy efficiency and responsiveness issues concurrently. This paper proposes an energy-efficient indexing scheme called MHash that optimizes tuning time and access latency in an integrated fashion. MHash reduces tuning time by means of hash-based indexing and enables nonflat data broadcast to reduce access latency. The design of hash function and the optimization of bandwidth allocation are investigated in depth to refine MHash. Experimental results show that, under skewed access distribution, MHash outperforms state-of-the-art air indexing schemes and achieves access latency close to optimal broadcast scheduling.", "paper_title": "An energy-efficient and access latency optimized indexing scheme for wireless data broadcast", "paper_id": "WOS:000238297300009"}
