To overcome this drawback, we propose a new general form of CG-like methods, which is attractive in that its descent and global convergence properties are always guaranteed independently of any formula and line search used, provided that an easy condition on the line search rule is fulfilled. Numerical results are given to show the efficiency of the proposed methods. A new way to generate sufficient descent directions is also introduced.", "paper_title": "New conjugate gradient-like methods for unconstrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000341011100006"}
