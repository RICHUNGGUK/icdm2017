Applied on a slit-valve failure of chemical vapor deposition equipment in one of major Taiwanese foundry companies, the proposed problem solving process successfully identified the critical key disadvantages of the problem and solved the slit-valve failure with breakthrough results. A number of solutions were generated by the integrated process which involves a number of TRIZ tools. This paper describes only the solution by the trimming process. Unlike the great majority of engineers use \"addition\" or \"substitution\" methods to resolve problems, the proposed trimming process used \"subtraction\" method to solve problem. The integrated systematic method can be used to address any process-machine related problems. The main contributions of this paper include: (1) Establishing an integrated TRIZ-based trimming process to resolve process-machine related problems capable of breakthrough problem solving and/or significant cost savings; (2) solving the slit-valve problem with 83.3% component count reduction, 95% component cost reduction, 99% operational energy reduction, and completely designed-out the original failure mode. The results have been converted into a patent pending approval. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
