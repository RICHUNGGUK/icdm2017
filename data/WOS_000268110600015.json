The boundary conditions are based on hourly measured data for the solar insolation and the sky, soil (I m below the soil surface) and outside air temperatures, plus other parameters describing the external convection and radiation. The numerical model takes into account all of the heat transfer mechanisms including the variable solar insolation, the air infiltration, the heat capacities of the thick walls and the ground and the natural convection inside the greenhouse. The temperatures were measured experimentally in an enclosed solar greenhouse with a 12 m span and 5.5 in ridge height during the winter in northern China with the south roof covered with a thin plastic film during the daytime and with a thermal blanket added at night to reduce heat losses. The large temperature variations in the greenhouse were measured and predicted for the climatic conditions in northern China during three clear days followed by a cloudy day during the winter. The simulated air and soil temperatures have the same profile as the measured temperatures with the average temperature differences between the simulated and measured air temperatures during the nighttime less than 1.0 degrees C on the clear days and no more than 1.5 degrees C during the entire cloudy day.
