However, they are based either on the mobile users' data access frequencies or on the semantic relations of the data. In this paper, we present a hybrid data broadcast scheme based both on semantic relationships and access probabilities. The broadcast scheme we propose generates a broadcast sequence according to the semantic relationships and replicates popular data items several times according to the data access probabilities. The efficiency of our broadcast scheme is shown via performance evaluations.", "paper_title": "A hybrid scheduling scheme for data broadcast over a single channel in mobile environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200031"}
