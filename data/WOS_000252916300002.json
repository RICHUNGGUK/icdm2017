Design/methodology/approach - A simple application of Faraday's law is enough to make the result plausible. Then it is shown that by an asymptotic analysis with the radius of the leads (assumed perfectly conductive) as small parameter that the current derived by the voltmeter is negligible. Findings - The rule is valid in spite of the considerable modification of the electric field that branching a voltmeter entails. Findings - The rule is valid in spite of the considerable modification of the electric field that branching a voltmeter entails. Originality/value - \"Voltage drop\", between A and B simply does not make sense. The threads of a voltmeter should carefully be placed in order to measure exactly what one has in view. This is explained by a few examples.", "paper_title": "What do voltmeters measure?", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300002"}
