However, the performance of video retrieval hasn't benefited much despite of the advances in high-level feature extraction. To make good use of high-level semantic features in video retrieval, we present a method called pointwise mutual information weighted scheme(PMIWS). The method makes a good judgment of the relevance of all the semantic features to the queries, taking the characteristics of semantic features into account. The method can also be extended for the fusion of multi-modalities. Experiment results based on TRECVID2005 corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "Using high-level semantic features in video retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500038"}
