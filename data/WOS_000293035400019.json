Trihydroxynaphthalene reductase is an enzyme of the 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin biosynthetic pathway, and it thus represents an emerging target for the development of novel fungicides and antimycotics. In the present study, we describe novel inhibitors of trihydroxynaphthalene reductase from C lunata. These inhibitors were identified by ligand-based three-dimensional similarity searching and docking to a homology-built model and by subsequent biochemical and antifungal evaluation. Discovery of competitive inhibitors with K(i) values in low micromolar and even nanomolar concentration range proves the aplicability of homology-built model of 3HNR for hit finding by virtual screening methods.", "paper_title": "Novel Inhibitors of Trihydroxynaphthalene Reductase with Antifungal Activity Identified by Ligand-Based and Structure-Based Virtual Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000293035400019"}
