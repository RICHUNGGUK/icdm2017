With the development of handheld devices and wireless technologies, interest in virtual reality is also increasing. Therefore, there is an accompanying interest in inertial sensors, which can provide such advantages as small size and low cost. Such sensors can also operate wirelessly and be used in an increasing number of interactive applications. An example related to virtual reality is the ability to move naturally through virtual environments. This is the objective of the real-walking navigation technique, for which a number of advantages have previously been reported in terms of presence, object searching, and collision, among other concerns. In this article, we address the use of foot-mounted inertial sensors to achieve real-walking navigation in a wireless virtual reality system. First, an overall description of the problem is presented. Then, specific difficulties are identified, and a corresponding technique is proposed to overcome each: tracking of foot movements; determination of the user's position; percentage estimation of the gait cycle, including oscillating movements of the head; stabilization of the velocity of the point of view; and synchronization of head and body yaw angles. Finally, a preliminary evaluation of the system is conducted in which data and comments from participants were collected.", "paper_title": "Natural Locomotion Based on Foot-Mounted Inertial Sensors in a Wireless Virtual Reality System", "paper_id": "WOS:000372889500002"}
