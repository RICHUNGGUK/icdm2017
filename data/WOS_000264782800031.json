The TRNFS is a modified model of the recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) to obtain generalization and fast convergence. The TRNFS is designed using hybridization of genetic algorithm (GA), back-propagation (BP), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), called GA_BPPSO. For the tracking control of mobile robot, two TRNFSs are designed to generate the control inputs by direct adaptive control scheme and hybrid algorithm GA_BPPSO. Through simulation results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed controller. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
