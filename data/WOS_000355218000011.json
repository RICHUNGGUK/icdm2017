The ULV circuit design challenges are discussed and a new biasing metric for ULV and ULP designs in deep-submicrometer CMOS technologies is introduced. Series inductive peaking in the feedback loop is analyzed and employed to enhance the bandwidth and noise performance of the LNA. Exploiting the new biasing metric, the design methodology, and series inductive peaking in the feedback loop, a 0.5 V, 0.75-mW broadband LNA with a current reuse scheme is implemented in a 90-nm CMOS technology. Measurement results show 12.6-dB voltage gain, 0.1-7-GHz bandwidth, 5.5-dB NF, -9-dBm IIP3, and -18-dB P1dB while occupying 0.23 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A Sub-mW, Ultra-Low-Voltage, Wideband Low-Noise Amplifier Design Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000355218000011"}
