Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and the adaptive periodical pinning intermittent control technique, some criteria are obtained for the synchronization between two general dynamical complex networks. Moreover, two typical BA scale complex networks with time-delayed Chua oscillator are chosen to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
