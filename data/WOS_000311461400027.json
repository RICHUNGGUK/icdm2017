A method has therefore been developed to help automate alert identification by mining descriptions of activating structural features directly from toxicity data sets. The method is based on jumping emerging pattern mining which is applied to a set of toxic and nontoxic compounds that are represented using atom pair descriptors. Using the resulting jumping emerging patterns, it is possible to cluster toxic compounds into groups defined by the presence of shared structural features and to arrange the clusters into hierarchies. The methodology has been tested on a number of data sets for Ames mutagenicity, oestrogenicity, and hERG channel inhibition end points. These tests have shown the method to be effective at clustering the data sets around minimal jumping-emerging structural patterns and finding descriptions of potentially activating structural features. Furthermore, the mined structural features have been shown to be related to some of the known alerts for all three tested end points.", "paper_title": "Automating Knowledge Discovery for Toxicity Prediction Using Jumping Emerging Pattern Mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000311461400027"}
