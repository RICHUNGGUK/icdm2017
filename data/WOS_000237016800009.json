Since XML data is widely used and distributed over the Internet, watermarking XML data is of great interest. In this paper, we present a new watermarking scheme to embed different fingerprints in XML data. The fingerprint can be used to trace illegal distributors. We also take into consideration that XML data usually contains categorical elements which can't tolerant much modification, our scheme attempts to reduce modifications without bringing down the robustness of the fingerprint. Modifications could be reduced by choosing different patterns to insert. The experiments show that our scheme is effective to make less distortion to the original data and the fingerprint maintains the same robustness level at the same time.", "paper_title": "A new scheme to fingerprint XML data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237016800009"}
