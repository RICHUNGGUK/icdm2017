We determine the computational complexity by proving that Shakashaka is NP-complete, and furthermore that counting the number of solutions is #P-complete. Next we formulate Shakashaka as an integer-programming (IP) problem, and show that an IP solver can solve every instance from Nikoli's website within a second.", "paper_title": "Computational Complexity and an Integer Programming Model of Shakashaka", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738600009"}
