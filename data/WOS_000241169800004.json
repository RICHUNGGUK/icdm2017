Our methodology is based on the calculation of optimised aging trajectories in a model space and aged images can be obtained through a fast, semi-automatic procedure. In addition, person-specific information about the subject at previous ages is included, allowing aging to proceed in the most appropriate direction in the model space. The theoretical basis is introduced and experimental results from our implementation are presented and discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
