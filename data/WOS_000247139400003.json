The latter may be viewed as an improvement of the class of induced divisions introduced in [1]. The continuity and constructivity of the <-divisions, as well as a number of additional properties of the >-divisions, are proved. Taking into account that the Janet division is a >-division associated with the lexicographical order, its \"antipode\"-a <-division associated with the same order-is separated in the class of the <-divisions.", "paper_title": "Involutive divisions and monomial orderings", "paper_id": "WOS:000247139400003"}
