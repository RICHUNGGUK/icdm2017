In particular, using a line search strategy, we evaluate the performance of the unilevel truncated Newton method (LSTN), a multiresolution truncated Newton (MR/LSTN) and a full multigrid truncated Newton (FMG/LSTN). We use three image sequences and four models of optical flow for performance evaluation. The FMG/LSTN algorithm is shown to lead to better optical flow estimation with less computational work than both the LSTN and MR/LSTN algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Line Search Multilevel Truncated Newton Algorithm for Computing the Optical Flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000360149400005"}
