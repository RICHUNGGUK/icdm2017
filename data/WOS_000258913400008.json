Using a new and simple approach based on Poincare-Nash inequality and on an integration by parts formula, it is rigorously established that the mutual information when properly centered and rescaled converges to a standard Gaussian random variable. Simple expressions for the centering and scaling parameters are provided. These results confirm previous evaluations based on the powerful but nonrigorous replica method. It is believed that the tools that are used in this paper are simple, robust, and of interest for the communications engineering community.", "paper_title": "A new approach for mutual information analysis of large dimensional multi-antenna channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000258913400008"}
