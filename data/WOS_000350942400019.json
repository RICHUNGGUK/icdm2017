We present a simple, yet general geometric tool for polynomial approximation, based on piecewise Hermite interpolation with C-2 quasi arc-length parameterization, a desirable property for robotics or CNC. We take the osculatory Hermite interpolation, prescribing position, tangent direction and curvature at the endpoints, and add quasi arc-length conditions, by imposing unit speed and vanishing tangential acceleration. These new conditions fit naturally into this scheme, yielding a quintic with Bezier points that turn out to display extremely simple geometry. In addition we consider a lower degree alternative to the quintic, namely a cubic B-spline. Finally, we include two examples of applications (the approximations of regular offsets and the clothoid) and compare our results with those from commercial systems or existing methods.
