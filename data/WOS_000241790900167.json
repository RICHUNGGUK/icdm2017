Due to the common complexity and huge size of spatial databases the aspect of efficiency is of the main concerns in spatial knowledge discovery algorithms. In this paper, we introduce two novel nature-inspired algorithms for efficient discovery of spatial trends, as one of the most valuable patterns in spatial databases. The algorithms are developed using ant colony optimization and evolutionary search. We empirically study and compare the efficiency of the proposed algorithms on a real banking spatial database. The experimental results clearly confirm the improvement in performance and effectiveness of the discovery process compared to the previously proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Nature-inspired approaches to mining trend patterns in spatial databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900167"}
