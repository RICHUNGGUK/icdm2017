We introduce Dynamic Positioning based on Voronoi Cells (DPVC) as a new method for players' positioning which uses Voronoi Diagram for distributing agents in the field. This method also uses Attraction Vectors that indicate agents' tendency to specific objects in the field with regard to the game situation and players' roles. Finally DPVC is compared with SBSP as the conventional method of positioning.", "paper_title": "Dynamic positioning based on voronoi cells (DPVC)", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100020"}
