Since operations in asynchronous circuits start after the completion of a previous operation, this method approximates the set of start times for each operation using the delay of the resources. Next, this method decides on control steps from the approximated sets of start times, which are used in scheduling algorithms. This paper extends two scheduling algorithms used for synchronous circuits so that the approximated sets of start times and the decided control steps are used. Finally, this paper shows the effectiveness of our proposed methods by comparing scheduling results with ones obtained by the original two scheduling algorithms.", "paper_title": "Scheduling methods for asynchronous circuits with bundled-data implementations based on the approximation of start times", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700018"}
