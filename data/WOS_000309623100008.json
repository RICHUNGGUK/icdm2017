By applying robust optimisation, we extend this model to a robust formulation which considers demand uncertainties. The computability of the resulting model is moderate. Hence, we apply three different cutting plane approaches for an improvement. Furthermore, an extensive case study is performed to examine the price of robustness, to compare the robust solution to conventional planning, and to explore the performance of the cutting planes.
