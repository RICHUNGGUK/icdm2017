The filter is based on a detection-estimation strategy. The impulse detection algorithm is used before the filtering process, and therefore only the noise-corrupted pixels are replaced with the estimated central noise-free ordered mean value in the current filter window. The new impulse detector, which uses multiple thresholds with multiple neighborhood information of the signal in the filter window, is very precise, while avoiding an undue increase in computational complexity. For impulse noise suppression without smearing fine details and edges in the image, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our scheme performs significantly better than many existing, well-accepted decision-based methods.", "paper_title": "Salt-pepper impulse noise detection and removal using multiple thresholds for image restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000234908900011"}
