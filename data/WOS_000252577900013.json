It was initially designed for software implementations in controllers, smart cards, or processors. In this letter, we investigate its performances in recent field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices. For this purpose, a loop architecture of the block cipher is presented. Beyond its low cost performances, a significant advantage of the proposed architecture is its full flexibility for any parameter of the scalable encryption algorithm, taking advantage of generic VHDL coding. The letter also carefully describes the implementation details allowing us to keep small area requirements. Finally, a comparative performance discussion of SEA with the Advanced Encryption Standard Rijndael and ICEBERG (a cipher purposed for efficient FPGA implementations) is proposed. It illustrates the interest of platform/context-oriented block cipher design and, as far as SEA is concerned, its low area requirements and reasonable efficiency.", "paper_title": "FPGA implementation(s) of a scalable encryption algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000252577900013"}
