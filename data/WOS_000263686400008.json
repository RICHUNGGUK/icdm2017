The riser topology is systematically modified to minimize the riser volume, while simultaneously ensuring that no defect appears in the product. In this approach, we combine finite-difference analysis of the solidification process with evolutionary topology optimization to systematically improve the feeding system design. The outstanding features of the presented method are: its efficiency, ease of implementation and simplifying definition of the initial design. The efficiency and capability of the presented method are supported by illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "Optimal riser design in sand casting process with evolutionary topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000263686400008"}
