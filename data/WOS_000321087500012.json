An l(1) minimization method is used to select the important features from which the LDA will be constructed. The asymptotic results of this proposed two-stage LDA (TLDA) are studied, demonstrating that TLDA is an optimal classification rule whose convergence rate is the best compared to existing methods. The experiments on simulated and real datasets are consistent with the theoretical results and show that TLDA performs favorably in comparison with current methods. Overall, TLDA uses a lower minimum number of features or genes than other approaches to achieve a better result with a reduced misclassification rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
