Feature integration theory is widely approved on the principles of the binding problem, which supplies the roadmap for our computational model. We construct the learning procedure to acquire necessary pre-knowledge for the recognition network on reasonable hypothesis-maximum entropy. With the recognition network, we bind the low-level image features with the high-level knowledge. Fundamental concepts and principles of conditional random fields are employed to model the feature binding process. We apply our model to current challenging problems, multi-label image classification and object recognition, and evaluate it on the benchmark image databases to demonstrate that our model is competitive to the state-of-the-art method.", "paper_title": "A feature binding computational model for multi-class object categorization and recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552600022"}
