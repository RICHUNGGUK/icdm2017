The target fault list includes all stuck-at, open, and pair-wise bridging faults in the mapped design. for interconnect testing, only the configuration of the used logic blocks is changed, and the structure of the design remains unchanged. For logic block testing, the configuration of used logic resources remains unchanged, while the interconnect configuration and unused logic resources are modified. Logic testing is performed in only one test configuration whereas interconnect testing is done in a logarithmic number of test configurations. This approach is able to achieve 100% fault coverage.", "paper_title": "Application-dependent testing of FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241611200009"}
