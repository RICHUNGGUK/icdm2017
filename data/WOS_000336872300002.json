Critical aircraft, spacecraft and industrial systems are required to perform robustly, reliably and safely. They must integrate hardware and software tools intended to detect and identify incipient failures and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of failing components. Furthermore, it is desirable that non-catastrophic faults be accommodated, that is fault tolerant or contingency management algorithms be developed that will safeguard the operational integrity of such assets for the duration of the emergency. It is imperative, therefore, that models and algorithms designed to achieve these objectives be verified before they are validated and implemented on-board an aircraft. This paper develops a verification approach that builds upon concepts from system analysis, specification definition, system modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations. The approach is implemented in a hierarchical structure at various levels from component to system safety. Salient features of the proposed methodology are illustrated through its application to a spacecraft propulsion system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
