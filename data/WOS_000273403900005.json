This method is an extension of the one proposed by Kijima and Matsui (Rand. Struct. Alg., 29:243-256, 2006). It is not polynomial, as it is based upon a recursion, and includes a rejection phase but can be used for practical purposes on small contingency tables as illustrated in a classical 4x4 example.", "paper_title": "Perfect sampling algorithm for small mxn contingency tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000273403900005"}
