Thus, the need arises for a formalism to specify constraints on agent interaction, and for a tool able to observe and check for agent compliance with interaction protocols. In this paper we present a JAVA-PRO-LOG software component built on logic programming technology, which can be used to verify compliance of agent interaction to protocols, and that has been integrated with the PROSOCS platform.", "paper_title": "Compliance verification of agent interaction: A logic-based software tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000236388900003"}
