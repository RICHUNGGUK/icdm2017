Due to the profound differences between whispered and neutral speech in vocal excitation and vocal tract function, the performance of automatic speaker identification systems trained with neutral speech degrades significantly. In order to better understand these differences and to further develop efficient model adaptation and feature compensation methods, this study first analyzes the speaker and phoneme dependency of these differences by a maximum likelihood transformation estimation from neutral speech towards whispered speech. Based on analysis results, this study then considers a feature transformation method in the training phase that leads to a more robust speaker model for speaker ID on whispered speech without using whispered adaptation data from test speakers. Three estimation methods that model the transformation from neutral to whispered speech are applied, including convolutional transformation (ConvTran), constrained maximum likelihood linear regression (CM LLR), and factor analysis (FA). a speech mode independent (SMI) universal background model (UBM) is trained using collected real neutral features and transformed pseudo-whisper features generated with the estimated transformation. Text-independent closed set speaker ID results using the UT-VocalEffort II corpus show performance improvement by using the proposed training framework. The best performance of 88.87% is achieved by using the ConvTran model, which represents a relative improvement of 46.26% compared to the 79.29% accuracy of the GMM-UBM baseline system. This result suggests that synthesizing pseudo-whispered speaker and background training data with the ConvTran model results in improved speaker ID robustness to whispered speech.
