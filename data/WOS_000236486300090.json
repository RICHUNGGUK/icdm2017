After a brief review of existing methods, we focus on decomposing a mixture into components made of harmonic sinusoidal partials. We address this problem in the Bayesian framework by building a probabilistic model of the mixture combining generic priors for harmonicity, spectral envelope, note duration and continuity. Experiments suggest that the derived blind decomposition method leads to better separation results than nonnegative matrix factorization for certain mixtures.", "paper_title": "Single-channel mixture decomposition using Bayesian harmonic models", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300090"}
