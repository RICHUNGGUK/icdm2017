However, these defensive technologies are implemented independently without cooperation among various network domains. In this paper, different administrative networks are leagued to form a federative network environment called a trusted domain. From the perspective of a network manager, there is a need to integrate diverse technologies into an effective defensive system among mutually trusted domains. An imperative task for security management is to put in place a shared defensive mechanism, or protective shield, for multiple domains. A cooperative approach to provide such a shared defensive system is presented with integration of both intra-domain and inter-domain defensive mechanisms. The simulation results show that, through sharing the defensive information, the firewall system can successfully detect and filter the repeated intrusions.
