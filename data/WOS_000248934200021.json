Comparing with the existing recursive DFF/IDFI' architectures, the proposed recursive architecture achieves a reduction in computation-cycle by half. Appling this novel low-computation cycle architecture, we could double the throughput rate and the channel density without increasing the operating frequency for the dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) detector in the high channel density voice over packet (VoP) application. From the chip implementation results, the proposed architecture is capable of processing over 128 channels and each channel consumes 9.77 mu W under 1.2 V@20MHz in TSMC 0.13 IP8M CMOS process. The proposed VLSI implementation shows the power-efficient advantage by the low-computation cycle architecture.", "paper_title": "VLSI architecture for the low-computation cycle and power-efficient recursive DFT/IDFT design", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934200021"}
