Nowadays there exist different dialogue systems with general architecture supporting different applications. Yet there is no efficient way to endow the multi-application supported dialogue systems with the corresponding applications. The approach represented in this paper provides an efficient way to integrate different applications into one dialogue system and addresses three issues. in multi-application dialogue systems - transparent application switching, task sharing and information sharing by merging the dialogue specifications of different applications into a unified dialogue specification as automatically as possible, which provides necessary domain information for a multi-application supported dialogue system.", "paper_title": "Combining speech user interfaces of different applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239591200009"}
