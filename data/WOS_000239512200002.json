MPI is one of the most used message passing libraries in HPC applications. These two trends raise the need for fault-tolerant MPI. The MPICH-V project focuses on designing, implementing and comparing several automatic fault-tolerant protocols for MPI applications. We present an extensive related work section highlighting the originality of our approach and the proposed protocols. We then present four fault-tolerant protocols implemented in a new generic framework for fault-tolerant protocol comparison, covering a large spectrum of known approaches from coordinated checkpoint, to uncoordinated checkpoint associated with causal message logging. We measure the performance of these protocols on a micro-benchmark and compare them with the NAS benchmark, using an original fault tolerance test. Finally, we outline the lessons learned from this in depth fault-tolerant protocol comparison of MPI applications.", "paper_title": "MPICH-V project: A multiprotocol automatic fault-tolerant MPI", "paper_id": "WOS:000239512200002"}
