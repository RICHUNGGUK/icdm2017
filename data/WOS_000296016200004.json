The proposed depth-based blurring is a prefiltering that reduces high-frequency components by mimicking the limited depth of field effect that occurs in cameras. To cope with the challenge of avoiding intensity leakage at the boundaries of objects when blurring at different depth levels, we introduce a selective blurring algorithm that simulates occlusion effects as occur in natural blurring. The proposed algorithm can handle any number of blurring and occlusion levels. Subjective experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms foveation filtering, which is the dominant approach for bitrate reduction by space-variant prefiltering.", "paper_title": "Image Coding Using Depth Blurring for Aesthetically Acceptable Distortion", "paper_id": "WOS:000296016200004"}
