Unlike the conventional brakes, an MRB employs the interaction between a magnetorheological fluid and an applied magnetic field to generate the retarding braking torque. The SEUMRE design optimization algorithm was used to maximize the braking torque and minimize the weight of the brake structure. The computation time and optimized design parameters illustrated SEUMRE's capability to converge to an accurate result faster than the conventional global optimization methods. However, SA provided significantly better optimization results than GA and SEUMRE in terms of the cost function.", "paper_title": "Application of SEUMRE global optimization algorithm in automotive magnetorheological brake design", "paper_id": "WOS:000297595300003"}
