Such justifications and assumptions are represented and dealt with in the framework of credibility theory. Important concepts in ATMS such as environments, labels, logical consequences, and consistency are redefined by the use of credibility measure. Based on these concepts, the label-updating procedure of the classical ATMS is extended, allowing effective computation of the membership function of any node within the network and that of its supporting environment. In addition, the contradictory environments can be captured with respect to their inconsistency degrees. This paper is compared to the most relevant existing research (i.e., ATMS using necessity as the truth value and ATMS using possibility as the truth value), demonstrating the significant improvements made. This paper also presents an illustrative application of credibilistic ATMS in supporting automated construction of domain models.", "paper_title": "A Credibilistic Approach to Assumption-Based Truth Maintenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000284095400008"}
