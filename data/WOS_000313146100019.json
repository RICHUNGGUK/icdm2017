A novel modulation technique that allows employing only all-digital components in the transceiver is used. The front-end uses all-digital sub-sampling for carrier demodulation, which does not need synchronization circuitry. Burst-errors generated by the front-end are corrected in baseband using hamming code and interleaving techniques. Experimentally, the all-digital transceiver was tested on FP-GAs that performed successful wireless communication at range/diameter equal to 1, which is higher than recent NFC research. Our transceiver uses only all-digital components, and consumes less area compared to other research.", "paper_title": "All-Digital Wireless Transceiver with Sub-Sampling Demodulation and Burst-Error Correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100019"}
