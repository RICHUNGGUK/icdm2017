Because spatial structure is costly to measure, a number of approaches for simulating spatial structures have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a simple approach that is capable of generating multispecies stand structures. Based on the method of copulas (Genest and MacKay, 1986, Am. Stat. 40:280-283), we utilize a normal copula to simulate spatially correlated stand structures. Species composition, diameter, height, and crown ratio distributions of each species, and their correlation with underlying spatial patterns are all controlled by user inputs. Example data sets are used to demonstrate how to estimate required parameters and compare simulated spatial structures with observed spatial structures. Except at the smallest scales (<10 m in the longleaf pine dataset and <2 m in the mixed Acadian Forest dataset), the simulated stand structures adequately captured the observed spatial patterns. Based on these comparisons, we conclude that the system is capable of simulating a range of forest stand spatial structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
