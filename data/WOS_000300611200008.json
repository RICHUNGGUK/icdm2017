The approach proposed here combines the results obtained by different remote sensing images (satellite and airborne photos) with the data derived from historical cartography and recent field surveys. The traces are mapped and organised in two vector databases organised in linear or polygonal features consistent with fluvial elements (e.g. palaeo-channels, abandoned streams, etc.) and marshy/swamp areas, respectively. This database represents a useful starting point that can be implemented by further more detailed studies aimed to better understand the evolution of the landscape and the possible relationship with the story of the archaeological site of Luna about which many questions are still unresolved.", "paper_title": "A multidisciplinary approach to reveal palaeo-hydrographic features: the case study of Luna archaeological site surroundings", "paper_id": "WOS:000300611200008"}
