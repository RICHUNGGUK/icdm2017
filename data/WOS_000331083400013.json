A method of detecting scenes wanted by a user through scene rearrangement based on calculated visual similarity is limited in that such a method does not reflect elements along the storyline through which a user remembers a movie. A movie's story is built up by characters, and such build-up is closely related with emotions of characters in a film. A movie browsing system based on storyline is executable by applying characters and those characters' emotions. Thus, methods of extracting key characters in each scene and of clustering scenes through extraction of emotion vectors from dialogues in each scene are hereby suggested. This paper also proposes to develop a movie browsing method and a system based on emotions of characters.", "paper_title": "Movie browsing system based on character and emotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000331083400013"}
