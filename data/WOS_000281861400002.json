The published method and code has been used even since by numerous researchers to advance the field of topology optimization. Inspired by the above paper, we demonstrate here that, by exploiting the notion of topological-sensitivity (an alternate to SIMP), one can generate Pareto-optimal topologies in about twice the number of lines of Matlab code. In other words, optimal topologies for various volume fractions can be generated in a highly efficient manner, by directly tracing the Pareto-optimal curve.", "paper_title": "A 199-line Matlab code for Pareto-optimal tracing in topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000281861400002"}
