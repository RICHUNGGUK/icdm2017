We introduce a new Lagrange-projection scheme based on a random sampling technique introduced by Chalons and Goatin (2007) [7]. We compare it to a ghost fluid approach introduced in Wang et al. (2006), Muller et al. (2009) [25,20] which is based on the ghost fluid method for the poor (Abgrall and Karni, 2001) [2]. Despite the non-conservative feature of the schemes, we observe the numerical convergence towards the relevant weak solution for shock-contact interaction test cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
