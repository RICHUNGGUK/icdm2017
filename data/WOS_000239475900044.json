Motivated by verification problems that involve arithmetical constraints, we show results on the intersection of such generalized sets with semi-linear sets, singling out cases where the non-emptiness of intersection is decidable. Starting from these initial results, we list some problems on solvability of arithmetical constraints beyond the semi-linear ones.", "paper_title": "On intersection problems for polynomially generated sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900044"}
