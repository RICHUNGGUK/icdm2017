The total variation (TV) regularization approach can effectively recover edges of image. In this paper, we propose a new TV blind deconvolution algorithm by employing split Bregman iteration (called as TV-BDSB). Considering the operator splitting and penalty techniques, we present also a new splitting objective function. Then, we propose an extended split Bregman iteration to address the minimizing problems, the latent image and the blur kernel are estimated alternately. The TV-BDSB algorithm can greatly reduce the computational cost and improve remarkably the image quality. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-life degradations. Comparisons are also made with some existing blind deconvolution methods. Experimental results indicate the advantages of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
