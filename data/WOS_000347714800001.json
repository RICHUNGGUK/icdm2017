It turns out that allowing two-way interaction with the prover does not change the class of verifiable languages, and that no polynomially bounded amount of randomness is useful for constant-memory computers when used as language recognizers, or public-coin verifiers. A corollary of our main result is that the class of outcome problems corresponding to O(log n)-space bounded games of incomplete information where the universal player is allowed a constant number of moves equals NL.", "paper_title": "FINITE STATE VERIFIERS WITH CONSTANT RANDOMNESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714800001"}
