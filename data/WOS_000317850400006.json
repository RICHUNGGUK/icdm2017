However, there seems to be a gap when it comes to verifying the efficiency of tools for understanding past decisions. In this paper, we show that the ability to perform decision reconstruction using a Group Support System (GSS) can provide a flexible solution to the problem, but only if the information model underlying it is able to provide bidirectional support to the phases of a decision-making process. For this, we present a general information model to support the decision-making process, as well as the decision reconstruction process. We tested these ideas by setting up a case study where we used a GSS, based on our model, to analyze a simulated public contracting process. We present a discussion of the results.", "paper_title": "A DECISION RECONSTRUCTION SUPPORT MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000317850400006"}
