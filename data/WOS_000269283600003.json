Yet, only few of them attract public attention and become successful. This study explores weblog success factors in three categories: content creation, content features and content diffusion. During the process of content creation in weblogs, we argue that weblog service providers (WSPs) support bloggers' resource collection. We also presume that the volume or the quality of posts in weblogs could be matter to gain visitors' attention when weblog content (i.e., post) is generated. During the process of content diffusion, we assume that use of blogging technologies (BTs) such as trackback or RSS would enhance content-sharing activities between weblogs. Based on the data from a sample of Korean individual weblogs, our analysis indicates that weblog success (in terms of the number of unique visitors per week) is related to the WSP's support level for content creation as well as content features.", "paper_title": "Modelling Weblog Success: Case of Korea", "paper_id": "WOS:000269283600003"}
