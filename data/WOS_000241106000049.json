Firstly, U/C is calculated for reducing the complexity of the reduction. Then, difference and similitude sets, of the reduced information system, are calculated. The last, the attributes are selected according to their abilities for giving high accurate rules. The time complexity of the reduction, including attributes reduction and rules induction, is O(vertical bar C vertical bar(2)vertical bar U/C vertical bar(2)).", "paper_title": "Difference similitude method in knowledge reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000049"}
