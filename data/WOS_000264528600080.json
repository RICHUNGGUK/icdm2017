Four feature vectors are extracted from power spectra of machine vibration signals. The extracted features are inputs of an CSP-based classifier for fault identification and classification. In this paper, the proposed CSP-based machine fault diagnostic system has been intensively tested with unbalanced electrical faults and mechanical faults operating at different rotating speeds. The proposed system is not only able to detect electrical and mechanical faults correctly, but the rules generated is also very simple and compact and is easy for people to understand, This will be proved to be extremely useful for practical industrial applications.
