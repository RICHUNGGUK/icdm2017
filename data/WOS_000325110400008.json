The distributed key revocation protocol presented by Chan et al. has a rapid reaction time and avoids the single-point failure problem inherent in centralized schemes. However, the scheme is computationally complex, requires a large storage space, and incurs high communication overheads. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel distributed, scalable, and cost-effective key revocation scheme based on Blom's t-secure property. In the proposed approach, any node identified as having a malicious behavior by t or more sensor nodes is categorized as a compromised node, and its keys are immediately revoked from the entire network. The proposed scheme not only satisfies the rigorous definition of a distributed key revocation protocol but also yields a significant improvement over Chan's revocation scheme in terms of a lower storage space requirement, a reduced communication overhead, and a lower computational cost.
