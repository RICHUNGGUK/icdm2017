In this paper, the potential of an object-oriented simulation environment for surface water quality management, based on the concepts of system dynamics (00-SD),. is discussed. The characteristics, along with a brief explanation, of the 00-SD approach are provided. A case study on the use of the 00-SD modeling approach for surface water quality management in southeastern Kentucky, USA, is described to highlight key features of the approach. In a later section, advantages and present shortcomings of the 00-SD approach to model hydrologic systems are discussed. The potential use of the proposed approach, especially in data-poor conditions, and the challenges that lie ahead of hydrologists to fully exploit such a modeling approach are identified.
