Rowling's fantasy series Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban [46], can be used as a surveillance tool to show all moving objects within the boundary of \" Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\" at a spell. In this paper, we introduce a similar forensic surveillance tool for wireless networks. Our system, the digital Marauder's map, can reveal the locations of WiFi-enabled mobile devices within the coverage area of a high-gain antenna. The digital Marauder's map is built solely with off-the-shelf wireless equipments, and features a mobile design that can be quickly deployed to a new location for instant usage without training. We present a comprehensive set of theoretical analysis and experimental results which demonstrate the coverage and localization accuracy of the digital Marauder's map.", "paper_title": "The Digital Marauder's Map: A WiFi Forensic Positioning Tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000299294400003"}
