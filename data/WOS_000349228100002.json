The return interval describes the waiting time between two successive price volatilities which are above some threshold, the present work is an attempt to quantify the level of multifractal detrended cross-correlation for the return intervals. Further, the concept of MF-DCCA coefficient of return intervals is introduced, and the corresponding empirical research is performed. The empirical results show that the return intervals of SSE and SZSE are weakly positive multifractal power-law cross-correlated, and exhibit the fluctuation patterns of MF-DCCA coefficients. The similar behaviors of return intervals for the price model is also demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Statistical analysis on multifractal detrended cross-correlation coefficient for return interval by oriented percolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000349228100002"}
