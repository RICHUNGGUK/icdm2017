First, the characteristic of the chroma interpolation is analyzed to obtain an optimized decomposition scheme, with which the chroma interpolation can be realized with arithmetic elements (AEs) which are comprised of only adders. Four types of AEs are developed and a pipelining hardware design is proposed to conduct the chroma interpolation with great hardware reuse. The proposed design was prototyped within a Xilinx Virtex6 XC6VLX240T FPGA with a clock frequency as high as 245 MHz. The proposed design was also synthesized with SMIC 130nm CMOS technology with a clock frequency of 200 MHz, which could support a real-time HDTV application with less hardware cost and lower power consumption.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL DECOMPOSITION APPROACH AND VLSI IMPLEMENTATION OF CHROMA INTERPOLATOR FOR H.264 ENCODERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209245200007"}
