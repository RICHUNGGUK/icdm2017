The emerging convergence of grid and peer-to-peer (P2P) computing technologies further opens new opportunities for enabling P2P Desktop Grid systems. This paper presents a taxonomy for classifying P2P desktop grid implementation paradigms, aiming to summarize the state-of-the-art technologies and explore the current and potential solution space. To have a comprehensive taxonomy for P2P desktop grid paradigms, we investigate both computational and data grid systems. Moreover, to ease the understanding, the taxonomy is applied to selected case studies of P2P desktop grid systems. The taxonomy is expected to be used as a survey of the state-of-the-art, a design map, a guideline for novice researchers, a common vocabulary, or a design space for simulation and benchmark, and to be extended as the technologies rapidly evolve.", "paper_title": "A taxonomy of peer-to-peer desktop grid paradigms", "paper_id": "WOS:000290314300003"}
