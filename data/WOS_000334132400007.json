In this paper, we introduce and investigate a new class of SN P systems, with spiking rules placed on synapses. The computational completeness is first proved, then two small universal SN P systems with rules on synapses for computing functions are constructed. Specifically, when using standard spiking rules, we obtain a universal system with 39 neurons, while when using extended spiking rules on synapses, a universal SN P system with 30 neurons is constructed.
