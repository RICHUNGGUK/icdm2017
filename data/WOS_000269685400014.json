In this paper, a novel training algorithm based on evolutionary programming (EP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for evolutionary diagonal recurrent neural network (EDRNN) is proposed. Mean-while, a new select mode is given for improving the premature convergence for PSO. Compared with conventional methods, EDRNN has prominent advantage in identifying nonlinear dynamic systems because the structure and weight of EDRNN can be evolved simultaneously. Experimental results of identifying the classical nonlinear dynamic systems confirm that EDRNN-based method is a promising tool for identifier.", "paper_title": "EVOLUTIONARY DIAGONAL RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WITH IMPROVED HYBRID EP-PSO ALGORITHM AND ITS IDENTIFICATION APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400014"}
