Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) is an effective tool for evaluating and ranking problems involving multiple criteria. In order to select suitable parting curve, several criteria need to be taken into account. Therefore, this paper proposes an extension of fuzzy MCDM approach to solve parting curve selection problem. In the proposed model, the ratings of alternatives and importance weights of criteria for parting curve selection are expressed in linguistic terms. The membership functions of the final fuzzy evaluation value in the proposed model are developed based on the linguistic expressions. To make the procedure easier and more practical, the normalized weighted ratings are defuzzified into crisp values by using a new maximizing set and minimizing set ranking approach to determine the ranking order of alternatives. An example of parting curve evaluation and selection is given. The results show that the proposed approach is very effective in selecting the optimal parting curve for the molded part. Finally, this paper compares the proposed approach with another fuzzy MCDM approach to demonstrate its advantages and applicability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
