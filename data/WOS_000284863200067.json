To overcome the disadvantage, the relation between Gaussian noise model and loss function of SVRM is studied. And then, a new loss function is proposed to penalize the Gaussian noise in this paper. Based on the proposed loss function, a new nu-SVRM, which is called g-SVRM, is put forward to deal with training set. To seek the optimal parameters of g-SVRM, an improved particle swarm optimization is also proposed. The results of application in car sale forecasts show that the forecasting approach based on the g-SVRM model is effective and feasible, the comparison between the method proposed in this paper and other ones is also given, which proves this method is better than nu-SVRM and other traditional methods.
