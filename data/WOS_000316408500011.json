However, the performance issues that arise in this language due to the irregular structure of sparse matrix operations have not yet been studied. Among them, the selection of an adequate storage format for the sparse matrices can significantly improve the efficiency of the parallel codes. This paper presents an evaluation, using UPC, of the most common sparse storage formats with different implementations of the matrix-vector and matrix-matrix products, which are key kernels in many scientific applications.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of sparse matrix products in UPC", "paper_id": "WOS:000316408500011"}
