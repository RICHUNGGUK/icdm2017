A good preconditioner in the Krylov subspace method is crucial for the efficiency of the solver. In this paper we consider a point-block Gauss-Seidel method as preconditioner. We describe and compare renumbering strategies that aim at improving the quality of this preconditioner. A variant of reordering methods known from multigrid for convection-dominated elliptic problems is introduced. This reordering algorithm is essentially black-box and significantly improves the robustness and efficiency of the point-block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner. Results of numerical experiments using the QUADFLOW solver and the PETSc library are given.
