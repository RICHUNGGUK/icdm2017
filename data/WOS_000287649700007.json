By using a novel Markovian switched Lyapunov functional, a delay-dependent bounded real lemma (BRL) is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Based on the derived BRL, both normal H-infinity filters and non-fragile H-infinity filters are designed, which guarantee that the corresponding filtering error systems are stochastically stable with a specified H-infinity performance level. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy H-infinity filtering for nonlinear Markovian jump neutral systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000287649700007"}
