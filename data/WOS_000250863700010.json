The model is not linear and it is common to perform a small signal linearization about an operating point and design a linear controller. Models obtained with such method involve considerable approximation and produce results that are limited for high performance controller designs. In this paper a piecewise a. ne approximation technique is introduced for modeling PWM converters. This model is much more precise in predicting the dynamic response of averaged nonlinear model comparing the linear model. This paper also presents a piecewise linear controller synthesis method for PWM converters described by the proposed PWA model. The proposed controller is very efficient and effective. The design method is well suited for converters having a wide range of variation about their operating point. A simulation example on buck-boost converter is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for modeling the dynamics of the converter and designing the appropriate controller.", "paper_title": "Piecewise affine system modeling and control of PWM converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000250863700010"}
