The representation is invariant with respect to the sensory modalities involved. Acquisition of the internal representation is demonstrated with a neural network model of a sensorimotor system of a simple model creature, consisting of a tactile-sensitive body and a multiple-degrees-of-freedom arm with proprioceptive sensitivity. Acquisition of the 3D representation as well as a distributed representation of the body scheme, occurs through sensorimotor interactions (i.e., the sensory-motor experience of the creature). Convergence of the learning is demonstrated through computer simulations for the model creature with a 7-DoF arm and a spherical body covered by 20 tactile fields.", "paper_title": "A Neural Network Model for the Acquisition of a Spatial Body Scheme Through Sensorimotor Interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000290897100007"}
