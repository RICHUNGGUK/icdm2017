The former has a strong effect on the intensity, the energy range of the beating and the number of groups, and the latter modulates the total group numbers of the oscillation structures. The single-particle and collective excitations are simultaneously presented in the magnetoreflectance spectra and can be precisely distinguished. For the loss function and reflectance, the beating pattern of the first group displays stronger intensities and broader energy range than other groups. Simple hexagonal graphite possesses unique magneto-optical characteristics that can serve to identify other bulk graphites. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
