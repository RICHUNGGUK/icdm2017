Common-plane (CP) algorithm is one of the more effective methods for contact detection when dealing with three-dimensional polyhedral or two-dimensional polygonal blocks. in this paper, fast common plane (FCP) identification algorithm proposed by Nezami is extended to a general case for all contact types and the proof of the algorithm is also provided. FCP approach recognizes that a common plane has identifying characteristics, which dramatically reduce the search space for the common plane. In two-dimensions, the CP is found by checking only five possible candidate lines. In three-dimensions, the candidate planes fall within four types related to the geometry of the blocks and their relative positions. The efficiency for CP identification is improved greatly and the veracity can be guaranteed. Numerical experiments reveal the efficiency of the extended FCP algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
