In this note, we analyze the notion of maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs) through the prism of the curvature scale space, and conclude that in its original definition, MSER prefers regular (round) regions. Arguing that interesting features in natural images usually have irregular shapes, we propose alternative definitions of MSER which are free of this bias, yet maintain their invariance properties.", "paper_title": "Are MSER Features Really Interesting?", "paper_id": "WOS:000294910000015"}
