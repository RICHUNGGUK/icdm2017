[R. Zhang, P.-S. Tsai, J.E. Cryer, M. Shah, Shape from shading: a survey, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 21 (8) (1999) 690-706]. In this new survey paper, we try to update their presentation including some recent methods which seem to be particularly representative of three classes of methods: methods based on partial differential equations, methods using optimization and methods approximating the image irradiance equation. One of the goals of this paper is to set the comparison of these methods on a firm basis. To this end, we provide a brief description of each method, highlighting its basic assumptions and mathematical properties. Moreover, we propose some numerical benchmarks in order to compare the methods in terms of their efficiency and accuracy in the reconstruction of surfaces corresponding to synthetic, as well as to real images.
