We present a model that addresses the energy technologies that may continue to be used and new clean energy technologies that should be introduced in energy generation. The approach involves a Stochastic Mixed-Integer Program (SMIP) that minimizes cost and emission levels associated with energy generation while meeting energy demands of a given region. The results provide encouraging outcomes with respect to cost, emission levels, and energy-technologies that should be utilized for future generation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
