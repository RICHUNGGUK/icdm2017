The camera is subjected to vibration as the vehicle moves so that the videos captured require stabilisation to facilitate accurate interpretation by remote operators. Dedicated architectures for video stabilisation that offer high performance while consuming low area and power are desirable for this application. This study presents a pipelined very large-scale integration architecture. It is based on exploiting the separability property of the two-dimensional (2-D) Sobel matrix and the 2-D Gaussian filtering matrix to obtain an efficient corner point detection architecture. It also employs the coordinate rotation digital computer architecture for global motion vector calculation. The proposed architecture has been coded in Verilog and synthesised for a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which offers massive parallelism at fairly low power. The proposed architecture is shown to be highly area efficient. An FPGA-based autonomous vehicle has been fabricated, and experiments with a camera mounted on the vehicle are presented and analysed.", "paper_title": "Very large-scale integration architecture for video stabilisation and implementation on a field programmable gate array-based autonomous vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000359605600012"}
