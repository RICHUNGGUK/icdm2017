The local oscillator (LO) frequency is 2.1 GHz with an input power of 5 dBm, whereas IF frequency is 300 MHz. Multiple gated transistors (MGTRs) method is used to increase the linearity of Gilbert cell mixer. In this method an auxiliary transistor is used parallel to the transconductance stage transistor. This increases linearity by decreasing of transconductance stage transistor. The simulation results show an HP3 improvement of 16.55 dBm. The proposed low power and highly linear mixer consumes a power of 4.46 mW from 1.8 V a supply voltage. The noise figure (NF) and gain conversion are about 13.8 dB and 9.11 dB, respectively.", "paper_title": "A Low Voltage, Low Power and Highly Linear CMOS Down-Conversion Gilbert Cell Mixer Using MGTR Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000356446200005"}
