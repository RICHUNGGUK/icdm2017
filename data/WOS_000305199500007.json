Based on maximum principle and minimum principle. FSI methods for FMP and FMT are respectively introduced. Then, the continuity properties of FSI methods determined by several fuzzy similarity measures are discussed. It is proved that under certain conditions, FSI method is uniform continuous in uniform metric.", "paper_title": "Continuity of Fuzzy Similarity Inference Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000305199500007"}
