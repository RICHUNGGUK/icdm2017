Consistent with prior research in this area, we use a computational simulation model to study four IT-enabled learning mechanisms: internal electronic communication networks, external communication networks, company knowledge repositories and portals, and interorganizational knowledge repositories and portals. We also explore the interactions between a firm's internal and external learning strategies and these learning mechanisms under three different scenarios of partner size symmetry.
