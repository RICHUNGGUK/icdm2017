They are obtained by using the solution for the three forces problem in Michell truss theory and the compatibility condition at the elastic support. The developed solutions are in good agreement with numerical solutions from Sokol's 99 line code for the optimization of discretized Michell truss with the support force in analytic solution. Besides, optimality criteria and a numerical example for minimum compliance design of elastically supported truss are discussed; both of them show the minimum compliance designs of elastically supported truss subject to proper material volume constraint are also a Michell truss and in good agreement with our analytic solutions.", "paper_title": "Analytic solutions of elastically supported Michell trusses", "paper_id": "WOS:000335509900012"}
