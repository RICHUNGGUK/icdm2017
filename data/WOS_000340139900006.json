However, the strength of the composite likelihood approach is dimmed when considering hypothesis testing about a multidimensional parameter because the finite sample behavior of likelihood ratio, Wald, and score-type test statistics is tied to the Godambe information matrix. Consequently, inaccurate estimates of the Godambe information translate in inaccurate p-values. The approach based on a fully nonparametric saddlepoint test statistic derived from the composite score functions is shown to achieve accurate inference. The proposed statistic is asymptotically chi-squared distributed up to a relative error of second order and does not depend on the Godambe information. The validity of the method is demonstrated through simulation studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
