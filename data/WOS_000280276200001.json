The depth of our network is Theta(lg(2) w), which depends only on w. In contrast, the amortized contention of the network depends on the number of concurrent processes n and the parameters w and t. This offers more flexibility than all previously known networks, with the same number in of input and output wires, whose contention depends only on two parameters, w and n. In case n > w lg w, by choosing t > w lg w the contention of our network is O(n lg w/w), which improves by a logarithmic factor of in over all previously known networks with w wires.
