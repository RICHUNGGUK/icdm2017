Hard-coded FSMs do not allow changes after the ASIC production. While an embedded FPGA IP core provides flexibility, it is a complex circuit, requires difficult synthesis tools, and is expensive. This article presents and evaluates a novel architecture that is specifically optimized for implementing reconfigurable finite state machines: Transition-based Reconfigurable FSM (TR-FSM). The architecture shows a considerable reduction in area, delay, and power consumption compared to FPGA architectures with a (nearly) FPGA-like reconfigurability.", "paper_title": "TR-FSM: Transition-Based Reconfigurable Finite State Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000299337400003"}
