Previous numerical investigations have shown that specific architectures based on suppression or max units can successfully learn static or dynamic stimuli (situations). Here we provide a theoretical basis concerning the learning process convergence and the network response to a novel stimulus. We show that, besides learning \"simple\" static situations, a nD network can learn and replicate a sequence of up to n different vectors or frames. We find limits on the learning rate and show coupling matrices developing during training in different cases including expansion of the network into the case of nonlinear interunit coupling. Furthermore, we show that a specific coupling matrix provides low-pass-filter properties to the units, thus connecting networks constructed by static summation units with continuous-time networks. We also show under which conditions such networks can be used to perform arithmetic calculations by means of pattern completion.", "paper_title": "Elements for a general memory structure: properties of recurrent neural networks used to form situation models", "paper_id": "WOS:000255090000002"}
