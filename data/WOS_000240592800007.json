In this paper, we present a related-key rectangle attack on 42-round SHACAL-2, which requires 2(243.38) related-key chosen plaintexts and has a running time of 2(488.37). This is the best currently known attack on SHACAL-2.", "paper_title": "Related-key rectangle attack on 42-round SHACAL-2", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800007"}
