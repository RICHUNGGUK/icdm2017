The significant feature of the C-posture is that the body's center of mass is located behind the hip joint. In this study, we investigate the C-posture mechanism and assess the relationship between posture and stability, the aim being to restore standing function. We first measured the standing postures of paraplegic subjects wearing an orthosis. The subjects maintained the standing posture for 30 s. Next, assuming the C-posture to be an equilibrium attractor in the musculoskeletal system, we used a dynamic model of the musculoskeletal system to analyze the relationship between posture and stability, and also to assess the influence of ankle stiffness. We calculated the standing posture on the basis of a return map. The calculated standing postures show some features of the C-posture. The stability analysis revealed that, despite a limitation in the range of stable postures, the C-posture is more stable than the postures of normal people. The results suggest that although the C-posture is an appropriate posture for paraplegic standing, sufficient ankle stiffness and an appropriate alignment of ankle angle are necessary and preventing hip flexion movements is desirable.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of paraplegic standing while wearing an orthosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241164900008"}
