Fundamentals and numerical algorithms for the synthesized method are described. Case studies demonstrate that coupling of nonlinearity and randomness will greatly change the response characteristics of the structure. The popular viewpoint that randomness of structural parameters is trivial compared to that of excitations is overthrown Besides, whether localization or dispersion of nonlinearity will occur in the structure depends mainly on the configuration of the structural parameters.
