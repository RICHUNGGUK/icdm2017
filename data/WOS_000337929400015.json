This paper documents APFEL, a new PDF evolution package that allows for the first time to perform DGLAP evolution up to NNLO in QCD and to LO in QED, in the variable-flavor-number scheme and with either pole or (MS) over bar heavy quark masses. APFEL consistently accounts for the QED corrections to the evolution of quark and gluon PDFs and for the contribution from the photon PDF in the proton. The coupled QCD circle times QED equations are solved in x-space by means of higher order interpolation, followed by Runge-Kutta solution of the resulting discretized evolution equations. APFEL is based on an innovative and flexible methodology for the sequential solution of the QCD and QED evolution equations and their combination. In addition to PDF evolution, APFEL provides a module that computes Deep-Inelastic Scattering structure functions in the FONLL general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme up to 0 (alpha(2)(s)). All the functionalities of APFEL can be accessed via a Graphical User Interface, supplemented with a variety of plotting tools for PDFs, parton luminosities and structure functions. Written in FORTRAN 77, APFEL can also be used via the C/C++ and Python interfaces, and is publicly available from the HepForge repository.

Computer: All. Operating system: All. RAM: <= 2 MB Classification: 11.6. External routines: LHAPDF Nature of problem: Solution of the unpolarized coupled DGLAP evolution equations up to NNLO in QCD and to LO in QED in the variable-flavor-number scheme, both with pole and with MSbar masses. Solution method: Representation of parton distributions and splitting functions on a grid in x, discretization of DGLAP evolution equations and higher-order interpolation for general values of x, numerical solution of the resulting discretized evolution equations using Runge-Kutta methods.
