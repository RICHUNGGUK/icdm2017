Transpositions over permutations, the sequences with no repeated symbols, are related to genome rearrangements. If one of the substrings is restricted to a prefix then it is called a prefix transposition. The prefix transposition distance between a pair of strings (permutations) is the minimum number of prefix transpositions required to transform a given string (permutation) into another given string (permutation). For a permutation of length n, we improve the current prefix transposition distance upper bound of n - log(8) n to n - log(9/2) n. For arbitrary strings, we prove new prefix transposition distance upper and lower bounds. For binary strings of length n, we show that n/2 is an upper bound. We show that the prefix transposition distance problem is NP-complete for binary strings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
