It is called the fine two-phase routing (F-TPR) scheme. F-TPR more finely distributes traffic from a source node to intermediate nodes than the original TPR. F-TPR determines the distribution ratios to intermediate nodes for each source-destination node pair independently. To determine an optimum set of distribution ratios, a linear programming (LP) formulation is derived. We compare the F-TPR scheme against the TPR scheme and the sophisticated traffic engineering (TE) scheme of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE). Numerical results show that F-TPR greatly reduces the network congestion ratio compared to TPR. In addition, F-TPR provides almost the same network congestion ratios as MPLS-TE, the difference is surprisingly less than 0.1% for the various network topologies examined. In addition, considering the practical implementation of F-TPR for routers, we also investigate the case that traffic from a source node to a destination node is not allowed to be split over multiple routes. The non-split problem is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. As it is difficult to solve the ILP problem within practical time, two heuristic algorithms are presented: Largest Traffic Demand First (LTDF) and a Random Selection (RS). The applicability of LTDF and RS are presented in terms of network size. We find that non-split F-TPR also matches the routing performance of MPLS-TE within an error of 1%, when network size is large enough. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
