This is partly due to the strong reliance of such systems on constraints, but also to the lack of speed of current constraint solvers. In this paper, an approach to the optimization of geometric constraint solving for direct manipulation of feature dimensions, orientation, and position is described. Details are provided on how this approach was successfully implemented in the SPIFF feature modeling system.", "paper_title": "Constraint solving for direct manipulation of features", "paper_id": "WOS:000242111300006"}
