We also present a method for one-step realization of a nontrivial unitary transformation u which can transform a standard W state into a fully separable state. The u operation plays a key role in recently proposed quantum-information processing tasks. Both the schemes are robust against decoherence. In addition, they can endure the error of controlling the interaction time between atoms and cavity. Our ideas can also be generalized to other systems.", "paper_title": "PREPARATION AND MANIPULATION OF W-CLASS ENTANGLED STATES: APPLICATIONS TO QUANTUM-INFORMATION PROCESSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000265087300003"}
