A constructive achievability proof shows that zero forcing is sufficient to achieve all the available DOF on the two user MIMO interference channel. We also show through an example of a share-and-transmit scheme how the gains of transmitter cooperation may be entirely offset by the cost of enabling that cooperation so that the available DOF are not increased.", "paper_title": "Degrees of freedom for the MIMO interference channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000247606300026"}
