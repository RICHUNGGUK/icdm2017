Existing methods for blending three, five or more such bi-2 spline surfaces using surface caps consisting of pieces of low polynomial degree suffer from artifacts ranging from flatness to oscillations. The new construction, based on reparameterization of the bi-2 spline data, yields well-distributed highlight lines for a range of challenging test data. The construction uses n pieces of degree bi-4 (bi-3 when n is an element of {3, 5}) and applies both to primal (Catmull-Clark-like) and dual (Doo-Sabin-like) input layouts.
