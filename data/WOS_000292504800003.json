These challenges include: the transfer learning challenge, the social learning challenge and the mobile context mining challenge. I pick these three challenges because I think time is ripe for each of them to be addressed in a major way in the near future, given the current technological and societal readiness to tackle them. I also believe that each of the three challenges discussed in this article will help move the science and engineering of data mining forward, and have a great impact on society.", "paper_title": "Three challenges in data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000292504800003"}
