However, since QoS are often influenced by several factors, traditional approaches are not very efficient and effective in measuring QoS of web service. The authors introduce in this study a novel QoS measure approach to efficiently measure QoS of web service for web service selection. The core of this approach is to take the three factors, that is, service providers, the context of customers and historical statistics into QoS measure. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and effective in measuring QoS of web service.", "paper_title": "Quality of service measure approach of web service for service selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000303930400007"}
