One of the areas where improvements could be made is the requirement engineering process, where the features offered by business process modeling (BPM) could favor the implication of the domain experts. BPMN, the standard notation, is one of the most widely used modeling languages, used by a great number of organizations around the world. Its versatility enables it to be used for any kind of business process, regardless of the domain the problem addresses. However, non-technical domain experts find difficulties when dealing with business process modeling notations, so their participation in this task remains minor. BPMN MUSIM is a simplified business process modeling notation that intends to: lower the difficulty domain experts have for learning and understanding other notations, enable quick modeling of the business processes and use the models to generate specific software applications.
