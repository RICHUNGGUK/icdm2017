Therefore, it is important to consider not only its lexical similarity but also structural similarity in ontology alignment. This paper proposes ontology kernel that computes both types of similarities simultaneously. The idea of this kernel is to measure the structural similarity of ontology entities by mapping their entity graphs into the space spanned by entity random walks. The graph of an entity in the kernel expresses all relations with other entities. Thus, the ontology kernel can compare the similarity between entities no matter how complex the entities are and no matter how many kinds of relations they possess. A series of experiments with the standard data sets prove the generality and the superiority of the ontology kernel in ontology alignment.", "paper_title": "Ontology Kernel - A Convolution Kernel for Ontology Alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000351401300004"}
