The approach is based on the dynamic programming principle that allows finding an optimal solution very fast. Additionally, an optimal sequence is automatically selected from the input data set to be a time scale pattern for all other sequences. The synchronized motion sequences are used to learn a model of human motion for action recognition and full-body tracking purposes.", "paper_title": "3D human motion sequences synchronization using dense matching algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241486800049"}
