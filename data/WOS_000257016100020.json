Proxy is introduced to localize feedback and retransmission, and therefore significantly depress traffic redundancy and reduce latency. Placement of proxies is a key issue in HRM. This paper theoretically analyzes the performance improvement made by placement of proxies and presents a new approach to optimal partition of a subtree for performance optimization in the placement of a single proxy. Based on this approach, we propose a new algorithm, designed in a greedy fashion. We experimentally compare our new algorithm with several existing heuristic algorithms, and observe that it outperforms in the tradeoff between performance and complexity. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
