Recently, we introduced SETTER-a fast and accurate method for RNA pairwise structure alignment. In this paper, we describe MultiSETTER, SETTER extension for multiple RNA structure alignment. MultiSETTER combines SETTER's decomposition of RNA structures into non-overlapping structural subunits with the multiple sequence alignment algorithm ClustalW adapted for the structure alignment. The accuracy of MultiSETTER was assessed by the automatic classification of RNA structures and its comparison to SCOR annotations. In addition, MultiSETTER classification was also compared to multiple sequence alignment-based and secondary structure alignment-based classifications provided by LocARNA and RNADistance tools, respectively. MultiSETTER precompiled Windows libraries, as well as the C++ source code, are freely available from http://siret.cz/multisetter.", "paper_title": "Multiple 3D RNA Structure Superposition Using Neighbor Joining", "paper_id": "WOS:000356608100004"}
