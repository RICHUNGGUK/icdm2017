These codes have a very low coding rate, which makes them especially suitable for spread spectrum systems where they can be used for simultaneously achieving error correction and bandwidth expansion. Due to the cyclic properties and codeword length of the component codes, branch metrics can be efficiently computed using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), enabling simple implementation of the encoder and decoder. Among the possible NLC base codes, special attention is given to the Tomlinson, Cercas, Hughes (TCH) codes family due to their good autocorrelation properties. It is shown by simulation that the turbo codes schemes studied usually perform better than traditional turbo codes (in this paper the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), rate 1/3 turbo code was used as a reference). This improvement is accomplished at the cost of bandwidth expansion. One of the advantages of the presented solutions over other low rate codes is their ability to improve the synchronization process at the receiver due to the good autocorrelation properties of the available NLC codes (especially TCH codes). A comparison of performance between the UNITS uplink connection and an equivalent system using the proposed codes for a multiuser scenario in a multipath fading channel is presented showing the possibility of capacity increase when using these codes.
