Fluxes and source terms are discretized to ensure steady state configurations including correct modeling of start/stop flow conditions, both in a global and a local system of coordinates. The weak solutions presented involve the effect of bed slope in pressure distribution and frictional effects by means of the adequate gravity acceleration components. The numerical solvers proposed are first tested against 1D cases with exact solution and then their results are compared with experimental data in order to check the suitability of the mathematical models described in this work. Comparisons between results provided when using global and local system of coordinates are presented. The obtained results point out that both the global and the local system of coordinates can be used to predict faithfully the overall behavior of the phenomena considered in this work.
