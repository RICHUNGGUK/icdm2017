A numerical methodology is presented for its design. An active distributed detriplexer is designed, simulated, fabricated, and measured by the proposed numerical procedure. Computer simulation and measurement results show the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed topology as a detriplexer. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
