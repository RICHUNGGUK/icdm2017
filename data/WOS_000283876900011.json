We first provide a novel and explicit interpretation for finite-time reliable guaranteed cost fuzzy control. Second, a suitable reliable controller is designed such that the provided performance criterion is satisfied for the normal and possible actuator fault cases. Moreover, the switched Lyapunov function approach is utilised for relaxing the conservatism of these obtained conditions and the related optimisation problem is also offered to minimise the guaranteed cost performance bound. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the validity of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Finite-time reliable guaranteed cost fuzzy control for discrete-time nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283876900011"}
