Combining an extended sequence of rules using 5, 9, 17 and 33 points with a doubly adaptive bisection strategy is the main focus of the paper. We also discuss local versus global adaptivity and conclude that globally adaptive codes are to be preferred. Based on this we develop several new globally adaptive codes that all compare favorably both with coteglob, with Matlab's best currently available quadrature software quad1 and the general purpose QUADPACK codes dqk15 and dqk21. We include the results from extensive testing using both a Lyness-Kaganove testing technique and a battery test.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 868: Globally doubly adaptive quadrature - Reliable Matlab codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000248947800006"}
