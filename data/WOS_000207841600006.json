In the field of physiological monitoring, there are several goals that ambient intelligence can help us achieve. First, when patients are anxious, unobtrusive monitoring does not aggravate their anxiety. Second, when patients are at risk and there are insufficient caregivers to attend to each patient individually in a timely manner, unobtrusive pervasive monitoring can reassure patients that they are being cared for. Furthermore, caregivers appreciate being able to monitor more patients. The SMART system was developed to monitor patients' vital signs and locations in the waiting area of a hospital's emergency department. This paper reviews the SMART system and compares it to several other systems in related areas.", "paper_title": "Using ambient intelligence for physiological monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000207841600006"}
