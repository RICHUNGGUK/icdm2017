By using the input-output approach combining with the small-scale gain theorem, a sufficient condition is established in terms of linear matrix inequality, which guarantees the fault detection system to be exponentially stable with an H performance. Then, a solvability condition for the desired fault detection filter is also proposed. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.", "paper_title": "Fault detection of discrete-time switched systems with distributed delays: input-output approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000320191500007"}
