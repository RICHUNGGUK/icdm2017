As a complement, the models approach can be used to describe and compare the occupancy situations under similar conditions. Time series analysis has been applied to modeling the radio spectrum occupancy. This paper categorizes different time series models to different occupancy patterns. Occupancy analysis of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) band is given as an example.", "paper_title": "Spectrum Occupancy Statistics and Time Series Models for Cognitive Radio", "paper_id": "WOS:000287662400004"}
