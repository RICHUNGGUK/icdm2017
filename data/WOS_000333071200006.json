Meanwhile, even for one application, it has different requirements of performance and power in different scenarios. Although various processors with different architectures emerge to fit for the various applications in different scenarios, it is impossible to design a dedicated processor to meet all the requirements. Furthermore, dealing with uncertain processors significantly aggravates the burden of programmers and system integrators to achieve specific performance/power. In this paper, we propose elastic architecture (EA) to provide a uniform computing platform with high elasticity, i.e., the ratio of worst-case to best-case performance/power/performance-power trade-off, which can meet different requirements for different applications. It is achieved by dynamically adjusting architecture parameters (instruction set, branch predictor, data path, memory hierarchy, concurrency, status&control, and so on) on demand. The elasticity of our prototype implementation of EA, as Sim-EA, ranges from 3.31 to 14.34, with 5.41 in arithmetic average, for SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suites, which provides great flexibility to fulfill the different performance and power requirements in different scenarios. Moreover, Sim-EA can reduce the EDP (energy-delay product) for 31.14% in arithmetic average compared with a baseline fixed architecture. Besides, some subsequent experiments indicate a negative correlation between application intervals' lengths and their elasticities.", "paper_title": "An Elastic Architecture Adaptable to Various Application Scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000333071200006"}
