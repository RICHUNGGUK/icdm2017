We also establish some desirable properties of this operator, such as commutativity, idempotency and monotonicity. Then, we apply the induced interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted average(I-IVIFEOWA) operator based on the data mining to deal with multiple attribute decision making under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environments. Finally, an illustrative example about selecting an ERP system is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Some induced Einstein aggregation operators based on the data mining with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information and their application to multiple attribute decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000340435700028"}
