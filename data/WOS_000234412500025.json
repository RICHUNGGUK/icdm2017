Following these results, we study lossless MT source coding and deterministic MT channel coding problems and point out different dualities between them. In particular, we show that there exists a functional duality between a Slepian-Wolf (SW) coding problem and a deterministic broadcast channel (DBC) coding problem and between a lossless multiple-description (MD) coding problem and a deterministic multiple-access channel (DMAC) coding problem. In analogy to the duality established between DBC and DMAC coding problems, we further propose a similar duality between SW and lossless MD coding problems; in this way, we form a closed \"duality loop\" of four MT coding problems, which imposes the existence of a single common rate point in the achievable rate regions of all four dual problems. We also consider duality in zero-error MT coding and shed light on practical code design with an example. Finally, extension to the case with only one lossless/deterministic component in the source/channel coding problem is provided.", "paper_title": "On dualities in multiterminal coding problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000234412500025"}
