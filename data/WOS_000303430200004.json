The main visual features (shape and colour) and the main spatial features (fixed orientation, relative orientation and topology) of each object within the image are described. This approach has been tested in two real scenarios that involve agents and human interaction: (i) images captured by the webcam of a mobile robot while it navigates, and (ii) images of tile compositions captured by an industrial camera used to select tile pieces to be used in assembling tile mosaics. In both scenarios, promising results have been obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
