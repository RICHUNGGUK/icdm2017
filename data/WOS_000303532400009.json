The optimization process proposed in this paper consists of three optimization steps. The first step is a topology optimization of a short untwisted and non tapered section of the blade, with the inner volume used as the design domain. The second step is again a topology optimization, but on the first half of a blade to study the effect of non symmetry of the structure due to blade twist and taper. Results of this optimization step are then interpreted to build a shell model of the complete blade structure to perform composite size optimization based on a minimum mass objective subjected to constraints on deflection, composite strength and structural stability. Different blade models using ribs are then optimized and compared against conventional blade structure (box spar structure without ribs and single web structure without ribs). The use of ribs in wind turbine blade structures, which is more adapted to thermoplastic composite manufacturing than for thermoset composites, leads to slightly lighter blades than conventional blade structures.", "paper_title": "Development of a structural optimization strategy for the design of next generation large thermoplastic wind turbine blades", "paper_id": "WOS:000303532400009"}
