The interlocking routes are typically listed manually by experienced signaling engineers, and this task is both time consuming and expensive. In this paper, an automatic, graph theory-based approach to route location and verification is presented. In this new approach, a component-based model is used to represent the topology of the station layout, and a modified matrix algorithm based on graph theory is used to locate all of the routes in a given station. This algorithm exhibits superior performance in the location and verification of routes and is universally applicable, irrespective of the station layout. When a station is modified, the designers can simply update the topological data for the station, and the new route information can be obtained automatically. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
