Riding this trend, recent research community envisions a novel information retrieving and information-sharing platform, which views the users with mobile devices, being willing to accept crowdsourcing tasks as crowd sensors. With the neat idea, a set of crowd sensors applications have emerged. Among the applications, the geospatial information systems based on crowd sensors show significant potentials beyond traditional ones by providing real-time geospatial information. In the applications, user positioning is of great importance. However, existing positioning techniques have their own disadvantages. In this paper, we study using pervasive Wi-Fi access point as user position indicators. The major challenge for using Wi-Fi access point is that there is no mechanism for mapping observed Wi-Fi signals to human-defined places. To this end, our idea is to employ crowdsourcing model to perform place name annotations by mobile participants to bridge the gap between signals and human-defined places. In this paper, we propose schemes for effectively enabling crowdsourcing-based place name annotation, and conduct real trials with recruited participants to study the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes over existing solutions.", "paper_title": "Effective Schemes for Place Name Annotations with Mobile Crowd", "paper_id": "WOS:000350913400001"}
