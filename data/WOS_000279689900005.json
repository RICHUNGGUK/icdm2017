Using the hyperelliptic Ate pairing and twisted Ate pairing, we propose a new approach to speeding up the Weil pairing computation. For some hyperelliptic curves with high degree twist, computing Weil pairing by our approach may be faster than Tate pairing, Ate pairing, and all other known pairings.", "paper_title": "Twisted Ate pairing on hyperelliptic curves and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000279689900005"}
