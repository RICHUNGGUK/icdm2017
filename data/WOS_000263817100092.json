Many researchers provide assistances and advice in fish disease diagnosis and appropriate treatment measures. However, the risk of misdiagnosis, incorrectly treatment or over-treatment also exists due to carrying out after disease outbreaks. So it is necessary to develop an early warning system. Taking into account that fish disease outbreak is mainly caused by suboptimal water quality in north of China. the best way is to develop decision aids tool that can assess and early warning the risk of fish disease based on water quality management. This paper introduces a knowledge-based early warning system for fish disease via water quality management. The architecture, the process for knowledge engineering, main components and their functions, especially a series of water quality management mathematic models are described. At present, the system is in pilot in the city of Tianjin in China. The stage achievements in developing the intellectual system of fish disease early warning are summarized. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
