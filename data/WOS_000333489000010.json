Trust can assist entities making decisions before establishing collaborations. It is desirable to simulate the behaviour of users as in social environments where they tend to trust users who have common interests or share some of their opinions, Le., users similar to them. In this paper, we introduce the concept of context similarity among entities and derive a similarity network. Then, we define a trust model that allows us to establish trust along a path of entities. We validate our model in a proximity-based trust establishment scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
