Recently, multi-hop secondary networks have gained attention as a promising design to leverage the full potential of cognitive radio networks. One of the main features of routing protocols in multi-hop networks is the routing metric used to select the best route for forwarding packets. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art routing metrics for cognitive radio networks. We start by listing the challenges that have to be addressed in designing a good routing metric for cognitive radio networks. We then provide a taxonomy of the different metrics and a survey of the way they have been used in different routing protocols. Then we present a case study to compare different classes of metrics. After that, we discuss how to combine individual routing metrics to obtain a global one. We end the paper with a discussion of the open issues in the design of future metrics for cognitive radio networks.", "paper_title": "Routing Metrics of Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000338700300006"}
