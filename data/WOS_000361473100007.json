We first describe a lifting argument to show exponential extension complexity for a number of NP-complete problems including subset-sum and three dimensional matching. We then obtain a relationship between the extension complexity of the cut polytope of a graph and that of its graph minors. Using this we are able to show exponential extension complexity for the cut polytope of a large number of graphs, including those used in quantum information and suspensions of cubic planar graphs.", "paper_title": "On the extension complexity of combinatorial polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000361473100007"}
