This model is inspired by friction force equations, and considers that pedestrians avoid passing near other pedestrians with high relative velocity. The route choice process is based on a weighting of the impedance generated by pedestrians and the path length. A social force model was used to model pedestrian walking behavior. The model is able to reproduce emergent behavior among agents, allowing the assumption that the friction equations may provide a suitable approach to route choice behavior and can also be used as an indirect measure of pedestrian delay.", "paper_title": "Pedestrian route choice model based on friction forces", "paper_id": "WOS:000342762000005"}
