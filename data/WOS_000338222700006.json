The objective function is the cost of power generation subject to the required power reserves, network constraints, and the power flow distribution in the energy system. The concept of the marginal unit in the unit commitment problem is introduced, and its properties are studied. The results of model calculations are presented.", "paper_title": "Mathematical model for the unit commitment problem in the Russian competitive electricity market", "paper_id": "WOS:000338222700006"}
