In this study, a two-level iterated greedy (TLIG) heuristic is proposed to minimize makespan of this strongly NP-hard problem. The performance of the proposed TLIG heuristic is compared against eight existing algorithms on a benchmark problem set used in earlier studies. The experimental results reveal that the proposed TLIG heuristic is very effective and efficient at finding near-optimal solutions for FMCSPs with SDFSTs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
