A significant element of modern data centers is their cooling infrastructure, whose efficient and sustainable operation is a key ingredient to the \"always-on\" capability of data centers. We describe the design and implementation of CAMAS (Chiller Advisory and MAnagement System), a temporal data mining solution to mine and manage chiller installations. CAMAS embodies a set of algorithms for processing multivariate time-series data and characterizes sustainability measures of the patterns mined. We demonstrate three key ingredients of CAMAS-motif mining, association analysis, and dynamic Bayesian network inference-that help bridge the gap between low-level, raw, sensor streams, and the high-level operating regions and features needed for an operator to efficiently manage the data center. The effectiveness of CAMAS is demonstrated by its application to a real-life production data center managed by HP.", "paper_title": "Temporal Data Mining Approaches for Sustainable Chiller Management in Data Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000208617100004"}
