An efficient average-case analysis procedure for finding the average performance ratio and problem solution is demonstrated. We give the closed-form expression for some special range to which the bounded item belongs. Our result is useful for designing the length in fixed-size format or evaluating the performance impacted by the protocol header in computer and communication network.", "paper_title": "A bounded item bin packing problem over discrete distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800010"}
