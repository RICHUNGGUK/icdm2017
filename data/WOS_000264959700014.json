Numerical analyses were conducted to evaluate the influences of soil elasticity. creep and soil-wall interface. Back-analyses indicate small strain parameters should be used if an elastic-perfect plastic model is selected. in addition, excavation-induced seepage has only a limited effect on vertical displacements. Delayed installation of 3rd level struts and base slab construction caused significant time-dependent (creep) movements during the excavation. Back-analyses show that the dynamic viscosity (D(v)) used in the visco-elastic model for creep simulation is in the range of 1.5 x 10(15)-2.0 x 10(15) Pa, but there are still inconsistencies in movements both near to and far from the excavation. Interpreting from observation data, the creep rate of wall movement caused in the non-supported stage of the excavation varies between 0.14 and 0.38 mm/day. Finally, parametric studies of interface elements indicate that the most sensitive parameters are the normal (K(n)) and shear stiffness (K(s)) of the interface. Back-analyses using an elastic-perfect plastic model indicate that using 3 x 10(6) Pa for K(n) and K(s) produces more acceptable results. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
