Meanwhile PaaS in cloud computing aims at providing efficient support for software developers. In the light of this consideration, we have designed and implemented Service4All, a service cloud platform targeting at improving productivity of service-oriented software developers. In this paper, we describe the key technical issues, architecture design and implementation technology of SAE, a key component in Service4All, in terms of scalability. First, we propose a software appliance-based mechanism for elastic middleware management. Second, we describe a micro-kernel-based AppEngine core for efficient coordination of various components. Third, we present a scalable replication framework to achieve highly scalable application services. Finally, through a real application deployed on Service4All, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.", "paper_title": "Service4All: a scalable PaaS platform for service-oriented software", "paper_id": "WOS:000354894200005"}
