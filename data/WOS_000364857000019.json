First, a model for the heartbeat shape is adaptively inferred from the signal using hierarchical clustering. Then, beat-to-beat intervals are detected by finding positions where the heartbeat shape best fits the signal. The method was validated with overnight recordings from 46 subjects in varying setups (sleep clinic, home, single bed, double bed, two sensor types). The mean beat-to-beat interval error was 13ms and on an average 54% of the beat-to-beat intervals were detected. The method is part of a home-use e-health system for an unobtrusive sleep measurement.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Heartbeat Modeling for Beat-to-Beat Heart Rate Measurement in Ballistocardiograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000364857000019"}
