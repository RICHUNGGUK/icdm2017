The wavelet coherence based on Monte Carlo method (MC-WTC) is effective in measuring the time-frequency coherence of neural signals, but it generates large intermediate data and could not be applied in real-time neural signal analysis. We develop a parallelised MC-WTC method with general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU), namely G-MC-WTC, which speeds up the calculations using the CUDA toolkit. Simulation data showed that it can improve the runtime performance by almost 200 times. This method has been applied to a visual-auditory EEG data and to obtain the coherence information between different brain areas in real time. The result revealed a coherence difference in. band at left temporal lobe. This method may become a useful tool for studying the cooperation mechanisms of brain regions in cognitive processes.", "paper_title": "High throughput wavelet coherence analysis of neural series", "paper_id": "WOS:000347629700006"}
