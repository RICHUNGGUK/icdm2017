This allows considering the bacterium aging as a relevant phenomenon moving the evolution far away from the usual linear predatorprey paradigms. We obtain an almost nonparametric aging mechanism based on a thresholding operation, as an elementary intelligent operation, that may explain some typical patterns of the population evolution. In this paper we discuss both theoretical aspects and the results of a standardized procedure.", "paper_title": "Evolution hypothesis of bacterial populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800030"}
