In this paper, we solve the k-coverage sensor deployment problem to achieve multilevel (k) coverage of the area of interest I. We consider two subproblems: the k-coverage placement problem and the distributed dispatch problem. The placement problem asks how the minimum number of sensors required and their locations in I can be determined to guarantee that I is k-covered and the network is connected, while the dispatch problem asks how mobile sensors can be scheduled to move to the designated locations according to the result computed by the placement strategy if they are not in the current positions such that the energy consumption due to movement is minimized. Our solutions to the placement problem consider both the binary and probabilistic sensing models and allow an arbitrary relationship between the communication distance and the sensing distance of sensors, thereby relaxing the limitations of existing results. For the dispatch problem, we propose a competition-based scheme and a pattern-based scheme. The competition-based scheme allows mobile sensors to bid for their closest locations, while the pattern-based scheme allows sensors to derive the target locations on their own. Our proposed schemes are efficient in terms of the number of sensors required and are distributed in nature. Simulation results are presented to verify their effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Distributed deployment schemes for mobile wireless sensor networks to ensure multilevel coverage", "paper_id": "WOS:000257869100011"}
