The BMRF algorithm has been compared with two most common MCI methods, Temporal Linear (TLIN) and Bidirectional MCI (BID) used in FRC, in the aspect of PSNR, perceptual quality, and computational complexity. The simulation results clearly showed that BMRF presented a trade-off solution between computation and interpolation quality. By using simple weighted frame interpolation between multiple frames, it reduced computation rapidly while keeping similar interpolation quality when compared to the BID method. The simplicity of the BMRF algorithm made it suitable for either software or hardware implementation essential for real-time FRC applications.", "paper_title": "NEW MULTIPLE FRAME MOTION COMPENSATED INTERPOLATION ALGORITHM FOR FRAME RATE UP-CONVERSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264490800005"}
