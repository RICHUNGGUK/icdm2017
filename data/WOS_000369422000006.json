Design/methodology/approach - A finite-element (FE)-based method is proposed which treats the microstructure of litz wires by an auxiliary cell problem. In the macroscopic model, litz wires are represented by a block with a homogeneous, artificial material whose properties are derived from the cell problem. As the frequency characteristics of the material closely resemble a Debye relaxation, it is possible to convert the macroscopic model to polynomial form, which enables the application of model reduction techniques of moment-matching type. Findings - FE-based model-order reduction using litz wire homogenization provides an efficient approach to the broadband analysis of WPT systems. The error of the reduced-order model (ROM) is comparable to that of the underlying original model and can be controlled by varying the ROM dimension. Research limitations/implications - Since the present model does not account for displacement currents, the operating frequency of the system must lie well below its first self-resonance frequency. Practical implications - The proposed method is well-suited for the computer-aided design of WPT systems. It outperforms traditional FE analysis in computational efficiency. Originality/value - The presented homogenization method employs a new formulation for the cell problem which combines the benefits of several existing approaches. Its incorporation into an order-reduction method enables the fast computation of broadband frequency sweeps.", "paper_title": "Litz wire homogenization by finite elements and model-order reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000369422000006"}
