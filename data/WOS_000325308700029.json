An induced matching of a graph G is a subset I of edges of G such that the graph induced by the endpoints of I is a matching. In this paper, we prove the NP-completeness of strong 4-, 5-, and 6-edge-colouring and maximum induced matching in some subclasses of subcubic triangle-free planar graphs. We also obtain a tight upper bound for the minimum number of colours in a strong edge-colouring of outerplanar graphs as a function of the maximum degree. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
