In such settings, one approach to recover the signal is known as l(1)-analysis. We expand in this paper the performance analysis of this approach by providing a weaker recovery condition than existing results in the literature. Our analysis is also broadly based on general frames and alternative dual frames (as analysis operators). As one application to such a general-dual-based approach and performance analysis, an optimal-dual-based technique is proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of using alternative dual frames as analysis operators. An iterative algorithm is outlined for solving the optimal-dual-based l(1)-analysis problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method and algorithm is demonstrated through several experiments.", "paper_title": "Compressed Sensing With General Frames via Optimal-Dual-Based l(1)-Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000009"}
