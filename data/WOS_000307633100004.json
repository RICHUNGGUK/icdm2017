However, a single flash-based SSD cannot satisfy the capacity, performance and reliability requirements of the modern storage systems that support increasingly demanding data-intensive computing applications. Applying RAID schemes to SSDs to meet these requirements, while a logical and viable solution, faces many challenges. In this article, we propose a Hybrid Parity-based Disk Array architecture (short for HPDA), which combines a group of SSDs and two hard disk drives (HDDs) to improve the performance and reliability of SSD-based storage systems. In HPDA, the SSDs (data disks) and part of one HDD (parity disk) compose a RAID4 disk array. Meanwhile, a second HDD and the free space of the parity disk are mirrored to form a RAID1-style write buffer that temporarily absorbs the small write requests and acts as a surrogate set during recovery when a disk fails. The write data is reclaimed to the data disks during the lightly loaded or idle periods of the system. Reliability analysis shows that the reliability of HPDA, in terms of MTTDL (Mean Time To Data Loss), is better than that of either pure HDD-based or SSD-based disk array. Our prototype implementation of HPDA and the performance evaluations show that HPDA significantly outperforms either HDD-based or SSD-based disk array.", "paper_title": "HPDA: A Hybrid Parity-Based Disk Array for Enhanced Performance and Reliability", "paper_id": "WOS:000307633100004"}
