Such an outcome is termed an FPT approximation algorithm. We describe some results that begin to provide some answers. We show that there is no such FPT algorithm for g(k) of the form k + c (where c is a fixed constant, termed an additive FPT approximation), unless FPT = W vertical bar 2 vertical bar. We answer the analogous problem completely for the related INDEPENDENT DOMINATING SET (IDS) problem, showing that IDS does not admit an FPT approximation algorithm, for any g(k), unless FPT = W vertical bar 2 vertical bar.
