However, far too little attention has been paid to routing issues involving enhanced robotic nodes. In view of the lack of a significant and comprehensive analysis, this research work completes an in-depth performance comparison of mostly well-known ad hoc routing protocols under a wide variety of conditions and applies the obtained results to a case study with three examples of real-world Wireless Networked Robotics scenarios.
