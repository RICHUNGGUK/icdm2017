A filter and a virtual observer are constructed to substitute the immeasurable system state. By using state transformation, the original system is converted to the system without input delay. Neural networks are employed to estimate the unknown continuous functions. The control scheme ensures that the closed-loop system is semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB).
