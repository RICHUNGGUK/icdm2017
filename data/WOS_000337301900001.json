Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effects of material parameters such as water-cement ratio, volume fraction of the mixtures, shape and size of aggregates and cement hydration degree, on the tortuosity of transport paths in hardened cement pastes, mortar and concrete. Results indicate that the transport tortuosity in cement-based materials decreases with the increasing of water-cement ratio, and increases with the cement hydration degree, the volume fraction of cement and aggregate, the shape factor and diameter of aggregates, and the material parameters related to cement pastes, such as the water-cement ratio, cement hydration degree and cement volume fraction, are the primary factors that influence the transport tortuosity of cement-based materials.", "paper_title": "Numerical investigation on tortuosity of transport paths in cement-based materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000337301900001"}
