The proposed observation selection criterion associates high utility with observations that predictably facilitate distinction between pairs of competing hypotheses by a Bayesian classifier. Rigorous experimentation of the proposed approach was conducted on two case studies, involving synthetic and real data, respectively. The results show the proposed algorithm to perform better than a random navigation strategy in terms of the amount of data required for recognition while being much faster than a strategy based on mutual information, without compromising accuracy.", "paper_title": "Efficient discriminant viewpoint selection for active Bayesian recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239097200003"}
