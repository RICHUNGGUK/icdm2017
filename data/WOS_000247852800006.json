This work presents findings on how trainees develop their skills in utilizing a solid mechanical CAD tool (Pro/Engineer version 2000i(2) and later version Wildfire). Exercises at the beginner and intermediate levels were designed so that several variations of a solid object are built by non-experienced trainees as they accumulate training time. In this case, trainees are fourth year mechanical engineering seniors and as such, they were of a similar technical and gender make-up. This assessment was conducted over the duration of training (16-week long semester). The test exercises were used to assess the trainees' speed and proficiency in the use of CAD by (1) measuring their performance time and (2) feature count (number of features-of-size used to build the test parts). Using performance time data, empirical learning curves are generated. Breaking these curves into declarative and procedural components provides insight into how fast the trainees develop cognitive and motor CAD skills. In order to confirm that this methodology can be extended to other CAD platforms, a follow-up study was performed on a different set of beginner-level trainees with similar make-up while using the same beginner-level parts but with a more recent version of Pro/Engineer: Wildfire. One significant result of this study is that the procedural and declarative components of CAD learning are largely cognitive. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
