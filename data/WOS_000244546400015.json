However, the quantitative effect of using color in the interfaces has not been discussed in the literature. This paper introduces research on the effects of color in pointing tasks using Fitts' law as the evaluation method. Different colors and color presentation styles are applied in the experiments which are similar in design to the paradigmatic Fitts' law pointing task. The experimental results show that when the subjects use a mouse as the input device, there is no significant difference between an interface with a colored target and one with a white target in the mean performance time. The results also reveal that color presentation styles will offer no significant difference to pointing tasks when the mouse is applied. However, when the interface of tablet PC and pen was applied, subjects without much experience in tablet personal computer usage needed more time to perform the task with colored targets than with a white target. Furthermore, when the colors are changed randomly during the selection process, the difference is even more obvious. These results are confirmed by a Checking Experiment and a Learning Effect Experiment which we performed on different groups of subjects.", "paper_title": "Investigating the influence of colors on the performance of pointing tasks for human interface design", "paper_id": "WOS:000244546400015"}
