Relaxing the equal cardinality, constraint leads to the max-cut problem (MCP). In this work, we present a memetic algorithm for MBP which integrates a grouping crossover operator and a tabu search optimization procedure. The proposed crossover operator preserves the largest common vertex groupings with respect to the parent solutions while controlling the distance between the offspring solution and its parents. Extensive experimental studies on 71 well-known G-set benchmark instances demonstrate that our memetic algorithm improves, in many cases, the current best known solutions for both MBP and MCP.
