The scheme, which controls the response of the frame by also controlling the significant modal contributions to the overall response, is designed to provide a target reduction of response and to take into account the time-delay effect. Inputs to the control scheme are (1) the measured accelerations at only a few selected points of the structure and (2) the ground acceleration. For developing the control scheme, two sets of neural nets are trained. The effectiveness of the control scheme is tested for both known and unknown problems from the El Centro earthquake record for a 10-story building frame. Results of the study show that the control scheme is highly effective in controlling both displacement and acceleration responses of the frame for the unknown El Centro earthquake record.", "paper_title": "Modal seismic control of building frames by artificial neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000234190700007"}
