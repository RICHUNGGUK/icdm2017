Individuals were provided with footstep sounds simulating different surface materials. The sounds were interactively generated using shoes with pressure sensors. Results showed that subjects' walking speed changed as a function of the type of simulated ground material. This effect may arise due to the presence of conflicting information between the auditory and foot-haptic modality, or because of an adjustment of locomotion to the physical properties evoked by the sounds simulating the ground materials. The results reported in this study suggest that auditory feedback may be more important in the regulation of walking in natural environments than has been acknowledged. Furthermore, auditory feedback could be used to develop novel approaches to the design of therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures for locomotion.", "paper_title": "Walking Pace Affected by Interactive Sounds Simulating Stepping on Different Terrains", "paper_id": "WOS:000329136700006"}
