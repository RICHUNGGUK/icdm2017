The novel networks, referred to as complex-valued RCNNs (CV-RCNNs), are characterized by a possible nonlinear function, which is applied on the real part of the scalar product of the current state and the original patterns. We show that the CV-RCNNs always converge to a stationary state. Thus, they have potential application as associative memories. In this context, we provide sufficient conditions for the retrieval of a memorized vector. Furthermore, computational experiments concerning the reconstruction of corrupted grayscale images reveal that certain CV-RCNNs exhibit an excellent noise tolerance.", "paper_title": "Complex-Valued Recurrent Correlation Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343704700002"}
