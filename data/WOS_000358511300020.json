The technique employs transition delay test for TSV fault detection. Fault recovery is achieved by employing redundant TSVs and rerouting signals to fault-free TSVs. This technique is efficient because it requires a small (2x number of TSVs per group) number of clock cycles for fault detection and recovery. Synthesis results using 130-nm design library show that 100% repair capability can be achieved with low area overhead (4% for the best case).", "paper_title": "Online Fault Tolerance Technique for TSV-Based 3-D-IC", "paper_id": "WOS:000358511300020"}
