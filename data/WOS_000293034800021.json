The scheme treats not only point values of a profile but also its zeroth to second order piecewise moments as dependent variables, for better conservation of the information entropy. We have developed one-and two-dimensional schemes and show that they provide quite accurate solutions within reasonable usage of computational resources compared to other existing schemes. The two-dimensional scheme can accurately solve the solid body rotation problem of a gaussian profile for more than hundred rotation periods with little numerical diffusion. This is crucially important for Vlasov simulations of magnetized plasmas. Applications of the one- and two-dimensional schemes to electrostatic and electromagnetic Vlasov simulations are presented with some benchmark tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
