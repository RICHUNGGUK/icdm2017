(2) Allow developers to build and share tools that operate on such a provenance model. (3) Define provenance in a precise, technology-agnostic manner. (4) Support a digital representation of provenance for any \"thing\", whether produced by computer systems or not. (5) Allow multiple levels of description to coexist. (6) Define a core set of rules that identify the valid inferences that can be made on provenance representation.
