We therefore propose connecting L (2) expansion coefficients between a polynomial family and a modified family by a sparse transformation. Accuracy and conditioning of the connection and its inverse are explored. The connection and recurrence coefficients can simultaneously be obtained as the Cholesky decomposition of a matrix polynomial involving the Jacobi matrix; this property extends to continuous, non-polynomial measure modifications on finite intervals. We conclude with an example of a useful application to families of Jacobi polynomials with parameters (gamma,delta) where the fast Fourier transform may be applied in order to obtain expansion coefficients whenever 2 gamma and 2 delta are odd integers.", "paper_title": "Computation of connection coefficients and measure modifications for orthogonal polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000305405200011"}
