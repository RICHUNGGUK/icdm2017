A linear model incorporating autocorrelated random effects and sampling errors was previously proposed in small area estimation using both cross-sectional and time-series data in the Bayesian paradigm. There are, however, many situations that we have time-related counts or proportions in small area estimation; for example, monthly dataset on the number of incidence in small areas. This article considers hierarchical Bayes generalized linear models for a unified analysis of both discrete and continuous data with incorporating cross-sectional and time-series data. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through several simulation studies and also by a real dataset.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Bayes estimation in small area estimation using cross-sectional and time-series data", "paper_id": "WOS:000327422900010"}
