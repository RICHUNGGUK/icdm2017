In this paper, an extension is made of the recently proposed LES formalism based on sampling operators. It is shown that the sampling-based dynamic procedure, in combination with an appropriate truncation error model, can be used as a technique to increase the numerical accuracy of a discretization. The technique is resemblant to the well-known Richardson extrapolation. The procedure is tested on a I D convection-diffusion equation and a 2D lid-driven cavity at Re = 400, using a finite difference method. Promising results are found. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
