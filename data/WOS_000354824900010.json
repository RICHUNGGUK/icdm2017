Collaborative representation-based classification (CRC) has shown the robustness and high performance. In this paper, we proposed a new feature extraction method-based collaborative representation. Firstly, we get the coefficients of all face samples by collaborative representation. Then we define the inter-class reconstructive errors and intra-class reconstructive errors for each sample. After that, Fisher criterion is used to get the discriminative feature. At last, CRC is executed to get the identification results in the new feature space. Different from other feature extraction methods, the proposed method integrates the classification criterion into the feature extraction. So the feature space we get fits the classifier better. Experiment results on several face databases show that the proposed method is more effective than other state-of-the-art face recognition methods.", "paper_title": "A Novel Feature Extraction Method Based on Collaborative Representation for Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000354824900010"}
