The Bayview Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge in Quincy, Illinois, was selected for the study. The focus was in comparing the viability of simplified techniques for practical applications. Accordingly, the numerical analysis involved development of a precise linear elastic finite element model (FEM) to simulate various structural health monitoring test scenarios with accelerometers. The Effective Independence Method was employed to locate the best distribution of the accelerometers along the length of the bridge. The simulated accelerometer data based on the FEM analysis was employed for the evaluation of the four damage identification methods investigated here. These methods included the Enhanced Coordinate Modal Assurance Criterion, Damage Index Method, Mode Shape Curvature Method, and Modal Flexibility Index Method. Some of these methods had been previously applied only to a number of specific bridges. However, the investigation here provides the relative merits and shortcomings of the damage detection methods in long-span cable-stayed bridges.", "paper_title": "Numerical Evaluation of Vibration-Based Methods for Damage Assessment of Cable-Stayed Bridges", "paper_id": "WOS:000287362200007"}
