The smoothness-based apparent (effective) complexity measure for RBF networks is considered. For the specific case of RBF network, bounds on the complexity measure are formally described. As the synthetic and real-world data experiments show, the proposed MOBJ learning method is capable of efficient generalization control along with network size reduction. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
