It should be the main issue how to guarantee the integration and accountability on each business, especially in mission critical system which is mainly supported by M2M (Machine to Machine) control mechanism. This study is from the analysis of digital forensics case study that is from the M2M Sensing Control Mechanism problem of the \"Imjin River\" case in 2009, where a group of family is swept away to death by water due to M2M control error. The ubiquitous surroundings bring the changes in the field of criminal investigation to real time controls such as M2M systems. The needs of digital forensics on M2M control are increasing on every crime scene but we suffer from the lack of control metrics to get this done efficiently. The court asks for more accurately analyzed results accounting high quality product development design. Investigators in the crime scene need real-time analysis against the crime caused by poor quality of mission critical systems. It seems to be every need of Real-Time-Enterprise, so called ubiquitous society on the case. We try to find the efficiency and productivity in discovering non-functional design defects in M2M convergence products focusing on three metrics in study model with quick implementation. Digital forensics system in present status depends on know-how of each investigator and is hard to expect professional analysis on every field. This study set up a hypothesis \"Co-working of professional investigators on each field will qualify Performance and Integrity\" especially in mission critical system such as M2M and suggests \"Online co-work analysis model\" to efficiently detect and prevent mission critical errors in advance. At the conclusion, this study proved the statistical research that was surveyed by digital forensics specialists around M2M crime scene cases with quick implementation of dash board.", "paper_title": "Control Variables of Remote Joint Analysis Realization on the M2M Case", "paper_id": "WOS:000300519400006"}
