The binary message to be embedded is divided into two segments, each of which is then decomposed into n + 1 or n types of sub-messages (where n >= 3 enables each pixel to embed a sub-message), respectively, according to the desired embedding capacity. Embedding is done by leaving the pixel value unchanged or changing it into one of its n or n - 1 neighboring values according to the type of the sub-message. From the results of this study, each pixel may not embed a fixed number of message bits and the adjustment of the pixel value is minimal, thus the image quality is significantly improved by adaptively decomposing the message into sub-messages and embedding them into the host image.", "paper_title": "Adaptively embedding binary data in an image", "paper_id": "WOS:000259604800007"}
