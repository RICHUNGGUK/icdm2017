Although the performance can be improved by applying an effective network-based IP mobility scheme in place of the traditional host-based alternatives, the existing inter-domain extensions of network-based IP mobility continue to suffer from an extended handover latency. This paper proposes a new inter-domain network-based IP mobility scheme based on node movement prediction. The proposed scheme accelerates the handover by preparing the future domain of the mobile node in a proactive manner. Analytical and simulation-based evaluations confirm improved performance of the proposed scheme in terms of handover latency and packet loss compared with existing schemes.", "paper_title": "A Fast Inter-Domain Network-based IP Mobility Scheme for Urban Areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000347917100008"}
