Machines are provided with different capability, i.e., the one with speed s can schedule all jobs, while the other one with speed 1 can only process partial jobs. Optimal algorithms for any 0 < s < infinity are given in the paper. For 0 < s < 1, it has a competitive ratio of min{1 + s, 1 + 1+s/1+s+s(2)}. For s > 1, the competitive ratio is min {1+s/s, 1 + 2s/1+s+s(2)}.", "paper_title": "A note on hierarchical scheduling on two uniform machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000280232600006"}
