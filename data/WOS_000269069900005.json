The proposed approach is demonstrated by solving a system of ordinary differential equations as a boundary value problem, utilizing finite difference approximations for solving partial differential equations, and investigating ill-conditioning in multiple linear regression. The educational benefits of this approach are discussed in detail. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
