The initiation of a geoepidemiological database, for recording autoimmune incidents with a focus to clinical manifestations, demographic parameters and geographic background is crucial to detect correlations. Results: The dAUTObase collects an ever increasing number of publications-currently counting 435-on autoimmune diseases' frequencies in various populations and ethnic groups. The respective data have been hosted by a web application developed for the task. It uses three data visualization tools: the PivotViewer, the Disease Treemap and the Disease World Map, to assist the effective data querying.", "paper_title": "Introducing dAUTObase: a first step towards the global scale geoepidemiology of autoimmune syndromes and diseases", "paper_id": "WOS:000350059600016"}
