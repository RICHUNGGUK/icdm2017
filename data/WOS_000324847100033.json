Conventional iris recognition systems transfer iris images to rectangle using polar coordinate after accurate segmentation, and have performed very well on accurate data. However, bovine iris images are usually irregular with respect to inactive participant, and the conventional methods cannot achieve high accuracy and true rotation invariance. In this paper, a new scheme is proposed based on scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and bag-of-features. Firstly, region-based active contour is used to detect the inner boundary. Secondly, SIFT method is applied to detect the keypoints in the iris image, and points located in pupil region are removed. Then, feature vocabulary is constructed, and histogram representation for each iris image is generated. Finally, histogram distance is adopted for the matching test. Experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness and potential of developed noncooperative iris recognition. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
