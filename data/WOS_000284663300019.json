This paper proposes a state-dependent algorithm for the FMS robot scheduling problem in make-to-order (MTO) environments for mass customization (MC). A mathematical model of the problem is formulated. A computational study of the proposed algorithm is performed. The algorithm is compared to an effective FMS robot scheduling rule, the shortest remaining processing time first (SRPF) rule. The results reveal the effectiveness of the algorithm in increasing the productivity-based measures of the FMS. Practical application insights are discussed. Further research is also provided.
