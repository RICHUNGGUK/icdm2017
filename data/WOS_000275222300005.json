GM(1,1) is a basic model for grey prediction, capable of system prediction under uncertainty and information imperfection. A grey self-organizing map (GreySOM) is a mechanism integrating GM(1,1), GRG, and SOM, and is a novel method for predicting financial time series. It classifies time-series differencing data in a SOM structure through grey correlation, and corrects the predicted values of the data to achieve more ideal predicted values of the data to achieve more ideal predicted values. The experimental results show that GreySOM has an excellent forecasting ability, and can help investors predict future stock price indices and grasp profit-making opportunities.", "paper_title": "FORECAST OF FINANCIAL TIME SERIES BASED ON GREY SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222300005"}
