However, the findings of our study also reveal the RFID technology implementation costs as the key inhibitor of RFID widespread adoption and usage among suppliers. This, in turn, precluded the focal TPL firm from implementing the best optimum RFID solution to create better business value from the RFID project.", "paper_title": "The impact of RFID technology on warehouse process innovation: A pilot project in the TPL industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000297198700007"}
