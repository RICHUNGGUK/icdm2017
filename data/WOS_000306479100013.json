This paper presents first the Measurement Information Model in ISO 15939 and clarifies next what in it refers to the classical metrology field, and what refers to the quantitative analysis of relationships. The paper concludes with two examples of the designs of a measure for ISO 9126, one focusing on a single attribute and the second attempting to quantify a set of relationships across a number of entities and attributes.
