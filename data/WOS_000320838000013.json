However, new research indicates that operons are found in higher organisms as well. There are instances of operons found in C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and other eukaryotic species. We developed a prototype using positional, structural and gene expression information to identify candidate operons. We focused our efforts on \"trans-spliced\" operons in which the pre-mRNA is trans-spliced into individual transcripts and subsequently translated, as widely observed in C elegans and some instances in Drosophila. We identify several candidate operons in Drosophila melanogaster of which two have been subsequently molecularly validated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
