This article discusses the concepts and methodologies of a geographical simulation and optimization system (GeoSOS). GeoSOS integrates cellular automata (CA), agent-based models (ABMs), and swarm intelligence models (SIMs) for solving process simulation and optimization problems. A general form of the so-called interaction rules is proposed for implementing this integrated system. The GeoSOS software is developed to provide these complementary functions that are unavailable in the current GIS. Experiments have demonstrated that GeoSOS is able to model the reciprocal relationships between urban simulation and spatial optimization (e.g., facility sitting, transport development, and natural protection) in fast-growing regions. Better modeling performances have been achieved using the coupling strategies of GeoSOS.", "paper_title": "Concepts, methodologies, and tools of an integrated geographical simulation and optimization system", "paper_id": "WOS:000291022400008"}
