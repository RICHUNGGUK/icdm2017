The longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle are studied using time-scale decomposition to reduce the complexity of T-S modeling. The dynamic inversion with PI control technique is applied for the slow dynamics to derive the flight path angle command and throttle setting by taking the pilot altitude and velocity command as its inputs. The T-S fuzzy controller is designed for the fast dynamics to derive the elevator deflection to track the flight path angle command. The discrepancy between the T-S model and real vehicle model is considered by using sliding mode control for the system stability. Simulation results are included to show the effectiveness of the controller.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy tracking control design for hypersonic vehicles via T-S model", "paper_id": "WOS:000288172900008"}
