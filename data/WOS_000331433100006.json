Assume that the GoS levels of the first s machines are 2 and that of the last (m - s) machines are 1 where m is the number of machines. The first problem is the lookahead version where an online algorithm is able to foresee the information of the next k jobs. The second problem is the buffer version where a buffer is available for storing at most g jobs. For the both versions, we prove that the lookahead ability or the buffer is useless for designing algorithm when k < m - s or g < min{s,m - s}. We also show that no online algorithm has a competitive ratio less than m(2)/m(m-s)+s(2) for any constant k or g. Moreover, we present two optimal online algorithms for k = m(2)-1/s + s - m and g = m - m/m(m-s)+s(2). At last, for the case with only two machines, we prove that the two algorithms can get their best possible competitive ratio when k = 1 and g = 1. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
