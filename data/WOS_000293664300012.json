These quaternary sequences are constructed by applying the inverse Gray mapping to binary sequences of odd period N with the ideal autocorrelation. Autocorrelation distribution of the proposed quaternary sequences is derived. These sequences can be used to construct quaternary sequence families of even period 2N. Family size and the maximum absolute value of correlation spectrum of the proposed quaternary sequence families are also derived.", "paper_title": "New Construction of Quaternary Sequences with Good Correlation Using Binary Sequences with Good Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664300012"}
