In this work, a new class of P systems with shuffle operation and catalytic-like rules is presented. Such a system has a membrane structure, where language-objects and shuffle-operation rules are placed in its regions. It can be used as a language generator. In this study, we propose a variant P system with shuffle operation on string-language objects. Some comparison results are obtained, which show that the power of shuffle operation is enlarged in the framework of P systems. Moreover, string-language objects are extended to array-language objects, and another variant P system with shuffle operation on picture-language objects is introduced. We also illustrate how to generate picture languages by using this kind of devices.", "paper_title": "P Systems with Shuffle Operation and Catalytic-Like Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000310430200003"}
