Our designed UEP rateless code provides high diversity on decoding probability and priority for data in different important level with overhead smaller than 0.27. By adopting this UEP rateless channel coding and scalable video source coding, our HASUR ensures symbols with basic quality to be decoded first to guarantee fluent playback experience. Besides, it also provides multiple layers to ensure the most suitable quality for fluctuant bandwidth and packet loss rate (PLR) without estimating them in advance. We evaluate our HASUR against the alternative solutions. Simulation results show that HASUR provides higher video quality and more adapts to bandwidth and PLR than other two commercial schemes under End-to-End transmission.", "paper_title": "A Novel Structure of HTTP Adaptive Streaming Based on Unequal Error Protection Rateless Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141300009"}
