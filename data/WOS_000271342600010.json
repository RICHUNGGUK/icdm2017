This formulation is an extension of the one discussed in Colagrossi and Landrini (2003) and is related to the one proposed by Hu and Adams (2006) to study multi-fluid flows. The new SPH scheme allows an accurate treatment of the discontinuity of quantities at the interface (such as the density), and permits to model flows where both interfaces and a free surface are present. The governing equations are derived following a Lagrangian variational principle leading to an Hamiltonian system of particles. The proposed formulation is validated on test cases for which reference solutions are available in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
