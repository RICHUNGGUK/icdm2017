It is maximal if it is not strictly included in another one. Such a code is complete in the sofic shift if any block of the shift occurs within some concatenation of code words. We prove that a maximal code in an irreducible sofic shift is complete in this shift. We give an explicit construction of a regular completion of a regular code in a sofic shift. This extends the well known result of Ehrenfeucht and Rozenberg to the case of codes in sofic systems. We also give a combinatorial proof of a result concerning the polynomial of a code in a sofic shift.", "paper_title": "Complete codes in a sofic shift", "paper_id": "WOS:000236464100009"}
