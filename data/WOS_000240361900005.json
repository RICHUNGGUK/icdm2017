However, this strategy is not effective for discovering potentially interesting patterns at low levels of support. Also, it tends to generate too many spurious patterns involving items which are from different support levels and are poorly correlated. In this paper, we present a framework for mining highly-correlated association patterns called hyperclique patterns. In this framework, an objective measure called h-confidence is applied to discover hyperclique patterns. We prove that the items in a hyperclique pattern have a guaranteed level of global pairwise similarity to one another as measured by the cosine similarity (uncentered Pearson's correlation coefficient). Also, we show that the h-confidence measure satisfies a cross-support property which can help efficiently eliminate spurious patterns involving items with substantially different support levels. Indeed, this cross-support property is not limited to h-confidence and can be generalized to some other association measures. In addition, an algorithm called hyperclique miner is proposed to exploit both cross-support and anti-monotone properties of the h-confidence measure for the efficient discovery of hyperclique patterns. Finally, our experimental results show that hyperclique miner can efficiently identify hyperclique patterns, even at extremely low levels of support.", "paper_title": "Hyperclique pattern discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000240361900005"}
