This method is inspired by the complex Ginzburg-Landau model and the weighted bounded variation model. Compared with active contour methods, our new algorithm can detect non-closed edges as well as quadruple junctions, and the initialization is completely automatic. The existence of the minimizer for our energy functional is proved. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed model in image denoising and segmentation.", "paper_title": "A new diffusion-based variational model for image denoising and segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242326600009"}
