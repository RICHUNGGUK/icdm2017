The simulation environment built in this paper uses Rockwell ARENA simulation software to provide a test bed for studying emergency response in a transportation network. With the data sources and assumptions used in building a roadway network with realistic traffic flow, accounting for both weather and congestion, a small study area in Western New York (WNY) provides the test bed based on real-life observations. After generating the expected movement of traffic, vehicular crashes are simulated, followed by Emergency Medical Service response. This paper focuses on the development process for building a simulation capable of modelling vehicular movement throughout a study area and a validation of the emergency vehicle travel times through historical crash response data in an existing traffic network. Its goal is to provide the basis of future work, enabling advanced transportation systems to be evaluated with respect to increased situation awareness resulting from optimized sensor placement, data fusion techniques and improved emergency response.", "paper_title": "A simulation approach to study emergency response", "paper_id": "WOS:000335366200002"}
