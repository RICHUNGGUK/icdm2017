These patterns are useful for evaluating the capabilities of workflow systems and models. In this paper we provide implementations of the workflow patterns in Orc, a new process calculus for orchestrating wide-area computations. A key feature of the Orc implementations is that they are expressed as definitions that can be reused as needed.", "paper_title": "Workflow patterns in Orc", "paper_id": "WOS:000239479100006"}
