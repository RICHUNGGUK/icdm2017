Methods. The methods of structuring information in dentistry are described and validation of structured data entry in electronic health records for forensic dentistry is performed on several real cases with the interactive DentCross component. The connection of this component to MUDR and MUDRLite electronic health records is described. Results: The use of the electronic health record MUDRLite and the interactive DentCross component to collect dental information required by standardized Disaster Victim Identification Form by Interpol for possible victim identification is shown. Conclusions: The analysis of structured data entry for dentistry using the DentCross component connected to an electronic health record showed the practical ability of the DentCross component to deliver a real service to dental care and the ability to support the identification of a person in forensic dentistry.", "paper_title": "Electronic health record for forensic dentistry", "paper_id": "WOS:000252710800003"}
