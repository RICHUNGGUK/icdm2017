Under the usual circumstances, frequent updating increases the risk of helper key-exposure. Parallel key-insulated encryption (PKIE) supports frequent key updates without increasing the risk of helper key-exposure. In an identity-based cryptosystem, a private key generator (PKG) uses a master secret key to issue private keys to users based on their identities. In this paper, we propose a new identity-based parallel key-insulated encryption (IBPKIE) scheme which achieves IND-ID-KI-CCA2 security without random oracles. Our IBPKIE scheme has short public parameters and a tight reduction with an additive factor. Hierarchical identity-based cryptography was first proposed in 2002. It allows a root PKG to distribute workload by delegating private key generation and entity authentication tasks to lower-level PKGs. In this paper, we formalize the syntax and security model for a hierarchical identity-based parallel key-insulated encryption (HIBPKIE) scheme. We then propose an HIBPKIE scheme with constant size ciphertext, and prove that it achieves IND-ID-KI-CCA2 security without random oracles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first HIBPKIE scheme up to now. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
