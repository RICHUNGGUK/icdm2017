Secondary lahars are highly destructive surface flows that originate from the mobilization of pyroclastic deposits by exceptionally heavy rainfalls. CA modelling of rain-induced lahars could be an important tool for risk management in threatened regions. LLUNPIY is a CA model, developed and partially applied on two real events: the 2005 and 2008 secondary lahars of Vascun Valley, Ecuador. Simulations are satisfying: a comparison of 2005 event was performed with the two-dimensional model Titan2D and field data, while results of 2008 event were confronted only with field data.
