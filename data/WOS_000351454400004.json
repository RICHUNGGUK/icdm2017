However, this paper deals with the opposite process of extracting new and human- comprehensible insights from emergent AI behaviour. Some examples of useful game-related insights drawn from observing AI players in action are presented.", "paper_title": "WHAT CAN GAME AI TEACH US?", "paper_id": "WOS:000351454400004"}
