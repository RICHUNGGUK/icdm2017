Development of better wind-thermal coordination economic dispatch is necessary to determine the optimal dispatch scheme that can integrate wind power reliably and efficiently. Apart from intrinsic random nature of realistic power grids intermittent nature of wind energy has added more uncertainties in studying the power systems. In this way, finding efficient probabilistic methods to inspect these uncertainties can play an important role to comfort studies. Therefore, this paper presents a novel optimization method based on Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) to cope with large non-convex Economic Dispatch (ED) problems while there are uncertainties in the network due to wind turbines. The proposed Probabilistic ED (PED) formulation includes ramp rate limits, Prohibited Operating Zones (POZs), system spinning reserve, valve loading effects, and multiple fuel options to provide a realistic model. The PED is solved based on an approach using Point Estimate Method (PEM) to model the uncertainty in wind speed. The proposed algorithm is successfully examined on different test systems and compared with several of the most recently published ED techniques.", "paper_title": "Effect of wind turbine on the economic load dispatch problem considering the wind speed uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900019"}
