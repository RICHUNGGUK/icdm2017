The stick figures can express a wide range or human motion, and they are easy to be drawn by people without any professional training. In our interface, the user can browse overall motion by viewing the stick figure images generated from the database and retrieve them directly by using sketched stick figures as an input query. We started with a preliminary survey to observe how people draw stick figures. Based on the rules observed from the user study, we developed an algorithm converting motion data to a sequence of stick figures. The feature-based comparison method between the stick figures provides an interactive and progressive search for the users. They assist the user's sketching by showing the current retrieval result at each stroke. We demonstrate the utility of the system with a user study, in which the participants retrieved example motion segments from the database with 102 motion files by using our interface.", "paper_title": "Retrieval and Visualization of Human Motion Data via Stick Figures", "paper_id": "WOS:000309461500008"}
