In this article, we examine enabling technologies for adding semantics to the IoT. Especially, we analyze data formats, which enable IoT applications consume semantic IoT data in a straightforward and general fashion, and evaluate resource usage of different alternatives with a sensor system. Our experiment illustrates encoding and decoding of different data formats and shows how big a difference a data format can make in energy consumption.
