By relying on multiscale representation of the particles, curvature estimation, and discriminant analysis for optimal separation of the categories of mixtures, a particularly effective and comprehensive methodology is obtained. The potential of the methodology is illustrated with respect to three important types of particles used in asphaltic mixtures, namely basalt, gabbro, and gravel. The obtained results show that gravel particles are markedly distinct from the other two types of particles, with the gabbro category resulting with intermediate geometrical properties. The importance of each considered measurement in the discrimination between the three categories of particles was also quantified in terms of the adopted discriminant analysis.", "paper_title": "Multiscale Curvature Analysis of Asphaltic Aggregate Particles", "paper_id": "WOS:000283195300006"}
