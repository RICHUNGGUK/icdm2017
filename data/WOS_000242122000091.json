The proposed approach allows users to be able to easily access the target information by interactively rearranging large amounts of information according to two user-centric sorting criteria, while overcoming the problems of the display size and the information overlapping. In this paper, a service migration concept is also proposed to support the task mobility which allows for the transfer of a started visualization task between different devices. In order to show the usefulness of this browsing approach, we apply the proposed browser to visualization of the query results in the heterogeneous multimedia retrieval system for the ubiquitous environment.", "paper_title": "User-centric multimedia information visualization for mobile devices in the ubiquitous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000091"}
