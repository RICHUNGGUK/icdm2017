The new scheme can assure the convergence of FIC transforms without some limiting conditions like Zhao's, and we also give the convergence proof of our new scheme in this paper. Our scheme also uses a recursive scheme feeding the coding results back to update domain pools during the coding process to improve the decoded image quality. At the end of the coding process, the \"climbing mountain\" method is used to adjust, the parameters to further improve the decoded image quality. Experimental results show our scheme can, achieve a better rate-distortion curve than conventional FIC scheme.", "paper_title": "Improving the performance of fractal image coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255300009"}
