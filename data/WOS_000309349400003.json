Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Video on Demand (VoD) streaming technologies are expected to be a key technology in the future Internet. Because the existing P2P streaming techniques are attributed to a number of shortcomings, P2P VoD schemes need to be adequately redesigned for the future Internet. In this paper, we propose a scheme to effectively provide VoD by using P2P-based mesh overlay networks that may be suitable for the future Internet. Our scheme selects the most appropriate peers by exploiting domain-based localization and congestion awareness strategies. Through simulations, our proposed scheme is demonstrated to have scalability and capability of reducing the startup delay and total link cost, while maintaining high playback rate. The results are encouraging and show the importance of redesigning P2P VoD services in future Internet.", "paper_title": "A Novel P2P VoD Streaming Technique Integrating Localization and Congestion Awareness Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000309349400003"}
