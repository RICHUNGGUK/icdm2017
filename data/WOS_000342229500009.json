Gene and protein expression patterns, from the tumor genome, are seen to facilitate individualized selection of therapies. Along with breakthroughs in biotechnology, applicable within cancer radiation biology, a new research field called Radiogenomics has been born in radiation oncology. Associating genotypes with imaging phenotypes holds promise for personalized optimal treatment. Segmentation and feature selection from the region of interest in an image are followed by correlation with the gene expression profile of the tumor in order to determine its noninvasive surrogates. This paper highlights the roles of quantitative imaging, genomics, and radiogenomics for a patient-specific tumor management.", "paper_title": "Integrating Radio Imaging With Gene Expressions Toward a Personalized Management of Cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000342229500009"}
