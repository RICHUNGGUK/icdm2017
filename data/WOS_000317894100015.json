Even if we allow epsilon-contractions and reachability predicates (with regular constraints) for pairs of configurations, the structures remain tree-automatic whence their first-order logic theories are decidable. As a corollary we obtain the tree-automaticity of the second level of the Caucal-hierarchy.", "paper_title": "COLLAPSIBLE PUSHDOWN GRAPHS OF LEVEL 2 ARE TREE-AUTOMATIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000317894100015"}
