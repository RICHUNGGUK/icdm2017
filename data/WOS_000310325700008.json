Our proposals are compared to well known RP algorithms presented in literature for two different network topologies for different network loads, distribution of load along the networks and number of translucent nodes. MSU-RP presented remarkable results and outperformed all previous approaches in all cases, while MSU-RP obtained a slightly superior or similar performance when compared to previous approaches presented in the literature.", "paper_title": "Novel strategies for sparse regenerator placement in translucent optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310325700008"}
