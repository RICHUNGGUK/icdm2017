In most cases, identification of the epileptic EEG signal is done manually by skilled professionals, who are small in number. in this paper, we try to automate the detection process. We use wavelet transform for feature extraction and obtain statistical parameters from the decomposed wavelet coefficients. A feed-forward backpropagating artificial neural network (ANN) is used for the classification. We use genetic algorithm for choosing the training set and also implement a post-classification stage using harmonic weights to increase the accuracy. Average specificity of 99.19%, sensitivity of 91.29% and selectivity of 91.14% are obtained. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
