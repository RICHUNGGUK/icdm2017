An equally important dimension of big data is variety, where the focus is to process highly heterogeneous data sets. We describe how we use semantics to address the problem of big data variety. We also describe Karma, a system that implements our approach and show how Karma can be applied to integrate data in the cultural heritage domain. In this use case, Karma integrates data across many museums even though the data sets from different museums are highly heterogeneous.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Semantics for Big Data Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000353079700004"}
