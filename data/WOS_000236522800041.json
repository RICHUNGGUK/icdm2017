The structures of carbon nanoneedles are tighter than even the smallest single wall nanotubes (SWNTs) based on (4, 0) naphthacene. The electronic properties, energetic stability of geometrical structures with various terminal units are investigated. The relatively large band gaps, the strong bonding, and additional orbital interactions within the C-4 rings and between the C-4 layers make the H-4(C-4)(n)H-4 type molecules nonmetallic. We have found indications that if the CNN (3, 0) structures are very long (in the limit of infinite-length), then they are likely to have semiconducting properties and could possibly be used as actual semiconductors. The studied families of CNNs can be considered as carbon nanostructures with unique structural and chemical properties and with possible potential for unusual electronic properties, with likely practical applications as natiomaterials and nanostructure devices.", "paper_title": "The electronic structures and properties of open-ended and capped carbon nanoneedles", "paper_id": "WOS:000236522800041"}
