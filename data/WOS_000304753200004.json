While the data structure is of independent interest, we demonstrate its use in the context of high-radiation environments. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the resulting approach leads to a significantly higher resiliency rate compared to previous results. This is especially the case for large-scale multi-spectral satellite data, which renders the proposed approach well-suited to operate aboard today's satellites.", "paper_title": "Resilient k-d trees: k-means in space revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000304753200004"}
