The empirical case of the newly emerging zinc oxide one-dimensional nanostructures is used. In line with other authors, 'problems' are visualized as those aspects guiding the dynamics of innovation systems. It is argued that the types of problems confronted by an innovation system, and in turn its dynamics of change, are imprinted on the nature of the underlying knowledge bases. The latter is operationalized through the construction of co-citation networks from scientific publications. We endow these co-citation networks with directionality through the allocation of a particular problem, drawn from a 'problem space' for nanomaterials, to each network node. By analyzing the longitudinal, structural and cognitive changes undergone by these problem-attached networks, we attempt to infer the nature of the paths of change of emerging nanotechnological innovation systems. Overall, our results stress the evolutionary mechanisms underlying change in a specific N&N subfield. It is observed that the latter may exert significant influence on the innovative potentials of nanomaterials.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary paths of change of emerging nanotechnological innovation systems: the case of ZnO nanostructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000318807000001"}
