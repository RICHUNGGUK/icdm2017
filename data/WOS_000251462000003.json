We address this problem in the context of robotic manipulation for cognitive systems, and claim that there are symbols which do not refer simply to physical objects but rather to the embodied interactions between the robot and the objects in its environment. Through the description of two manipulation experiments we offer a proposal on which to build a theory of symbolic representations for physical interactions. Some important neuroscience studies that support our view are also briefly described. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
