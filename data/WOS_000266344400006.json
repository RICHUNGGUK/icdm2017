For a complete graph, the difference of expected lengths between exponential distribution, with rate one, and uniform distribution on the interval (0, 1) is shown to be positive and of rate zeta(3)/n. For wheel graphs, precise values of expected lengths are given via calculations of the associated Tutte polynomials.", "paper_title": "On the Difference of Expected Lengths of Minimum Spanning Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000266344400006"}
