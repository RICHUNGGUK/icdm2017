Power consumption is minimized by intelligent transmission scheduling design, with the average queuing delay and joint packet loss across MAC and physical layers being confined below certain levels. The problem is formulated as an infinite horizon constrained Markov decision problem and solved by linear programming (LP) method. The primary intention of this paper is to provide a visible paradigm on using LP method to optimize the performance of mobile wireless communication systems. We elaborate the detailed mathematical solution with consistent simulation experiments and emphasize the effectiveness of adaptive transmission scheduling for cross-layer QoS provisioning.
