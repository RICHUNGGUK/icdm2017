The proposed method can design efficient DTCWTs by improving the design degrees of freedom and solving the least square solution iteratively. Because the resulting DTCWTs have good approximation accuracy of the half sample delay condition and the stopband attenuation, they provide precise shift-invariance and directionality. Finally, the proposed DTCWTs are evaluated by applying to non-linear approximation and image denoising, and showed their effectiveness, compared with the conventional DTCWTs.", "paper_title": "A Linear Optimization of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480700021"}
