The solver under consideration, which is representative of modern numerics used in industrial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, is based on a mixed element-volume method on unstructured tedrahedrisations. The parallelisation strategy combines mesh partitioning techniques, a message-passing programming model and an additive Schwarz algorithm. The parallelisation performances are analysed on a two-phase compressible flow and a turbulent flow past a square cylinder. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
