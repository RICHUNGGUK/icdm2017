The aim, using this general context, is to introduce (in a direct way) the concept of conditional belief function as a conditional generalized decomposable measure phi(.vertical bar.), defined on a set of conditional events. Our main tool will be the following result, that we prove in the first part of the article and which is a sort of converse of a well-known result (i.e., a belief function is a lower probability): a coherent conditional lower probability (P) under bar(.vertical bar K) extending a coherent probability P(H-i)-where the events H(i)s are a partition of the certain event Omega and K is the union of some (possibly all) of them-is a belief function.
