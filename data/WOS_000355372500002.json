In general, ship routing and scheduling is associated with uncertainty in weather conditions and unpredictable waiting times at ports. In this work, both sailing times and port times are considered to be stochastic parameters. A two-stage stochastic programming model with recourse is presented where the first stage consists of routing, loading and unloading decisions, and the second stage consists of scheduling and inventory decisions. The model is solved using a decomposition approach similar to an L-shaped algorithm where optimality cuts are added dynamically, and this solution process is embedded within the sample average approximation method. A computational study based on real-world instances is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
