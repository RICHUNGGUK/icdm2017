This work analyzes the infinite element created by Zhao and Valliappan and proposes a new kind of infinite element, aiming to get better solutions in situations in which the former does not give satisfactory results. This new element is also applied alternatively as a boundary condition to the system, and then extended to two-dimensional problems. Examples are solved, verifying mesh refinement and time step influence in the results and comparing the techniques, giving better results to the proposed ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
