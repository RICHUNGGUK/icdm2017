The paper describes the implementation and experimental validation of an ADACOR-based holonic manufacturing control system in a real flexible manufacturing system, using multiagent systems technology. The results extracted from a set of experimental tests allowed to verify the correctness, applicability, and merits of the ADACOR concepts and also contribute to prove the applicability of multiagent systems in industrial environments.", "paper_title": "Implementation of a holonic control system in a flexible manufacturing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000259192000007"}
