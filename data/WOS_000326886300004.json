The GUI is characterised by an easily readable, graphic visualisation of spectra, from which the absorption band depth (ABD) can be obtained for a selected wavelength. The output format of the ASD data is a binary file with an .asd extension. The binary file, that provides a single spectrum, can be processed using a software functionality, by means of a GUI, that allows to select one or more binary files to produce a spectral library in a unique .txt file. The spectral reflectance is re-calibrated with the \"convex-hull\" methodology to eliminate the convex shape, which is typical of reflectance spectra. Different examples of the use of the new GUI are provided.", "paper_title": "Two GUIs-based analysis tool for spectroradiometer data pre-processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000326886300004"}
