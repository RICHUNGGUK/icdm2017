The proposed system first decomposes the document image into distinct object planes to separate homogeneous objects, including textual regions of interest, non-text objects (such as graphics and pictures) and background textures. A knowledge-based text extraction and identification method accurately detects and extracts text lines with different characteristics from each object plane. Afterwards, a computationally efficient text removal and inpainting process, based on an effective adaptive inpainting neighborhood adjustment scheme, is applied to the obtained text-line regions to produce a clear non-text restored background image. Experimental and comparative results demonstrate that the proposed system can provide accurate extraction of text-line regions of interest with diverse illumination levels, sizes and font styles from various complex compound document images, and can effectively and computationally produce clear and well-preserved non-text background images with satisfactory visual quality for further applications.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATIC TEXT EXTRACTION, REMOVAL AND INPAINTING OF COMPLEX DOCUMENT IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648200021"}
