We first study the case of maximum-likelihood decoding, and show that the design criterion is rather straightforward. Since optimal constructions for maximum-likelihood decoding do not perform well under iterative decoding, we introduce a new family of full-diversity LDPC codes that exhibit near-outage-limit performance under iterative decoding for all block-lengths. This family competes favorably with multiplexed parallel turbo codes for nonergodic channels.", "paper_title": "Low-Density Parity-Check Codes for Nonergodic Block-Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400008"}
