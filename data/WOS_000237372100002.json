The system is based on compiling propositional instances of relational Bayesian networks into arithmetic circuits and then performing online inference by evaluating and differentiating these circuits in time linear in their size. We report on experimental results showing successful compilation and efficient inference oil relational Bayesian networks, whose Primula-generated propositional instances have thousands of variables, and whose jointrees have clusters with hundreds of variables.
