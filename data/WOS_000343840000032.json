The POPF model for wind-integration power system is firstly proposed. Two kinds of schemes in point estimate method, 2m and 2m+1 scheme, are then employed to solve the POPF. Moreover, the correlation samples of nodal injections are generated by the Cholesky decomposition method, and the path following interior point method is employed to solve the deterministic optimal power flow calculation. Finally, the proposed method is tested on the modified 5-bus and IEEE 30-bus test system. Simulation results show that 2m+1 scheme is feasible and effective to solve the POPF for wind-integration power system. Also, it is seen that correlated loads affect the POPF results, and the POPF with load correlation would reflect the system operation more accurately. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
