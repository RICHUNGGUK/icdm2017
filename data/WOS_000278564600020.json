We show that for n = 2(k) the formula obtained above is an essentially unique one that computes Parity(x(1), ... , x(n)) with size n(2). In the equivalent framework of the Karchmer-Wigderson communication game, our result means that an optimal protocol for the parity of 2(k) variables is essentially unique. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
