Instead of considering the MHD generator as a constant voltage source or a constant flow source, a simple and effective iteration is provided and successfully practiced to simulate the interaction between the MHD generator and the outer circuit so that they obey the Ohm's Law and the Kirchhoff's Law with sufficient accuracy set by user. The objective of this research is to have more detailed knowledge of the characteristics of MHD generators with incompressible medium, including the spatial variances of velocity and electromagnetic variables. In the calculations, two significant non-dimensional parameters Hac and Rec, whose influences on velocity and electromagnetic variables are elaborately discussed, are deduced from the governing equations. In general, Hac, proportional to the applied magnetic field, has negative effects on the variables discussed but Rec, corresponding to the driven pressure, has opposite effects.
