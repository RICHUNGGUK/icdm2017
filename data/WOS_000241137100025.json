In this paper, the concept of case management is introduced, which specifically targets this type of support. Its associated technology is intended to be used as a harmonious extension of workflow technology, instead of a competing system. A discussion in some depth is presented of the concept, methods, and technology of case management, as well as experiences with its application in industry.", "paper_title": "Introducing case management: Opening workflow management's black box", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137100025"}
