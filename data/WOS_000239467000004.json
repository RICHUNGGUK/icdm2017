The proposed brake system consists of rotating disks immersed in a MR fluid and enclosed in an electromagnet, which the yield stress of the fluid varies as a function of the magnetic field applied by the electromagnet. The controllable yield stress causes friction on the rotating disk surfaces, thus generating a retarding brake torque. The braking torque can be precisely controlled by changing the current applied to the electromagnet. In this paper, an optimum MRB design with two rotating disks is proposed based on a design optimization procedure using simulated annealing combined with finite element simulations involving magnetostatic, fluid flow and heat transfer analysis. The performance of the MRB in a vehicle was studied using a quarter vehicle model. A sliding mode controller was designed for an optimal wheel slip control, and the control simulation results show fast anti-lock braking. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
