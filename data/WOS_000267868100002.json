The specific binding site may consist of just a few base-pairs while the DNA is usually several millions of base-pairs long. How does the protein search for the target site? What is the most efficient mechanism for a successful search? Motivated by these fundamental questions on intracellular biological processes, we have developed a model for searching a specific site on a model DNA by a single protein. We have made a comparative quantitative study on the efficiencies of sliding, intersegmental hoppings and detachment/re-attachments of the particle during its search for the specific site on the DNA. We also introduce some new quantitative measures of efficiency of a search process by defining a relevant quantity, which can be measured in in-vitro experiments", "paper_title": "SEARCHING FOR TARGETS ON A MODEL DNA: EFFECTS OF INTER-SEGMENT HOPPING, DETACHMENT, AND RE-ATTACHMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000267868100002"}
