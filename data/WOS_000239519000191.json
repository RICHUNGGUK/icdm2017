Actually almost every educational program has a model, but most of them remain implicit. In this paper we propose a methodology for developing educational software for children with visual disabilities. Multimedia software for these children has some particularities reflected on our model with emphasis on process modelling including learner evaluation and feedback. The model emerges from research on developing educational software for children with visual disabilities and studies concerning the design of educational software for sighted learners. The model was validated by special education teachers and software designers trying the model with five software products based on model heuristics.", "paper_title": "Modeling 3D interactive environments for learners with visual disabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000191"}
