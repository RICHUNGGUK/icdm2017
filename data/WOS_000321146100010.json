The aging population, the increasing cost of formal health care, the caregiver burden, and the importance that the individuals place on living independently, all motivate development of innovative-assisted living technologies for safe and independent aging. In this survey, we will summarize the emergence of 'ambient-assisted living\" (AAL) tools for older adults based on ambient intelligence paradigm. We will summarize the state-of-the-art AAL technologies, tools, and techniques, and we will look at current and future challenges.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Ambient-Assisted Living Tools for Older Adults", "paper_id": "WOS:000321146100010"}
