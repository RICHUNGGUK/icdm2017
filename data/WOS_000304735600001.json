Additionally, when third parties, such as system integrators, want to compare results among different algorithm providers, they cannot do so easily for several reasons: difficulty accessing large databases, inability to exchange biometric data among researchers due to data protection laws in some countries, or the lack comprehensive and standardised evaluation reports. This paper presents a new performance evaluation system for biometric systems that is secure, automatic and remote. This system has been developed using current standards developed within ISO/IEC JTC1/SC37 for data Formats, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and evaluation methodology. Standardised technology is able to provide developers in biometrics and third parties with a way to perform comprehensive evaluations remotely and with 24/7 availability without compromising the privacy of the individuals included in the test crew. The solution described here offers the developers the ability to evaluate large databases that are stored in a secured centralised server. As this system is modality-independent, researchers can use the same protocol to perform different evaluations, and therefore lower the overhead costs for testing purposes. Additionally, such protocols can be plugged directly into end-user applications, minimising technology transfer costs. The system is described by block diagrams as well as flowcharts.
