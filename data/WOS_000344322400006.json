An edge is called shared if it is used in more than one of the paths. We provide a -approximation algorithm for this problem, improving the best previous approximation factor of . We also provide the first approximation algorithm for the problem with a sublinear approximation factor of , where is the number of vertices in the input graph. For sparse graphs, such as bounded-degree and planar graphs, we show that the approximation factor of our algorithm can be improved to . While the problem is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate to within an factor, we show that the problem is polynomially solvable when is a constant. This settles an open problem posed by Omran et al. regarding the complexity of the problem for small values of . We present most of our results in a more general form where each edge of the graph has a sharing cost and a sharing capacity, and there is a vulnerability parameter that determines the number of times an edge can be used among different paths before it is counted as a shared/vulnerable edge.", "paper_title": "The Minimum Vulnerability Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000344322400006"}
