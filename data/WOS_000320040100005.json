A ray-tracing technique is developed to calculate channel frequency responses in an indoor environment, of which the frequency dependence for the dielectric constant and the conductivity are carefully considered. By using the frequency responses, the channel capacities with single co-channel interference are calculated. The outage probability of the channel capacities are also calculated for analyzing the channel statistical property. Furthermore, some useful channel statistical parameters are also investigated for different material partitions.
