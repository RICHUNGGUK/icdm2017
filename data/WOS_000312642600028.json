Multi-UAV system with advanced cooperative control algorithms has advantages over single UAV system, especially in time urgent tasks such as detecting nuclear radiation before deploying the salvage. This paper considers two scenarios for nuclear radiation detection using multiple UAVs, of which contour mapping of the nuclear radiation is simulated. Then, for real applications, this paper presents a low-cost UAV platform with built-in formation flight control architecture together with a formulated standard flight test routine. Three experimental formation flight scenarios that imitate the nuclear detection missions are prepared for contour mapping of nuclear radiation field in 3D space.", "paper_title": "Low-cost Multi-UAV Technologies for Contour Mapping of Nuclear Radiation Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000312642600028"}
