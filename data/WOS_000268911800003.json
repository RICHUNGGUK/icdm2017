This study proposes an adaptation for the trapeziometacarpal joint. The definition of the segment coordinate system of both trapezium and first metacarpal is based on functional anatomy. The definition of the joint coordinate system (JCS) is guided by the two degrees of freedom of the joint, i.e. flexion-extension about a trapezium axis and abduction-adduction about a first metacarpal axis. The rotations obtained using three methods are compared on the same data: the fixed axes sequence proposed by Cooney et al., the mobile axes sequence proposed by the ISB and our alternative mobile axes sequence. The rotation amplitudes show a difference of 9 degrees in flexion-extension, 2 degrees in abduction-adduction and 13 degrees in internal-external rotation. This study emphasizes the importance of adapting the JCS to the functional anatomy of each particular joint.", "paper_title": "A joint coordinate system proposal for the study of the trapeziometacarpal joint kinematics", "paper_id": "WOS:000268911800003"}
