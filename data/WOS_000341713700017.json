Design/methodology/approach - To presents the efficiency evaluation of 5MW wind turbine generating systems, two 5MW surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) with medium and low rated voltage is designed. A two-level transistor converter is considered for ac/dc conversion. Three different dc-link voltage levels are used. By using these voltage levels the PMSG is utilized in slightly different ways. Findings - It is found that the system with the lower voltage machine has slightly higher annual energy efficiency compare to the higher voltage system. Furthermore, it is shown that the best choice for the dc-link voltage level is a voltage between the minimum voltage which gives the desired torque and the voltage which gives Maximum Torque Per Ampere. Originality/value - A procedure as well as investigations with quantified results on how to find the highest complete drive system efficiency for a wind turbine application. Based on two given PMSG, the most energy-efficient dc-link voltage has been established.", "paper_title": "DC-link voltage selection for a multi-MW wind turbine", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713700017"}
