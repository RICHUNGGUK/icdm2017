Multiplicative noises are assumed to be linearly dependent of the state and control input Of the DTFTCS. Second moment stochastic stability for the proposed bilinear DTFTCS actuated by a state feedback control law) with constant gains is characterized. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived in terms of nonlinear matrix inequalities. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a stabilizing controller that guarantee second moment stability and 6-level of disturbance rejection are derived. The conditions are stated in terms of feasibility solutions for a set of linear matrix, inequalities (LMI). An M-driven stabilizing controller is synthesized.", "paper_title": "BILINEAR DISCRETE FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL SYSTEMS: CONTROLLER DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000261409800028"}
