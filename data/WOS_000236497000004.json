The user needs to input a series of points and the accompanied dimensionality n and the tool will produce via the genetic programming paradigm a function f : R-n --> R which is an approximate solution to the symbolic regression problem. The tool is entirely written in ANSI C++ and it can be installed in any UNIX system.
