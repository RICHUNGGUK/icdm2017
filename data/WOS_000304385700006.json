Here we develop a PharmacoKinetics Knowledge Base (PKKB) to compile comprehensive information about ADMET properties into a single electronic repository. We incorporate more than 10 000 experimental ADMET measurements of 1685 drugs into the PKKB. The ADMET properties in the PKKB include octanol/water partition coefficient, solubility, dissociation constant, intestinal absorption, Caco-2 permeability, human bioavailability, plasma protein binding, blood-plasma partitioning ratio, volume of distribution, metabolism, half-life, excretion, urinary excretion, clearance, toxicity, half lethal dose in rat or mouse, etc. The PKKB provides the most extensive collection of freely available data for ADMET properties up to date. All these ADMET properties, as well as the pharmacological information and the calculated physiochemical properties are integrated into a web-based information system. Eleven separated data sets for octanol/water partition coefficient, solubility, blood-brain partitioning, intestinal absorption, Caco-2 permeability, human oral bioavailability, and P-glycoprotein inhibitors have been provided for free download and can be used directly for ADMET modeling. The PKKB is available online at http://cadd.suda.edu.cn/admet.", "paper_title": "ADMET Evaluation in Drug Discovery. 11.
