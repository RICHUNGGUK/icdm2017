In order to display a real 3D scene using an image-based rendering technique, we have also proposed a camera system that captures light ray data needed for reconstructing 3D images by reconstructing parallax rays from multiple images captured from multiple viewpoints. However, to reconstruct a 3D image of a real 3D object, many parallax images are required. In order to reduce the number of required images, we have proposed an interpolation algorithm suitable for a thin 3D display, as well as a method of estimating the minimum number of required cameras. In this paper, we describe a 3D camera system for a thin 3D display, and we present experimental results. When the distance between the proposed 3D camera system and a real 3D object was 380 mm and the depth dimension of the 3D object was 100 mm, the proposed 3D camera system, consisting of 12 cameras, can obtain sufficient 3D light ray data. Experimental results confirm that 3D images were reconstructed on the thin 3D display system from the obtained 3D light ray data.
