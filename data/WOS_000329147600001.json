Using these new operations, the properties of type-2 fuzzy relations are discussed, especially the compositions of type-2 fuzzy relations. On this basis, this paper introduces interval-valued type-2 fuzzy sets and interval-valued type-2 fuzzy relations, and discusses their properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
