The desired structure is typically generated via manual tracing within this model. When model-based segmentation is applied to human cortical data, problems arise if left-right comparisons are desired. The asymmetry of the human cortex requires that both left and right models of a structure be composed in order to effectively segment the desired structures. Paradoxically, defining a model in both hemi-spheres carries a likelihood of introducing bias to one of the structures. This paper describes a novel technique for creating a symmetric average model in which both hemispheres are equally represented and thus left-right comparison is possible. This work is an extension of that proposed by Guimond et al [1]. Hippocampal segmentation is used as a test-case in a cohort of 118 normal eld-erly subjects and results are compared with expert manual tracing.", "paper_title": "Symmetric atlasing and model based segmentation: An application to the hippocampus in older adults", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700008"}
