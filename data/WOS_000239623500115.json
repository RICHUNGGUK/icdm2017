The proposed method also improves data pre-processing step by identifying important features for intrusion detection. Furthermore, we develop a learning algorithm to find classifiers for imbalanced training data to avoid some assumptions made in most learning algorithms that are not necessarily sound. Preliminary experimental results indicate that our approach is very effective in anomaly detection.", "paper_title": "FADS: A fuzzy anomaly detection system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500115"}
