Our approach is based on using fuzzy clustering as a sufficiently explainable method to describe the distribution of an object over the classification structure. We extend the conventional blocking regression model by using two types of degrees. One is the degree of belongingness of an object to a fuzzy cluster and the other is the degree of uncertainty of the object to the classification Structure. This extension has the following merits: (1) the fitness is improved due to the increase in the degree of freedom of the clustering result. (2) we can simultaneously capture the relationship between the fuzzy clusters and a dependent variable along with the relationship between the independent variables and a dependent variable. (3) objectively obtained clusters can be used, in spite of this, conventional blocking regression requires external information to identify the clusters. (4) by considering not only the degree of belonging to a single cluster, but also the relatively related degree of clusters for a fixed object, we can avoid the noise of the data. Several numerical examples show improved performance in terms of the fitness for the proposed model.", "paper_title": "FUZZY REGRESSION MODELS ON ENTROPY BASED BLOCKING STRUCTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400003"}
