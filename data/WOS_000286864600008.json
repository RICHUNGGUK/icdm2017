Complexity is dealt with by exploiting statechart-based actors which constitute the basic building blocks of a model. Actors are lightweight reactive autonomous agents that communicate to one another by asynchronous message passing. The threadless character of actors saves memory space and fosters efficient execution. The behaviour of actors is specified through \"distilled statecharts\" that enable hierarchical and modular specifications. Distributed simulation is achieved by partitioning a system model among a set of logical processes (theatres). Timing management and inter-theatre communications rest in a case on the High Level Architecture services. The paper illustrates the practical application of the proposed modelling and simulation methodology by specifying and analysing a complex manufacturing system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
