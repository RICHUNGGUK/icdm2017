The proposed algorithm, called model-based reconstruction, performs an accurate IMM smoothing process whose parameters are modified along time according to the flight modes segmented from trajectory measurements. Its competitive performance is demonstrated through comparison with previous reconstruction methods used in ATC and with classical IMM smoothing, using simulated data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
