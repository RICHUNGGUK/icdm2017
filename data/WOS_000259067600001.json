We then solve the resulting harmonic Dirichlet problems efficiently using the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) in conjunction with fast fourier transforms (FFTs). This technique is extended to harmonic Dirichlet problems in doubly-connected domains which are now mapped onto annular domains. The solution of the resulting harmonic Dirichlet problems can be carried out equally efficiently using the MFS with FFTs. Several numerical examples are presented.", "paper_title": "Conformal mapping for the efficient MFS solution of Dirichlet boundary value problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259067600001"}
