We use two level set functions to model the open contour and find the end points of the open contour as the intersection of the two level set functions. The evolutions of both level set functions do not depend on the gradient of the images, as in the classical geometric deformable models, but are decided by a region-based '' band velocity ''. The '' band velocity '' is different from region information introduced by other deformable models which can only be used to find the closed contours in images, it is designed for evolutions of both closed and open contours and particularly unique for contours which are open and do not enclose any region. Prior shape information is also integrated into the contour evolution process, which prevents two level set functions from intersecting at other places than at the contour end points. With the described method open contours can be recovered from noisy images. Successful experiments on several data sets are presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "A level set approach for shape recovery of open contours", "paper_id": "WOS:000235772300061"}
