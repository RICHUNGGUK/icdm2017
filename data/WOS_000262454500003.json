PADDLE supports several variations of context-sensitive analyses, including call site strings and object sensitivity, and context-sensitively specializes both pointer variables and the heap abstraction. We empirically evaluate the precision of these context-sensitive analyses on significant Java programs. We find that that object-sensitive analyses are more precise than comparable variations of the other approaches, and that specializing the heap abstraction improves precision more than extending the length of context strings.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the Benefits of Context-Sensitive Points-to Analysis Using a BDD-Based Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000262454500003"}
