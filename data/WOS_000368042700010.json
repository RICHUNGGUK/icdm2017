The systems are assumed to be bounded by a more general form than a class of feedforward systems satisfying a linear growth condition in the unmeasurable states multiplying by unknown growth rates and continuous functions of the inputs or delayed inputs. Using the dynamic gain scaling technique and choosing the appropriate Lyapunov Krasovskii functionals, we explicitly construct the universal output feedback controllers such that all the states of the closed-loop system are globally bounded and the states of large-scale uncertain systems converge to zero.", "paper_title": "OUTPUT FEEDBACK REGULATION FOR LARGE-SCALE UNCERTAIN NONLINEAR SYSTEMS WITH TIME DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000368042700010"}
