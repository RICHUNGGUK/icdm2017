This will enable attendees to better interpret and critically evaluate the results of studies that use this measure. It will also give them an introduction to the advantages of using eye fixation data and the effort involved in setting up an eye-tracking laboratory and analyzing eye fixation data. The tutorial will also identify problems in the analysis and interpretation of eye fixations that might lead to the development of new software tools for analyzing and interpreting this type of data.", "paper_title": "Eye fixations and diagrammatic reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000239625600002"}
