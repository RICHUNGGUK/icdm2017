In this paper, the ensemble information is described by data cluster association matrix. However, most data cluster association matrix overlooks an important type of information about the relationship between clusters. This paper proposes a new method WETU to refine the data cluster association matrix with link-based similarity measure. The refined data cluster association matrix is obtained according to the similarity of clusters among all base clustering results, not in one base clustering result. In addition, WETU can provide more discriminative information than CSM and WTU. The data cluster association matrix is refined into high level real-valued matrix, which can be aggregated by real-valued method, such as Global k-means. Experiments on synthetic dataset and UCI datasets show that the proposed method outperforms standard K-means, base clustering algorithm and CSM+Global k-means and WTU+Global k-means.T.", "paper_title": "An improved clustering ensemble method based link analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000349608400001"}
