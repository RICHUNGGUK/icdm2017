We obtain the first exponential lower bound on the sign-rank of a function in AC(0). Namely, let f(x, y) = Lambda(i=1,) (...,m) V-j=1,V- (...,m2) (x(ij) Lambda y(ij)). We show that the matrix [f(x, y)] x, y has sign-rank exp(Omega(m)). This in particular implies that Sigma(cc)(2) not subset of UPPcc, which solves a longstanding open problem in communication complexity posed by Babai, Frankl, and Simon [Proceedings of the 27th Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 1986, pp. 337-347]. Our result additionally implies a lower bound in learning theory. Specifically, let phi(1), ..., phi(r) : {0, 1}(n) --> R be functions such that every DNF formula f : {0, 1}(n) --> {-1, +1} of polynomial size has the representation f equivalent to sgn(a(1)phi(1) + ... + a(r)phi(r)) for some reals a(1), ..., a(r). We prove that then r >= exp(Omega(n(1/3))), which essentially matches an upper bound of exp((O) over tilde (n(1/3))), due to Klivans and Servedio [J. Comput. System Sci., 68 (2004), pp. 303-318]. Finally, our work yields the first exponential lower bound on the size of threshold-of-majority circuits computing a function in AC(0). This substantially generalizes and strengthens the results of Krause and Pudlak [Theoret. Comput. Sci., 174 (1997), pp. 137-156].", "paper_title": "THE SIGN-RANK OF AC(0)", "paper_id": "WOS:000277584700006"}
