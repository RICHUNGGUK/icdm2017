In this paper, we present a discrete approach to MIR based upon optimizing the labeling of fractional volume elements within a discretization of the problem's original domain. We detail how to construct and initially label a discretization, and introduce a volume conservative swap move for optimization. Furthermore, we discuss methods for extracting and visualizing material interfaces from the discretization. Our technique has significant advantages over previous methods: we produce interfaces between multiple materials that are continuous across cell boundaries for time-varying and static data in arbitrary dimension with bounded error", "paper_title": "Discrete multi-material interface reconstruction for volume fraction data", "paper_id": "WOS:000257075000039"}
