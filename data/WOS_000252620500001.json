The cancor () function in R (R Development Core Team 2007) performs the core of computations but further work was required to provide the user with additional tools to facilitate the interpretation of the results. We implemented an R package, CCA, freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN, http://CRAN.R-project.org/), to develop numerical and graphical outputs and to enable the user to handle missing values. The CCA package also includes a regularized version of CCA to deal with datasets with more variables than units. Illustrations are given through the analysis of a dataset coming from a nutrigenomic study in the mouse.", "paper_title": "CCA: An R package to extend canonical correlation analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000252620500001"}
