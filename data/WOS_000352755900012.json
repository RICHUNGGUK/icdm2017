In cloud storage, date security properties such as data confidentiality, integrity and availability become more and more important in many commercial applications. Recently, many provable data possession (PDP) schemes are proposed to protect data integrity. In some cases, it has to delegate the remote data possession checking task to some proxy. However, these PDP schemes are not secure since the proxy stores some state information in cloud storage servers. Hence, in this paper, we propose an efficient mutual verifiable provable data possession scheme, which utilizes Diffie-Hellman shared key to construct the homomorphic authenticator. In particular, the verifier in our scheme is stateless and independent of the cloud storage service. It is worth noting that the presented scheme is very efficient compared with the previous PDP schemes, since the bilinear operation is not required.", "paper_title": "Mutual Verifiable Provable Data Auditing in Public Cloud Storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000352755900012"}
