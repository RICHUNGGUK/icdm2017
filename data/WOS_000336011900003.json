For the first time, exact expressions are given for the negentropy, the differential entropy, and related quantities such as integral(infinity)(-infinity)integral(r)(x)/phi(r-1)(x)dx for r = 2,3,... in terms of cumulants. Several advantages of our expressions over known ones are pointed out. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
