The Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP) is to schedule the work activities for a set of cranes assigned to a single berthed vessel with the objective of minimizing the completion time of all container handling tasks. The problem is complicated by special characteristics of QC operations. Considering QC moving time and interference constraints, the concept of contiguous bay operations is proposed and a heuristic is developed to generate QC schedules with this feature. The heuristic is efficient and effective: it has polynomial computational complexity, and it produces schedules with a completion time objective bounded above by a small increment over the optimal completion time. Importantly, the heuristic guarantees that no quay cranes are idle due to interference. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the optimality gap is small for practical instances.
