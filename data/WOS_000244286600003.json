We also discover the geometric meaning of the auxiliary control points during the corner cutting. Our main idea is to gradually elevate the degree of B-spline curves one knot interval by one knot interval. To this end, a new class of basis functions, to be called bi-degree B-spline basis functions, is constructed and discussed by the integral definition of spline. The transformation formulas between usual and bi-degree B-spline basis functions leads to the corner cutting for degree elevation of B-spline curves. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
