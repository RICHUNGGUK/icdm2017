Otherwise, we could have large scale crowd simulations where only a small percentage of the population is displayed. Several approaches have been proposed in order to efficiently render crowds of animated characters. However, these approaches either render crowds animated with simple behaviors or they can only support a few hundreds of user-driven entities. In this paper, we propose a distributed visualization system for large crowds of autonomous agents that allows the visualization of crowds animated with complex behaviors without adding significant overhead to the simulation servers. The proposed implementation can be hosted on dedicated computers different from the servers, and it takes advantage of the Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) capabilities. As a result, the performance evaluation shows that thousands of agents can be rendered without affecting the system performance. Also, the results show that the design of the visual client allows to add multiple visuals for displaying large crowds.", "paper_title": "A distributed visualization system for crowd simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000295356300004"}
