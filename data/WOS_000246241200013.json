Design/methodology/approach - The paper starts with an overview and a conceptualisation. The empirical part is based on a national RIS 2005 representative telephone survey (n = 727) of companies in Slovenia. With respect to ICT developments the Republic of Slovenia, situated between Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, is a typical (median) country of the European Union. Findings - The size of ICT investments strongly determined the perception of ICT investments, but it had surprisingly little impact on its structure (i.e. hardware, software, education...). Satisfaction with ICT investments was relatively low, particular in small companies. One reason for this was the suboptimal implementation, particularly the lack of accompanying measures (e.g. education, organisational changes). The ICT investments brought considerable changes for the internal organisation and communication, but much less for the management. The clearest effect of ICT investments was the greater need to educate the employees. Practical implications - More attention is needed to the accompanying managerial, communication, education and organisational measures of ICT investments, particularly in small companies, Originality/value - The paper sheds light on the structure of seven components (hardware, software, telecommunications, education...) of an ICT investment (as perceived by ICT managers). Hardware is diminishing as a stand-alone ICT component. The paper also exposes the problem of a relatively low level of satisfaction with ICT investments. It analysed the link between the size of ICT investments and the evaluation rating given by ICT managers.", "paper_title": "Characteristics and impacts of ICT investments: perceptions among managers", "paper_id": "WOS:000246241200013"}
