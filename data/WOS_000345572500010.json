Such meshes are essential in the field of architectural design and rationalization. By using homogeneous coordinates to describe vertices, we can parametrize the entire shape space of planar-preserving deformations with bilinear equations. The generality of this space allows for polyhedral geometric processing methods to be conducted with ease. We demonstrate its usefulness in planar-quadrilateral mesh subdivision, a resulting multi-resolution editing algorithm, and novel shape-space exploration with prescribed transformations. Furthermore, we show that our shape space is a discretization of a continuous space of conjugate-preserving projective transformation fields on surfaces. Our shape space directly addresses planar-quad meshes, on which we put a focus, and we further show that our framework naturally extends to meshes with faces of more than four vertices as well.", "paper_title": "A Projective Framework for Polyhedral Mesh Modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000345572500010"}
