However, current health condition prediction approaches are not accurate enough, which has become the bottleneck for achieving the full power of CBM. Neural network based methods have been considered to be a very promising category of methods for equipment health condition prediction. In this paper, we propose a neural network prediction model called extended recurrent neural network (ERNN). An ERNN based approach is developed for health condition prediction of gearboxes based on the vibration data collected from a gearbox experimental system. The results demonstrate the capability of the ERNN based approach for producing satisfactory health condition prediction results. A comparative study based on the gearbox experiment data further establishes ERNN as an effective recurrent neural network model for equipment health condition prediction.", "paper_title": "Health Condition Prediction of Gears Using a Recurrent Neural Network Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000284844900011"}
