The study is aimed at investigating the effects of stiffer ceramic components on the stress/strain-related failure mechanisms in the resurfaced femur, using three-dimensional finite element models of intact and resurfaced femurs with varying stem-bone interface conditions. Tensile stresses in the cement varied between 1 and 5 MPa. Postoperatively, 20-85% strain shielding was observed inside the resurfaced head. The variability in stem-bone interface condition strongly influenced the stresses and strains generated within the resurfaced femoral head. For full stem-bone contact, high tensile (151-158 MPa) stresses were generated at the cup-stem junction, indicating risk of fracture. Moreover, there was risk of femoral neck fracture due to elevated bone strains (0.60-0.80% strain) in the proximal femoral neck region. Stresses in the ceramic component are reduced if a frictionless gap condition exists at the stem-bone interface. High stresses, coupled with increased strain shielding in the ceramic resurfaced femur, appear to be major concerns regarding its use as an alternative material.", "paper_title": "Design considerations for ceramic resurfaced femoral head: effect of interface characteristics on failure mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000276628100001"}
