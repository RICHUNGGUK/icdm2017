Such attack combines vulnerabilities existing on different systems/services and are potentially more harmful than single point attacks. One of the methods for analyzing such security vulnerabilities in an enterprise network is the use of attack graph. It is a complete graph which gives a succinct representation of different attack scenarios, depicted by attack paths. An attack path is a logical succession of exploits, where each exploit in the series satisfies the preconditions for subsequent exploits and makes a causal relationship among them. Thus analysis of the attack graph may help in assessing network security from hackers' perspective. One of the intrinsic problems with the generation and analysis of such a complete attack graph is its scalability. In this work, an approach based on Planner, a special purpose search algorithm from artificial intelligence domain, has been proposed for time-efficient, scalable representation of the attack graphs. Further, customized algorithms have been developed for automatic generation of attack paths (using Planner as a low-level module). The analysis shows that generation of attack graph using the customized algorithms can be done in polynomial time. A case study has also been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "A planner-based approach to generate and analyze minimal attack graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000300657400008"}
