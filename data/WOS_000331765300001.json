To evaluate this system, the testing platform of the networked motion control system for ocean wave maker is designed. The paper gives the detailed design for the testing platform including software and hardware. With message access delay and jitter, a set of experiments are done to evaluate the crucial performance for the implemented networked motion control system. By analyzing the experimental results, the systemic performance is verified. And the design approach can be widely extended to other automation application scenarios.", "paper_title": "Design Approach Based on EtherCAT Protocol for a Networked Motion Control System", "paper_id": "WOS:000331765300001"}
