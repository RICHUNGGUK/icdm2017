Exascale compute and data storage architectures will be critically dependent on the interconnection network. The most popular interconnection network for current and future supercomputer systems is the torus (eg, k-ary, n-cube). This paper focuses on the modelling and simulation of ultra-large-scale torus networks using Rensselaer's Optimistic Simulator System. We compare real communication delays between our model and the actual torus network from Blue Gene/L using 2048 processors. Our performance experiments demonstrate the ability to simulate million-node to billion-node torus networks. The torus network model for a 16-million-node configuration shows a high degree of strong scaling when going from 1024 cores to 32 768 cores on Blue Gene/L, with a peak event-rate of nearly 5 billion events per second. We also demonstrate the performance of our torus network model configured with 1 billion nodes on both Blue Gene/L and Blue Gene/P systems. The observed best event rate at 128K cores is 12.36 billion per second on Blue Gene/P.
