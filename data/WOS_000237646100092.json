The proposed method reduces the time to complete the handover by exchanging the binding update message protected by the secret materials formed from the interaction between 802.11 and FMIP processing during the handover. The result shows the cost-efficiency reduced up to 35% and 27% in comparing with MIPv6 and Fast Handover, respectively.", "paper_title": "An authentication scheme between wireless LAN and mobile 1Pv6 during handover", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100092"}
