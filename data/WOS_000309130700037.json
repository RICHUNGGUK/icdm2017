The chip includes the photo sensor, amplifier and digital decision core, and driver circuits. The photo-sensor is implemented with the p+/n- well diodes to generate the photo current with the array of diodes. Following, the operational amplifier is used to enhance the signal level, in which the gain is adjustable to control the detected sensitivity from the photo-sensor. Next, the digital controller is designed to keep a stable status for the output level while the twilight slowly changing from dark-to-bright or bright-to-dark. The LED driver is implemented to increase the output current in the last stage. The photo control chip is successfully implemented with TSMC 0.35 mu m MOS technology, which the core size is about 928.7 x 807.1 mu m.", "paper_title": "Photovoltaic lighting control with single chip integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700037"}
