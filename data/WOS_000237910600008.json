However, it is much useful to let every node identifier carry more characteristics of the node itself. This paper introduces the naming problem for sensor networks in the literature for the first time, and proposes a location-based naming mechanism (LBN) for sensor networks, in which location information is embedded into node identifier and acts as an inherent node characteristic to provide authentication service in local access control. When LBN is enforced, the impacts of many attacks to sensor network topology can be limited in a small area. A link layer authentication (LLA) scheme is also proposed to further decrease the impacts of those attacks. Our LBN and LLA can be combined and act as an efficient solution against a wide range of attacks in sensor networks.
