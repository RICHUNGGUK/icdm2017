A 'single location in-a-cluster' technique is proposed to diagnose multiple defects that may not be diagnosed by traditional 'single location at-a-time' technique. A statistics technique, 'analysis of variance', is conducted to reduce noise from random defects. Simulations on five ISCAS'89 circuit demonstrate the effectiveness of the authors' techniques. An experiment on an industrial design manufactured in 55 nm technology discovered a suspected culprit physical feature.", "paper_title": "Physical-aware systematic multiple defect diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000341185100001"}
