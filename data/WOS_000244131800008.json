It incorporates a filter ranking method in the traditional genetic algorithm to improve classification performance and accelerate the search in identifying the core feature subsets. Particularly, the method adds or deletes a feature from a candidate feature subset based on the univariate feature ranking information. This empirical study on commonly used data sets from the University of California, Irvine repository and microarray data sets shows that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of classification accuracy, number of selected features, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate several major issues of memetic algorithm (MA) to identify a good balance between local search and genetic search so as to maximize search quality and efficiency in the hybrid filter and wrapper MA.", "paper_title": "Wrapper-filter feature selection algorithm using a memetic framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000244131800008"}
