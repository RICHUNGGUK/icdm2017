The presented heuristics aim at saving power by reducing processor back-end size dynamically and at a cluster level. They do this by occasionally shutting down or gating one of the clusters in a multi-cluster processor. The success of the heuristics depends on power-efficient techniques that can identify times when a processor back-end may be downsized safely (i.e., without performance cost). This paper suggests techniques that work by estimating (a) branch confidence, (b) the available instruction-level parallelism, and (c) instruction flow. It shows that, on average, these methods reduce total energy consumption for a subset of Spec2000 benchmarks by 16% and 10% for dual- and quad-cluster processors respectively. Unlike many energy optimization techniques that trade energy for performance, the proposed techniques reduce energy consumption while improving performance for most benchmarks since they reduce the number of clustering-induced stalls. The best technique yields an average performance improvement of 3.9% for dual-cluster processors and an average performance loss of only 1% for quad-cluster processors.", "paper_title": "Energy-aware dynamic resource allocation heuristics for clustered processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000240087900002"}
