In our work, face area is first located initially using an illumination invariant face skin model; Then, it is segmented by the combination of image transformation and a competitive Hopfield neural network (CHNN) and facial feature candidates such as eyes, eyebrows and mouth are obtained; Finally, eyes are located by facial features evaluation and validation, which is based on face's geometrical structures. Experimental results show that our system performs well under not good lighting conditions.", "paper_title": "Eyes location using a neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000069"}
