In this paper, we present a new framework for the hierarchical segmentation of gray level image. The proposed scheme comprises a nonlinear scale-space and morphological gradient watersheds. Our aim is to produce a meaningful hierarchy among the objects in the image. The scale-space is based on morphological anisotropic diffusion that uses reconstruction morphological operators. Furthermore, we introduce the method to reconstruct morphological operators and the principle of the dynamics of contours in scale-space that combines scale and contrast information. The performance of the proposed segmentation scheme is presented via experimental results obtained with a wide range of image including natural scenes.", "paper_title": "Multiscale morphological watershed segmentation for gray level image", "paper_id": "WOS:000243552500005"}
