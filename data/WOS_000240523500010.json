It has been shown that estimating the multipath channels and applying the convolution of the spread signals can increase both the information transmission rate and frequency usage efficiency. There are some variations of such signal design methods using complete complementary codes. The efficiency of the communication systems and information transmission rate depend upon the applied signal design method and the modulation scheme. In this paper, we consider two of these signal design methods. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) performances for both methods through some numerical simulations under the single cell scenario. Numerical results show the BER properties under some modulation schemes such as BPSK, QPSK and 16QAM. Some discussions on the relation between the BER performance and the information transmission rate are also included.", "paper_title": "Comparison of the two signal design methods in the CDMA systems using complete complementary codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240523500010"}
