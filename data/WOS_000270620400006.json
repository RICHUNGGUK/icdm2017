We constructed a Sigma MAP/M/1/K queuing model for the RED mechanism with multimedia traffic which follows a continuous-time Markovian arrival process (MAP). In addition to evaluating the long-term per-stream packet drop probabilities, we examine the bursty nature of per-stream packet drops by means of conditional statistics with respect to dropped periods and the probability that the queuing system stays in the dropped period. The dropped period corresponds to having more than a certain number of packets in router buffer; non-dropped period corresponds to the opposite. These performance measures describe the quality of service provided by the router to particular multimedia traffic streams in the presence of background multimedia traffic. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
