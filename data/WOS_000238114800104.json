We then employ the MILP to perform a head-to-head comparison between directional transmission and directional reception. We also propose and analyze a new directional reception heuristic. Our results indicate that directional reception can match directional transmission when extending path lifetime, with lower complexity and employing routes that use much less cumulative power.", "paper_title": "Directional reception vs. directional transmission for maximum lifetime multicast delivery in ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800104"}
