KPCA-SCF combines kernel principal component analysis and kernel subspace classification proposed in this paper to extract edge features. KPCA-SCF was tested and compared with linear PCA, nonlinear PCA and conventional methods such as Sobel, LOG, Canny, etc. Experiments on synthetic and real-world images show that KPCA-SCF is more robust under noisy conditions. KPCA-SCF's score of F-measure (0.44) ranks 11th in the Berkeley segmentation dataset and benchmark, it (0.54) ranks 10th tested on a noised image. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
