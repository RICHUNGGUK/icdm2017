Both the fitness of stereo data to surfaces and interrelation between the surfaces are defined in the framework of a three-dimensional (3-D) Markov Random Field (MRF) model. The surface reconstruction is accomplished by searching for the most likely state of the MRF model. Three experimental results are shown for synthetic and real stereo data.", "paper_title": "Surface reconstruction from stereo data using a three-dimensional Markov Random Field model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961900007"}
