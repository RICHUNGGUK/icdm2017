We present fundamental characteristics and discuss research dimensions, including data representation, ranking, efficient processing, query representation, and result presentation. Various approaches for developing the search system are described and compared within a common framework. We discuss the evolution of new research strategies to resolve the issues associated with probabilistic models, efficient top-k query processing, and schema analysis in relational databases.", "paper_title": "Keyword search in relational databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000286211500001"}
