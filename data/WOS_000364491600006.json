Many researchers have demonstrated prototypes using graphene-based materials, but few specific applications have appeared. Graphene-based acoustic devices have become a popular topic. This paper describes a novel method to fabricate graphene-based earphones by laser scribing. The earphones have been used in wireless communication systems. A wireless communication system was built based on an ARM board. Voice from a mobile phone was transmitted to a graphene-based earphone. The output sound had a similar wave envelope to that of the input; some differences were introduced by the DC bias added to the driving circuit of the graphene-based earphone. The graphene-based earphone was demonstrated to have a great potential in wireless communication.", "paper_title": "The Use of Graphene-Based Earphones in Wireless Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000364491600006"}
