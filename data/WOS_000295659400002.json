The positivity of such a model is also discussed as well as the boundedness of the total and partial populations. The model takes also into consideration the natural population growing and the mortality associate to the disease as well as the lost of immunity of newborns. It is assumed that there are two finite delays affecting to the susceptible, recovered, exposed and infected population dynamics.", "paper_title": "On the Equilibrium Points, Boundedness and Positivity of a Sveirs Epidemic Model under Constant Regular Constrained Vaccination", "paper_id": "WOS:000295659400002"}
