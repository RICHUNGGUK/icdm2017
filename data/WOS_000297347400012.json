A routing algorithm for the proposed graph is also presented, and the upper bound of the diameter is deduced as left perpendicular5n/2right perpendicular. Moreover, the embedding properties and maximal fault tolerance are also analyzed. Finally, we compare the proposed networks with some other similar network topologies. It is found that WG(n)(2m) is superior to other interconnection networks because it helps to construct large-scale networks with lower cost.", "paper_title": "A new family of Cayley graph interconnection networks based on wreath product and its topological properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000297347400012"}
