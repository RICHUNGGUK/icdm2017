Our method consists of: (1) the creation of a conflation map between an SLI trace and a vector map; (2) the detection of the corresponding buildings between the SLI scene and the conflation map; and (3) POI name extraction from a signboard in the SLI scene by user-interactive text recognition. Finally, a POI is generated through a combination of the POI name and attributes of the building object on a vector map. The proposed method showed recall of 92.99% and precision of 97.10% for real-world POIs.", "paper_title": "New POI Construction with Street-Level Imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000314079800015"}
