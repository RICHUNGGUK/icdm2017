The main themes of the paper are treatment of time-dependent constraints, calculation of design sensitivity, and approximation. Each subject is reviewed with corresponding papers that have been published since the 1970s. The treatment of time-dependent constraints in both the direct method and the transformation method is discussed. Two ways of calculating design sensitivity of a structure under transient loads are discussed-direct differentiation method and adjoint variable method. The approximation concept mainly focuses on the response surface method in crashworthiness and local approximation with the intermediate variables. Especially, a method using the equivalent static load is discussed as an approximation method. It takes advantage of the well-established static response optimization. The structural optimization in flexible multibody dynamic systems is reviewed in the viewpoint of the above three themes.", "paper_title": "A review of optimization of structures subjected to transient loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000234753100001"}
