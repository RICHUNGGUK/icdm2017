Our method is based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) fluids and allows more realistic and complex viscous behaviors than the previous SPH frameworks in computer animation literature. The viscous liquid is modeled by a non-Newtonian fluid flow and the variable viscosity under shear stress is achieved using a viscosity model known as Cross model. We demonstrate the efficiency and stability of our framework in a wide variety of animations, including scenarios with arbitrary geometries and high resolution of SPH particles. The interaction of the viscous liquid with complex solid obstacles is performed using boundary particles. Our framework is able to deal with different inlet velocity profiles and geometries of the injector, as well as moving inlet jet along trajectories given by cubic Hermite splines. Moreover, the simulation speed is significantly accelerated by using Computer Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) computing platform. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
