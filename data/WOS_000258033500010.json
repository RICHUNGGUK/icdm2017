This model will serve as the framework for various rescue missions for securing and distributing critical resources. We investigate different technologies and network strategies and integrate them into the proposed network model to provide seamless support to heterogeneous environments including wireline nodes, ad hoc and sensor network nodes, and network devices based on different standards. In this article we present the network architecture and identify the key technical aspects of its management, security, QoS, and implementation.", "paper_title": "Networking for critical conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258033500010"}
