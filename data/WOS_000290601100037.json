Practically, the image fusion technique is usually used to solve this problem. In this paper, we proposed a region-based image fusion method which is similar as the manual cut-and-paste method the fused image from which is often seen as the 'ideal' everywhere-focus image. In order to reduce the computational complexity, the watershed transform is employed to achieve image segmentation, and the morphological wavelet transform coefficients are used as the clarity measurements. The proposed method is compared with a pixel-based wavelet transform method and a region-based Laplacian pyramid method. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs the best.", "paper_title": "MULTI-FOCUS IMAGE FUSION USING WATERSHED TRANSFORM AND MORPHOLOGICAL WAVELET CLARITY MEASURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100037"}
