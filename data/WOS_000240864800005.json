The growing popularity of the geographical information system (GIS) approach, with capacities ranging from conventional data storage to complex spatial analysis and graphical presentation, means that it is also becoming a powerful tool for geotechnical engineers. In this study, in which we combine GIS grid-based data with four proposed column-based models of 3D slope stability analysis, we have devised new correspondent GIS grid-based 3D deterministic models to calculate the safety factor of the slope. Based on the four GIS-based 3D slope stability analysis models, a GIS-based program, 3DSlopeGIS, has been developed to implement the algorithm where all the input data are in the same format as the GIS dataset. The 3DSlopeGIS system, which is an extension of the widely used GIS software package, represents the combined development of 3D slope stability analysis and GIS-based component object model (COM) skills. Since all related data are supplied in the GIS format, this new database approach will be convenient for the repeated renewal and consulting of data. Certain widely addressed examples are evaluated in this paper and the results show the correction and potential of this GIS-based tool as a means of assessing the 3D stability of a slope. Two practical slope problems have been evaluated using the 3DSlopeGIS system. The results illustrate the convenience of data management as well as the effective range selection of Monte-Carlo random variables and the critical slip surface location in some parts of a lava dome.
