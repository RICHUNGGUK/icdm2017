We do it by dividing this metric into its lower and upper quasi-pseudometric parts. This characterization is given in the more general context with no assumption on the fuzzy sets. Furthermore, motivated from the theory of Convex Analysis, we also provide some results about the behavior of the convergence in the supremum metric with respect to maximizers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
