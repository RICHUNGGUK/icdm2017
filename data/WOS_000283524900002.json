Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines several key notions in classification and extended previous frameworks by combining an explanation-based approach to classification with the concepts of cognitive authority and trust. Findings - The paper presents an understanding of classification that allows designers and editors to establish trust through the principle of transparency. It demonstrates that modern classification theory and practice are tied to users' activities and domains of knowledge and that trustworthy classification systems are in close dialogue with users to handle bias responsible and establish trust. Originality/value - The paper establishes a foundation for exploring trust and authority for classification systems.", "paper_title": "Classification in a social world: bias and trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000283524900002"}
