Many mechanisms of Relevance Feedback exist with many interactive techniques and implement criteria. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach of RF which can set adaptive weights of similarity measurement for each database image from the user feedback, i.e. ego-similarity measurement. We would explore the feedback records were archived in the two different ways that stored along with query images (QRF-based) or along with each retrieved relevant image from the image database (DBRF-based). In the experiment, DBRF-based relevant feedback improved greatly in the retrieval effectiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
