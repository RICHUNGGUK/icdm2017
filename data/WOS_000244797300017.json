Such scaling relations between width, amplitude and velocity are of great help for numerical investigations of nonlinear solutions. The methodology is applied to a variety of examples from diverse branches of physics, both Hamiltonian as well as dissipative ones. The limitations of the approach are also discussed. (c) 2006 IMACS.
