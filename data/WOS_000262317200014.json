Since the level of detail is also influenced by object collision and self-collision, we propose a more accurate model for cloth-object friction. We also propose a robust history-based repulsion/collision framework where repulsions are treated accurately and efficiently on a per time step basis. Distributed memory parallelism is used for both time evolution and collisions, and we specifically address Gauss-Seidel ordering of repulsion/collision response. This algorithm is demonstrated by several high-resolution and high-fidelity simulations.", "paper_title": "Robust High-Resolution Cloth Using Parallelism, History-Based Collisions, and Accurate Friction", "paper_id": "WOS:000262317200014"}
