Vector control based algorithms which are used for proper functioning estimate the rotor speed and magnetic flux. In many applications, flux and speed are estimated without using sensors. Thus, in these cases, it is necessary to obtain speed and flux by measuring voltage and current. In this paper, a nonlinear observer for estimating motor parameters based on Lyapunov function is presented. Using the Lyapunov theory, inputs regulating system and control system are earned which improve system performance. Simulation and experimental results are included to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under possible uncertainties and different reference trajectories. These results show the advantages of the proposed observer in control of induction motor transient performances. The merits of the proposed control system are also indicated comparing with a traditional optimal control system.", "paper_title": "NONLINEAR OBSERVER FOR INDUCTION MOTOR TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND DYNAMIC STABILITY ANALYSIS IN FOC METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000305249000011"}
