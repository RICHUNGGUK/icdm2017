By using the Lyapunov function and linear matrix inequality approaches, the local synchronization of the proposed model is further investigated. Here, the local synchronization is defined by the inner synchronization within a group which does not mean the synchronization between different groups. Moreover, several sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the local synchronization of the proposed network model. Finally, several representative examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods and theories.", "paper_title": "Local Synchronization of a Complex Network Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000262562700020"}
