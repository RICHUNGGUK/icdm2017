GOssTo is bundled with six semantic similarity measures, including both term-and graph-based measures, and has extension capabilities to allow the user to add new similarities. Importantly, for any measure, GOssTo can also calculate the Random Walk Contribution that has been shown to greatly improve the accuracy of similarity measures. GOssTo is very fast, easy to use, and it allows the calculation of similarities on a genomic scale in a few minutes on a regular desktop machine.", "paper_title": "GOssTo: a stand-alone application and a web tool for calculating semantic similarities on the Gene Ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000340049100028"}
