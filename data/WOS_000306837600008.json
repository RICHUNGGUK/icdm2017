However, repeatedly using the same key to encrypt many different messages is not perfectly secure. A trivial method to update the key is to use QKD to re-establish a new key for each message. In this paper, we present a method, called quantum key evolution (QKE), to update the secret key using less qubits. Hence, it is more efficient for long messages. More precisely, we present a secure and efficient protocol, called quantum message transmission (QMT) protocol, to transmit long secret message using less qubits than the methods of incorporating QKD with one-time pad, as well as some quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocols.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM KEY EVOLUTION AND ITS APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306837600008"}
