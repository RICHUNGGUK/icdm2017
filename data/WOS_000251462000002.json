These two approaches have also had strong influence on the robotics field. In this paper we want to present a less known one, based on Ethology, and its application to the generation of autonomous behavior in mobile robots. In this way, we present the foundations of JDE (Jerarqura Dinamica de Esquemas), an etho-inspired architecture where behavior is organized as a dynamic hierarchy of independent schemas, as well as some examples of its applications, and a discussion about its properties.
