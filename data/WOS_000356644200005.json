We designed and implemented the system as both a web-based service and a multi-platform application for smartphones and tablets. The proposed system has three novel features: (1) web-based maternity records, which contains concise explanations of various antenatal screening and diagnostic tests; (2) self-care journals, which allow pregnant women to keep track of their gestational weight gains, blood pressure, fetal movements, and contractions; and (3) health education, which automatically presents detailed information on antenatal care and other pregnancy-related knowledge according to the women's gestational age. A survey was conducted among pregnant women to evaluate the usability and acceptance of the proposed system. In order to prove that the antenatal care was effective, clinical outcomes should be provided and the results are focused on a usability evaluation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
