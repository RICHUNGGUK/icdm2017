This paper proposed a new computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithm to detect the MCs. At first, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was applied to extract the high-frequency signal, and thresholding with hysteresis was used to locate the suspicious MCs. Then, filling dilation was utilized to segment the desired regions. During the detection process, ANFIS was applied for auto-adjustment, making the CAD more adaptive. Finally, the segmented MCs were classified with MLP, and a satisfying result validated this method.", "paper_title": "Detection of microcalcifications using wavelet-based thresholding and filling dilation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300095"}
