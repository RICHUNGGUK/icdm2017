Most of the works in the literature exhibit good performance under strictly controlled acquisition conditions, but the performance drastically drop when changes in pose and illumination occur, SO that recently a number of approaches have been proposed to deal with such variability. The aim of this work is twofold: first a survey on the existing techniques proposed to obtain an illumination robust recognition is given, and then a new method, based on the fusion of different classifiers, is proposed. The experiments carried out on different face databases confirm the effectiveness of the approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
