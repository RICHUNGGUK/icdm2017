It handles several classes of models useful for sequence analysis, such as Markov chains, hidden Markov models, weighted context-free grammars, regular expressions and PROSITE expressions. GenRGenS is the only program that can handle weighted context-free grammars, thus allowing the user to model and to generate structured objects (such as RNA secondary structures) of any given desired size. GenRGenS also allows the user to combine several of these different models at the same time.", "paper_title": "GenRGenS: software for generating random genomic sequences and structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000238768500020"}
