A part of the problems can be solved by the use of some auxiliary data which yields various time/space trade-offs. Finally, approaches to deal with extensions such as allowing scaling or rotations are suggested.", "paper_title": "Compressed pattern matching in JPEG images", "paper_id": "WOS:000243313900006"}
