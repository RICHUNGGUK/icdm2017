The model checker helps the system designer to find errors in a specification before starting on an implementation. One facility that TLA+/TLC lacks however, is a GUI providing the user with more operational comfort. This article presents our design and implementation of a GUI for the TLA+/TLC-system, called the GTLA system. GTLA provides the user with three main facilities: a system editor, a simulator and a verifier (the TLC model checker) operable through a GUI. This article also discusses the tools which have been used for constructing the GTLA system.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of a GUI for the TLC model checker", "paper_id": "WOS:000202972700005"}
