This paper presents a new approach to rendering trimmed spline surfaces that guarantees visual accuracy efficiently, even under interactive adjustment of trim curves and spline surfaces. The technique achieves robustness and speed by discretizing at a near-minimal correct resolution based on a tight, low-cost estimate of adaptive domain griding. The algorithm is highly parallel, with each trim curve writing itself into a slim lookup table. Each surface fragment then makes its trim decision robustly by comparing its parameters against the sorted table entries. Adding the table-and-test to the rendering pass of a modern graphics pipeline achieves anti-aliased sub-pixel accuracy at high render-speed, while using little additional memory and fragment shader effort, even during interactive trim manipulation.
