This logic is known to admit undecidable satisfiability and model-checking problems. We study decidability and complexity issues for fragments of LTL with Presburger constraints obtained by restricting the syntactic resources of the formulae (the number of variables, the maximal distance between two states for which counters can be compared and, to a smaller extent, the set of Presburger constraints), while preserving the strength of the logical operators. We provide a complete picture refining known results from the literature. We show that model-checking and satisfiability problems for the fragments of LTL with difference constraints restricted to two variables and distance one and to one variable and distance two are highly undecidable, enlarging significantly the class of known undecidable fragments, On the positive side, we prove that the fragment restricted to one variable and to distance one augmented with propositional variables is PSPACE-CoMplete. Since the atomic formulae can state quantitative properties on the counters. this extends some results about model-checking pushdown systems and one-counter automata. In order to establish the PSPACE upper bound, we show that the non-emptiness problem for Buchi one-counter automata taking values in Z and allowing zero tests and sign tests, is only NLOGSPACE-complete. Finally, we establish that niodel-checking one-counter automata with complete quantifier-free Presburger LTL restricted to one variable is also I'SPACE-Coniplete, whereas the satisfiability problem is undecidable.", "paper_title": "The Effects of Bounding Syntactic Resources on Presburger LTL", "paper_id": "WOS:000273177000025"}
