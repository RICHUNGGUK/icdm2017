These operations are inherently numeric constructs yielding numeric results. We pose a question whether two t-norms produce distinct results. The problem is formally expressed as a certain hypothesis testing where a null hypothesis concerns equality of medians of membership grades produced by the two triangular norms. In the sequel, we extend a discussion on composition operations constructed with the aid of both t-norms and t-conorms (s-t and t-s composition operators). A comprehensive suite of experiments deals with a collection of commonly encountered triangular norms including those endowed with some parameters. The null hypothesis is tested with regard to the pairs of triangular norms as well as the same triangular norm but having two values of its parameter. We introduce a concept of granular t-norms (more specifically, t-norms operating on granular arguments) and discuss an idea of granular equivalence of logic operators. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
