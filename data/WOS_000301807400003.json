The finite element formulation uses a quadratic approximation for the velocity field, an extension of a previously published Augmented Lagrangian formulation with a linear velocity field, and was implemented for a parallel processing environment. Results from determining the limit loads under three-dimensional conditions are presented and compared with previously published data. The results obtained allow a strict upper-bound determination of the shape factors. Furthermore, a practical proposal for these factors is made and compared with other proposals made by other authors.
