The approach includes three sequential stages: a forward search stage to generate a planning-graph to reduce the search space of the following two stages greatly, an optimal local QoS calculating stage to compute all the optimal local QoS values of services in the planning, and a backward search stage to find the top-K composed services with optimal QoS values according to the planning-graph and the optimal QoS value. In order to validate the approach, experiments are carried out based on the test sets offered by the WS-Challenge competition 2009. The results show that the approach can find the same optimal solution as the champion system from the competition but also can provide more alternative solutions with the optimal QoS for users.", "paper_title": "Efficient planning for top-K Web service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000322531500003"}
