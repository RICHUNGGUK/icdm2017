It also approaches the possible factors affecting the observation threshold of product representation angles - \"familiarity\" and \"product component\" to study the related factors. This research uses NOKIA 8250 as the objective cellular phone, and the contrasting cellular phone of component difference found in the previous test. It uses questionnaires to divide subjects, according to familiarity, into groups for experiments, and then calculate the representation angle observation threshold of subjects. The conclusions of this research are: (1) The observation thresholds of product representation angles are found as an X shape on the distribution maps, and the two sides of the distribution maps show the difficult recognition areas. (2) Familiarity affects the observation threshold of cellular phone representation angles, while product component difference show little effect. (3) Most subjects favor a clockwise or up turned presentation angle of cellular phone. (4) Products with sufficient components show a larger range of representation angle observation threshold.
