To extract moving objects from the background, an adaptive background subtraction scheme with a shadow elimination model is used. Swinging trees are removed from foreground objects to reduce the computational complexity of subsequent tracking. Raindrops are removed from foreground objects when necessary. Performance evaluations are carried out using seven real-world traffic image sequences. Experimental results show average recognition rates of 96.83% and 97.20% for swinging trees and raindrops, respectively, indicating the feasibility of the proposed method. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
