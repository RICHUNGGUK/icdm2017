Our application adopts both local and global information for robust estimation. The authors utilise the original images from the ORL and Yale databases for evaluation. The images of the FERET database are pre-processed to extract the pure face region and execute the affine transformation. The authors roughly divide the face images into four block images that are most significant for the face: left eye, right eye, nose and mouth. The feature extraction using magnitude of first-order gradients, based on geometric features, is ideal for estimating a single sample. While conducting the classification stage, local features are putatively matched before processing or the global random sample consensus robust estimation features, with the aim of identifying the fundamental matrix between two matched face images. Finally, similarity scores are calculated, and the candidate awarded the highest score is designated the correct subject. Experiments were implemented using the FERET, ORL and Yale databases to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results show that our algorithm greatly improves recognition performance compared with the existing methods.", "paper_title": "Face recognition based on a two-view projective transformation using one sample per subject", "paper_id": "WOS:000309959000014"}
