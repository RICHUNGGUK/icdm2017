It works by estimating a sequence of principal components that have maximal dependence on the response variable. The proposed supervised PCA is solvable in closed-form, and has a dual formulation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of problems in which the number of predictors greatly exceeds the number of observations (such as DNA microarray experiments). Furthermore, we show how the algorithm can be kernelized, which makes it applicable to non-linear dimensionality reduction tasks. Experimental results on various visualization, classification and regression problems show significant improvement over other supervised approaches both in accuracy and computational efficiency.
