Then, a method is proposed for synthesis of dipole arrays to produce desired scattering pattern using genetic algorithm (GA). In the synthesis method, the element positions in an array are considered as the optimization parameter and the derived expression is used to evaluate the fitness function of GA. To assess the validity and efficiency of the proposed method, several linear dipole arrays are designed to obtain scattering pattern with low sidelobe level (SLL). A good agreement between the patterns calculated using the expression and simulated by FEKO validates the accuracy of the presented expression. In addition, the numerical results show that the maximum SLL of the scattering pattern is considerably reduced by optimization. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
