One of the steps required to turn these sequences into valuable information is gene content prediction. To date, there is no publicly available gene predictor specifically trained for maize sequences. To this end, we have chosen to train the EuGene software that can combine several sources of evidence into a consolidated gene model prediction.", "paper_title": "EuGene-maize: a web site for maize gene prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000277225400018"}
