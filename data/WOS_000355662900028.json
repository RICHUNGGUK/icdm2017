IllumiRoom uses 3D scanning and projected light to change the appearance of the room, induce apparent motion, extend the field of view, and enable entirely new gaming experiences. Our system is entirely self-calibrating and is designed to work in any room. We present a detailed exploration of the design space of possible projected visualizations and we demonstrate ways to trigger and drive these visualizations from gaming content. We also contribute specific feedback from two groups of target users (10 gamers and 15 game designers); providing insights for enhancing game and film experiences beyond the TV.", "paper_title": "IllumiRoom: Immersive Experiences Beyond the TV Screen", "paper_id": "WOS:000355662900028"}
