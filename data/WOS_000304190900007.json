We propose in this paper a Boolean approach for extracting conclusions about the role of each module from the systematic comparison of the numerical behavior of all knock-out mutants. We associate a Boolean variable to each module, expressing when the module is included in the architecture and when it is not. We can then express the satisfiability of system-level properties of the full model, such as efficiency, or economical use of resources, in terms of a Boolean formula expressing in a compact way which model architectures, i.e., which combinations of modules, give rise to the desired property. We demonstrate this method on a recently proposed computational model for the heat shock response in eukaryotes. We describe the contribution of each of its three feedback loops towards achieving an economical and effective heat shock response.", "paper_title": "A Boolean Approach for Disentangling the Roles of Submodules to the Global Properties of a Biomodel", "paper_id": "WOS:000304190900007"}
