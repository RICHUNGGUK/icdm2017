At the very start, video shot detection is performed and the highest image quality video frame is extracted as the key frame for each shot on the basis of our proposed image quality assessment method. These key frames are utilized as the thumbnail candidates for the following processes. In the image quality assessment, the normalized variance autofocusing function is employed to evaluate the image blur and ensures that the selected video thumbnail candidates are clear and have high image quality. For accessibility analysis, color moment, visual salience and texture are used with a support vector regression model to predict the candidates' accessibility score, which ensures that the recommended thumbnail's ROIs are big enough and it is very accessible for users. For content representativeness analysis, the mutual reinforcement algorithm is adopted in the entire video to obtain the candidates' representativeness score, which ensures that the final thumbnail is representative enough for users to catch the main video contents at a glance. Considering browsers' query intent, a relevant model is designed to recommend more personalized thumbnails for certain browsers. Finally, by flexibly fusing the above analysis results, the final adaptive recommendation work is accomplished. Experimental results and subjective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with the existing web video thumbnail generation methods, the thumbnails for video owners not only reflect the contents of the video better, but also make users feel more comfortable. The thumbnails for video browsers directly reflect their preference, which greatly enhances their user experience.", "paper_title": "Web video thumbnail recommendation with content-aware analysis and query-sensitive matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000342418700026"}
