Password based authenticated key agreement protocols, however, are vulnerable to password guessing attacks since users usually choose easy-to-remember passwords. Recently, Lee and Lee pointed out that N. Y. Lee et al.'s password based authenticated key agreement protocol is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, and then proposed an improvement to overcome the attack. The current paper, however, demonstrates that Lee-Lee's password based authenticated key agreement protocol is still vulnerable to off-line password guessing attacks, and then proposes an improvement of the protocol in order to overcome such security attacks. Compared with Lee-Lee's protocol, the proposed protocol is very useful in password-based Internet and wire/wireless communication environments to access remote information systems since it provides security, reliability and efficiency.", "paper_title": "IMPROVING THE LEE-LEE'S PASSWORD BASED AUTHENTICATED KEY AGREEMENT PROTOCOL", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800016"}
