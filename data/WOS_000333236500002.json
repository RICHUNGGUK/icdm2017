The degree sequence (ni(t),i >= 0) of t satisfies n-ary sumation i >= 0ni(t)=1+ n-ary sumation i >= 0ini(t)=|t|, where |t| denotes the number of nodes in t. In this paper, we consider trees sampled uniformly among all plane trees having the same degree sequence s; we write DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Ps for the corresponding distribution. Let s(kappa)=(ni(kappa),i >= 0) be a list of degree sequences indexed by kappa corresponding to trees with size n kappa ->+infinity. We show that under some simple and natural hypotheses on (s(kappa),kappa>0) the trees sampled under DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Ps(kappa) converge to the Brownian continuum random tree after normalisation by n kappa 1/2. Some applications concerning Galton-Watson trees and coalescence processes are provided.Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
