The present work seeks to provide an in silico correlate of experimental target fishing technologies in order to rapidly fish out potential targets for compounds on the basis of chemical structure alone. A multiple-category Laplacian-modified naive Bayesian model was trained on extended-connectivity fingerprints of compounds from 964 target classes in the WOMBAT ( World Of Molecular BioAcTivity) chemogenomics database. The model was employed to predict the top three most likely protein targets for all MDDR (MDL Drug Database Report) database compounds. On average, the correct target was found 77% of the time for compounds from 10 MDDR activity classes with known targets. For MDDR compounds annotated with only therapeutic or generic activities such as \"antineoplastic\", \"kinase inhibitor\", or \"anti-inflammatory\", the model was able to systematically deconvolute the generic activities to specific targets associated with the therapeutic effect. Examples of successful deconvolution are given, demonstrating the usefulness of the tool for improving knowledge in chemogenomics databases and for predicting new targets for orphan compounds.", "paper_title": "Prediction of biological targets for compounds using multiple-category Bayesian models trained on chemogenomics databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000237658400023"}
