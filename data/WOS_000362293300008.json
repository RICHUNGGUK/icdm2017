In this paper, we propose a hierarchical method for the rigid registration of multiple views. The multiview registration problem is solved via hierarchical optimization defined on an undirected graph. Each node or edge in this graph represents a single view or a connection between two overlapped views, respectively. The optimizations are performed hierarchically on the edges, the loops, and the entire graph. First, each overlapped pair of views is locally aligned. Then, a loop-based incremental registration algorithm is introduced to refine the initial pairwise alignments. After a loop is registered, the views in the loop are merged into a metaview in the graph. Finally, global error diffusion is applied to the entire graph to evenly distribute the accumulated errors to all views. In addition, a new objective function is defined to describe the loop closure problem; it improves the accuracy and robustness of registration by simultaneously considering transformation and registration errors. The experimental results show that the proposed hierarchical approach is accurate, efficient and robust for initial view states that are not well posed.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Multiview Rigid Registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000362293300008"}
