These three LSOs are the genetic algorithm, the linear bisection search, and the Hooke and Jeeves method. A simple encoding method is presented to encode the GP individuals into the expressions that can be recognized by the different LSOs. The implemented hybrid GP algorithms are applied to identify the excitation force acting on the structures from the measured structural response, which is an important type of inverse problem in structural dynamics. Illustrative examples of a frame structure and a multistory building structure demonstrate that, compared with the standard GP, the hybrid GP algorithms have higher search efficiency which can be used as alternate global search and optimization tools for other engineering problem solving.", "paper_title": "Hybrid genetic programming with local search operators for dynamic force identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000248815800003"}
