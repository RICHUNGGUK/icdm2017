This paper proposes a method for the non-rigid registration of mural images and laser scanning data based on the optimization of the edge of interest by using laser echo intensity information as an intermediary. First, the intensity image was generated from the laser echo intensity information, and registered with the mural image using a rigid transformation model. Second, the edges of interest in the mural image and the gradient field of the intensity images were processed as registration primitives. Third, every edge of interest was registered with the optimization base used in the rigid registration of the mural image and intensity image. Finally, the registration was completed after a non-rigid transformation model between these two images was constructed using the control points on the optimized edges. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain high registration accuracy for different data sets.", "paper_title": "Non-rigid registration of mural images and laser scanning data based on the optimization of the edges of interest", "paper_id": "WOS:000320077800017"}
