Currently, the most widely used criteria are precision and recall. However, they do not always work well while facing objects with semantics, like ontologies and alignments, because they only consider \"exact\" Correspondences but ignore \"close\" ones. Some new measures have been proposed to solve the problem. However, they have their own limitations, and do not rely purely on the semantics of ontologies and alignments. A framework for purely semantic precision and recall of ontology mapping is proposed in this paper, which can guarantee that the measures are purely semantic. Then a group of application-oriented measures are proposed to instantiate the framework. In some examples these measures are compared with former ones. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
