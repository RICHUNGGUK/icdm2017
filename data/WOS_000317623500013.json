By using MOS capacitors (varactors) to perform parametric amplification, it is possible to achieve a measured gain enhancement of about 12 dB, together with 21 dB noise figure and more than 5 dBm IIP3. Operating in the VHF-III band, the downconverter core dissipates 6.2 mW and occupies 0.024 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A 6.2 mW 0.024 mm(2) fully-passive RF downconverter with 12 dB gain enhancement using MOS parametric amplification", "paper_id": "WOS:000317623500013"}
