Our design consists of a compact and highly expressive bidding format, two pricing models to control tradeoffs between revenue and fairness, and fast auction clearing algorithms to achieve conflict-free spectrum allocations that maximize auction revenue. We develop analytical bounds on algorithm performance and complexity to verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. We also use both simulated and real deployment traces to evaluate the auction framework. We conclude that pricing models and bidding behaviors have significant impact on auction outcomes and spectrum utilization. Any efficient spectrum auction system must consider demand and spectrum availability in local regions to maximize system-wide revenue and spectrum utilization. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
