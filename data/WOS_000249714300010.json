In addition, the quality of the reconstructed secret image is normally degraded in contrast, especially for halftone images. This study proposes a VSS scheme that maps a block in a secret image onto one corresponding equal-sized block in each share image without image size expansion. Two types of techniques, including histogram width-equalization and histogram depth-equalization, are proposed to generate the corresponding share blocks containing multiple levels rather than two levels based on the density of black pixels on the blocks for a secret block. In the former technique, the gray-scale image histogram is obtained by uniformly splitting the range of the pixel gray levels in the secret image, while in the latter the buckets are created so that the area of each bucket is roughly constant by containing approximately the same number of pixels. The proposed schemes significantly improve the quality of the reconstructed secret image compared to several previous investigations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
