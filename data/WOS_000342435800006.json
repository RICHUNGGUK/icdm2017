For the mixed-resolution multi-view case, where the input is one high-resolution view along with its neighboring low-resolution views, our method can give the super-resolution results and obtain a high-quality depth map simultaneously. The closed loop method consists of two parts: part I, stereo matching and depth maps fusion; and part II, super-resolution. Under the guidance of the estimated depth information, the super-resolution problem can be formulated as an optimization problem. It can be solved approximately by a three-step method, which involves disparity-based pixel mapping, nonlocal construction and final fusion. Based on the super-resolution results, we can update the disparity maps and fuse them into a more reliable depth map. We repeat the loop several times until obtaining stable super-resolution results and depth maps simultaneously. The experimental results on public dataset show that the proposed method can achieve high-quality performance at different scale factors.", "paper_title": "A new closed loop method of super-resolution for multi-view images", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435800006"}
