The global index employed for this velocity performance optimization is the approximation of the minimum manipulator velocity ratio (AMMVR). The AMMVR is computed from a finite set of MVR values computed at specific locations along the path selected by a trajectory approximation algorithm. This algorithm approximates the path using an interpolation method based on the cubic spline interpolation to guarantee velocity continuity. The optimization is performed by a simple genetic algorithm, using as fitness function the AMMVR and the manipulator's constraints. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated by simulation tests using a six-degree-of-freedom non-redundant Puma type manipulator and the obtained results are presented and discussed.
