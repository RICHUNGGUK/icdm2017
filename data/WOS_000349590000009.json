A usual alternative is the multivariate histogram, which features a low computational complexity. Multivariate frequency polygons have often been neglected, even though they share many of the advantages of the histograms, while they are continuous unlike the histograms. Here we build on our previous work on histograms in order to propose a new probability density estimator which is based on averaging multivariate frequency polygons. The convergence of the estimator is formally proved. Experiments are carried out with synthetic and real machine learning datasets. Finally, image denoising and object tracking applications are also considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
