Unfortunately, as practical use of microprocessors has increased, so have the security problems associated with them. Although public key cryptography (PKC) can mitigate these problems, standard implementations of PKC also impose a steep computational cost on resource-constrained devices. To reduce this cost, researchers have proposed alternative implementations that accelerate multiprecision multiplication, the most expensive operation involved in PKC. In this paper, we focus on a further optimization of this same operation, using several innovative methods: carry-once, optimized multiplication and accumulation (MAC), unbalanced comb, and optimized comb-window. These methods yield further performance improvements of 2%, 17%, 4.5%, and 9.5%, respectively, on representative modern microprocessors including ATmega128 and MSP430.
