We have developed DMAN, a novel tool to analyse multi-well plate data obtained in DSF experiments. DMAN is easy to install and provides a user-friendly interface. Multi-well plate layouts can be designed by the user and experimental data can be annotated and analysed by DMAN according to the specified plate layout. Statistical tests for significance are performed automatically, and graphical tools are also provided to assist in data analysis. The modular concept of this software will allow easy development of other multi-well plate analysis applications in the future.", "paper_title": "DMAN: a Java tool for analysis of multi-well differential scanning fluorimetry experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000300043200026"}
