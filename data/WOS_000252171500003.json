The hubs are directly connected to a central node and each terminal node is directly connected to a hub node. The aim is to minimize the cost of locating hubs, assigning terminals and routing the traffic between hubs and the central node. We present two formulations and show that the constraints are facet-defining inequalities in both cases. We test the formulations on a set of instances. Finally, we present a heuristic based on Lagrangian relaxation.
