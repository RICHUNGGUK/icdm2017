A sufficient condition for the existence of an asymptotic UIO such that the observer estimation error asymptotically converges to zero is first given in terms of a rank condition on the given system matrices. A systematic method is then presented for the design of UIOs using a linear matrix inequality technique. An example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design of unknown input observers for a class of 2-D nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000323252700003"}
