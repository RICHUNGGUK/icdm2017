The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that determine buyer acceptance of G2B e-government services in the context of inter-entity supply contracts. Based primarily on an adapted version of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a sample of 185 organizational buyers of real G2B e-government services in Taiwan was examined. The findings show that perceived usefulness, perceived risk, external influence, interpersonal influence, self-efficacy, and facilitating conditions are critical factors in determining buyer acceptance. The resulting implications and recommendations for G2B e-government services research and practice are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Buyer Acceptance of G2B E-government Services: An Empirical Study of Inter-Entity Supply Contracts", "paper_id": "WOS:000299651100006"}
