Sensor nodes are usually battery-powered and thus have very limited lifetime. In this paper, we introduce a novel passive wake-up radio device named WISP-Mote that uses a passive RFID tag as a wake-up receiver for a traditional sensor node. We characterize the WISP-Mote with field tests in different operating environments and present the wake-up probabilities based on the distance between the wake-up transmitter and receiver. We then perform simulations to compare the performance of a network with WISP-Motes and with duty-cycling of the sensor nodes, using the wake-up probabilities measured in our field tests. Additionally, potential applications that can benefit from WISP-Motes are discussed, and the advantages of using WISP-Motes are identified by simulation results based on these application scenarios. Results show that the wake-up radio sensor networks have great potential over duty-cycling approaches for energy efficiency, while providing similar latency and packet delivery performances.
