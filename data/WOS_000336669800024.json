By using a rotor flux model reference adaptive system (MRAS) estimation method to PTC, the system has the virtue of low cost due to the absence of PWM and speed measurement components. PTC requires not only estimated speed but also estimated stator and rotor flux. In implementation, a compensated MRAS is considered for obtaining good flux estimations. The experimental results confirm that this control strategy has very fast dynamics, can adapt a very wide speed range, and shows good performance both at transient and steady states.", "paper_title": "Encoderless Finite-State Predictive Torque Control for Induction Machine With a Compensated MRAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800024"}
