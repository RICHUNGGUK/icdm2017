An efficient solution strategy for this time tested problem is shown here which uses different variants of biologically inspired Genetic Algorithms and is aided by a multiobjective formulation. The Genetic Algorithms worked more efficiently than the classical techniques used earlier and the nature of the feasible solutions was clearly revealed by the Pareto-optimality concept embedded in the multi-objective optimization employed here.
