The objective of the study is to maximize the annual net benefits subjected to various irrigation planning constraints for 75% dependable flow scenario. Extensive sensitivity analysis on various parameters used in above techniques indicated that they yielded same solution corresponding to a set of optimal combination of parameters. It is concluded that SA, SQ and RGA can be utilized for efficient planning of any irrigation system with suitable modi. cations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
