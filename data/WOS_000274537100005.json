Simulation results using 0.18-mu m CMOS process parameters show that the proposed circuit has a good linearity performance. The simulated bandwidth is 350 MHz. The THD improvement of the proposed circuit is more than 60 dB compared to the one of a common gate circuit under a same total current consumption of 10.4 mA.", "paper_title": "Design of Wideband Linear Voltage-to-Current Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537100005"}
