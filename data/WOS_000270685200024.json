Here, we present a web-based interface-called GRIMP-to run publicly available genetic software for extremely large GWAS on scalable super-computing grid infrastructures. This is of major importance for the enlargement of GWAS with the availability of whole-genome sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project and for future whole-population efforts.", "paper_title": "GRIMP: a web- and grid-based tool for high-speed analysis of large-scale genome-wide association using imputed data", "paper_id": "WOS:000270685200024"}
