By now, the concept is developing in many different directions, including \"density\", \"level set\", \"topological derivative\", \"phase field\", \"evolutionary\" and several others. The paper gives an overview, comparison and critical review of the different approaches, their strengths, weaknesses, similarities and dissimilarities and suggests guidelines for future research.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization approaches A comparative review", "paper_id": "WOS:000328211600001"}
