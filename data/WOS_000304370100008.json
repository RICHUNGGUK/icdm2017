Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) successfully operationalised such value as the degree that a system can improve users' job performance. The proposed construct, perceived usefulness, has been proved to be the most important factor for technology adoption. However, many scholars have called for further theoretical development to enrich this critical construct but not much effort has been put forward (Bagozzi, R. P., 2007. The legacy of the technology acceptance model and a proposal for a paradigm shift. Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 8 (4), 244-254; Benbasat, I. and Barki, H., 2007. Quo vadis, TAM? Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 8 (4), 212-218). To respond to this call on deepening the conceptualisation of perceived usefulness, this article argues that system usefulness can be formulated beyond job performance improvement and explores several additional usefulness constructs based on well-established management concepts and human need theory. The information system (IS) use continuance model (Bhattacherjee, A., 2001. Understanding information systems continuance: An expectation-confirmation model. MIS Quarterly, 25 (3), 351-370) has been adopted as the theoretical foundation of this study because certain types of system usefulness can be recognised only in a use continuance stage. The empirical results of the research have validated most of the proposed constructs. Significant contributions to research and practice are identified and discussed.", "paper_title": "Extended conceptualisation of perceived usefulness: empirical test in the context of information system use continuance", "paper_id": "WOS:000304370100008"}
