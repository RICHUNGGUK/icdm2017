These script languages should be abstracted from complex low-level concepts such as DOF, so that users can create scenario scripts easily without having to be concerned about the physical properties of motion. Also, the scripts should be defined in a standard format and structure so that they can be reused in various applications. In the proposed system, we defined a layered script language for avatar behavior representation and control, which consists of task-level behavior, high-level motion and primitive motion script. The high-level behavior script provides abstract and domain-dependent avatar-object behavior interfaces to the user so that the user can easily create avatar scenario scripts, the high-level motion script represents the avatar motion sequence, and the primitive motion script represents the geometric information of the underlying tools for physical animation control. A presentation domain is chosen to apply the proposed script language, and empirical evaluation shows that a novice user can easily and quickly design a scenario script using the proposed interface", "paper_title": "Definition of a layered avatar behavior script language for creating and reusing scenario scripts", "paper_id": "WOS:000253522600007"}
