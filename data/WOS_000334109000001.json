To overcome this limitation of the deterministic optimization approach, in this paper we present a novel particle filtering approach to template-based visual tracking. We formulate the problem as a particle filtering problem on matrix Lie groups, specifically the three-dimensional Special Linear group SL(3) and the two-dimensional affine group Aff(2). Computational performance and robustness are enhanced through a number of features: (i) Gaussian importance functions on the groups are iteratively constructed via local linearization; (ii) the inverse formulation of the Jacobian calculation is used; (iii) template resizing is performed; and (iv) parent-child particles are developed and used. Extensive experimental results using challenging video sequences demonstrate the enhanced performance and robustness of our particle filtering-based approach to template-based visual tracking. We also show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art template-based visual tracking methods via experiments using the publicly available benchmark data set.", "paper_title": "A Geometric Particle Filter for Template-Based Visual Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000334109000001"}
