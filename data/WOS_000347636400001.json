The first is an accidental pinhole camera image. The second class of accidental images are \"inverse\" pinhole camera images, formed by subtracting an image with a small occluder present from a reference image without the occluder. Both types of accidental cameras happen in a variety of different situations. For example, an indoor scene illuminated by natural light, a street with a person walking under the shadow of a building, etc. The images produced by accidental cameras are often mistaken for shadows or interreflections. However, accidental images can reveal information about the scene outside the image, the lighting conditions, or the aperture by which light enters the scene.", "paper_title": "Accidental Pinhole and Pinspeck Cameras Revealing the Scene Outside the Picture", "paper_id": "WOS:000347636400001"}
