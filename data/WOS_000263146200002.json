We briefly review the topological asymptotic analysis, and then present its historical application to the crack localization problem from boundary measurements. A very natural application of this technique in image processing is the inpainting problem, which can be solved by identifying the optimal localization of the missing edges. A second natural application is then the image restoration or enhancement. The identification of the main edges of the image allows us to preserve them, and smooth the image outside the edges. If the conductivity outside edges goes to infinity, the regularized image is piecewise constant and provides a natural solution to the segmentation problem. The numerical results presented for each application are very promising. Finally, we must mention that all these problems are solved with a O(n. log(n)) complexity.", "paper_title": "Image Processing by Topological Asymptotic Expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000263146200002"}
