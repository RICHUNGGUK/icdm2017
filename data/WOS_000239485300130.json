First, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology using an improved S-shaped membership function has been developed for finding out the 'best candidate FMS alternative' from a set of candidate-FMSs. The MCDM model trade-offs among various parameters, namely, design parameters, economic considerations, etc., affecting the FMS selection process in multi-criteria decision-making environment. Genetic algorithm is used to evolve the architecture and weights of the proposed neural network method. Further, a back-propagation (BP) algorithm is used as the local search algorithm. The selection of FMS is made according to the error output of the results found from the MCDM model.", "paper_title": "Meta-learning evolutionary artificial neural network for selecting flexible manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300130"}
