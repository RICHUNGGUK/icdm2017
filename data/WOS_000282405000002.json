This study proposes a de-clustering approach for distributed architectures, which eliminates the inter-site communication cost, for most of the influential association rule mining algorithms. To de-cluster the database into similar partitions, an efficient algorithm is developed to approximate the shortest spanning path (SSP) to link transaction data together. The SSP obtained is then used to evenly de-cluster the transaction data into subgroups. The proposed approach guarantees that all subgroups are similar to each other and to the original group. Experiment results show that data size and the number of items are the only two factors that determine the performance of de-clustering. Additionally, based on the approach, most of the influential association rule mining algorithms can be implemented in a distributed architecture to obtain a drastic increase in speed without losing any frequent itemsets. Furthermore, the data distribution in each de-clustered participant is almost the same as that of a single site, which implies that the proposed approach can be regarded as a sampling method for distributed association rule mining. Finally, the experiment results prove that the original inadequate mining results can be improved to an almost perfect level. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
