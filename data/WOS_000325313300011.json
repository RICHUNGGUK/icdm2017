Although many researchers have studied the CFLP in a deterministic environment, their proposed models cannot satisfactorily accommodate various customer demands in the real world. Thus, this paper focuses on the CFLP random fuzzy environment using (alpha, beta)-cost minimization model under the Hurwicz criterion. Furthermore, it is proved that this model can deal with various CFLPs in random, fuzzy and random fuzzy environments. In order to solve this model, the simplex algorithm, fuzzy simulations and a firefly algorithm are integrated to produce a hybrid intelligent algorithm. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Capacitated Facility Location Problem in random fuzzy environment: Using (alpha, beta)-cost minimization model under the Hurwicz criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000325313300011"}
