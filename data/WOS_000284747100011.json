The model is an extension of a recent model with single-relaxation-time [Guo et al., Phys. Rev. E 79, 046708 (2009)], which was developed based on the axisymmetric Boltzmann equation. Due to the use of the MRT collision model, the present model can achieve better numerical stability. The model is validated by some numerical tests including the Hagen-Poiseuille flow, the pulsatile Womersley flow, and the external flow over a sphere. Numerical results are in excellent agreement with analytical solutions or other available data, and the improvement in numerical stability is also confirmed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
