In order to overcome intra-class and inter-class ambiguities of fingerprints, the proposed method extracts a feature vector from an adaptively detected feature region and classifies the feature vector using SVMs. The outputs of the SVMs are then combined by multiple decision templates that make several per class. Experimental results on NIST4 fingerprint database revealed the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method for fingerprint classification.", "paper_title": "Multiple decision templates with adaptive features for fingerprint classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000253298200007"}
