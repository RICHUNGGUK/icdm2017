Three types of tests are conducted to assess the performances of the models producing synthetic data based on the ALARM network. The results indicate that the linear combination of the aforementioned models leads to a 5% and a 30% improvement in medical diagnosis when compared to the Rule Based Method and the Bayesian Network Based Method, respectively.", "paper_title": "Comparison of different inference algorithms for medical decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000325810500004"}
