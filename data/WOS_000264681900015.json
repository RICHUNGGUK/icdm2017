Parallel prefix circuits are parallel prefix algorithms on the combinational circuit model. The depth of a prefix circuit is a measure of its processing time; smaller depth implies faster computation. The size of a prefix circuit is the number of operation nodes in it. Smaller size implies less power consumption, less VLSI area, and less cost. A prefix circuit with n inputs is depth-size optimal if its depth plus size equals 2n - 2. A circuit with a smaller fan-out is in general faster and occupies less VLSI area. To be of practical use, the depth and fan-out of a prefix circuit should be small. In this paper, a family of depth-size optimal, parallel prefix circuits with fan-out 2 is presented. This family of prefix circuits is easier to construct and more amenable to automatic synthesis than two other families of the same type, although the three families have the same minimum depth among all depth-size optimal prefix circuits with fan-out 2. The balanced structure of the new family is also a merit.", "paper_title": "Straightforward Construction of Depth-Size Optimal, Parallel Prefix Circuits with Fan-Out 2", "paper_id": "WOS:000264681900015"}
