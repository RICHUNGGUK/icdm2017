MODI is defined as an activity class-weighted ratio of the number of nearest-neighbor pairs of compounds with the same activity class versus the total number of pairs. The MODI values were calculated for more than 100 data sets, and the threshold of 0.65 was found to separate the nonmodelable and modelable data sets.", "paper_title": "Data Set Modelability by QSAR", "paper_id": "WOS:000330542800001"}
