The two notions coincide for finite rings, and we show that all finite systems exhibit certain periodicity properties. For the particular case of systems over the ring of integers modulo m > 1, which is important in coding theory, a method is given for determining the number of trajectories, using Grobner basis techniques.", "paper_title": "Finite multidimensional behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000298881400002"}
