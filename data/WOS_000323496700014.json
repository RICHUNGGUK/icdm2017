The NMRT of an omega-independent net consists of all and only reachable markings from its initial marking. Moreover, the applications of the NMRT to deadlock analysis for omega-independent nets are developed. The proposed method has a larger application scope than all the existing methods. Several examples are provided to show its superiority over them.", "paper_title": "A New Modified Reachability Tree Approach and Its Applications to Unbounded Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000323496700014"}
