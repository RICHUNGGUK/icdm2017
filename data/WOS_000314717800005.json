The DBS optimization framework has been modified for designing clustered-dot texture, by using filters with different sizes in the initialization and update steps of the algorithm. Following an intuitive explanation of how the clustered-dot texture results from this modified framework, we derive a closed-form cost metric which, when minimized, equivalently generates stochastic clustered-dot texture. An analysis of the cost metric and its influence on the texture quality is presented, which is followed by a modification to the cost metric to reduce computational cost and to make it more suitable for screen design.", "paper_title": "Clustered-Dot Halftoning With Direct Binary Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000314717800005"}
