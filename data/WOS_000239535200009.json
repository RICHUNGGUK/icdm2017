In our analytical model, an ingress edge node has multiple buffers where IP packets are stored depending on their egress edge nodes, and bursts are assembled at the buffers in round-robin manner. Moreover, bursts are transmitted in accordance with slotted scheduling where each burst transmission starts at the slot boundary. We construct a loss model with two independent arrival streams, and explicitly derive the burst loss probability, burst throughput, and data throughput. In numerical examples, we show the effectiveness of our analysis in comparison with the Erlang loss system. It is shown that our model is quite useful for an OBS network with a large number of input and output links. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
