A solution to this scheduling problem is to partition all sensors into some sensor covers such that each cover can monitor all targets and the covers are activated sequentially. In this paper, we propose to provide information coverage instead of the conventional sensing disk coverage for target. The notion of information coverage is based oil estimation theory to exploit the collaborative nature of geographically distributed sensors. Due to the use of information coverage, a target that is not within the sensing disk of any single sensor can still be considered to be monitored (information covered) by the cooperation of more than one sensor. This change of the problem settings complicates the solutions compared to that by using a disk coverage model. We first define the target information coverage (TIC) problem and prove its NP-completeness. We then propose a heuristic to approximately solve our problem. Simulation results show that our heuristic is better than an existing algorithm and is close to the upper bound when only the sensing disk coverage model is used. Furthermore, simulation results also show that the network lifetime can be significantly improved by using the notion of information coverage compared with that by using the conventional definition of sensing disk coverage.
