The 3 x 2 TIMO channel is mainly studied. First, the capacity fluctuation number (CFN) which reflects the variation of channel capacity is proposed. Then, the expression of the average capacity against the CFN is derived. The CFN is used as a criterion for optimization of the capacity by changing inter-element spacings of transmit and receive antenna arrays. Next, the capacity sensitivity of the 3 x 2 TIMO channel to the orientation and the frequency variation is studied and compared with those of 2 x 2 and 4 x 2 TIMO channels. A small capacity sensitivity of the 3 x 2 TIMO channel is achieved and verified by both simulation and measurement results. Furthermore, the CFN can also be used as a criterion for optimization of average capacity and the proposed optimization method is validated through numerical results.", "paper_title": "Capacity Maximization for Short-Range Millimeter-Wave Line-of-Sight TIMO Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466300004"}
