In this problem we are given bins of size B with C compartments, and n items of Q different classes, each item i is an element of {1,..., n} with class ci and size si. The problem is to pack the items into bins, where each bin contains at most C different classes and has total items size at most B. We present several approximation algorithms for offline and online versions of the problem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
