A matrix characterization of the secrecy capacity region is established via a channel enhancement argument. The enhanced channel is constructed by first splitting receiver 1 into two virtual receivers and then enhancing only the virtual receiver that decodes the confidential message. The secrecy capacity region of the enhanced channel is characterized using an extremal entropy inequality previously established for characterizing the capacity region of a degraded compound MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel.", "paper_title": "Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Gaussian Broadcast Channels With Common and Confidential Messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000283449000007"}
