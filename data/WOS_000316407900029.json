By encoding pairs of symbols, it may be possible to reduce the redundancy penalty of symbol-by-symbol encoding, while preserving the simplicity of the encoding and decoding procedures typical of Golomb codes and their variants. It is shown that optimal codes for these so-called two-dimensional (2-D) geometric distributions are parameter singular, in the sense that a prefix code that is optimal for one value of the parameter q cannot be optimal for any other value of q. This is in sharp contrast to the one-dimensional (1-D) case, where codes are optimal for positive-length intervals of the parameter q. Thus, in the 2-D case, it is infeasible to give a compact characterization of optimal codes for all values of the parameter, q as was done in the 1-D case. Instead, optimal codes are characterized for a discrete sequence of values q of that provides good coverage of the unit interval. Specifically, optimal prefix codes are described for q = 2(-1/k) (k >= 1), covering the range q >= 1/2, and q = 2(-k), (k >= 1), covering the range q < 1/2. The described codes produce the expected reduction in redundancy with respect to the 1-D case, while maintaining low-complexity coding operations.", "paper_title": "Optimal Prefix Codes for Pairs of Geometrically Distributed Random Variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000316407900029"}
