The main considered issue is the selection of paths that minimize the total risk of hazmat shipments while spreading the risk induced on the population in an equitable way. The problem is mathematically formulated, and two heuristic algorithms are proposed for its solution. Substantially, these procedures are modified versions of Yen's algorithm for the k-shortest path problem, which take into due consideration the risk propagation resulting from close paths and spread the risk equitably among zones of the geographical region in which the transportation network is embedded. Furthermore, a lower bound based on a Lagrangean relaxation of the given mathematical formulation is also provided. Finally, a series of computational tests, referring to a regional area is reported.
