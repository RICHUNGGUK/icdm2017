DPNs are a natural model of multi-threaded programs with (possibly recursive) procedure calls and thread creation. Thus, it is important to have model checking algorithms for DPNs. We consider in this work model checking DPNs against single-indexed LTL and CTL properties of the form such that f (i) is a LTL/CTL formula over the PDS i. We consider the model checking problems w.r.t. simple valuations (i.e., whether a configuration satisfies an atomic proposition depends only on its control location) and w.r.t. regular valuations (i.e., the set of the configurations satisfying an atomic proposition is a regular set of configurations). We show that these model checking problems are decidable. We propose automata-based approaches for computing the set of configurations of a DPN that satisfy the corresponding single-indexed LTL/CTL formula.", "paper_title": "Model checking dynamic pushdown networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349854100008"}
