In this study, a network scenario is evaluated in which AWG-based optical nodes are used as burst router nodes within the optical network. The two classical solutions to solve the burst contentions on the channels outgoing from the node are considered, that is, either based on buffering within the node, or by exploiting deflection routing. A performance evaluation is carried out to evaluate and compare these solutions for different network topologies with different node and traffic parameters. Our main contribution is to set numerical tradeoffs between burst deflection through the network and buffering in the node, so that a guidance in optical network design is provided where node buffering is inherently technologically limited.", "paper_title": "Buffering-deflection tradeoffs in optical burst switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000281986700010"}
