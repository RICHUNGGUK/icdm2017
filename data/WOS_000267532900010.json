In this paper, we consider the L-VAs that have L-valued initial and final states. We study the categorical issue of L-VAs. The main technical contributions include: (1) We investigate the relationship between the category of L-VAs and the category of non-deterministic automata (NDAs); also, we study the relationship between the category of generalized L-VAs and the category of NDAs. (2) We prove the existence of isomorphisms between the category of L-VAs and the subcategory of generalized L-VAs and between the category of L-VAs and the category of sets of NDAs. (3) Finally, we further investigate some specific relationships between the output L-valued subsets of generalized L-VAs and the output L-valued subsets of NDAs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
