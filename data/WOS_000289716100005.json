However, it is difficult to realise the integration and optimisation of services in an open environment, which contains large amounts randomicity and uncertainty. The key problem is how to realise the optimal service selection and composition. In this article, the comprehensive performance evaluation metrics for service-oriented manufacturing network is proposed, which combines the key performance indicators of services in business, service and implementation level. The performance evaluation model is brought forward to analyse the local and global performance. An uncertainty and genetic algorithm-based method is developed to realise the optimal service selection and composition in effective and efficient way.", "paper_title": "Optimal service selection and composition for service-oriented manufacturing network", "paper_id": "WOS:000289716100005"}
