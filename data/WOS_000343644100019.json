The control scheme consists of a radial basis function network (RBFN) and a robust controller. By using the finite time convergence property of the terminal sliding mode (TSM), we derive a new online learning algorithm for updating all the parameters of the RBFN that ensures the RBFN has fast approximation for the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. We design a robust controller to compensate RBFN approximation errors and realise the anticipative stability and performance properties. We can also achieve closed-loop system stability using Lyapunov stability theory. No detailed knowledge of the non-linear dynamics of the spacecraft is required at any point in the entire design process, and the proposed robust scheme is simple and effective and can be applied to more complex systems. Simulation results demonstrate the good tracking characteristics of the proposed control scheme in the presence of inertial uncertainties and external disturbances.", "paper_title": "Robust attitude tracking control scheme for a multi-body spacecraft using a radial basis function network and terminal sliding mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000343644100019"}
