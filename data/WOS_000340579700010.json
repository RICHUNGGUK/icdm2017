Even for such simple systems the maximal correlation - as measured by mutual information - over the set of unitarily accessible separable states is highly non-trivial to compute; however for the 2 x 2 case a particular class of spectra admits full analysis and allows us to contrast classical states with more general separable states. We analyse a particular entropic binary relation on the set of spectra and prove for the qubit-qutrit case that this relation alone picks out a unique classical maximum state for mutual information. Moreover the 2 x 3 case is the largest system with such a property.", "paper_title": "ON THE SPECTRAL DEPENDENCE OF SEPARABLE AND CLASSICAL CORRELATIONS IN SMALL QUANTUM SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579700010"}
