This present work extends the classical Kaufman-Roberts formula such that it becomes applicable in CDMA systems in which elastic services with state-dependent instantaneous bit rate and average-bit-rate-dependent. residency time are supported. Our model captures the effect of soft blocking, that is, an arriving session may be blocked in virtually all system states but with a state dependent probability. The core of this method is to approximate the original irreversible Markov chain with a reversible one and to give lower and upper bounds on the so-called partially blocking macro states of the state space. We employ this extended formula to establish lower and upper bounds on the steady state and the classwise blocking probabilities.", "paper_title": "Bounding the blocking probabilities in multirate CDMA networks supporting elastic services", "paper_id": "WOS:000247788700017"}
