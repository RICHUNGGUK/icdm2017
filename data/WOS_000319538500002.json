In order to recommend suitable and attractive social applications, an efficient recommendation system, considering the popularity and reputation of an application as well as the preferences and social relationships of a user, is proposed. By using Facebook as a test platform, the experiment shows that our model outperforms other methodologies and indicates that social relationships play a more important role than the preferences of a user and the popularity of an application.
