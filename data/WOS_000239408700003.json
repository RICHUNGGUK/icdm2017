The canonical problem of interest is formulated based on a model of the blurred image of two closely spaced point sources of unknown brightness. To quantify a measure of resolution in statistical terms, the following question is addressed: \"What is the minimum detectable separation between two point sources at a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and for prespecified probabilities of detection and false alarm (P-d and P-f)?\". Furthermore, asymptotic performance analysis for the estimation of the unknown parameters is carried out using the Cramer-Rao bound. Although similar approaches to this problem (for one-dimensional (I-D) and oversampled signals) have been presented in the past, the analyzes presented in this paper are carried out for the general two-dimensional (2-D) model and general sampling scheme. In particular the case of under-Nyquist (aliased) images is studied. Furthermore, the Kullback-Liebler distance is derived to further confirm the earlier results and to establish a link between the detection-theoretic approach and Fisher information. To study the effects of variation in point spread function (PSF) and model mismatch, a perturbation analysis of the detection problem is presented as well.", "paper_title": "Statistical and information-theoretic analysis of resolution in imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408700003"}
