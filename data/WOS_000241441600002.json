We propose a real options approach to value a tolling contract incorporating operational characteristics of the generation asset and contractual constraints. Dynamic programming and value function approximation by Monte Carlo based least-squares regression are employed to solve the valuation problem. The effects of different electricity price assumptions on the valuation of tolling contracts are examined through numerical examples.", "paper_title": "A real options approach for pricing electricity tolling agreements", "paper_id": "WOS:000241441600002"}
