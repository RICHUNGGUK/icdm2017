In this paper, we study a stochastic model of cloud computing, where jobs arrive according to a stochastic process and request resources like CPU, memory and storage space. We consider a model where the resource allocation problem can be separated into a routing or load balancing problem and a scheduling problem. We study the join-the-shortest-queue routing and power-of-two-choices routing algorithms with the MaxWeight scheduling algorithm. It was known that these algorithms are throughput optimal. In this paper, we show that these algorithms are queue length optimal in the heavy traffic limit. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
