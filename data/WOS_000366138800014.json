In order to protect legitimate users, it is critical for us to obtain an accurate and timely understanding of our cyber opponents. However, at the moment we lack effective tools to do this. In this article we summarize the work on modeling malicious activities from various perspectives, discuss the pros and cons of current models, and present promising directions for possible efforts in the near future.", "paper_title": "Modeling Malicious Activities in Cyber Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000366138800014"}
