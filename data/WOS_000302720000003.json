The significance of wireless communication to our daily lives and industrial engineering will first be discussed. Antennas and circuits used in wireless communication will then be introduced followed by a discussion on the need for optimization. After that, this paper will focus on three widely used optimization algorithms for antennas and RF/microwave circuit design. A survey of the optimization of antennas and microwave devices available in the literature will be presented and will include the use of other optimization algorithms. For illustration purposes two optimization examples with measurement results will be given.", "paper_title": "Computational Optimization Algorithms for Antennas and RF/Microwave Circuit Designs: An Overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000302720000003"}
