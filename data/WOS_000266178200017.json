We give a novel approximation ratio preserving reduction from Directed SNDP to Undirected SNDP. Our reduction extends and widely generalizes as well as significantly simplifies the main results of [G. Kortsarz, R. Krauthgamer, J.R. Lee, Hardness of approximation for vertex-connectivity network design problems, SIAM journal on Computing 33 (3) (2004) 704-720]. Using it, we derive some new hardness of approximation results, as follows. We show that directed and undirected variants of SNDP and of k-Connected Subgraph are equivalent w.r.t. approximation, and that a rho-approximation for Undirected Rooted SNDP implies a rho-approximation for Directed Steiner Tree.
