It is compared with state-of-the-art methods attending the Session to find out whether the algorithm is effective in solving difficult problems. The test results show that CA-ILS may be a competitive method, at least in the tested problems. The results also reveal the classes of problems where CA-ILS can work well and/or not well.", "paper_title": "An experimental study of hybridizing Cultural Algorithms and local search", "paper_id": "WOS:000253582000002"}
