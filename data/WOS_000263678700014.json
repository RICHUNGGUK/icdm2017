Skipping the physically based HDR assembly step simplifies the acquisition pipeline. This avoids camera response curve calibration and is computationally efficient. It also allows for including flash images in the sequence. Our technique blends multiple exposures, guided by simple quality measures like saturation and contrast. This is done in a multiresolution fashion to account for the brightness variation in the sequence. The resulting image quality is comparable to existing tone mapping operators.", "paper_title": "Exposure Fusion: A Simple and Practical Alternative to High Dynamic Range Photography", "paper_id": "WOS:000263678700014"}
