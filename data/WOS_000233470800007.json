We apply a transformation technique to map the multidimensional resource consumption to single dimension. Convex hulls are constructed to reduce the search space to find the near-optimal solution of the MMKP. We present the computational complexity of solving the MMKP using this approach. A comparative analysis of different heuristics for solving the MMKP has been presented based on the experimental results. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
