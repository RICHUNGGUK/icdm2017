In this paper we explore the idea of structural patterns in XML vocabularies, by examining the characteristics of elements as they are used, rather than as they are defined. We introduce from the ground up a formal theory of 8 plus 3 structural patterns for XML elements, and verify their identifiability in a number of different XML vocabularies. The results allowed the creation of visualization and content extraction tools that are completely independent of the schema and without any previous knowledge of the semantics and organization of the XML vocabulary of the documents.", "paper_title": "Dealing with structural patterns of XML documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000340479500010"}
