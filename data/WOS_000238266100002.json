Recently, infrared (IR) imagery of human faces is considered as a promising alternative to visible imagery. IR face recognition is a biometric which offers the security of fingerprints with the convenience of face recognition. However, IR has its own limitations. The presence of eyeglasses has more influence on IR than visible imagery. In this paper, a method based on Log-Gabor wavelets for IR face recognition is proposed. The method first derives a Log-Gabor feature vector from IR face image, then obtains the independent Log-Gabor features by using independent component analysis (ICA). Experimental results show that the proposed method works well, even in challenging situations.", "paper_title": "Infrared face recognition based on Log-Gabor wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000238266100002"}
