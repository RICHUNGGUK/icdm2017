In order to describe the self-driven function of the node's state, a state transfer matrix is introduced. Three typical network structures (random network, small-world network and scale-free network) are numerically studied in order to investigate the impact of network structure. Simulation results show that, according to the phase synchronization index, the coupling strength is divided into four regions: the increasing region, the maximum region, the decreasing region and the oscillation region. Moreover, the size of the oscillation region seems to be changeless, independent of the network structure and a parameter describing the number of total node's states.", "paper_title": "SYNCHRONIZATION BEHAVIOR IN DISCRETE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291739600001"}
