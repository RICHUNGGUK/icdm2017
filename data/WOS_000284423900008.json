In this paper, we present methods for performing such pairwise computations efficiently in parallel on Cell processors. This problem is particularly challenging on the Cell processor due to the small sized Local Stores of the Synergistic Processing Elements, the main computational cores of the processor. We present techniques for different variants of this problem including those with large number of entities or when the dimensionality of the information per entity is large. We demonstrate our methods in the context of multiple applications drawn from fluid dynamics, materials science and systems biology, and present detailed experimental results. Our software library is an open source and can be readily used by application scientists to accelerate pairwise computations using Cell accelerators.", "paper_title": "Accelerating Pairwise Computations on Cell Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000284423900008"}
