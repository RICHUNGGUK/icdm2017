A mechatronic unit that uses a multi-axis force/torque sensor has been specially designed and we propose to control the system by using a reduced dynamic model. The control method makes use of an inner-loop to control the position of two servo-motors, by means of PID regulators, and an outer-loop that cancels the tip vibration. Moreover, the closed-loop motor dynamics has been reduced by using a series connection of filters that invert its dynamics. The motor controllers have proved to be fast and precise, and cancel the non-modelled components of the motor friction without the need for a previous estimation. The flexible-beam vibration has been controlled by implementing an input-state feedback linearisation which includes compensation terms for the nonlinear beam dynamics, a linear feedback control law and a full state estimator. The experimental validation of the complete control method showed a significant trajectory tracking of the tip, while vibrations were prevented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
