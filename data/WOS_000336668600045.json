This topology is composed of an H-bridge circuit and a ripple power-decoupling circuit. The ripple power-decoupling circuit shares one bridge arm with the H-bridge circuit so it has less additional components: just one IGBT, one diode, and an energy-storage inductor. Its modulation strategy is properly devised to coordinate the operation of decoupling circuit and H-bridge circuit. To enhance the power-decoupling performance, a direct ripple power-cancellation method based on energy-storage inductor is proposed. A multiresonant controller with feed-forward control is introduced for fast and precise current tracking. The effectiveness of this topology has been verified by detailed simulation studies as well as the laboratory prototype experiment results.", "paper_title": "An Active Power-Decoupling Method for Single-Phase AC-DC Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600045"}
