By means of the Lyapunov stability theory, a feedback controller is designed for achieving lag synchronization between two delayed neural networks systems in finite time. Paper extends some basic results from the area of finite time to time-delay systems. Numerical simulations on coupled Lu neural systems illustrate the effectiveness of the results.
