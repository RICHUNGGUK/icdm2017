But with this innovation has come complexity. To keep up, ecologists must master multiple specialized software packages, such as ArcGIS for display and manipulation of geospatial data, R for statistical analysis, and MATLAB for matrix processing. This requires a costly investment of time and energy learning computer programming, a high hurdle for many ecologists. To provide easier access to advanced analytic methods, we developed Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET), an extensible collection of powerful, easy-to-use, open-source geoprocessing tools that ecologists can invoke from ArcGIS without resorting to computer programming. Internally, MGET integrates Python, R, MATLAB, and C++, bringing the power of these specialized platforms to tool developers without requiring developers to orchestrate the interoperability between them. In this paper, we describe MGETs software architecture and the tools in the collection. Next, we present an example application: a habitat model for Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) that predicts dolphin presence using a statistical model fitted with oceanographic predictor variables. We conclude by discussing the lessons we learned engineering a highly integrated tool framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
