In TM-MAC, we implement a concurrent multiuser access scheme instead of a mutual exclusion method such as TDMA and random access. For multiuser interference, we establish a model to adaptively adjust the data transmission rate to generate the expected signal to interference noise ratio ( SINR) at the receiver side for reliable communications. We also analyze the relationship among the theoretical maximum channel capacity, achievable maximum channel capacity, and data transmission rate. According to network topology, TM-MAC redivides each piconet into several subsets in which communication pairs can make communication simultaneously and achieve the maximum throughput using the highest data rate. In subset formation, we propose a general analytical framework that captures the unique characteristics of shared wireless channel and throughput variance, as well as allows the modeling of a large class of systemwide throughput maximization via the specification of the per-link utilization function. For algorithm essential parameters design, we consider the influence of traffic type on the system performance. Heavy tailed distribution, compared to Poisson distribution for most existing work, is exploited to accurately model the real traffic to achieve the adaptation of our algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithm can maximize throughput to achieve short latency.", "paper_title": "Throughput and energy-efficiency-aware protocol for ultrawideband communication in wireless sensor networks: A cross-layer approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000255012900011"}
