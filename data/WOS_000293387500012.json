If a facility fails, customers originally assigned to it have to be reassigned to other (operational) facilities. We formulate this problem as a two-stage stochastic program and then as a nonlinear integer program. Several heuristics that can produce near-optimal solutions are proposed for this NP-hard problem. For the special case where the probability that a facility fails is a constant (independent of the facility), we provide an approximation algorithm with a worst-case bound of 4. The effectiveness of our heuristics is tested by extensive computational studies, which also lead to some managerial insights.", "paper_title": "The Reliable Facility Location Problem: Formulations, Heuristics, and Approximation Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000293387500012"}
