However, an image sequence provides no depth information. We propose the novel endoscope system with compound eye and wavelength band pass filter. The system is composed of micro-lens array, wavelength band pass filter, separation layer and image sensor. Several wave length band pass filters are covered with each micro-lens. The proposed system makes it possible to take any images from the membrane surface to deep blood vessel simultaneously. With several test targets, the characteristics of the prototype system are evaluated.", "paper_title": "EVALUATION OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL ENDOSCOPE USING COMPOUND EYE OPTICAL SYSTEM WITH MULTI-WAVELENGTH BAND-PASS FILTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000293817400008"}
