Our approach is based on a particular factorization of strings which on the average allows to pack in a machine word of w bits automata state configurations for strings of length greater than w. We adapted the Shift-And and BNDM algorithms using our encoding and compared them with the original algorithms. Experimental results show that the new variants are generally faster for long patterns.
