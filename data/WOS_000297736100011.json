The agitator has six rotor blades matched with six stationary guide blades. The mechanism and phenomena of the flow are investigated in the area between two adjacent stationary guide blades. Eddies near each tip of the rotational blades are predicted, and they move with the motion of the rotor blades but in opposite rotation direction of the rotor. The rotation axis of the eddies is traced and annular vortices, which are made by the eddies, are studied. The pressure pulsation in the rotation process is also predicted with this particle method.
