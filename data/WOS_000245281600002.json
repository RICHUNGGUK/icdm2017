Similar to feature selection algorithm ReliefF, the proposed algorithm exploits the contextual information via selection of nearest instances. The ordEval algorithm outputs probabilistic factors corresponding to the effect an increase/decrease of attribute's value has on the class value. While the ordEval algorithm is general and can be used for analysis of any survey with graded answers, we show its utility on an important marketing problem of customer (dis) satisfaction. We develop a visualization technique and show how we can use it to detect and confirm several findings from marketing theory.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of ordinal attributes at value level", "paper_id": "WOS:000245281600002"}
