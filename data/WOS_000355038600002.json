It is also shown that the problem whether a boundary value problem has a global solution is not algorithmically decidable. The negative results retain even within the class of quasilinear equations defined by analytic computable functions over particularly simple domains (quasilinear equations are among the simplest first-order nonlinear partial differential equations). This fact shows that the algorithmic unsolvability is intrinsic. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
