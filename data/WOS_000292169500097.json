Artificial neural networks (ANNs) method for more than 300 datasets was used for evaluating free swelling index value. In this investigation, some of input parameters (nearly 10) were used. For selecting the best model for this study, outputs of models were compared. A three-layer ANN was found to be optimum with architecture of 12 and 5 neurons in the first and second hidden layer, respectively, and 1 neuron in output layer. In this work, training and test data's square correlation coefficients (R(2)) achieved 0.99 and 0.92, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows that, nitrogen (dry), carbon (dry), hydrogen (dry), Btu (dry), volatile matter (dry) and fixed carbon (dry) have positive effects and moisture, oxygen (dry), ash (dry) and total sulfur (dry) have negative effects on FSI. Finally, the fixed carbon was found to have the lowest effect (0.0425) on FSI. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
