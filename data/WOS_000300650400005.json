The procedure relies on three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationships (3D-QSAR) and does not require structural knowledge of the binding site. Candidate alignments are automatically built and ranked according to a consensus scoring function. 3D-QSAR analysis based on the selected binding mode enables affinity prediction of new drug candidates having less than 10 rotatable bonds.", "paper_title": "A 3D-QSAR-Driven Approach to Binding Mode and Affinity Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000300650400005"}
