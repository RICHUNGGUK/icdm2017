The Helmholtz differential equation is solved for both, the spectral and the source problems, and each of these is formulated in terms of pressure and displacement. The pressure formulation allows to use standard Lagrangian elements whereas Raviart-Thomas elements are applied for the displacement formulation. Both formulations are tested in several examples. It is shown that Raviart-Thomas elements account for a reasonable alternative to Lagrangian elements in some cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
