The MD calculations verify the formation of hexagonal ice nanotubes at the phase transition temperature T-c = 275 K by a sharp change in the location of the oxygen atoms inside the SWCNT. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis provides evidence of considerable intermolecular charge transfer during the phase transition and verifies that the ice nanotube contains two different forms of hydrogen bonding due to confinement. Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses were used to demonstrate the fundamental influence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions on the formation and electronic structure of ice nanotubes. In addition, the NQR analysis revealed that the rearrangement of nano-confined water molecules during the phase transition could be detected directly by the orientation of O-17 atom EFG tensor components related to the molecular frame axes. The effects of nanoscale confinements in ice nanotubes and water clusters were analyzed by experimentally observable NMR and NQR parameters. These findings showed a close relationship between the phase behavior and orientation of the electronic structure in nanoscale structures and demonstrate the usefulness of NBO and NQR parameters for detecting phase transition phenomena in nanoscale confining environments.
