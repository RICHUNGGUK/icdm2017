In this paper, we first investigate numerous GPS mobility traces of human mobile nodes and observe superdiffusive behavior in all GPS traces, which is characterized by a \"faster-than-linear\" growth rate of the mean square displacement (MSD) of a mobile node. We then investigate a large amount of access point (AP) based traces, and develop a theoretical framework built upon continuous time random walk (CTRW) formalism, in which one can identify the degree of diffusive behavior of mobile nodes even under possibly heavy-tailed pause time distribution, as in the case of reality. We study existing synthetic models and trace-based models in terms of the capability of producing various degrees of diffusive behavior, and use a set of Levy walk models due to its simplicity and flexibility. In addition, we show that diffusive properties make a huge impact on contact-based metrics and the performance of routing protocols in various scenarios, and that existing models such as random waypoint, random direction model, or Brownian motion lead to overly optimistic or pessimistic results when diffusive properties are not properly captured. Our work in this paper, thus, suggests that the diffusive behavior of mobile nodes should be correctly captured and taken into account for the design and comparison study of network protocols.", "paper_title": "Superdiffusive Behavior of Mobile Nodes and Its Impact on Routing Protocol Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000273447600011"}
