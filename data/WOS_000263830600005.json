In this paper, we present a novel biorthogonal wavelet-constructed through the lifting scheme-that accommodates the quad/triangle subdivision. The introduced wavelet smoothly unifies the Catmull-Clark subdivision wavelet (for quadrilateral meshes) and the Loop subdivision wavelet (for triangular meshes) in a single framework. It can be used to flexibly and efficiently process any complicated semi-regular hybrid meshes containing both quadrilateral and triangular regions. Because the analysis and synthesis algorithms of the wavelet are composed of only local lifting operations allowing fully in-place calculations, they can be performed in linear time. The experiments demonstrate sufficient stability and fine fitting quality of the presented wavelet, which are similar to those of the Catmull-Clark subdivision wavelet and the Loop subdivision wavelet. The wavelet analysis can be used in various applications, such as shape approximation, progressive transmission, data compression and multiresolution edit of complex models.", "paper_title": "Biorthogonal wavelet construction for hybrid quad/triangle meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000263830600005"}
