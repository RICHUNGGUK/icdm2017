There has been extensive work to construct an optimal neural network for controlling a mobile robot by evolutionary approaches such as genetic algorithm, genetic programming, and so on. However, evolutionary approaches have a difficulty to design the controller that conducts complex behaviors. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we propose an incremental evolution method for neural networks based on cellular automata and a method of combining several evolved modules by a rule-based approach. The incremental evolution method evolves the neural network by starting with simple environment and gradually making it more complex. The multi-modules integration method can make complex behaviors by combining several modules evolved or programmed to do simple behaviors. Simulation results show the potential of the incremental evolution and multi-module integration methods as sophisticated techniques to make the evolved neural network to do complex behaviors. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the applicability of cellular automata-based neural networks and propose sophisticated techniques for the generation of high-level behaviors.
