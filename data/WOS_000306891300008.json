Essential to get a system implemented is acceptance. In a distributed setting this is challenging, especially when one deals with multiple independent and competing companies. We share our experiences with the use of a real-time multi-player simulation game that we developed to illustrate a Multi-Agent system for the barge handling problem in the Port of Rotterdam. We experienced that the game has many advantages over a more passive approach, such as vocal presentations. We conclude that the game has considerably contributed to the acceptance of the illustrated Multi-Agent system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
