Especially, the strong penetration of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) into the communications standards has triggered heavy investigation on multicarrier systems, leading to re-consideration of different approaches as an alternative to OFDM. The goal of the present survey is not only to provide a unified review of waveform design options for multicarrier schemes, but also to pave the way for the evolution of the multicarrier schemes from the current state of the art to future technologies. In particular, a generalized framework on multicarrier schemes is presented, based on what to transmit, i.e., symbols, how to transmit, i.e., filters, and where/when to transmit, i.e., lattice. Capitalizing on this framework, different variations of orthogonal, bi-orthogonal, and non-orthogonal multicarrier schemes are discussed. In addition, filter designs for various multicarrier systems are reviewed considering four different design perspectives: energy concentration, rapid decay, spectrum nulling, and channel/hardware characteristics. Subsequently, evaluation tools which may be used to compare different filters in multicarrier schemes are studied. Finally, multicarrier schemes are evaluated from the perspective of practical implementation aspects, such as lattice adaptation, equalization, synchronization, multiple antennas, and hardware impairments.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Multicarrier Communications: Prototype Filters, Lattice Structures, and Implementation Aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000343072200008"}
