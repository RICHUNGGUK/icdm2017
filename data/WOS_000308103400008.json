However, the verification accuracy cannot meet the need of some application domains. In this paper, we propose to use videos for fingerprint verification. To take full use of the information contained in fingerprint videos, we present a novel method to use the dynamic as well as the static information in fingerprint videos. After preprocessing and aligning processes, the Inclusion Ratio of two matching fingerprint videos is calculated and used to represent the similarity between these two videos. Experimental results show that video-based method can access better accuracy than the method based on single fingerprint.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL METHOD USING VIDEOS FOR FINGERPRINT VERIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000308103400008"}
