In recent works, the kernel recursive least squares CMAC (KRLS-CMAC) was proposed as a superior alternative to the standard CMAC as it converges faster and does not require tuning of a learning rate parameter. One improvement to the standard CMAC that has been discussed in the literature is eligibility, and vector eligibility. With vector eligibility the CMAC is able to control online motion control problems that it could not previously, stabilize the system much faster, and converge to a more intelligent solution. This paper integrates vector eligibility with the KRLS-CMAC and shows how the combination is advantageous through two simulated control experiments.", "paper_title": "The Kernel Recursive Least Squares CMAC with Vector Eligibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000336026700004"}
