Fourteen parameters affecting the ferrite fraction were considered as inputs, including the cooling rate, initial austenite grain size, and different chemical compositions. The network was then trained to predict the ferrite fraction amounts as outputs. A multilayer feed-forward back-propagation network was developed and trained using experimental data form literatures. The predicted values are in very good agreement with the measured ones indicating that the developed model is very accurate and has the great ability for predicting the ferrite fraction.", "paper_title": "ANN-based prediction of ferrite fraction in continuous cooling of microalloyed steels", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200022"}
