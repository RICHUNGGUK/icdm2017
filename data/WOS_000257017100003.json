Topological and geometric criteria have been proposed to evaluate and compare DGGSs; two of which, intercell distance and the \"cell wall midpoint\" criterion, form the basis of this study. We propose evaluation metrics for these two criteria and present numerical results from these measures for several DGGSs. We also consider the impact of different design choices on these metrics, such as predominant tessellating shape, base modeling solid and partition density between recursive subdivisions. For the intercell distance metric, the Fuller-Gray DGGS performs best, while the Equal Angle DGGS performs substantially worse. For the cell wall midpoint metric, however, the Equal Angle DGGS has the lowest overall distortion with the Snyder and Fuller-Gray DGGSs also performing relatively well. Aggregation of triangles into hexagons has little impact on intercell distance measurements, although dual hexagon aggregation results in markedly different statistics and spatial patterns for the cell wall midpoint property. In all cases, partitions on the icosahedron outperform similar partitions on the octahedron. Partition density accounts for little variation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
