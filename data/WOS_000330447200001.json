An extension of this logic to obligations (respectively permissions and prohibitions) to do an action before a given deadline or during a given time interval is defined. These temporal constraints are defined by events which may have several occurrences (like the obligation to update a given file before midnight). Violations of these kinds of norms are defined in this logical framework.", "paper_title": "Obligations with deadlines: a formalization in Dynamic Deontic Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000330447200001"}
