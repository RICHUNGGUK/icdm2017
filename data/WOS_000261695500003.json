To that end, we have implemented a system called TeamSpace for capturing and reviewing general meetings. In this article, we describe the long-term deployment of TeamSpace to a university research group, along with a pseudo-controlled study involving the same group of users and their meetings. We gained a detailed understanding of the behavioral patterns involved in reviewing meeting content and how to improve on the experience. Our evaluations also demonstrate several of the barriers and challenges in realizing the potential benefits of meeting capture.", "paper_title": "Reviewing Meetings in TeamSpace", "paper_id": "WOS:000261695500003"}
