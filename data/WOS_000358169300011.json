In SLICE networks, a routing and spectrum allocation algorithm assigns a spectrum path (SP) to any demand with just enough contiguous sub-carriers while following the spectrum continuity and the sub-carrier consecutiveness constraints. In this paper, we propose efficient sub-carrier allocation algorithms to assign sub-carriers to SPs whose spectrum demands could fluctuate with time. An integer linear programming model is developed to minimize the network reconfiguration and spectrum usage. Based on the historic traffic profile, an interference graph technique is proposed to facilitate the sub-carrier assignment. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can effectively accommodate the dynamic time-varying traffic while minimizing the network reconfiguration cost in SLICE networks.", "paper_title": "Spectrum allocation in spectrum-sliced elastic optical path networks using traffic prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000358169300011"}
