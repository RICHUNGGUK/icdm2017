In this paper, we provide an error analysis for the regularized classifiers using multivariate polynomial kernels. We introduce Bernstein-Durrmeyer polynomials, whose reproducing kernel Hilbert space norms and approximation properties in L-1 space play a key role in the analysis of regularization error. We also introduce the standard estimation of sample error, and derive explicit learning rates for these algorithms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
