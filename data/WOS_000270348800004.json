The protocol mitigates the multi-channel hidden and exposed terminal problems by using information about channel usage gleaned from overhearing (cooperating) neighbours. By accounting for the multiple access interference, CCM-MAC also addresses the near-far problem of CDMA in MANETs enabling concurrent transmissions on each channel. We provide an analysis of the maximum throughput of CCM-MAC and validate it through simulation in MATLAB. We also compare the throughput it achieves to IEEE 802.11, a multi-channel MAC protocol, and a CDMA-based MAC protocol. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
