Factorial cumulants arise in the same manner from factorial moments as do (ordinary) cumulants from (ordinary) moments. Another tool we exploit is a new identity for 'moments' of partitions of numbers. The general limiting result is then used to (re-)derive asymptotic normality for several models including classical discrete distributions, occupancy problems in some generalized allocation schemes and two models related to negative multinomial distribution.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Normality Through Factorial Cumulants and Partition Identities", "paper_id": "WOS:000314296400003"}
