By recursively applying the D-morphism to the maximum-length LFSRs and representing the cycles by generating functions, a new family of maximum-length nonlinear feedback shift registers (NFSRs) are proposed based on the properties of these LFSRs. The number of NFSRs in the proposed family is also considered.", "paper_title": "The Properties of a Class of Linear FSRs and Their Applications to the Construction of Nonlinear FSRs", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900041"}
