Service integration had become an important issue for system development. In this paper, we present an approach for UPnP devices connecting to outer networks via UPnP aware gateway. We develop service on a smart campus network based on enhanced UPnP technologies as an example. Under such framework, intelligent system provides users individual information at the right place and the right time.", "paper_title": "Service integration with UPnP agent for an ubiquitous home environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000274009000002"}
