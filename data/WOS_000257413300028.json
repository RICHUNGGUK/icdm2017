The approximation is accurate if the errors in the image correspondences are small. The parameter space for the focus of expansion is sampled at a finite set of points chosen such that every point in the space is near to at least one sample point. A focus of expansion is detected by checking each sample point in turn to see if it is supported by the image correspondences. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
