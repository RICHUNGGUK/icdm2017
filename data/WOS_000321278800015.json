Such paths are readily available in ad hoc wireless networks. To approach the original quality, all descriptions need to be successfully received. However, in a wireless channel, error bursts or link disruption may still affect one or more descriptions, resulting in significant drops in video quality. This article describes a lower complexity yet effective scheme for video streaming over such wireless networks. In order to improve error resiliency, the scheme combines unequal packet importance with the advantages of path diversity. The scheme can be implemented with a minimal increase in computational complexity, as spatial decomposition of video frames is employed to generate the descriptions. Experimental results for an ad hoc wireless network show that a significant objective quality gain can be achieved (up to 3 dB) in the presence of signal shadow fading.", "paper_title": "VIDEO STREAMING OVER AN AD HOC NETWORK USING DATA PARTITIONING AND PATH DIVERSITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000321278800015"}
