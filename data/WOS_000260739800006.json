This technique, if implemented appropriately, will be able to shorten the prototyping time for control system research and development in both academic and industrial areas. The two cases presented involve complicated dynamics: road/tire steering dynamics and chemical/electrical dynamics in a fuel cell, for which software packages are available to simulate. Therefore, for the purpose of steering and SRM drive control performance validation, successful real-time simulation is desired through interfacing with these software, i.e. making software package in the loop. The case studies presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of this concept. The presented real-time SIL simulation is conducted on a two-node computer platform engineered by RT-Lab, operating in fixed-step real time. Comparison between real-time and off-line simulation is also presented.", "paper_title": "Real Time Software-in-the-Loop Simulation for Control Performance Validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260739800006"}
