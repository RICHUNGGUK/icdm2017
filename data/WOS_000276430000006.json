The initialization of laboratory quantities in a relativistically moving frame is depicted, and the method for result comparison with the plasma rest frame is described. Benchmarks with laboratory frame simulations and experimental data where gains of similar to 20 times were obtained are discussed, and potential numerical issues are analyzed. This method enables numerical simulations with shorter turnaround times required for parameter scanning, and for one-to-one three-dimensional experimental modeling of current and next generation laser wakefield experiments.
