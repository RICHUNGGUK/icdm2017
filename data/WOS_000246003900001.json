A sharp upper bound d(R) (S, T) <= 4n - 8 is known, based on group theory [S. Cleary, J. Taback., Bounding restricted rotation distance, Information Processing Letters 88 (5) (2003) 251-256]. We refine this bound to a sharp d(R) (S, T) <= 4n - 8 - rho(S) - rho(T), where rho(S) and rho(T) are the numbers of vertices in the rightmost vertex chains of the two trees, using an elementary transformation algorithm. We then generalize the concept to k-restricted rotation, by allowing rotations to take place at all the vertices of the highest k levels of the tree, and study the new distance for k = 2. The case k >= 3 is essentially open. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "k-restricted rotation distance between binary trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000246003900001"}
