High degree of correlation between the RGB planes of a color image is reduced by transforming them to O1O2O3 planes. Each O-i plane (1 <= i <= 3) is then encoded using BTC-PF method. Size of the pattern book and the block size are selected based on the information content of the corresponding plane. The result of the proposed method is compared with that of several BTC based methods and the former is found superior. Though this method is a spatial domain technique, it is also compared with JPEG compression method, which is one of most popular frequency domain techniques. It is found that the performance of the proposed method is a little inferior to that of the JPEG in terms of quality of the reconstructed image. Decoding time is another important criterion where the compressed image is decoded frequently for various purposes. As the proposed method requires negligible decoding time compared to JPEG, the former is preferred over the latter in those cases. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
