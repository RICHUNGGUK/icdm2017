Drawing on the justice theory, this research identified the factors affecting continuous usage of LBS. Perceived justice reflects a set of fairness perceptions and involves three dimensions: distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice, which reflect outcome fairness, process fairness and treatment fairness, respectively. We conducted data analysis with structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that procedural justice is the main factor affecting privacy risk, whereas distributive justice is the main factor affecting perceived usefulness. Privacy risk and perceived usefulness influence continuous usage. Thus mobile service providers need to improve users' perceived justice to facilitate their usage of LBS.", "paper_title": "Examining continuous usage of location-based services from the perspective of perceived justice", "paper_id": "WOS:000316020500011"}
