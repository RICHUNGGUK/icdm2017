To process this information we use a recent generalization of Walley's imprecise Dirichlet model, allowing us also to handle incomplete observations or imprecise judgements, including missing data. We derive efficient algorithms and discuss properties of the optimal solutions with respect to several criteria, including Gamma-maximinity and E-admissibility. In the case of precise data and pure actions the former surprisingly leads us to a frequency-based variant of the Hodges-Lehmann criterion, which was developed in classical decision theory as a compromise between Bayesian and mini-max procedures.
