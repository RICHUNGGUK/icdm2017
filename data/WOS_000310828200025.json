Interoperability problems limit health care applications from achieving their full potential. In this paper, we propose the use of Semantic Web technologies to solve interoperability problems between data providers. Through the development of unifying health care ontologies, data from multiple health care providers can be aggregated, which can then be used as input for a decision support system. This way, more data is taken into account than a single health care provider possesses in his local setting. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by the creation of an end-to-end proof of concept, focusing on Belgian health care providers and medicinal decision support.
