The inference of the most suitable response should be made according to a set of response metrics that specify different rules for selecting a specific response according to some context and input parameters and the weight associated with each of them. Furthermore, the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) can be used to specify these response metrics, providing an open and extensible framework for the behavior description of an AIRS, able to be integrated with the increasing number of Semantic Web tools. The aim of this paper is to study and characterize these metrics, as well as defining a set of response metrics for an AIRS, specifying these metrics with SWRL rules and testing their execution with Semantic Web current technologies. Finally, some results are shown concerning the inferred responses and performance of this SWRL-based reasoning. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
