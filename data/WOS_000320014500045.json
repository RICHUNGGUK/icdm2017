From this we derive an oversampling expansion for any bandpass signal, and show that any finitely many missing samples from two-channel oversampling expansion can always be uniquely recovered. In addition, we find a sufficient condition under which some infinitely many missing samples can be recovered. Numerical stability of the recovery process is also discussed in terms of the oversampling rate and distribution of the missing samples.", "paper_title": "Recovery of Missing Samples from Oversampled Bandpass Signals and Its Stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000320014500045"}
