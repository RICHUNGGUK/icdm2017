Consequently, characterization and passive macromodeling of high-speed modules such as interconnects, vias, and packages based on tabulated data are becoming important. This paper presents a fast algorithm for passivity verification and enforcement of large order macromodels of scattering parameter based multiport subnetworks. Numerous examples tested on this algorithm demonstrate a significant speed-up compared to the existing algorithms in the literature.", "paper_title": "Fast passivity verification and enforcement via reciprocal systems for interconnects with large order macromodels", "paper_id": "WOS:000244803900006"}
