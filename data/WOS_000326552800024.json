Further developments could not just overturn this predicament, but lead to completely new perspectiVes in biology. Here, we give an account of our own computational tool and how we have put it to good use, and we discuss a paradigmatic example to outline a path to making cell biology more quantitative and predictive.", "paper_title": "Computer-Aided Biophysical Modeling: A Quantitative Approach to Complex Biological Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326552800024"}
