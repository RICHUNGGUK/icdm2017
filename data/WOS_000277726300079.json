In nine test data sets covering three ambiguous personal names, we address the issues of awareness degree of an entity, the source of materials and web pages in different areas. In a single-clusterer approach, employing all features achieve average F-score 0.635, which is better than employing contextual terms only 0.502. When community chains are expanded by using the web, the average F-score is increased to 0.676. We also propose a multiple-clusterer approach, which cascades five clusterers corresponding to the five features. The average F-score is further improved to 0.684. Expanding community chains also enhances the average F-score of the multiple-clusterer approach to 0.697. In summary, the proposed features are quite useful; the cascaded multiple-clusterer approach is better than the single-clusterer approach; and expanding community chains using the web has positive effects on personal name disambiguation. The experiments show that this approach has significant improvements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
