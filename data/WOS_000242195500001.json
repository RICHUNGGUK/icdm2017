These shell elements axe built up from flat triangular membranes and plates. We propose an element comprised of the constant strain triangle (CST) membrane element and the discrete Kirchhoff (DKT) plate element and describe its formulation while stressing two main issues: the derivation of the geometric stiffness matrix and the isolation of the rigid body motion from the total deformations. We further use it to solve a broad class of problems from the literature to validate its use.", "paper_title": "Geometrically Nonlinear analysis structures using a flat triangular element", "paper_id": "WOS:000242195500001"}
