Two scenarios are considered: the large scale MIMO and the conventional scale MIMO. It is found that, in order to get the maximum spectral efficiency, the CNT bundle size should be optimized to obtain a tradeoff between antenna efficiency and the number of antennas for a given area. This work also takes into account the random fluctuation in the bundle size during the CNT bundled antenna fabrication which reduces the system spectral efficiency.", "paper_title": "Spectral Efficiency of Carbon Nanotube Antenna Based MIMO Systems in the Terahertz Band", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100014"}
