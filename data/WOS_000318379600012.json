This novel intelligent procedure is based on the following phases. Firstly, a neural model extracts the internal structure and the relevant features of the data set representing the system. Secondly, the dynamic system performance of different variables is specifically modelled using a supervised neural model and identification techniques. This constitutes the model for the fitness function of the production process, using relevant features of the data set. Finally, a genetic algorithm is used to optimise the machine parameters from a non parametric fitness function. The proposed novel approach was tested under real dental milling processes using a high-precision machining centre with five axes, requiring high finishing precision of measures in micrometres with a large number of process factors to analyse. The results of the experiment, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
