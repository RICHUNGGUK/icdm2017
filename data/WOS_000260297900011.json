Target peak data rates of 1 Gb/s in local areas and 100 Mb/s in wide areas are expected to be provided by means of advanced MIMO antenna configurations and very high spectrum allocations (on the order of 100 MHz). For the downlink, OFDMA is unanimously considered the most appropriate technique for achieving high spectral efficiency. For the uplink, the LTE of the 3GPP, for example, employs SC-FDMA due to its low PAPR properties compared to OFDMA. For future IMT-A systems, the decision on the most appropriate uplink access scheme is still an open issue, as many benefits can be obtained by exploiting the flexible frequency granularity of OFDMA. In this article we discuss the suitability of using OFDMA or SC-FDMA in the uplink for local area high-data-rate scenarios by considering as target performance metrics the PAPR and multi-user diversity gain. Also, new bandwidth configurations have been proposed to cope with the 100 MHz spectrum allocation. In particular, the PAPR analysis shows that a localized (not distributed) allocation of the resource blocks (RBs) in the frequency domain shall be employed for SC-FDMA in order to keep its advantages over OFDMA in terms of PAPR reduction. Furthermore, from the multi-user diversity gain evaluation emerges the fact that the impact of different RB sizes and bandwidth configurations is low, given the propagation characteristics of the assumed local area environment. For full bandwidth usage, OFDMA only outperforms SC-FDMA when the number of frequency multiplexed users is low. As the spectrum load decreases, instead, OFDMA outperforms SC-FDMA also for a high number of frequency multiplexed users, due to its more flexible resource allocation. In this contex different channel-aware scheduling algorithms have been proposed due to the resource allocation differences between the two schemes.", "paper_title": "OFDMA VS.
