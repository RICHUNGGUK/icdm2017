Two neurons are derived by adding and multiplying the outputs of the wavelet and the sigmoidal activation functions. These neurons in a feed-forward single hidden layer network result summation wavelet neural network (SWNN) and multiplication wavelet neural network (MWNN). An algorithm is introduced for structure determination of the proposed networks. Approximation properties of SWNN and MWNN have been evaluated with different wavelet functions. The above networks in the consequent part of the neuro-fuzzy model result summation wavelet neuro-fuzzy (SWNF) and multiplication wavelet neuro-fuzzy (MWNF) models. Different types of wavelet function are tested with the proposed networks and fuzzy models on four different dynamical examples. Convergence of the learning process is also guaranteed by adaptive learning rate and performing stability analysis using Lyapunov function.
