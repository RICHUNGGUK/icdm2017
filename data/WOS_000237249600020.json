This is a hard nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem for which we investigate an efficient technique based on DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC optimization Algorithm). Preliminary numerical results on some artificial and real-world databases show the efficiency and the superiority of this approach with respect to related existing methods.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical clustering based on mathematical optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600020"}
