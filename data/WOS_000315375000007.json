The integration of diverse components which are developed and produced by different technologies and materials is a major challenge in a smart clothing system technology. Therefore, an integrated methodology based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy information axiom is used for the solution of this problem.", "paper_title": "Developing a Smart Clothing System for Blinds Based on Information Axiom", "paper_id": "WOS:000315375000007"}
