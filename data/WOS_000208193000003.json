This is the motivation behind MyNet, a P2P platform that enables non-expert users to easily organize their resources and share them in their immediate social neighborhood. In this paper, we present our experience following a user-centered approach in designing MyNet: using real-world metaphors in the core system, leveraging NFC-based touch to mirror human behavior models, and involving actual users in the design process. The results of our 50-user usability evaluation are also presented in detail. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
