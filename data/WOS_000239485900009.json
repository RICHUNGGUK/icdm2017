The dynamics of a process model are based on Petri Nets. This allows us to use a process definition model to plan and track the execution of actual projects. This new language can be integrated with existing approaches for software process modeling such as Software Process Engineering Metamodel.", "paper_title": "Process definition and project tracking in model driven engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485900009"}
