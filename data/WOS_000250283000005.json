It aims to establish likely operational models and investigate their relationship with tailored logistics. Design/methodology/approach - Multiple case-studies with shippers, carriers and technology providers, involving inter-views, process mapping, work-shops and system demonstrations. Findings - Key attributes in relation to processes, relationships and technology are identified. Finding reveal that the ELM business model is still at its infancy stage but with huge potential for growth in optimizing supply chain networks, and enabling the provision of tailored logistics. Practical implications - Business-to-business electronic marketplaces are becoming more common in practice. By characterizing the different operational models, decision makers in logistics can identify which structure is best suited for their particular application. The paper confirms the existence of three distinct ELM structures, while also specifying their key attributes. It provides a foundation for future research in this developing field. Originality/value - Research on ELMs is scarce. The paper establishes fundamentals of the operational models available to support closed ELM and provides insights on how different closed ELMs are structured, what they do and how they impact tailored logistics.", "paper_title": "Electronic marketplaces for tailored logistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000250283000005"}
