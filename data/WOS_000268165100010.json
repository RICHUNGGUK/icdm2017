Such data can be constrained by domain knowledge provided by relations between the variables and these relations are expressed by rules. However, such knowledge can introduce a combinatorial increase in the computation time depending on the number of rules. In this paper, we present a way to cluster such data in polynomial time. The method is based on the following: a decomposition of the data according to the rules, a suitable dissimilarity function and a clustering algorithm based on dissimilarities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
