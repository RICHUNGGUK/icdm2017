To address this challenge, this paper proposes an ensemble manifold regularized sparse low-rank approximation (EMRSLRA) algorithm for multiview feature embedding. The EMR-SLRA algorithm is based on the framework of least-squares component analysis, in particular, the low dimensional feature representation and the projection matrix are obtained by the low-rank approximation of the concatenated multiview feature matrix. By considering the complementary property among multiple features, EMR-SLRA simultaneously enforces the ensemble manifold regularization on the output feature embedding. In order to further enhance its robustness against the noise, the group sparsity is introduced into the objective formulation to impose direct noise reduction on the input multiview feature matrix. Since there is no closed-form solution for EMR-SLRA, this paper provides an efficient EMR-SLRA optimization procedure to obtain the output feature embedding. Experiments on the pattern recognition applications confirm the effectiveness of the EMR-SLRA algorithm compare with some other multiview feature dimensionality reduction approaches.
