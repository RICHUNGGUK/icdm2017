Here, the authors harness observations and complaints from human sensors, collected through Twitter, to demonstrate how social sensing has the ability to detect breakdowns in a public transport network in real time, beyond official surveillance information. The system collects, filters, and processes the large datasets obtained to detect the daily problems in a public transport railway network of a major city and disseminate the results for user consumption through graphical rendering.", "paper_title": "Microbloggers as Sensors for Public Transport Breakdowns", "paper_id": "WOS:000364339800004"}
