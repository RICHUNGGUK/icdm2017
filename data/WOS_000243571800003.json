Contrary to the classical case such a metric is not unique. We complete the characterization, initiated by Morozova, Chentsov and Petz, of these metrics by providing a closed and tractable formula for the set of Morozova-Chentsov functions. In addition, we provide a continuously increasing bridge between the smallest and largest symmetric monotone metrics.", "paper_title": "Characterizations of symmetric monotone metrics on the state space of quantum systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243571800003"}
