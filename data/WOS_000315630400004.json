More explicitly, one realization of non-cryptographic oblivious transfer allows for the perfect simulation of sending one qubit and measuring it in an orthogonal basis. On the other hand, a qubit channel allows for realizing non-cryptographic oblivious transfer with probability roughly 85 %, whereas 75 % is the classical limit.", "paper_title": "Oblivious transfer and quantum channels as communication resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000315630400004"}
