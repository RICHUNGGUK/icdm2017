To effectively determine the flow performance measures and consequently the congestion indicators of segmented road pieces, the ability to process such data in real time is out of the question. In this article, a dynamic approach to specify flow pattern variations is proposed mainly concentrating on the incorporation of neural network theory to provide real-time mapping for traffic density simultaneously in conjunction with a macroscopic traffic flow model. To deal with the noise and the wide scatter of raw flow measures, a filtering is applied prior to modeling processes. Filtered data are dynamically and simultaneously input to processes of neural density mapping and traffic flow modeling. The classification of flow patterns over the fundamental diagram, which is dynamically plotted with the outputs of the flow modeling subprocess, is obtained by considering the density measure as a pattern indicator. Densities are mapped by selected neural approximation method for each simulation time step considering explicitly the flow conservation principle. Simultaneously, mapped densities are matched over the fundamental diagram to specify the current corresponding flow pattern. The approach is promising in capturing sudden changes on flow patterns and is open to be utilized within a series of intelligent management strategies including especially nonrecurrent congestion effect detection and control.", "paper_title": "An Approach to Dynamic Classification of Traffic Flow Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000315859700003"}
