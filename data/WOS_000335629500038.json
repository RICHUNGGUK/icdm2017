However, its high computational load in the test phase makes it difficult to use in practice. In this paper, we propose hybrid neural network (HNN), a method to accelerate an SVM in the test phase by approximating the SVM. The proposed method approximates the SVM using an artificial neural network (ANN). The resulting regression function of the ANN replaces the decision function or the regression function of the SVM. Since the prediction of the ANN requires significantly less computation than that of the SVM, the proposed method yields faster test speed. The proposed method is evaluated by experiments on real-world benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully accelerates SVM in the test phase with little or no prediction loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
