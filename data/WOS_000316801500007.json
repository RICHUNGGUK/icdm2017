This new computational model aims to facilitate the mapping of solid models with complicated geometry or heterogeneous inner structures. In order to solve cross-shape mapping between such models through divide and conquer, solid models can be decomposed into subparts upon which mappings is computed individually. The biharmonic volumetric mapping can be performed in each subregion separately. Unlike the widely used harmonic mapping which only allows C-0 continuity along the segmentation boundary interfaces, this biharmonic model can provide C-1 smoothness. We demonstrate the efficacy of our mapping framework on various geometric models with complex geometry (which are decomposed into subparts with simpler and solvable geometry) or heterogeneous interior structures (whose different material layers can be segmented and processed separately).", "paper_title": "Biharmonic Volumetric Mapping Using Fundamental Solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000316801500007"}
