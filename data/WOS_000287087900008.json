The Pricing Schemes are designed to offer profitable business to the Wireless Service Providers (WSPs), as well as, to create favorable services for the mobile subscribers and eventually to get charged according to their services usage. In this paper, the Pricing Schemes are classified, based on their ability to adapt to the needs of the WSPs and their subscribers during the entire service period, into Static-based Pricing and Dynamic-based Pricing Schemes. The Pricing Schemes are also analyzed in detail and are further classified according to the factors involved in the price calculation of a service, i.e. the Service Level Agreement (SLA), the subscription type, the negotiation capabilities between WSPs and their subscribers, the network capacity, the available bandwidth and frequency spectrum, the network hops, and the Base Stations (BSs). The affected elements by the pricing network are also discussed, together with the performance evaluation of the presented pricing schemes.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Pricing Schemes in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287087900008"}
