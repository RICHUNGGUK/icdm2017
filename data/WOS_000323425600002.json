The existence of constant-round zero-knowledge proofs was proven by Goldreich and Kahan (Journal of Cryptology, 1996), and the existence of constant-round zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge was proven by Feige and Shamir (CRYPTO, 1989). However, the existence of constant-round zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge for all is folklore, to the best of our knowledge, since no proof of this fact has been published.", "paper_title": "A Note on Constant-Round Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000323425600002"}
