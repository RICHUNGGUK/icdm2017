One of the main problems in this context is to design aggregation operators that take into account the individual opinions of the decision makers. One of the most important operators used for synthesizing the individual opinions in a representative value of majority in the OWA operator, where the majority concept used aggregation processes, is modeled using fuzzy logic and linguistic quantifiers. In this work the semantic of majority used in OWA operators is analyzed, and it is shown how its application in group decision-making problems does not produce representative results of the concept expressed by the quantifier. To solve this type of problem, two aggregation operators, QMA-OWA, are proposed that use two quantification strategies and a quantified normalization process to model the semantic of the linguistic quantifiers in the group decision-making process.
