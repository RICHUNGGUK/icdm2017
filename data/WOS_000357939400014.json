We give nonasymptotic bounds on the minimum average length in terms of Erokhin's rate-distortion function and we use those bounds to obtain a Gaussian approximation on the speed of approach to the limit, which is quite accurate for all but small blocklengths: (1 - epsilon) kH(S) - ((kV(S)/2 pi))(1/2) exp[-((Q(-1) (epsilon))(2)/2)], where Q(-1) (.) is the functional inverse of the standard Gaussian complementary cumulative distribution function, and V(S) is the source dispersion. A nonzero error probability thus not only reduces the asymptotically achievable rate by a factor of 1 - epsilon, but this asymptotic limit is approached from below, i.e., larger source dispersions and shorter blocklengths are beneficial. Variable-length lossy compression under an excess distortion constraint is shown to exhibit similar properties.", "paper_title": "Variable-Length Compression Allowing Errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000357939400014"}
