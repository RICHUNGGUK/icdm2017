First, we compute in closed form the expectation for the angle theta between the new and the old normal when uniform noise is added to a single vertex of a triangle. Next, we propose and experimentally validate an approximation and lower and upper bounds for theta when uniform noise is added to all three vertices of the triangle. In all cases, for small amounts of spatial noise that do not severely distort the mesh, there is a linear correlation between theta and simple functions of the heights of the triangles and thus, theta can be computed efficiently. The addition of uniform spatial noise to a mesh can be seen as a dithered quantization of its vertices. We use the obtained linear correlations between spatial and normal noise to compute the level of dithered quantization of the mesh vertices when a tolerance for the average normal distortion is given.", "paper_title": "Linear Correlations between Spatial and Normal Noise in Triangle Meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000311124600005"}
