Multi-objective scheduling of scientific applications in these systems is therefore receiving increasing research attention. Most existing approaches typically aggregate all objectives in a single function, defined a-priori without any knowledge about the problem being solved, which negatively impacts the quality of the solutions. In contrast, Pareto-based approaches having as outcome a set of (nearly) optimal solutions that represent a tradeoff among the different objectives, have been scarcely studied. In this paper, we analyse MOHEFT, a Pareto-based list scheduling heuristic that provides the user with a set of tradeoff optimal solutions from which the one that better suits the user requirements can be manually selected. We demonstrate the potential of our method for multi-objective workflow scheduling on the commercial Amazon EC2 Cloud. We compare the quality of the MOHEFT tradeoff solutions with two state-of-the-art approaches using different synthetic and real-world workflows: the classical HEFT algorithm for single-objective scheduling and the SPEA2* genetic algorithm used in multi-objective optimisation problems. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to compute solutions of higher quality than SPEA2*. In addition, we show that MOHEFT is more suitable than SPEA2* for workflow scheduling in the context of commercial Clouds, since the genetic-based approach is unable of dealing with some of the constraints imposed by these systems.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective workflow scheduling in Amazon EC2", "paper_id": "WOS:000336424400003"}
