A VLC system uses many LED chips, and its performance is greatly affected by the direction of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Normally, the LEDs are directed vertically downward to the floor. In this paper, we introduce an LED layout scheme in which the LEDs tilt toward the room corners. The effects of changing LED direction on system performance, including illuminance, received power, and SNR, are analyzed. The analysis is then verified by the simulations.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the effects of LED direction on the performance of visible light communication system", "paper_id": "WOS:000313162500006"}
