By using short-time energy (STE) as a weighting function, this algorithm was originally proposed as an improved linear predictive (LP) method based oil emphasising those samples that fit the underlying speech production model well. The original formulation of WLP, however, did not guarantee stability of all-pole models. Therefore, the current work revisits the concept of WLP by introducing a modified short-time energy function leading always to stable all-pole models. This new method, stabilised weighted linear prediction (SWLP), is shown to yield all-pole models whose general performance can be adjusted by properly choosing the length of the STE window, a parameter denoted by M. The study compares the performances of SWLP, minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), and conventional LP in spectral modelling of speech corrupted by additive noise. The comparisons were performed by computing, for each method, the logarithmic spectral differences between the all-pole spectra extracted from clean and noisy speech in different segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) categories. The results showed that the proposed SWLP algorithm was the most robust method against zero-mean Gaussian noise and the robustness was largest for SWLP with a small M-value. These findings were corroborated by a small listening test in which the majority of the listeners assessed the quality of impulse-train-excited SWLP filters, extracted from noisy speech, to be perceptually closer to original clean speech than the corresponding all-pole responses computed by MVDR. Finally, SWLP was compared to other short-time spectral estimation methods (FFT, LP, MVDR) in isolated word recognition experiments. Recognition accuracy obtained by SWLP, in comparison to other short-time spectral estimation methods, improved already at moderate segmental SNR values for sounds corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian noise. For realistic factory noise of low pass characteristics, the SWLP method improved file recognition results at segmental SNR levels below 0 dB.
