Scheifele's algorithm is one of the excellent integrators developed in the past years to take advantage of special transformations of variables such as the K-S set. It is based on using expansions in series of the so-called G-functions, and generalizes the Taylor series integrators but with the remarkable property of integrating without truncation error oscillations in one basic known frequency. A generalization of Scheifele's method capable of integrating exactly harmonic oscillations in two known frequencies is developed here, after introducing a two parametric family of analytical.-functions. Moreover, the local error contains the perturbation parameter as a factor when the algorithm is applied to perturbed problems. The good behavior and the long-term accuracy of the new method are shown through several examples, including systems with low-and high-frequency constituents and a perturbed satellite orbit. The new methods provide significantly higher accuracy and efficiency than a selection of well-reputed general-purpose integrators and even recent symplectic or symmetric integrators, whose good behavior in the long-term integration of the Kepler problem and the other oscillatory systems is well stated in recent literature.", "paper_title": "Accurate Numerical Integration of Perturbed Oscillatory Systems in Two Frequencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000271214000004"}
