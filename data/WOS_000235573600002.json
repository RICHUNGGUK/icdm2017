During the last four decades a vast quantity of literature on the subject has appeared. Developments in the theory of computational complexity allow us to establish the theoretical complexity of a variety of stochastic programming problems studied in this literature. Under the assumption that the stochastic parameters are independently distributed, we show that two-stage stochastic programming problems are #P-hard. Under the same assumption we show that certain multi-stage stochastic programming problems are PSPACE-hard. The problems we consider are non-standard in that distributions of stochastic parameters in later stages depend on decisions made in earlier stages.", "paper_title": "Computational complexity of stochastic programming problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235573600002"}
