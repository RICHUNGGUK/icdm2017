This algorithm is based on a peak-picking filter derived from supervised learning through independent experiments. This filter is a function of the oscillation frequency, computed even from noisy, apparent displacement records. The algorithm minimizes the noise of high-frequency GPS and RTS recordings and calculates the mean amplitude of the oscillations with millimeter accuracy. The application of this method to the Structural Health Monitoring is demonstrated in the case of measurement of displacements of two short-span bridges. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
