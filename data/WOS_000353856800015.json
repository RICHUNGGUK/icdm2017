The network is assumed to employ Decode and Forward (DF) relaying. Assuming the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI) of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers, we consider a scheduling and power allocation (PA) problem for a multiple-source multiple-sink scenario so that eavesdroppers are jammed, and source-destination throughput targets are met while minimizing the overall transmitted power. We propose activation sets (AS-es) for scheduling, and formulate an optimization problem for PA. Several methods for finding AS-es are discussed and compared. We present an approximate linear program for the original nonlinear, non-convex PA optimization problem, and argue that under certain conditions, both the formulations produce identical results. In the absence of eavesdroppers' CSI, we utilize the notion of Vulnerability Region (VR), and formulate an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the VR. Our results show that the proposed solution can achieve power-efficient operation while defeating eavesdroppers and achieving desired source-destination throughputs simultaneously.
