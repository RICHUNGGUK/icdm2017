In order to obtain the correct results, the high data quality is required. In this paper, we analyze the quality problems of enterprise data warehouse and present an object-oriented framework for data quality management. In this framework, an object-oriented data quality model (OODQM) is built. The data quality requirements, the participators, the data quality checking object, and the possible data quality problems, form the core components of OODQM. The method we provide is a goal-driven method. Once the data quality goal is built, we manage data quality by the interaction of those components of OODQM.", "paper_title": "An object-oriented framework for data quality management of enterprise data warehouse", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500146"}
