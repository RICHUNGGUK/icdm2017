The study is motivated by attempts to develop effective techniques for the elimination of pathological brain rhythms in networks involving many distinct brain regions, such as epileptic systems. We find that complete desynchronization is obtained by individual control of all subgroups. Local control of one particular subgroup desynchronizes only the stimulated one. It does not have any significant impact on the collective behavior of other subgroups, which in turn does not affect the desynchronization effects of the controlled group. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
