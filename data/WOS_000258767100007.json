In the system, each sequence of movements is converted into a posture sequence. To better characterize a posture in a sequence, we triangulate it into triangular meshes, from which we extract two features: the skeleton feature and the centroid context feature. The first feature is used as a coarse representation of the subject, while the second is used to derive a finer description We adopt a depth-first search (dfs) scheme to extract the skeletal features of a posture from the triangulation result. The proposed skeleton feature extraction scheme is more robust and efficient than conventional silhouette-based approaches. The skeletal features extracted in the first stage are used to extract the centroid context feature, which is a finer representation that can characterize the shape of a whole body or body parts. The two descriptors working together make human movement analysis a very efficient and accurate process because they generate a set of key postures from a movement sequence. The ordered key posture sequence is represented by a symbol string. Matching two arbitrary action sequences then becomes a symbol string matching problem. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method is a robust, accurate, and powerful tool for human movement analysis.", "paper_title": "Video-based human movement analysis and its application to surveillance systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258767100007"}
