However, with the increasing need for bandwidth and types of service from users, FiWi networks are still relatively incapable and ossified. To alleviate bandwidth tension and facilitate new service deployment, we attempt to apply network virtualization in FiWi networks, in which the network's control plane and data plane are separated from each other. Based on a previously proposed hierarchical model and service model for FiWi network virtualization, the process of service implementation is described. The performances of the FiWi access networks applying network virtualization are analyzed in detail, including bandwidth for links, throughput for nodes, and multipath flow transmission. Simulation results show that the FiWi network with virtualization is superior to that without.", "paper_title": "Performance improvement for applying network virtualization in fiber-wireless (FiWi) access networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344865200008"}
