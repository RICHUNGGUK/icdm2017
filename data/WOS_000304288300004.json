Formularies list drugs that have been clinically proved to be safe and effective and have been approved for certain uses by a regulatory authority, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, once a drug is approved, physicians may also prescribe it for unapproved or \"off-label\" indications. In addition, although third-party payers may specify some of labelled uses for reimbursement, prescriptions may leak to unspecified but labelled indications. Once a drug is listed on a formulary, the payer faces unlimited liability for that drug. Drug manufacturers thus try to get their drugs listed on a formulary and promote sales for both labelled and off-label uses. Some third-party payers use price-volume agreements to control unspecified drug uses. This paper investigates how a manufacturer would make marketing decisions under a price-volume agreement. We develop an optimization model in which the manufacturer maximizes its expected profit by choosing marketing efforts to promote different uses. We also compare models when off-label uses are reimbursed and when they are completely avoided to illustrate the impact of off-label promotion on the optimal decisions, on the decision makers' performance and on the cost-effectiveness of drug uses. We are not aware of any paper that theoretically investigates off-label promotions. This paper drives a number of interesting managerial insights on how to control off-label uses by applying operations research methods to address a health care policy issue.", "paper_title": "Promotion and Leakage under a Pharmaceutical Price-Volume Agreement", "paper_id": "WOS:000304288300004"}
