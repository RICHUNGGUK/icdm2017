Furthermore, an explicit construction of the corresponding feedback laws is given. The feedback laws constructed also result in a closed-loop system that is globally asymptotically stable. The results presented here are parallel to our earlier results on the continuous-time delay case, and show that, for the first issue, such stabilization is possible if and only if the system is stabilizable and the transition matrix has spectral radius inside or on the unit circle. For the finite-gain l(p)-stabilization issue, we assume that the system is neutrally stable. We provide upper bounds for the corresponding l(p)-gain which is delay-independent.", "paper_title": "On the stabilization of linear discrete-time delay systems subject to input saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241666400015"}
