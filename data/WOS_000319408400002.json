Based on the OFA, an algorithm requiring only algebraic computation is used to solve dynamic equations for TS-fuzzy-model based feedback and is then integrated with HTGA to design quadratic finite-horizon optimal controllers for TS-DSPS under the criterion of minimizing a quadratic finite-horizon integral performance index, which is also converted to algebraic form by the OFA. Integration of OFA and HTGA in the proposed approach enables use of simple algebraic computation and is well adapted to the computer implementation. Therefore, it facilitates design tasks of quadratic finite-horizon optimal controllers for the TS-DSPS. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated in the example of a moored tanker designed using quadratic finite-horizon optimal controllers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
