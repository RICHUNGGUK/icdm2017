This holds even in case that f is bounded by a polynomial of degree three (six) with respect to n. On the other hand, there is a linear (quadratic) bound on f which guarantees that the problem is decidable in polynomial time. Similar results are obtained for paths as well as for paths between prescribed endvertices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
