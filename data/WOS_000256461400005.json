Previously established results on the parametric calculus, such as confluence and standardization, are primarily syntactical. In this paper our attention is mainly addressed to semantics, although we start again from a syntactical point of view. We propose an analysis of the notion of contextual preorders of usual operational semantics. Given a contextual preorder, we build a parametric complete lattice based on a closure operator. This lattice provides a fully abstract model for the considered preorder, via a completion. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
