Firstly, -quasi-lock semantic resolution method in lattice-valued propositional logic LP(X) is established by combining the lock and semantic resolution simultaneously, and its theorems of soundness and conditional completeness are proved. Secondly, this -quasi-lock semantic resolution method is extended into the corresponding lattice-valued first-order logic LF(X), and its soundness and conditional completeness are also established. This extended resolution method will provide a theoretical basis for automated soft theorem proving and program verification based on lattice-valued logic.", "paper_title": "alpha-Quasi-Lock Semantic Resolution Method Based on Lattice-Valued Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000336216400002"}
