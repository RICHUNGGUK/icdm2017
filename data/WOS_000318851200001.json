The well-known Golay aperiodic complementary sequence pair (Golay pair) is a special case of even periodic (odd periodic) complementary sequence pair. In this paper, we presented several classes of even periodic and odd periodic complementary pairs based on the generalized Boolean functions, but which do not form Gloay pairs. The proposed sequences could be used to design signal sets, which have been applied in direct sequence code division multiple (DS-CDMA) cellular communication systems.", "paper_title": "EVEN PERIODIC AND ODD PERIODIC COMPLEMENTARY SEQUENCE PAIRS FROM GENERALIZED BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318851200001"}
