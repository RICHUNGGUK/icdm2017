Furthermore, the paper aims to articulate the concurrence between the external pressures of CG and internal control logic of ERP systems. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a review of the normative literature pertaining to the increase in significance of CG in the light of the worldwide economic crisis. The paper highlights a literature gap related to the lack of studies focusing on the impact of ERP systems implementation on the IAF practices. Findings - The authors articulate institutional theory to formulate a conceptual framework that explains the reciprocal interplay between the macro external governance pressures, micro internal institutional logics inscribed in the ERP systems and their effect on IAF practices and structure within organisations. Research limitations/implications - The paper is conceptual in nature and therefore the proposed framework will be subsequently validated using a qualitative research approach in future research. Practical implications - The conceptual framework would offer the internal auditors some strategies for enabling adaptation to the different internal and external pressures. Also the paper provides a platform for research community to investigate the influence of CG and ERP systems implementation on IAF adaptation. Originality/value - The paper provides a clearer articulation of the various constructs that affect the IAF, which has gained great attention for assuring good CG.", "paper_title": "The dilemma of internal audit function adaptation The impact of ERP and corporate governance pressures", "paper_id": "WOS:000355689200006"}
