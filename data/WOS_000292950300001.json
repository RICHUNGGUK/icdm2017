Reconstruction methods using X-ray images have been developed recently. However, these reconstruction methods have limited ability to generate femur models with severe rotational deformities. In this study, a new X-ray-based reconstruction method was proposed using the free form deformation method with two X-ray images and three CT images. The obtained femur model is closer to a CT-based 3D femur model in comparison with the reconstruction method using only X-ray images. This method will have benefits for many clinical and biomechanical applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
