(2010) [2], we provide a proof-theoretical setting for the study of context-sensitive interactions by means of a non-monotonic conjunction operator. The resulting system is a non-associative variant of MLLpol (the multiplicative polarised fragment of Linear Logic) in which the monotonicity of interactions, depending on the context, is governed by specific devices called control sets. Following the spirit of Linear Logic, the ordinary sequent calculus presentation is also framed into a theory of proof-nets and the set of sequential proofs is shown to be sound and complete with respect to the class of corresponding proof-nets. Some possible biochemical applications are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A logic of non-monotonic interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000315313100003"}
