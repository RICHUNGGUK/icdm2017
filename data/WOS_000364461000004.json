Methods: We pre-process RF time series features extracted from 14 patients using hierarchical clustering to remove possible outliers. Then, we demonstrate that the mean central frequency and wavelet features extracted from a group of patients can be used to build a nonlinear classifier which can be applied successfully to differentiate between cancerous and normal tissue regions of an unseen patient. Results: In a cross-validation strategy, we show an average area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 and classification accuracy of 80%. To validate our results, we present a detailed ultrasound to histology registration framework. Conclusion: Ultrasound RF time series results in differentiation of cancerous and normal tissue with high AUC.", "paper_title": "Computer-Aided Prostate Cancer Detection Using Ultrasound RF Time Series: In Vivo Feasibility Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000364461000004"}
