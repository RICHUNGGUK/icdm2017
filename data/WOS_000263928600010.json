This bound is a consequence of the stability condition, and is here referred to as stability bound. In this paper, a stability bound over the BEC is developed for doubly-generalized LDPC codes, where variable and check nodes can be generic linear block codes, assuming maximum a posteriori erasure correction at each node. It is proved that also in this generalized context the bound depends only on the variable and check component codes with minimum distance 2. A condition is also developed, namely, the derivative matching condition, under which the bound is achieved with equality. The stability bound leads to consider single, parity-check codes used as variable nodes as an appealing option to overcome common problems created by generalized check nodes.", "paper_title": "Doubly-Generalized LDPC Codes: Stability Bound Over the BEC", "paper_id": "WOS:000263928600010"}
