Preference relations based on intuitionistic multiplicative information, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 2013, 21(1): 113-133), in this paper, a new preference relation called the interval-valued multiplicative intuitionistic preference relation is developed. It is analyzed the basic operations for interval-valued multiplicative intuitionistic preference information and its aggregation techniques. An interval-valued multiplicative intuitionistic group decision making model is presented in which experts provide their preference relation by interval-valued multiplicative intuitionistic fuzzy expressions, and give a real case about talent introduction in Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics to illustrate our methods.", "paper_title": "Interval-Valued Multiplicative Intuitionistic Fuzzy Preference Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000330156000005"}
