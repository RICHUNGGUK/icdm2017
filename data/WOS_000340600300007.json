In this paper, we tried to overcome this difficulty by proposing a new method for the implementation of the fuzzy rule-based inference systems. To achieve this goal, we have designed a multi-layer neuro-fuzzy computing system based on the memristor crossbar structure by introducing a new concept called the fuzzy minterm. Although many applications can be realized through the use of our proposed system, in this study we only show how the fuzzy XOR function can be constructed and how it can be used to extract edges from grayscale images. One main advantage of our memristive fuzzy edge detector (implemented in analog form) compared to other commonly used edge detectors is it can be implemented in parallel form, which makes it a powerful device for real-time applications.", "paper_title": "Memristive fuzzy edge detector", "paper_id": "WOS:000340600300007"}
