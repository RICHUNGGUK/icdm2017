A quantitative analysis of security degrees corresponding to different unitary operations is also provided, when the secret sharing schemes without entanglement are stricken by substitute-Bell-state attack. As a result, the relation between the selection of unitary operations and the effect of substitute-Bell-state attack is shown, which can serve as an important guidance for the selection of unitary operations in designing and implementing quantum secret sharing schemes.", "paper_title": "Selection of unitary operations in quantum secret sharing without entanglement", "paper_id": "WOS:000293465200006"}
