Similar to the case of mobile ad hoc networks, the routing task in VANETs comes under various constraints that can be environmental, operational, or performance based. The proposed Polymorphic Unicast Routing Protocol (PURP) uses the concept of polymorphic routing as a means to describe dynamic, multi-behavioral, multi-stimuli, adaptive, and hybrid routing, that is applicable in various contexts, which empowers the protocol with great flexibility in coping with the timely requirements of the routing tasks. Polymorphic routing protocols, in general, are equipped with multi-operational modes (e.g., grades of proactive, reactive, and semi-proactive), and they are expected to tune in to the right mode of operation depending on the current conditions (e.g., battery residue, vicinity density, traffic intensity, mobility level of the mobile node, and other user-defined conditions). The objective is commonly maximizing and/or improving certain metrics such as maximizing battery life, reducing communication delays, improving deliverability, and so on. We give a detailed description and analysis of the PURP protocol. Through comparative simulations, we show its superiority in performance to its peers and demonstrate its suitability for routing in VANETs.
