As a result of this procedure, processing images with regular structuring elements in the transformed domain is equivalent to working with deformed structuring elements in the original representation. More specifically, the conversion into polar-logarithmic coordinates provides satisfying results in image analysis applied to round objects, if they are roughly origin-centered. We have illustrated the interest of the derived cyclic morphology with two pattern recognition examples: erythrocyte shape analysis and multiscale description of iris textures.", "paper_title": "Cyclic Mathematical Morphology in Polar-Logarithmic Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000265091700016"}
