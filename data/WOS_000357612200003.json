However, the decomposition approach raises the problems of unreliable and unbalanced training of individual classifiers. The aim of this work is to alleviate these problems. In this paper, a novel multi-class classification algorithm based on one-class SVM is presented. The distinguishing point of our proposed algorithm is that the algorithm solves a one-class classification problem rather than decomposing the problem into several smaller subproblems. The proposed algorithm solves a multi-class classification problem by expanding the training input vector with the class label and constructing a one-class SVM with the expanded input vectors. In the test phase, test input vectors are assessed by fit to the decision boundary under the assumption of belonging to a class. We conducted experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms other SVM-based multi-class classification algorithms.", "paper_title": "A novel multi-class classification algorithm based on one-class support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000357612200003"}
