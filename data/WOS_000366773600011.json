Further, in order to show how the algorithms work, two specific magic squares are constructed. Moreover, the correctness of the algorithms is proved, and the complexity analysis of the algorithms is given. Finally, the improved even order magic square construction algorithms are applied in secure communication and authentication areas for multi-user shared electronic account in detail.
