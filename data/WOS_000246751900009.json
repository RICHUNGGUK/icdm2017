Consequently, product model data insufficiency and incompatibility between varieties of application systems are still the major barriers to system integration, especially the integration of design and process planning. This paper proposes a practical solution for a bi-directional integration of CAD and CAPP on the platform of commercial CAD systems. The key techniques Such as feature recognition and conversion, feature parameter and constraint extraction, feature tree reconstruction, technical information processing, process planning, automatic process drawing marking and 3D material stock CAD model generating are discussed. And the extracted features and their related technical information and knowledge are encapsulated together with the geometry-oriented CAD model to form an integrated product information model to facilitate effective integration with the downstream activities. The integrated CAD/CAPP system is implemented on a commercial CAD package, UGS/SolidEdge. A case study and industry implementation illustrate the feasibility of the approach proposed.
