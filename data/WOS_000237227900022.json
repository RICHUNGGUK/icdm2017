In this paper two improved approaches to measure population diversity are proposed and validated using two traditional test problems in genetic programming literature. Code growth gave rise to improve pseudo-isomorph measures by eliminating non-functional code using an expression simplifier. Also, Rosca's entropy to measure behavioral diversity is updated to cope with problems producing a more continuous fitness value. Results show a relevant improvement with regard to the original diversity measures.", "paper_title": "Characterizing diversity in genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000237227900022"}
