To ease the analysis of the large amounts of data generated by this approach, we have developed ChIP-on-chip Analysis Suite (CoCAS), a standalone software suite which implements optimized ChIP-on-chip data normalization, improved peak detection, as well as quality control reports. Our software allows dye swap, replicate correlation and connects easily with genome browsers and other peak detection algorithms. CoCAS can readily be used on the latest generation of Agilent high-density arrays. Also, the implemented peak detection methods are suitable for other datasets, including ChIP-Seq output.", "paper_title": "CoCAS: a ChIP-on-chip analysis suite", "paper_id": "WOS:000264651800017"}
