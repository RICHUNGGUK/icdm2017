In recent years the extreme growth of digital documents brought to light the need for novel approaches and more efficient techniques to improve the accuracy of IR systems to take into account real users' information needs. In this article we propose a novel metric to measure the semantic relatedness between words. Our approach is based on ontologies represented using a general knowledge base for dynamically building a semantic network. This network is based on linguistic properties and it is combined with our metric to create a measure of semantic relatedness. In this way we obtain an efficient strategy to rank digital documents from the Internet according to the user's interest domain. The proposed methods, metrics, and techniques are implemented in a system for information retrieval on the Web. Experiments are performed on a test set built using a directory service having information about analyzed documents. The obtained results compared to other similar systems show an effective improvement.", "paper_title": "An Ontology-Driven Approach for Semantic Information Retrieval on the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000268966100002"}
