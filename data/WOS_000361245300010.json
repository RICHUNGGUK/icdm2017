Several learning algorithms have been proposed to handle this kind of tasks in recent years. The rank entropy-based monotonic decision tree is very representative thanks to its better robustness and generalization. Ensemble learning is an effective strategy to significantly improve the generalization ability of machine learning systems. The objective of this work is to develop a method of fusing monotonic decision trees. In order to achieve this goal, we take two factors into account: attribute reduction and fusing principle. Through introducing variable dominance rough sets, we firstly propose an attribute reduction approach with rank-preservation for learning base classifiers, which can effectively avoid overfitting and improve classification performance. Then, we establish a fusing principe based on maximal probability through combining the base classifiers, which is used to further improve generalization ability of the learning system. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed fusing method can significantly improve classification performance of the learning system constructed by monotonic decision trees.", "paper_title": "Fusing Monotonic Decision Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000361245300010"}
