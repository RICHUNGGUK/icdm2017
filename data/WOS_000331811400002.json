The design of a multipath protocol that can cooperate with current single-path transport protocols is an interesting research field. Most previous works on multipath network utility maximization (NUM) lead to rate-based control protocols. Moreover, these studies do not model a case in which paths from a source may have different characteristics. Thus, these approaches are difficult to deploy to the Internet. In this paper, we introduce a multipath NUM model for a network with both multipath and single-path users. The proposed algorithm converges to a global solution to the multipath NUM. Based on the mathematical framework, we develop a multipath TCP called mReno. Analysis and simulations indicate that mReno is completely compatible with TCP Reno and achieves load-balance, fairness, and performance improvement targets.", "paper_title": "mReno: a practical multipath congestion control for communication networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000331811400002"}
