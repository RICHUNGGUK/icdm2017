The indicator is constructed using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which measures the economic efficiency of a decision-making process, or how efficiently a GDSS user converts decision resources into decision outcomes. To illustrate how our framework can be applied, we conduct an experiment that manipulates three contextual factors: communication mode, incentive structure, and group leadership. Within these contexts, we obtain an individual DEA decision efficiency score during the GDSS decision process, where participants are engaged in a mixed-motive task. We find that the communication mode, incentive structure, and interaction between the two significantly influence decision efficiency within this GDSS setting. However, the leadership structure does not have a significant impact on decision efficiency. The current study presents the first application of DEA in the area of GDSS. We illustrate how DEA is useful for evaluating GDSS-supported decision efficiency. The results suggest implications that guide the design of the next generation GDSS to support individuals within collaborative work groups involved in mixed-motive tasks.
