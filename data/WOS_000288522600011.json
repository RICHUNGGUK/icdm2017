In this problem, a set of \"if ... then ... \" decision rules is used as a preference model to sort objects evaluated by a set of criteria. The rules can be induced from dominance-based rough approximations of preference-ordered decision classes according to the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA). In this paper, we present an approach to generating the minimal decision rules based on Boolean reasoning techniques. The concepts of decision matrices and decision functions of the lower approximations and the boundary regions are proposed to generate the certain rules and the approximate rules, respectively. Then, the decision rules can be applied to predict sorting of new objects. An example is used for illustration of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "GENERATION AND APPLICATION OF DECISION RULES WITHIN DOMINANCE-BASED ROUGH SET APPROACH TO MULTICRITERIA SORTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600011"}
