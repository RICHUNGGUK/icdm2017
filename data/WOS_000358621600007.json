The proposed method can enhance target signal and suppress background clutter simultaneously. In the first stage, a enhanced image is obtained using the proposed Weighted Laplacian of Gaussian. In the second stage, an adaptive threshold is adopted to segment the target. Experimental results on two challenging image sequences show that the proposed method can detect the bright and dark targets simultaneously, and is not sensitive to sea-sky line of the infrared (IR) image. So it is fit for small IR target detection.", "paper_title": "Biologically inspired small infrared target detection using local contrast mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000358621600007"}
