The analytical approach was developed based on the potential theory to calculate fluid velocity field, and the dynamics of the liquid sloshing coupled to the moving body are described as a mechanical system with two degrees of freedom. The coupling between the fluid and the moving body is given by a damping force calculated based on the body geometry and the fluid velocity field. The proposed numerical approach is based on the Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method, which is a Lagrangian particle-based method and very effective to model nonlinear hydrodynamics due to fluid-structure interaction. In the numerical approach, the rigid body is modeled as a cluster of particles and the motions are calculated considering its mass, moment of inertia, hydrodynamic loads and springs restoring forces. The elastic link between the body and tank is modeled by applying Hooke's law. Simple cases of floating body motion were used to validate the numerical method. Finally, analytical and numerical results were compared. Despite its simplicity, the analytical approach proposed in the present work is an efficient approach to provide qualitative understanding and a first estimate of the moving body effects on the sloshing inside the tank. On the other hand, the numerical approach can provide more detailed information about the coupling phenomena, and it is an effective mean for the assessment of the reduction of the sloshing loads due to the moving body with elastic link. Finally, the effectiveness of the concept as a sloshing suppressing device is also investigated. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
