We say that an applicant x is an element of A prefers an item p than an item q if p is located at a higher position than q in its preference list, and we say that x prefers a matching M over a matching M' if x prefers M(x) than M'(x). For a given matching problem A, I, and preference lists, we say that M is more popular than M' if the number of applicants preferring M over M' is larger than that of applicants preferring M' over M, and M is called a popular matching if there is no other matching that is more popular than M. Here we consider the situation that A is partitioned into A(1), A(2) ,..., A(k), and that each A(i) is assigned a weight w(i) > 0 such that w(1) > w(2) > ... > w(k) > 0. For such a matching problem, we say that M is more popular than M' if the total weight of applicants preferring M over M' is larger than that of applicants preferring M' over M, and we call M an k-weighted popular matching if there is no other matching that is more popular than M. Mahdian (In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, 2006) showed that if m > 1.42n, then a random instance of the (nonweighted) matching problem has a popular matching with high probability. In this article, we analyze the two-weighted matching problem, and we show that (lower bound) if m/n(4/3) = o(1), then a random instance of the two-weighted matching problem with w(1) >= 2w(2) has a two-weighted popular matching with probability o(1); and (upper bound) if n(4/3)/m = o(1), then a random instance of the two-weighted matching problem with w(1) >= 2w(2) has a two-weighted popular matching with probability 1-o(1).
