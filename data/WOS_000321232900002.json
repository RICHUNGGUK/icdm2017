In this paper, a method is proposed to recognize objects in shape spaces in which landmarks have three kinds of information, i.e., landmarks position, angle and feature vector. By comparing angle and feature vector, a landmark in an image can correspond with a few number of landmarks in another image. Then, the pixel's positions of landmarks from two images are used to calculate the Procrustean distance in a shape space. If the value of the Procrustean distance is smaller than a predefined threshold, the two sets of landmarks will be considered to match each other. Applying the proposed method, two-dimensional objects including occluded objects can be recognized quickly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
