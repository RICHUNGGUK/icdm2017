Therefore, the structures have to be reconditioned from time to time. However, the existing methods are very complex and resource-consuming when doing this task. In this paper, we present an approach to recondition the class structures of object-oriented (OO) software systems. It uses attribute-method networks and method-method networks to represent attributes, methods and dependencies between them; It proposes a guided community detection algorithm to obtain the optimized community structures in the method-method networks, which also correspond to the optimized class structures; It also provides a list of refactorings by comparing the optimized class structures with the real class structure in software systems and inspecting the attribute-method networks. The approach is evaluated using the open-source case study, JHotDraw 5.1, and the advantages of our approach are illustrated in comparison with existing methods.", "paper_title": "Class structure refactoring of object-oriented softwares using community detection in dependency networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971100014"}
