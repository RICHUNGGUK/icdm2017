The von Neumann algorithm is very attractive due to its simplicity, but is not practical for solving most linear programs to optimality due to its slow convergence. Our algorithms were developed with the objective of improving the practical convergence of the von Neumann algorithm while maintaining its attractive features. We present results from computational experiments on a set of linear programming problems that show significant improvements over the von Neumann algorithm.", "paper_title": "A family of linear programming algorithms based on an algorithm by von Neumann", "paper_id": "WOS:000265975500009"}
