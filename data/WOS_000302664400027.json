Image processing and image communication in wireless sensor network reduce the life time of network due to the heavy processing and communication. Face recognition system enhances the security and functionality using wireless sensor network and gains flexibility while integrated into wireless sensor network. This paper presents a collaborative face recognition system in wireless sensor network. The layered linear discriminant analysis is re-engineered to implement on wireless sensor network by efficiently allocating the network resources. Distributed face recognition not only helps to reduce the communication overload but it also increases the node life time by distributing the work load on the nods. The simulation shows that the proposed technique provides significant gain in network life time.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTED FACE RECOGNITION IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664400027"}
