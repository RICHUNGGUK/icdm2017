Our algorithm runs in O(nd) time and is used for the study of repetition-freeness of partial words. Furthermore, we construct an infinite word over a five-letter alphabet that is overlap-free even after holes are inserted in arbitrary 2-valid positions, answering affirmatively a conjecture from Blanchet-Sadri, Mercas, and Scott.
