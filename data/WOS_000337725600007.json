In contrast to previous work where a cognitive user vacates a channel only when that channel becomes busy, the proposed scheme requires the cognitive user to switch to the channel with the next highest idle probability if the current channel's gain is below a certain threshold. We derive the threshold values that maximize the long term throughput for various primary user transition probabilities and cognitive user's relative movement.", "paper_title": "An Opportunistic Channel Access Scheme for Interweave Cognitive Radio Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337725600007"}
