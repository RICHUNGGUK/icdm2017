It is stunning that so many predictions in Turing's 1950 Mind paper were right. In the decades since that paper appeared, with its inspiring challenges, research in computer science, neuroscience, and the behavioral sciences has radically changed thinking about mental processes and communication, and the ways in which people use computers has evolved even more dramatically. Turing, were he writing now, might still replace \"Can machines think?\" with an operational challenge, but it is likely he would propose a very different test. This paper considers what that might be in light of Turing's paper and advances in the decades since it was written.", "paper_title": "What Question Would Turing Pose Today?", "paper_id": "WOS:000313134000008"}
