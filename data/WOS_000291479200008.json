In many practical scenarios, fine-grained access control is a pivotal security requirement to enhance usability and protect sensitive sensor information from unauthorized access. Recently, there have been proposed many schemes to adapt public key cryptosystems into sensor systems consisting of high-end sensor nodes in order to enforce security policy efficiently. However, the drawback of these approaches is that the complexity of computation increases linear to the expressiveness of the access policy. Key-policy attribute-based encryption is a promising cryptographic solution to enforce fine-grained access policies on the sensor data. However, the problem of applying it to distributed sensor networks introduces several challenges with regard to the attribute and user revocation. In this paper, we propose an access control scheme using KP-ABE with efficient attribute and user revocation capability for distributed sensor networks that are composed of high-end sensor devices. They can be achieved by the proxy encryption mechanism which takes advantage of attribute-based encryption and selective group key distribution. The analysis results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves efficient user access control while requiring the same computation overhead at each sensor as the previous schemes.", "paper_title": "Fine-grained data access control for distributed sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291479200008"}
