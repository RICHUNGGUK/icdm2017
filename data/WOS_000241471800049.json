In this paper, a framework for specifying unambiguous, interoperable security requirements and detecting conflict and undesirable emergent properties in collaborative systems is presented. The framework includes a core ontology representing hierarchical security requirements, an ontology-based security requirement specification process, a set of security requirement refining rules, an algorithm for automatic security requirement refinement and an analysis algorithm to detect inconsistent security requirements. In this paper, the specification and refinement of security requirements are emphasized.", "paper_title": "A framework for specifying and managing security requirements in collaborative systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800049"}
