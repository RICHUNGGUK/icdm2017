Quantum maximal distance separable (MDS) codes are optimal in the sense they attain maximal minimum distance. Recently, constructing quantum MDS codes has received much attention and seems to become more and more difficult. In this paper, based on classical constacyclic codes, we construct some new quantum MDS codes by employing the Hermitian construction. Compared with the known quantum MDS codes, these quantum MDS codes have much larger minimum distance.", "paper_title": "Constacyclic Codes and Some New Quantum MDS Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000333099400008"}
