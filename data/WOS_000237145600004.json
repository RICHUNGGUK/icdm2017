This problem is NP-hard in general, and, therefore, it is natural to study how restricting the allowed types of constraints affects the approximability of the problem. It is known that every Boolean (that is, two-valued) Max CSP with a finite set of allowed constraint types is either solvable exactly in polynomial time or else APX-complete ( and hence can have no polynomial-time approximation scheme unless P = NP). It has been an open problem for several years whether this result can be extended to non-Boolean Max CSP, which is much more difficult to analyze than the Boolean case. In this paper, we make the first step in this direction by establishing this result for Max CSP over a three-element domain. Moreover, we present a simple description of all polynomial-time solvable cases of our problem. This description uses the well-known algebraic combinatorial property of supermodularity. We also show that every hard three-valued Max CSP contains, in a certain specified sense, one of the two basic hard Max CSPs which are the Maximum k-colorable Subgraph problems for k = 2, 3.", "paper_title": "The approximability of three-valued MAX CSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000237145600004"}
