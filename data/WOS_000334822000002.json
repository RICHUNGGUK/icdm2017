Although memory oversubscription improves overall memory efficiency, existing schemes lack isolation support, which is crucial for clouds to provide pay-per-use services on multi-tenant resource pools. This paper presents groupbased memory oversubscription that confines both mechanism and policy of memory oversubscription into a group of virtual machines. A group is specified as one of service level agreements so that a cloud customer can control the memory management mechanism within its own isolated domain. We introduce group-based memory deduplication and reprovisioning with several policies based on per-group workload behaviors. The proposed scheme is implemented on the KVM-based prototype and evaluated with realistic cloud workloads such as MapReduce and MPI applications. The evaluation results show that our group-based memory oversubscription ensures strict inter-group isolation while achieving intra-group memory efficiency, compared to a system-wide scheme, by adapting oversubscription policies based on per-group workload characteristics.
