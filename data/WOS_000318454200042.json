It is expected to play an important role in the near future along with its new form of Internet of Things (IoT). A PN is formed around a person's IoT. Most wireless devices in PNs are battery powered and need to keep track of available energy. Additionally, users always require certain lifetime guarantees for the nodes in PNs to ensure network functionalities which emphasizes more on the battery usage. The notion of cooperation brings in new methods for extending the network lifetime when it is introduced in PNs. In this paper, we propose a distributed mechanism called lifetime guaranteed mechanism (LGM) for cooperative PNs. In LGM, energy consumption budgets are dynamically set for personal devices in order to guarantee their lifetimes so as to satisfy user requirements. Furthermore, cooperative queues are proposed on both medium access control (MAC) layer and network layer to decrease packet drops and in turn congestion. We show that LGM can achieve less average end-to-end delay and lesser packet drop while network lifetime is guaranteed at the expense of lesser throughput. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
