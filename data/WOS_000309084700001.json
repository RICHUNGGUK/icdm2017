More precisely, based on the knowledge of actual production of the competitor and its actual rate of change, the clever firm is able to evaluate its opponent's output in the near future by virtue of straightforward extrapolative foresight. We finally arrive at a conclusion that this seemingly rational mechanism takes a positive effect on convergence to equilibrium behavior. Inconsistent with common intuition, we demonstrate that stronger foresight ability is not always better to stabilize the equilibrium. Particularly, perfect foresight dose not give rise to the best stabilizing factor. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
