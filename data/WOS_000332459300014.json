A main stumbling block for further applications, in particular concerning filter design in the Fourier domain, is the lack of a proper convolution theorem. The present paper develops and studies two conceptually new ways to define convolution products for such transforms. As a by-product, convolution theorems are obtained that will enable the development and fast implementation of new filters for quaternionic signals and systems, as well as for their higher dimensional counterparts.", "paper_title": "Convolution Products for Hypercomplex Fourier Transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000332459300014"}
