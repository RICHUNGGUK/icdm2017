We parameterized the Guided Search model [Wolfe, J.M., 1994. Guided Search 2.0: a revised model of visual search. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review 1(2), 202-238] for a task involving visual search of a target store in a map. The resulting model was then used to choose color assignments for all the elements of the display that would result in the fastest average search time for the display and search tasks. These predicted optimized color assignments were then tested empirically. The empirical data closely matched the predicted pattern of search times. We conclude that computational models of visual search are sophisticated enough to contribute to the development of optimized map designs, discuss some limitations of the current models, and suggest directions for further development.
