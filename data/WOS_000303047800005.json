In this article we introduce some simplification rules for Intuitionistic propositional logic that try to replace a formula with an equi-satisfiable \"simpler\" one with the aim to reduce the search space. Our results are proved via semantical techniques based on Kripke models. We also provide an empirical evaluation of their impact on implementations.", "paper_title": "Simplification Rules for Intuitionistic Propositional Tableaux", "paper_id": "WOS:000303047800005"}
