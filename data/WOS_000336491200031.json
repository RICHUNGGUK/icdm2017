Then, we extend the grey relational analysis (GRA) procedure for multiple attribute group decision making with multigranularity linguistic information. According to the concept of the GRA, a fuzzy relative relational degree is defined to determine the ranking order of all alternatives by calculating the degree of fuzzy grey relational coefficient to both the fuzzy positive-ideal solution (FPIS) and fuzzy negative-ideal solution (FNIS) simultaneously. Finally, a practical example for evaluating the performance of enterprise's mergers & acquisition is used to illustrate the developed procedures.", "paper_title": "A method for group decision making with multigranularity linguistic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000336491200031"}
