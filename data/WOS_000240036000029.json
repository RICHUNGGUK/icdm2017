The prevalent methods such as one based on the frequency characteristics do not deal with time-series data in the time dimention. Therefore, our method for extracting the features is temporally sensitive to fluctuations of time-series data. We experimented using the time-series data whose frequency bands were changed variously in order to make clear the availability of the proposal procedures such as smoothing and encoding.", "paper_title": "Feature detection from illustration of time-series data", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000029"}
