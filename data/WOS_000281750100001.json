These thermal-aware policies require the envision of high-level models that capture the complex thermal behavior of (nano)structures that build the 3D stack. Moreover, the floorplanning of the chip strongly determines the thermal profile of the system and a quick exploration of the design space is required to minimize the damage of the thermal effects. This paper proposes a complete thermal model for 3D-CMPs with building nano-structures. The proposed thermal model is then used to characterize the thermal behavior of the Niagara system and expose the strong influence of the chip floorplanning in the thermal profile.
