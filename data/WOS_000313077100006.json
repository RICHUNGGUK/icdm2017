The simulated results of lower n-alkanes are in good agreement with the existing experimental data, and support the reliability of results of the simulations of self-diffusion coefficients obtained at the extreme conditions. We predict the self-diffusion coefficients for methane, ethane, propane and n-butane at the similar reduced temperatures and pressures to draw a comparison between them. Then the correlation between self-diffusion and structural properties are further investigated by calculating the coordination numbers. Moreover, we define four distances and their corresponding relative deviations to characterize the flexibility of long-chain n-alkanes. The simulated results show that the self-diffusion of n-alkane molecules is mainly affected by the close packing, and the flexibility has a strong impact on the self-diffusion of longer n-alkane molecules.", "paper_title": "MD simulation of self-diffusion and structure in some n-alkanes over a wide temperature range at high pressures", "paper_id": "WOS:000313077100006"}
