In this paper, we propose the Auto Diffusion Function (ADF) which is a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in a way that has a simple physical interpretation. The ADF of a given 3D object has a number of further desirable properties: Its extrema are generally at the tips of features of a given object, its gradients and level sets follow or encircle features, respectively, it is controlled by a single parameter which can be interpreted as feature scale, and, finally, the ADF is invariant to rigid and isometric deformations. We describe the ADF and its properties in detail and compare it to other choices of scalar functions on manifolds. As an example of an application, we present a pose invariant, hierarchical skeletonization and segmentation algorithm which makes direct use of the ADF.", "paper_title": "Shape Analysis Using the Auto Diffusion Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000268597500016"}
