A major reason for this preference is the well-known problem of inconsistency of estimators based on regular sampling, when the underlying power spectral density is not bandlimited. It is argued in this paper that, in consideration of a large sample property like consistency, it is natural to allow the sampling rate to go to infinity as the sample size goes to infinity. Through appropriate asymptotic calculations under this scenario, it is shown that the smoothed periodogram based on regularly spaced data is a consistent estimator of the spectral density, even when the latter is not band-limited. It transpires that, under similar assumptions, the estimators based on uniformly sampled and Poisson-sampled data have about the same rate of convergence. Apart from providing this reassuring message, the paper also gives a guideline for practitioners regarding appropriate choice of the sampling rate. Theoretical calculations for large samples and Monte-Carlo simulations for small samples indicate that the smoothed periodogram based on uniformly sampled data have less variance and more bias than its counterpart based on Poisson sampled data.", "paper_title": "Consistent Estimation of Non-bandlimited Spectral Density From Uniformly Spaced Samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700002"}
