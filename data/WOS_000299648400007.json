Many authenticated group key agreement schemes have been proposed, but few of them provide user anonymity for wireless mobile networks. Considering the user privacy issues and the characteristics of wireless mobile networks, we proposed a certificateless authenticated group key agreement scheme with privacy-preservation based on elliptic curve discrete logarithms. Resource-limited mobile devices can efficiently, cooperatively and anonymously establish an authenticated group key with entity authentication using no public key certificates in mobile wireless networks. The proposed scheme has the following properties: (1) It achieves contributory group key agreement with entity authentication. (2) It provides mutual authentication, explicit key authentication, key confirmation, forward secrecy, group key updating, user anonymity and some potential attacks resistance. (3) No public key certificates are used and the authenticity of public keys is implicitly verified. (4) It is efficient and suitable for unbalanced mobile wireless networks in terms of computational complexities, communication overheads, key storage and key management.", "paper_title": "CERTIFICATELESS AUTHENTICATED GROUP KEY AGREEMENT SCHEME WITH PRIVACY-PRESERVATION FOR RESOURCE-LIMITED MOBILE DEVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400007"}
