However, in case that the number of views to be encoded increases in MVC, the total encoding time will be greatly increased. To reduce computational complexity in MVC, a fast mode decision using both Macroblock-based region segmentation information and global disparity vector among views is proposed to reduce the encoding time. The proposed method achieves on the average 1.5 similar to 2.9 reduction of the total encoding time with the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) degradation of about 0.05 dB.", "paper_title": "Fast Mode Decision Using Global Disparity Vector for Multiview Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190700061"}
