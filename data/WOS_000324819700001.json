This class includes the (single basepoint) Log-Exp subdivision scheme as a special case. In these schemes, the exponential map is replaced by a so-called retraction map f from the tangent bundle of a manifold to the manifold. It is known that any choice of retraction map yields a C (2) scheme, provided the underlying linear scheme is C (2) (this is called \"C (2) equivalence\"). But when the underlying linear scheme is C (3), Navayazdani and Yu have shown that to guarantee C (3) equivalence, a certain tensor P (f) associated to f must vanish. They also show that P (f) vanishes when the underlying manifold is a symmetric space and f is the exponential map. Their analysis is based on certain \"C (k) proximity conditions\" which are known to be sufficient for C (k) equivalence. In the present paper, a geometric interpretation of the tensor P (f) is given. Associated to the retraction map f is a torsion-free affine connection, which in turn defines an exponential map. The condition P (f) =0 is shown to be equivalent to the condition that f agrees with the exponential map of the connection up to the third order. In particular, when f is the exponential map of a connection, one recovers the original connection and P (f) vanishes. It then follows that the condition P (f) =0 is satisfied by a wider class of manifolds than was previously known. Under the additional assumption that the subdivision rule satisfies a time-symmetry, it is shown that the vanishing of P (f) implies that the C (4) proximity conditions hold, thus guaranteeing C (4) equivalence. Finally, the analysis in the paper shows that for k >= 5, the C (k) proximity conditions imply vanishing curvature. This suggests that vanishing curvature of the connection associated to f is likely to be a necessary condition for C (k) equivalence for k >= 5.", "paper_title": "Single Basepoint Subdivision Schemes for Manifold-valued Data: Time-Symmetry Without Space-Symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000324819700001"}
