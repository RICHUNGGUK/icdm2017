Original images of the targets, such as statues, buildings, or culture relics, are captured with a hand-held camera and processed in three steps, which consists of preprocessing, sparse reconstruction and dense reconstruction. The reconstructed surface models can be preserved or exhibited as digital copies of the heritage; experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its potential to be applied in the field of historical heritage restoration.", "paper_title": "Digital restoration of historical heritage by reconstruction from uncalibrated images", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300168"}
