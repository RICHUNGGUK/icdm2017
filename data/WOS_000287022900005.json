The paper develops a novel constraint-based action language, B(MAP), that enables the declarative description of large classes of multi-agent and multi-valued domains. B(MAP) supports several complex features, including combined effects of concurrent and interacting actions, concurrency control, and delayed effects. The paper presents a mapping of B(MAP) theories to CLP and it demonstrates the effectiveness of an implementation in SICStus Prolog on several benchmark problems. The effort is an evolution of previous research on using CLP for single-agent domains, demonstrating the flexibility of CLP technology to handle the more complex issues of multi-agency and concurrency.", "paper_title": "An Investigation of Multi-Agent Planning in CLP", "paper_id": "WOS:000287022900005"}
