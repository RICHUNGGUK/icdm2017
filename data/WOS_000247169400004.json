However, one of the limitations of these methods is their slow convergence. The PX-EM (parameter-expanded EM) algorithm was proposed by Liu, Rubin and Wu to make EM much faster. On the other hand, stochastic versions of EM are powerful alternatives of EM when the E-step is untractable in a closed form. In this paper we propose the PX-SAEM which is a parameter expansion version of the so-called SAEM (Stochastic Approximation version of EM). PX-SAEM is shown to accelerate SAEM and improve convergence toward the maximum likelihood estimate in a parametric framework. Numerical examples illustrate the behavior of PX-SAEM in linear and nonlinear mixed effects models.", "paper_title": "A parameter expansion version of the SAEM algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000247169400004"}
