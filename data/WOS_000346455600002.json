However, the backlash or joint clearance in the system can significantly degrade the accuracy and bandwidth. This work studied the application of actuation redundancy in a general Stewart platform to regulate the preloads on its active joints for the purpose of backlash prevention. A novel active preload control method was proposed to achieve a real-time approach that is robust to large six degrees of freedom interactive loads. The proposed preload method applies an inverse-dynamics based online optimization algorithm to calculate the desired force trajectory of the redundant actuator, and uses a force control scheme to achieve the required force. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that this method is able to eliminate backlash inaccuracies during application of large interactive loads and therefore ensure the precision of the system.
