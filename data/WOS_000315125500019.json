However, parallel implementations for new meshfree particle methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are less studied. In this work, we present optimizations for both central processing units (CPU) and graphics processing units (GPU) focused on a Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. In particular, the obtained performance and a comparison between the most efficient implementations for CPU and GPU are shown using the DualSPHysics code. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
