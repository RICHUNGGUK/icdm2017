We prove that for any tree T with n(1) leaves R(T) >= ad(T) + max(0,root n(1) - 2), where ad(T) is the average distance between vertices of T. As a consequence we resolve the conjecture R(G) >= ad(G) given by Fajtlowicz in 1988 for the case when G is a tree.", "paper_title": "Relation Between Randic Index and Average Distance of Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000294591400006"}
