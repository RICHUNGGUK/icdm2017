We obtain heavy-traffic limits for the distributions of the joint workload, waiting-time and queue length processes. We do so by using a functional central limit theorem approach, which requires the interchange of steady-state and heavy-traffic limits. The marginals of these limiting distributions are shown to be exponential with rates that can be computed by matrix-analytic methods. Moreover, we show how to numerically compute the joint distributions, by viewing the limit processes as multi-dimensional semi-martingale reflected Brownian motions in the non-negative orthant.", "paper_title": "Heavy-traffic asymptotics for networks of parallel queues with Markov-modulated service speeds", "paper_id": "WOS:000350362600003"}
