Gehrke et al. Both interval extensions can be seen as interval representations and therefore satisfy the correctness principle of interval computations. T-norms and automorphisms can be seen as objects and morphisms, respectively, of a category. Analogously, we will prove that interval t-norms supplied with interval automorphism is also a category, and we provide a functor between these categories that always returns the best interval representation of any t-norm and automorphism, and therefore can be used to deal with optimality of interval fuzzy algorithms.
