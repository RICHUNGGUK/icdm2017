The increased interest in lightweight cryptography motivates us to analyze such a MAC scheme. Our attacks are based on a distinguishing-H attack on HMAC-MD5 proposed by Wang et al. We first improve its complexity from 2(97) to 2(89.04). With this improvement, we then propose key recovery attacks on Sandwich-MAC-MD5 by combining various techniques such as distinguishing-H for HMAC-MD5, IV Bridge for APOP, dBB-near-collisions for related-key NMAC-MD5, meet-in-the-middle attack etc. In particular, we generalize a previous keyrecovery technique as a new tool exploiting a conditional key-dependent distribution. Surprisingly, a key which is even longer than the tag size can be recovered without the knowledge of the key size. Finally, our attack also improves the previous partial-key (K1) recovery on MD5-MAC, and extends it to recover both of K-1 and K-2.", "paper_title": "Improved Single-Key Distinguisher on HMAC-MD5 and Key Recovery Attacks on Sandwich-MAC-MD5 and MD5-MAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100004"}
