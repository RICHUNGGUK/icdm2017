Such models are in general not closed under symmetric property, so we must rely on a proper asymmetric notion of vertex separation which produces structures closed under all graphoid properties and their reverses except for symmetry (namely, asymmetric graphoids). Focusing on this kind of models we present an efficient procedure to generate and represent them symbolically. We then introduce asymmetric Markov properties and prove their equivalence, providing in this way a method to extract the model encoded in a DAG. Finally, an algorithm to build a minimal I-map, given an ordering of the random variables, is drawn.
