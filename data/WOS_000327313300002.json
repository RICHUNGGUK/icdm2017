In this paper, we present two concrete examples of trajectory tracking of an open quantum system with time-dependent Lindblad operator which has an eigenstate vertical bar psi(s)(t)> with eigenvalue 0. We work out the first case analytically while numerically the second case. From both the cases, we find that, if changing the Lindblad operator is sufficiently slow, then the system can follow the trajectory of vertical bar psi(s)(t)> very well.", "paper_title": "INSTANTANEOUS DARK STATE AND TRAJECTORY TRACKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000327313300002"}
