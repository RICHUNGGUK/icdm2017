In this paper we examine how such a spatial layout can be interpreted as a vital system of egress, which if processed exhaustively by a naive agent will identify with a measure of egress complexity. We further examine how the established rule-based mechanism for the determination of egress complexity satisfies the generically accepted axioms of complexity and we illustrate some of the algorithms of egress complexity with examples.", "paper_title": "Axiomatic considerations of a rule based mechanism for the determination of a building's egress capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000259717900001"}
