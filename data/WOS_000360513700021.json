Assumed stresses are rationally derived basing on the stresses associated to analytical solutions of some particular cases. Displacements within the element are a posteriori recovered by shape functions based on the same solutions. Numerical results show the high performance of the proposed element: generalized displacements and stresses are accurately predicted with very rough meshes, often using only one or two finite elements.
