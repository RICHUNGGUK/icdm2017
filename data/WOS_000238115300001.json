We provide a sound and complete axiomatization for the logic, and consider the complexity of the decision problem. Although the reasoning in the logic is mainly propositional, we allow variables representing numbers and quantification over them. This expressive power seems necessary to capture important properties of evidence.", "paper_title": "A logic for reasoning about evidence", "paper_id": "WOS:000238115300001"}
