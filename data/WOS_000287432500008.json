Project activities are assumed to have known deterministic renewable resource requirements and uncertain durations, described by independent random variables with a known probability distribution function. To tackle the problem solution we propose a heuristic method which relies on a stage wise decomposition of the problem and on the use of joint probabilistic constraints. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
