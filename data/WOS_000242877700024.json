A perceptual weighting function is developed by applying cubic spline interpolation on the signal-to-mask ratios (SMRs) which are obtained from the psychoacoustic model. Experiments on speaker identification and speech resynthesis showed that the proposed method not only improved the speaker recognition performance, but also improved the speech quality of the resynthesized speech.", "paper_title": "Perceptually weighted mel-cepstrum analysis of speech based on psychoacoustic model", "paper_id": "WOS:000242877700024"}
