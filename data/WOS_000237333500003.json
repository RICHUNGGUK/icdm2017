The solutions provided by this algorithm in the particular case R-1 = R - 1, R-2 = R can be used to obtain for any integer delta > 0 a factor (2+1/delta) approximation algorithm for solving the following augmentation problem with odd diameter constraints D = 2R + 1: Given a tree T, add a minimum number of new edges such that the augmented graph has diameter <= D.
