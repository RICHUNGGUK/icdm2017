When the timely propagation of updates to remote distributed replicas is an important issue, it is preferable that a replica gets the same update twice than it does not receive it at all. On the other hand, few assumptions on the topology of the network can be made in a nomadic environment, where connections are likely to change unpredictably. An extreme approach would be to blindly \"push\" every update to every replica; however, this would lead to a huge waste of bandwidth and of resources. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on timed buffers, a technique that tends to reduce the overall number of propagated updates while guaranteeing that every update is delivered to every replica and that the propagation is not delayed.
