At present, just rational approximations and asymptotic expressions for these functions were obtained. In this paper we present a direct calculation of the integral representation of these functions obtaining perturbative and nonperturvative solutions expressed in terms of fast convergent series. We also provide a simple numerical algorithm which allows to control speed and precision of the results. The testing runs have provided, in reasonable computing times, correct results up to 13-14 significant digits on the density and distribution functions and 9-10 on the first and second momenta. If necessary, this accuracy could be improved by adding more coefficients to the algorithm.", "paper_title": "The Landau distribution for charged particles traversing thin films", "paper_id": "WOS:000242248700007"}
