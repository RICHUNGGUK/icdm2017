These categories have a natural visualisation as a form of graphs. We present a formalism for equational reasoning about such graphs and develop this into a generic proof system with a fixed logical kernel for reasoning about compact closed categories. A salient feature of our system is that it provides a formal and declarative account of derived results that can include 'ellipses'-style notation. We illustrate the framework by instantiating it for a graphical language of quantum computation and show how this can be used to perform symbolic computation.", "paper_title": "Graphical reasoning in compact closed categories for quantum computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000271260500003"}
