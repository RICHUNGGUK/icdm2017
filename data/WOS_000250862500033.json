The energy stargenvalue equation as well as the dynamical equation do not display the expected solutions. In this paper, we review some previous results on the subject and add some new contributions. We reformulate the confined energy eigenvalue equation by adding to the Hamiltonian a new (distributional) boundary potential. The new Hamiltonian is proved to be globally defined and self-adjoint. Moreover, it yields the correct Weyl -Wigner formulation of the confined system.", "paper_title": "Deformation quantization of confined systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862500033"}
