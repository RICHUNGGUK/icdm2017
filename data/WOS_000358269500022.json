Numerical simulations are performed for two simplified vehicles: a slanted-back Ahmed body at Re = 30,000 and a squared-back Ahmed body at Re = 300,000. A comparison of the resolved and modeled physical flow scales is made with corresponding LES and experimental data for a better understanding of the performance of the PANS model. The PANS model is compared for coarse and fine grid resolutions and it is indicated that even a coarse-grid PANS simulation is able to produce fairly close flow predictions to those from a well-resolved LES simulation. The results indicate the possibility of improvement of the predictions by employing a finer grid resolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
