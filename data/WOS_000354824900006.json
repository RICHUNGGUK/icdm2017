By dividing the original medical image into blocks, the method displaces the peak point of a block's histogram of difference and embeds multi-bit information at 1 pixel point. In so doing, secret communication and storage of large-capacity invisible medical diagnoses and patients personal confidential data can be achieved. Once the watermark is extracted, not only the image integrity is authenticated, but also the original image and personal data of the patient can be recovered in a nondestructive way. With low computational complexity, a high embedding capacity and little demand for auxiliary information, the proposed algorithm is highly secure and practical.", "paper_title": "Large-Capacity Reversible Watermarking Algorithm for Medical Image Based on Block Histogram of Difference", "paper_id": "WOS:000354824900006"}
