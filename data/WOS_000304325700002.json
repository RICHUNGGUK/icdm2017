Usually, the graphical user interface components shown on these displays are small and often difficult to interact with. Although some prior work has shown that Fitts' law does not hold for small target size, a detailed investigation of Fitts' law in different small target size conditions has yet to be done. In this study we conducted two experiments investigating the impact of small target sizes on pointing performance. We identified a critical point on the target size dimension where Fitts' law started to break down. We then proposed a small target size index of difficulty and an empirical Fitts' formula to extend the Fitts' law beyond the critical point to small target size conditions. Our results show that the new model works well as both a descriptive and a predictive model for small target size conditions.", "paper_title": "Updating Fitts' Law to Account for Small Targets", "paper_id": "WOS:000304325700002"}
