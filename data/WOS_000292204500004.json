We have considered the anisotropic Heisenberg (XXZ) model in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya (DM) interaction in addition to the Ising model in a magnetic field with DM interaction. We have found that the increment of DM interaction and magnetic field can enhance and reduce the entanglement of the system. We have shown that the non-symmetric pairwise state has higher value concurrence and critical temperature (above which the entanglement vanishes) than the symmetric pairwise one. For the negative anisotropy, the non-symmetric entanglement is a monotonic function of DM interaction while for positive anisotropy, it has a maximum versus DM parameter and vanishes for larger values of DM interaction. The conditions for the existence of thermal entanglement are discussed in detail. The most remarkable result appears at zero temperature where the three-qubits ground state entanglement of the system (in spite of two-qubits counterpart) shows the fingerprint of the quantum phase transition for a system of in finite number of qubits.", "paper_title": "THREE-QUBITS GROUND STATE AND THERMAL ENTANGLEMENT OF ANISOTROPIC HEISENBERG (XXZ) AND ISING MODELS WITH DZYALOSHINSKII-MORIYA INTERACTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000292204500004"}
