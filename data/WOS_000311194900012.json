In this paper, we apply the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set theory to generalize results concerning hypergraphs. For each intuitionistic fuzzy structure defined, we use cut-level sets to define an associated sequence of crisp structures. We determine what properties of the Sequence of crisp structures characterize a given property of the intuitionistic fuzzy structure. We also present applications of intuitionistic fuzzy hypergraphs.
