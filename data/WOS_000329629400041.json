With a knowledge of the aircraft's state and parameters, as well as a known wind profile, the area of maximum glide range can be calculated using aircraft equations of motion for gliding flight. A landing descent circuit technique used by human pilots carrying out forced landings called high key low key is employed to account for the extra glide distance required for an approach and landing. By combining maximum glide range analysis with the descent circuit, all the reachable landing sites can be determined. X-Plane flight simulator is used to demonstrate and validate the techniques presented.", "paper_title": "Reachability Analysis of Landing Sites for Forced Landing of a UAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400041"}
