The method establishes geometric rules of the associated interpolatory subdivision through addition of further weighted averaging operations to the approximatory subdivision. The paper thus provides a novel approach for designing new interpolatory subdivision schemes. In addition, a family of subdivision surfaces varying from the given approximatory scheme to its associated interpolatory scheme, namely the blending subdivisions, can also be established. Based on the proposed method, variants of several known interpolatory subdivision schemes are constructed. A new interpolatory subdivision scheme is also developed using the same technique. Brief analysis of a family of blending subdivisions associated with the Loop subdivision scheme demonstrates that this particular family of subdivisions are globally C-1 continuous while maintaining bounded curvature for regular meshes. As a further extension of the blending subdivisions, a volume-preserving subdivision strategy is also proposed in the paper.", "paper_title": "A method for constructing interpolatory subdivision schemes and blending subdivisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000246680900006"}
