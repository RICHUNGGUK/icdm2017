While previous work has focused primarily on correlating individual SNP markers with gene expression and disease, it has been suggested that using haplotype blocks instead of individual markers can significantly increase statistical power. Results: We present BlockMapper, a probabilistic generative model for genotype data and quantitative traits data, such as gene expression or phenotype measurements. BlockMapper discovers the block structure of genotype data and associates these inferred blocks to patterns of variation in quantitative traits data, whilst accounting for non-genetic factors. Our model achieves high accuracy for predicting Crohn's disease phenotype in Chromosome 5q31 and reveals novel cis-associations between two haplotype blocks in the ENm006 genomic region and GDl1, a gene implicated in X-linked mental retardation. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for the influence of large sets of SNPs on patterns of regulatory/phenotypic variation and represent a step towards an understanding of human genetic variation.", "paper_title": "Bayesian association of haplotypes and non-genetic factors to regulatory and phenotypic variation in human populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400049"}
