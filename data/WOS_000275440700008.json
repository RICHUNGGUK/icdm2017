The growth of 3D content in virtual worlds will make real-time content streaming (or 3D streaming) increasingly attractive for developers. To meet the demands of a large user base while lowering costs, peer-to-peer (P2P) content delivery holds the promise for a paradigm shift in how future virtual worlds will be deployed and used. The authors define both the problem and solution spaces for P2P 3D streaming - by outlining its requirements and challenges - and categorize existing proposals.", "paper_title": "Peer-to-Peer 3D Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000275440700008"}
