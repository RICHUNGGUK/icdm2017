Each job consists of no more than two operations and time lags exist between the completion time of the first and the start time of the second operation of any two-operation job. We prove that any greedy algorithm is 2-competitive. For the non-clairvoyant variant of the problem, no on-line algorithm can do better. For the clairvoyant variant, no on-line delay algorithm has a competitive ratio better than root 5+1/2 approximate to 1.618, and a greedy algorithm is still the best on-line non-delay algorithm. We also show that the same results hold for the two-machine flow shop problem with time lags. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
