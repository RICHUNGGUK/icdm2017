However, finding a globally effective feature is difficult and, in many cases, domain dependent. Instead of simply extracting features from copyrighted images directly, we propose a new framework called the extended feature set for detecting copies of images. In our approach, virtual prior attacks are applied to copyrighted images to generate novel features, which serve as training data. The copy-detection problem can be solved by learning classifiers from the training data, thus, generated. Our approach can be integrated into existing copy detectors to further improve their performance. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach can substantially enhance the accuracy of copy detection.", "paper_title": "A new approach to image copy detection based on extended feature sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000248192300014"}
