Based on the method of neural network, a novel adaptive controller is designed via backstepping design process. Furthermore, by introducing Nussbaum function, the issue of unknown control directions is handled. In the backstepping design process, the dynamic surface control technique is employed to avoid differentiating certain nonlinear functions repeatedly. Moreover, in order to reduce the number of adaptation laws, we do not use the neural networks to directly approximate the unknown nonlinear functions but the desired control signals. Finally, we provide two examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Approximation-Based Adaptive Tracking Control for MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Input Saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751900009"}
