A 3D navigation method is introduced aiming at providing a monitoring system with enhanced safety and minimal intraoperative interaction. An automatic registration method is presented to establish the 3D-3D transformation between the preoperative CT images and a common reference system in the surgical space, and an intensity-based similarity metric adapted for the multi-planar configuration is introduced in the registration procedure. A critical region is defined for real-time monitoring in order to prevent penetration of the lamina and avoid violation of nerve structures. The contour of the spinal canal is reconstructed as the critical region, and different levels of warning limits are defined. During the milling procedure, the position of the surgical instrument relative to the critical region is provided with augmented display and audio warnings. Timely alarm is provided for surgeons to prevent surgical failure when the mill approaches the critical region. Our validation experiment shows that real-time 3D navigation and monitoring is advantageous for improving the safety of the milling operation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
