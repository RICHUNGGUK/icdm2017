However, due to the uncertainties in the manufacturing environment, such as defective parts and demand change, the dispatching policy should be considered to ensure efficient operations in pull-type robotic cells. In this research, a predictive algorithm based on the heuristic approach is developed to prioritize tasks and generate robot movements in a pull-type robotic cell. The effects of the predictive algorithm on system performance under different system parameters, such as capacity of the decoupler and degree of imbalance, are evaluated. In addition, the performance of the predictive algorithm is compared with the cyclic logic, first come first serve and shortest distance. The simulation results show that the proposed predictive algorithm can reduce cell cycle time and provide quicker response to pull requests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
