However, the classical models ignore the difference between the transactions, and the weighted association rule mining does not work on databases with only binary attributes. In this paper, we introduce a new measure w-support, which does not require preassigned weights. It takes the quality of transactions into consideration using link-based models. A fast miming algorithm is given, and a large amount of experimental results are presented.", "paper_title": "Mining weighted association rules without preassigned weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000254045000005"}
