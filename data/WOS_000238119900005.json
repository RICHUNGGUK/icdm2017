We study the capacitated version of this problem in which the input includes an integral capacity for each line that bounds the number of rectangles that the line can cover. We consider two versions of this problem. In the first, one is allowed to use only a single copy of each line (hard capacities), and in the second, one is allowed to use multiple copies of every line provided that multiplicities are counted in the size of the solution (soft capacities). For the case of d-dimensional rectangle stabbing with soft capacities, we present a 6d-approximation algorithm and a 2-approximation algorithm when d = 1 For the case of hard capacities, we present a bi-criteria algorithm that computes 16d-approximate solutions that use at most two copies of every line. For the one dimensional case, an 8-approximation algorithm for hard capacities is presented.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for capacitated rectangle stabbing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238119900005"}
