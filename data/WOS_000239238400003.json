By exploring the properties of the dead-zone model intuitively and mathematically, a dead-zone inverse is constructed. Based on this inverse construction, an adaptive sliding controller is designed. Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the proposed adaptive control law ensures global stability of the adaptive system and achieves desired tracking precision. Simulation results attained for an uncertain non-linear system are presented to illustrate and further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive sliding inverse control of a class of non-linear systems preceded by unknown non-symmetrical dead-zone", "paper_id": "WOS:000239238400003"}
