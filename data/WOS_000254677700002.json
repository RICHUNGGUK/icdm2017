First, the generation of the bases is studied. Our numeric results show that the linear optics method can be used to generate the 4 mutually unbiased basis qutrit states probabilistically with high fidelity. Second, we investigate whether or not linear polarization-optics components are sufficient to realize the simultaneous detection of the qutrit states forming a complete basis. Analytical results show that every state in two of the bases, namely only half of the 4 mutually unbiased bases qutrit states can be identified.", "paper_title": "Generation and detection of photonic qutrit states by linear optics", "paper_id": "WOS:000254677700002"}
