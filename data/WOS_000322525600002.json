In this article we propose a methodology, as well as the supporting toolset, targeting to provide fast application implementation onto reconfigurable architectures with the usage of a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation framework. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the introduced framework, as we reduce the execution runtime compared to the state-of-the-art approach on average by 53.5x. Additionally, the derived solutions achieve higher operation frequencies by 1.17x, while they also exhibit significant lower fragmentation ratios of hardware resources.", "paper_title": "JITPR: A Framework for Supporting Fast Application's Implementation onto FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000322525600002"}
