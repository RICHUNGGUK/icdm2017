We give a representation of pseudowords over R by infinite trees, called R-trees. Then we show that a pseudoword is an omega-term if and only if its associated tree is regular (i.e. it can be folded into a finite graph), or equivalently, if the w-term has a finite number of tails. We give a linear algorithm to compute a compact representation of the R-tree for omega-terms, which yields a linear solution of the word problem for omega-terms over R. We finally exhibit a basis for the omega-variety generated by R and we show that there is no finite basis. Several results can be compared to recent work of Bloom and Choffrut on long words.
