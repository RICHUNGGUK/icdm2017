The paper points out that the MF is the collective term for the flow of macroscopic goods and that of microcosmic substances. The material flow is not only an economic phenomenon, but also social and natural ones. There is not only economic MF, but also social and natural ones. The economic MF is the core for the MF, and the social and natural MF is the basis for the MF; no matter whether in nature, society or economic circles, the MF comprises of five basic elements: Material, Flow, Owner, Region and Time, among which Material is the core one; the MF is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic ones by nature. Its intrinsic natures include Material, Flow, Owner, Region and Time; its extrinsic natures include Party, Service, Management, Technology and Economy. The MF science and technology is a scientific and technological field with very strong comprehensibility, dealing with subjects including natural science, engineering technology and science, and human and social studies; the MF engineering is a syntheses comprising of six MF elements or six MF forces. The MF's hard science and technology and its soft science and technology can be applied to national economy in the most efficient way, with the fundamental purpose to benefit the mankind; the MF is not only an industry, but also a backbone industry, and even a backbone industry group. The paper provides some insights into future enterprise integration in a global supply chain environment.", "paper_title": "The concept and theory of material flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000259569600009"}
