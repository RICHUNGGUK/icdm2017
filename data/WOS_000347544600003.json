However, for such datasets parametric Johnson-Mehl models fitted by maximum likelihood have yet not been evaluated by means of functional summary statistics. This paper therefore invents four functional summary statistics adapted to the Johnson-Mehl model, with two of them based on the second-order properties and the other two on the nuclei-boundary distances for the associated Johnson-Mehl tessellation. The functional summary statistics theoretical properties are investigated, non-parametric estimators are suggested, and their usefulness for model checking is examined in a simulation study. The functional summary statistics are also used for checking fitted parametric Johnson-Mehl models for a neurotransmitters dataset.", "paper_title": "Functional summary statistics for the Johnson-Mehl model", "paper_id": "WOS:000347544600003"}
