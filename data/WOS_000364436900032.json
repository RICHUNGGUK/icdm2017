Existing protocols in this area utilized various social features such as user interests, social similarity, and community structure to improve the performance of data dissemination. However, the interrelationship between user interests and its impact on the efficiency of data dissemination has not been explored sufficiently. In this paper, we analyze various kinds of relationships between user interests and model them using a layer-based structure in order to form social communities in SAN paradigm. We propose Int-Tree, an Interest-Tree based scheme which uses the relationship between user interests to improve the performance of data dissemination. The core of Int-Tree is the interest-tree, a tree-based community structure that combines two social features, i.e., density of a community and social tie, to support data dissemination. The simulation results show that It-Tree achieves higher delivery ratio, lower overhead, in comparison to two benchmark protocols, PROPHET and Epidemic routing. In addition, It-Tree can perform with 1.36 hop counts in average, and tolerable latency in terms of buffer size, time to live (TTL) and simulation duration. Finally, It-Tree keeps stable performance with various parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
