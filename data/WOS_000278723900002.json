In a special class of accelerated life tests known as step-stress tests, the stress levels increase discretely at pre-fixed time points, and this allows the experimenter to obtain information on the parameters of the lifetime distributions more quickly than under normal operating conditions. Moreover, when a test unit fails, there are often more than one fatal cause for the failure, such as mechanical or electrical. In this article, we consider the simple step-stress model under time constraint when the lifetime distributions of the different risk factors are independently exponentially distributed. Under this setup, we derive the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the unknown mean parameters of the different causes under the assumption of a cumulative exposure model. Since it is found that the MLEs do not exist when there is no failure by any particular risk factor within the specified time frame, the exact sampling distributions of the MLEs are derived through the use of conditional moment generating functions. Using these exact distributions as well as the asymptotic distributions, the parametric bootstrap method, and the Bayesian posterior distribution, we discuss the construction of confidence intervals and credible intervals for the parameters. Their performance is assessed through Monte Carlo simulations and finally, we illustrate the methods of inference discussed here with an example. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
