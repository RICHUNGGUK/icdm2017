Their backbone is JavaScript, the only programming language supported by all major web browsers. Most browsers run on desktop or mobile devices with parallel hardware. However, JavaScript is by design sequential, and current web applications make little use of hardware parallelism. Are web applications ready to exploit parallel hardware? We answer the question in two steps: First, we survey 174 web developers about the potential and challenges of using parallelism. Then, we study the performance and computation shape of a set of web applications that are representative for the emerging web. Our findings indicate that emerging web applications do have latent data parallelism, and JavaScript developers' programming style is not a significant impediment to exploiting this parallelism.", "paper_title": "Are Web Applications Ready for Parallelism?", "paper_id": "WOS:000367254800044"}
