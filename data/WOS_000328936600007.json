In this paper presents a proposed Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) chip utilized a novel Membership Function Circuit (MFC) which can be made programmable. This membership function features of large dynamic range, high current driving, high noise immunity and is simply tunable by setting some voltages on IC pins. Each input of controller has five membership functions and output has seven singletons. A new structure for Min/Max operators, and also, a new current-mode divider circuit with very small area, very low power consumption and high speed and accurate are presented, which are compatible to the proposed MFC, are also given. This controller is a general-purpose two-input one-output fuzzy controller that can be implemented in 0.08-mm(2) in 0.35-mu m CMOS technology (BSIM3v3). For general control tasks, input-output inference of FLC is voltage/voltage. The maximum delay in output of FLC is about 67-ns that correspond to 15-MFLIPS (Fuzzy Logic Inference per Second) and power consumption is 2.5-mW.", "paper_title": "Design of current-mode modular programmable analog CMOS FLC", "paper_id": "WOS:000328936600007"}
