Static sensors monitor the environment and report events occurring in the sensing field. Mobile sensors are then dispatched to visit these event locations to conduct more advanced analysis. A big challenge is how to schedule these mobile sensors' traveling paths in an energy-balanced way so that their overall lifetime is maximized. We formulate this problem as a multiround sensor dispatch problem and show it to be NP-complete. Then, we propose a centralized and a distributed heuristics to schedule mobile sensors' traveling paths. Our heuristics allow arbitrary numbers of mobile sensors and event locations in each round and have an energy-balanced concept in mind. The centralized heuristic tries to minimize mobile sensors' moving energy while keeping their energy consumption balanced. The distributed heuristic utilizes a grid structure for event locations to bid for mobile sensors. Through simulations, we show the effectiveness of our schemes. This paper contributes in defining a more general multiround sensor dispatch problem and proposing energy-efficient solutions to it.", "paper_title": "Energy-Balanced Dispatch of Mobile Sensors in a Hybrid Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000283559800010"}
