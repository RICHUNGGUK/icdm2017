The new condition, while guaranteeing that the vector field is diffeomorphic, is sharp enough to allow large deformations. The complexity of the constraint is also discussed. A new diffeomorphic registration algorithm using this condition and its application to interslice interpolation are presented and evaluated on synthetic images and in vivo magnetic resonance T-2 images of the brain. The registration method has also been compared to some state-of-the-art registration methods.", "paper_title": "A Sharp Sufficient Condition for B-Spline Vector Field Invertibility.
