The dispersive properties of finite element solution by using semi-discretizations of Timoshenko's flexural wave equation, as well as bifurcations of the first- and second-spectra flexural waves illustrate a better performance of the proposed lumped mass model. Classic two-node cubic elements are taken into account. The Newmark average acceleration step-by-step integration method is used for solution. The attention is devoted to the evanescent first- and seccnd-spectra waves. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. and Civil-Comp Ltd.
