This research relies on a distribution problem encountered at Northern Grocery Company in Beijing as an example to develop a two-stage solution procedure and subsequent computer-enabled programs for identifying efficient vehicle routing alternatives. The solution process, which integrates heuristic search algorithms and an integer programming model, can be applied to a wide range of distribution problems with specified route durations and a circular transportation network structure as exemplified by City of Beijing.
