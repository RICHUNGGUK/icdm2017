In this sense, the available multiple well test datasets are used to calibrate the geological model parameters rather than fitting simplified analytical models. In the exercise studied in this paper, the parameter space includes a range of geostatistical, petrophysical, and structural parameters. The differential evolution algorithm starts with an initial random population from the ranges of input variables and progresses with successive evaluation of the static models' transient tests. The static models' input parameters are perturbed to generate new populations, which can finally match the truth model well test derivative with lower misfits. The ensemble of population models (samples) along with the misfit values are used to highlight the value of well test data in reducing the uncertainty in the parameter space. A Bayesian framework is employed to implement the Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters. The results are confirmed by the sample-based Sobol sensitivity indices, which rank the influential parameters. To reduce the computational cost of the McMC and sensitivity indices, a cross-validated proxy model (i.e., Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline) is constructed. The effect of different variants of differential evolution algorithm on the geological well test matching is also discussed. This paper provides a workflow for quantitative integration of well test data into the reservoir characterization workflow.", "paper_title": "Population-based sampling methods for geological well testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000369521500006"}
