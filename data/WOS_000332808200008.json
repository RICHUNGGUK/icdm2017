Contrary to possibilistic networks (Ayachi et al., 2011 [2]), the compilation principle has not been exploited to ensure causal reasoning in the possibility theory framework. This paper proposes mutilated-based inference approaches and augmented-based inference approaches for qualitative possibilistic causal networks using two compilation methods. The first one is a possibilistic adaptation of the probabilistic inference approach (Darwiche, 2002 [13]) and the second is a purely possibilistic approach based on the transformation of the graphical-based representation into a logic-based one (Benferhat et al., 2002 [3]). Each of the proposed methods encodes the network or the possibilistic knowledge base into a propositional base and compiles this output in order to efficiently compute the effect of both observations and interventions. This paper also reports on a set of experimental results showing cases in which augmentation outperforms mutilation under compilation and vice versa. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
