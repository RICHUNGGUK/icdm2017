In this paper, we present an algorithm for the efficient computation of the Cech complex of P for a given value a of the radius of the covering balls. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can generally handle input sets of several thousand points, while for the topologically most interesting small values of E can handle inputs with tens of thousands of points. We also present an algorithm for the construction of all possible tech complices on P. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
