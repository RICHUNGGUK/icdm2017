Design/methodology/approach - As a complex system, knowledge management should be analyzed and established by system methodologies. There are many system methodologies. Owing to WSR is characteristic of oriental culture; the paper introduces concept and working process of WSR system methodology in knowledge management from WSR perspective. Findings - WSR system methodology can be used to analyze contents of WSR in KMS and to establish an effective KMS. Research limitations/limplications - How to define WSR in KMS is a little difficult for users. Practical implications - A new approach for system analysis and establishment of a successful KMS. Originality/value - The paper shows how the WSR system approach can integrate quantitative approach and qualitative analysis to analyze and establish a KMS synthetically.", "paper_title": "Application of Wuli-Shili-Renli system methodology in knowledge management", "paper_id": "WOS:000267416500008"}
