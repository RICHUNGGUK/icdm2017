Gaussian basis RBF neural networks are used to approximate the plant unknown. nonlinearities and a high-gain observer is used to estimate the states which can not be measured. The proposed controller can guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable, all the states are bounded and the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Output feedback tracking control for a class of MIMO nonlinear minimum phase systems based on RBF neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981200004"}
