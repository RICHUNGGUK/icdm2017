Nevertheless, most of them do not provide formal analysis proof, and the security robustness is doubtful. Chang and Cheng (2011) proposed an efficient remote authentication protocol with smart cards and claimed that their proposed protocol could support secure communication in a multi-server environment. Unfortunately, there are opportunities for security enhancement in current schemes. In this paper, we identify the major weakness, i.e., session key disclosure, of a recently published protocol. We consequently propose a novel authentication scheme for a multi-server environment and give formal analysis proofs for security guarantees.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design of a smart card based authentication protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000328364300002"}
