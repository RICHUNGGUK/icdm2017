It is an extension of the S3 model, implemented via uniform application of the AS3 element pattern across different layers of the model. The pattern consists of components constituting an adaptation loop. The functionality of each component is specified in a generic way. Aspects of these patterns are analyzed in relation to individual S3 layers. The ability to achieve multilayer adaptation, provided by several cooperating AS3 elements is also discussed. Practical usage of the proposed concepts for Adaptive Operational Systems, Integration, and Service Component layers are presented in the form of three case studies. Each study describes the architecture of the proposed system extensions, selected software technologies, implementation details, and sample applications. Related work is discussed in order to provide a background for the reported research. This paper ends with conclusions and an outline of future work.", "paper_title": "Adaptive SOA Solution Stack", "paper_id": "WOS:000304672100002"}
