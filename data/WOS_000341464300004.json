Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, the equations of motion of the manipulator are derived by considering its motion characteristics, namely, all the components rotating about the center of rotation. Using the derived dynamic model, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated to optimize the structural and geometric parameters of the spherical parallel manipulator. The proposed approach is illustrated with the design optimization of an unlimited-roll spherical parallel manipulator with a main objective to minimize the mechanism mass in order to enhance both kinematic and dynamic performances.
