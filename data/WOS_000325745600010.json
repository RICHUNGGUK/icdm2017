More specifically, the paper considers a transfer of two assumptions/axioms of reaction systems, non-permanency and the threshold assumption, into the framework of membrane computing. It is proved that: (1) spiking neural P systems with non-permanency of spikes assumption characterize the semilinear sets of numbers, and (2) symport/antiport P systems with threshold assumption (translated as omega multiplicity of objects) can solve SAT in polynomial time. Also, several open research problems are stated.", "paper_title": "Bridging Membrane and Reaction Systems - Further Results and Research Topics", "paper_id": "WOS:000325745600010"}
