The inherent complexities of simultaneously optimizing the allocation of production tasks at each facility, as well as the interplay between several production and distribution centers make operational planning of a multisite production and distribution network challenging especially when addressing large-scale, industrial applications. The proposed multisite planning with production disaggregation model (Multisite-PPDM) has been formulated in order to address industrially relevant supply chains and determine both the production and shipment profiles for the supply chain of interest.
