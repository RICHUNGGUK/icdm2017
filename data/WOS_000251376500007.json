While we have applied these techniques to clinical data, in this paper in order to rigorously evaluate their effectiveness we rely on data obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Specifically, gappy data sets are generated by removing nodal values from high-resolution 3-D CFD data (at random or in a fixed area) while noisy data sets are formed by superimposing speckle noise on the CFD results. A combined POD-Kriging procedure is applied to planar data sets mimicking coarse resolution \"ultrasound-like\" blood flow images. A method for locating the vessel wall boundary and for calculating the wall shear stress (WSS) is also proposed. The results show good agreement with the original CFD data. The combined POD-Kriging method, enhanced by proper smoothing if needed, holds great potential in dealing effectively with gappy and noisy data reconstruction of in vivo velocity measurements based on color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) imaging or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).", "paper_title": "A reconstruction method for gappy and noisy arterial flow data", "paper_id": "WOS:000251376500007"}
