With the continuous increase in IC integration density, the power consumption is becoming the limiting factor. It turns out that the driving force of the future IC and system development is the reduction of the power consumption and improvement of the performance/power ratio. The Moore's Law is inherently the law for the technology and economic development, and has served as the guideline of the IC development for half a century. However, with the scaling down of IC feature size and the corresponding increased integration density, it is progressively approaching the physical limitation. Moore's Law will gradually complete its historic mission and it will be replaced by a law of reducing the power consumption while ensuring the performance requirements for IC, SoC and SiP performance, law of improving the performance/power ratio. This paper will discuss the related research topics on Green micro/nanoelectronics, including low-power design, novel low-power devices, manufacturing processes for low power applications and related micro/nano electromechanical systems.", "paper_title": "The driving force for development of IC and system in future: Reducing the power consumption and improving the ratio of performance to power consumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000290269200002"}
