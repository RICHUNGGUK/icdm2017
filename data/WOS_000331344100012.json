In recent years, there have been calls for measures to be introduced to protect vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. In this study, a method to detect and track pedestrians using an in-vehicle camera is presented. We improve the technology of detecting pedestrians by using the highly accurate images obtained with a monocular camera. In the detection step, we employ ECoHOG as the feature descriptor; it accumulates the integrated gradient intensities. In the tracking step, we apply an effective motion model using optical flow and the proposed feature descriptor ECoHOG in a tracking-by-detection framework. These techniques were verified using images captured on real roads.", "paper_title": "Extended Feature Descriptor and Vehicle Motion Model with Tracking-by-Detection for Pedestrian Active Safety", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100012"}
