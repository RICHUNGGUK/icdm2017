The VA system is a model used to describe the evolution of probability density function of charged particles under self consistent electric field in plasmas. It conserves many physical quantities, including the total energy which is comprised of the kinetic and electric energy. Unlike the total particle number conservation, the total energy conservation is challenging to achieve. For simulations in longer time ranges, negligence of this fact could cause unphysical results, such as plasma self heating or cooling. In this paper, we develop the first Eulerian solvers that can preserve fully discrete total energy conservation. The main components of our solvers include explicit or implicit energy-conserving temporal discretizations, an energy-conserving operator splitting for the VA equation and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods for the spatial discretizations. We validate our schemes by rigorous derivations and benchmark numerical examples such as Landau damping, two-stream instability and bump-on-tail instability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
