In this sense, project managers must find the best resource configuration for each of the work packages necessary for the management of software development processes in order to keep the team motivated and committed to the project and to improve productivity and quality. This paper presents ReSySTER, a hybrid recommender system based on fuzzy logic, rough set theory and semantic technologies, aimed at helping project leaders to manage software development projects. The proposed system provides a powerful tool for project managers supporting the development process in Scrum environments and helping to form the most suitable team for different work packages. The system has been evaluated in a real scenario of development with the Scrum framework obtaining promising results.", "paper_title": "RESYSTER: A HYBRID RECOMMENDER SYSTEM FOR SCRUM TEAM ROLES BASED ON FUZZY AND ROUGH SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312723300002"}
