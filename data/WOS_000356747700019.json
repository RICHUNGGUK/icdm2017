Dynamic surface control technique is connected with radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) based control framework to avoid the explosion problem of complexity. The composite laws are constructed by prediction error and compensated tracking error between system state and serial-parallel estimation model for NN weights updating. Using Lyapunov techniques, the uniformly ultimate boundedness stability of all the signals in the closed-loop systems is guaranteed. Simulation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed scheme and verify the theoretical analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
