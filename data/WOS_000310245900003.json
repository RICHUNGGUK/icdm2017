We study the complexity of the following problem, for rationals x and y: given as input a planar graph G, determine T(G; x, y). Vertigan completely mapped the complexity of exactly computing the Tutte polynomial of a planar graph. He showed that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if (x, y) is on the hyperbola H (q) given by (x - 1)(y - 1) = q for q = 1 or q = 2 or if (x, y) is one of the two special points (x, y) = (-1, -1) or (x, y) = (1, 1). Otherwise, the problem is #P-hard. In this paper, we consider the problem of approximating T(G; x, y), in the usual sense of \"fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme\" or FPRAS. Roughly speaking, an FPRAS is required to produce, in polynomial time and with high probability, an answer that has small relative error. Assuming that NP is different from RP, we show that there is no FPRAS for the Tutte polynomial in a large portion of the (x, y) plane. In particular, there is no FPRAS if x > 1, y < -1 or if y > 1, x < -1 or if x < 0, y < 0 and q > 5. Also, there is no FPRAS if x < 1, y < 1 and q = 3. For q > 5, our result is intriguing because it shows that there is no FPRAS at (x, y) = (1 - q/(1 + epsilon), -epsilon) for any positive epsilon but it leaves open the limit point epsilon = 0, which corresponds to approximately counting q-colorings of a planar graph.", "paper_title": "Inapproximability of the Tutte polynomial of a planar graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000310245900003"}
