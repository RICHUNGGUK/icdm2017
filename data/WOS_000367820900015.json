The separation of control and data planes in SDN demands the synergistic operation of the two entities for globally optimized performance. We identify the collaboration of the control plane and the data plane in software-defined optical transmission systems as a cyber-physical interdependency where the \"physical\" fiber network provides the \"cyber\" control network with means to distribute control and signaling messages and in turn is itself operated by these \"cyber\" control messages. We focus on the cyber-physical interdependency in SDN optical transmission from a network robustness perspective and characterize cascading failure behaviors. Our analysis suggests that topological properties pose a significant impact on failure extensibility. We further evaluate the effectiveness of optical layer reconfigurability in improving the resilience of SDN controlled optical transmission systems.", "paper_title": "Cyber-Physical Interdependency in Dynamic Software-Defined Optical Transmission Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000367820900015"}
