HDRI techniques have also been used to construct radiance maps in measurement applications; unfortunately, the design and evaluation of HDRI algorithms for use in these applications have received little attention. In this paper, we develop a novel HDRI technique based on pixel-by-pixel Kalman filtering and evaluate its performance using objective metrics that this paper also introduces. In the presented experiments, this new technique achieves as much as 9.4-dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and can achieve as much as a 29% improvement in radiometric accuracy over a classic method.", "paper_title": "A Kalman-Filtering Approach to High Dynamic Range Imaging for Measurement Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000300559700009"}
