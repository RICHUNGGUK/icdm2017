The proposed FAMDDA model is a conflict-resolving classifier that can perform stable and incremental learning while settling overlapping of hyper-rectangular prototypes of different classes in minimizing misclassification rates. The performance of FAMDDA is evaluated using a number of benchmark data sets. The results are analyzed and compared with those from FAM and a number of machine learning classifiers. The outcomes show that FAMDDA has a better generalization capability than FAM, and its performance is comparable with those from other classifiers. The effectiveness of FAMDDA is also demonstrated in an application pertaining to condition monitoring of a circulating water system in a power generation station. Implications on the effectiveness of FAMDDA from the application point of view are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
