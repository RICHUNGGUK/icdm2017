The popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) further amplifies this challenge, as we should authenticate these mobile tags in the partial-distributed-server environments. In this paper, we propose an RFID authentication scheme in the partial-distributed-server environments. The proposed scheme owns excellent performance in terms of computational complexity and scalability as well as security properties.", "paper_title": "RFID Authentication with Un-Traceability and Forward Secrecy in the Partial-Distributed-Server Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589800002"}
