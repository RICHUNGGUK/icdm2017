Cyclic-feature detectors, which make use of the cyclostationary signature of communication signals, are a promising lead to meet these requirements. This paper presents a new nonparametric cyclic-feature detector based on the Spatial Sign Cyclic Polyspectrum (SSCP) that detects single-carrier signals for the aforementioned scenarios. In addition to being nonparametric the new detector is also robust with respect to narrowband interferers.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric Cyclic Polyspectrum-Based Spectrum Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696500026"}
