Separable codes were introduced to detect colluders taking part in the averaging attack, which is the most feasible approach to perform a collusion attack. In this paper, we provide some improved bounds for the size of separable codes. Using a combinatorial technique named grouping coordinates, we have greatly reduced the upper bound. On the other hand, we also provide some lower bounds for the size of separable codes by both probabilistic and deterministic construction methods. In particular, 2-separable codes with asymptotically optimal rate are obtained by the deletion method.", "paper_title": "New Bounds on Separable Codes for Multimedia Fingerprinting", "paper_id": "WOS:000342415600013"}
