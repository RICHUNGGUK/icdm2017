Into this lacuna we launch the Open Source Network Tester, a fully open source traffic generator and capture system. Our prototype implementation on the NetFPGA-10G supports 4 x 10 Gb/s traffic generation across all packet sizes, and traffic capture is supported up to 2 x 10Gb/s with naive host software. Our system implementation provides methods for scaling and coordinating multiple generator/capture systems, and supports 6.25 ns timestamp resolution with clock drift and phase coordination maintained by GPS input. Additionally, our approach has demonstrated lower-cost than comparable commercial systems while achieving comparable levels of precision and accuracy; all within an open-source framework extensible with new features to support new applications, while permitting validation and review of the implementation.", "paper_title": "OSNT: Open Source Network Tester", "paper_id": "WOS:000345579700003"}
