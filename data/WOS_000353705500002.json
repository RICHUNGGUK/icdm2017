Linear supply rates and L-1-gain notations are introduced to analyse the performance of the underlying systems. Stability with a weighted L-1-gain for autonomous systems are solved by using multiple linear copositive Lyapunov functions incorporated with the average dwell time approach. Then, state-feedback and output-feedback controllers are designed to guarantee the stabilisation with a weighted L-1-gain for non-autonomous systems. All present conditions are solvable in terms of linear programming. Finally, a practical example is given to illustrate the validity of theoretical findings.", "paper_title": "L-1-gain analysis and control synthesis of positive switched systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000353705500002"}
