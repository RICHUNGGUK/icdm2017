The data were collected by document analysis, expert interview, and Delphi technique surveys. The Delphi technique involved three questionnaire surveys of field experts and scholars followed by Kendall coefficient of concordance analysis to evaluate the Chi-Square value and examine the consistency of respondent opinions to check the items whether reach the level of significance. Further, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-sample test examined working competence items using 31 items divided into 7 domains. The survey items were selected according to consensus opinions of 10 experts by Delphi survey technique. The findings of this study provide guidelines for assessing professional working competence for mechatronics by applying graphical monitoring and control systems. The research findings reveal the practical competency requirements for students in a technology institute program, and a relevant curriculum is suggested. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
