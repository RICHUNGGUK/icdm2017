Starting from an organizational information-processing perspective, we have developed the Virtual Team Alliance, a computational model of project participants' information-processing behavior. The model produces 2 measures of efficiency-project duration and cost-and 3 measures of work process quality-problem-solving quality, coordination quality; and decision-making quality. In addition to providing a project manager with measures to support specific and detailed organizational design decisions involving trade-offs between efficiency and work process quality, our model predicts organizational risks that might adversely affect project performance. Users can identify and test feasible and useful interventions to mitigate organizational risks contingently. We prospectively applied our model early in the development process of an industrial project team within the aerospace industry. Our model forecasted backlogs arising from extra coordination and rework and the resulting problems that might occur without organizational change. Based on simulations and analysis of our model, we made specific recommendations to the project manager for improving work process performance. After considering our recommendations, the cooperating manager intervened in the engineering process to reduce some of the organizational risks that we predicted might adversely affect project performance. In our subsequent observations of the project, the potential organizational risks that our model had initially identified as being likely to affect project performance adversely were avoided by the manager's intervention.", "paper_title": "Designing quality into project organizations through computational organizational simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000246860800001"}
