This might be due to the fact that the compact formulation proposed in [Altin et al. Networks 49 (2007), 100-115] turned out to be very tight, that is, showing very little or no integrality gap in the computational experiments. In this short note, we first confirm the observations in [Altin et al. Networks 49 (2007), 100-115] by analyzing in detail the behavior of the compact formulation on a larger but similar testbed, and then we provide a set of difficult instances exposing large integrality gaps. This new insight is likely to reinvigorate efforts to develop effective exact computational approaches.
