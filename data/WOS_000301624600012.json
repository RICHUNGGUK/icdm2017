A practical problem of the method is the time-consuming computation related to its iterative procedure. This paper describes a way of accelerating the computation by replacing an exhaustive grid search for the optimal stress tensor by direct calculation using an analytical solution. Furthermore, a technique to reduce noise in the result was developed based on the estimation of instabilities of solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
