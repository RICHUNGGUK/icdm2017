In both problems the optimal value can be approximated by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations, in the spirit of the moment approach developed in Lasserre (SIAM J Optim 11:796-817, 2001; Math Program B 112:65-92, 2008). This provides a unified approach and a class of algorithms to compute Nash equilibria and min-max strategies of several static and dynamic games. Each semidefinite relaxation can be solved in time which is polynomial in its input size and practice on a sample of experiments reveals that few relaxations are needed for a good approximation (and sometimes even for finite convergence), a behavior similar to what was observed in polynomial optimization.", "paper_title": "Semidefinite programming for min-max problems and games", "paper_id": "WOS:000299180900013"}
