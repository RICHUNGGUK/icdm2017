To jointly optimize mobile clients' expense and energy consumption in such a non-cooperative environment, based on game theory, we present an intelligent wireless data access scheme called EPGA to address the issue of energy and expense optimization. In EPGA, the shared data items among the mobile clients are seen as public resources, and the expense and energy consumed by selfish clients for sending request messages are formulated as their cost. By comparing the utilities received through sending the request message at different time intervals, EPGA can help each client independently make the strategy of sending the request message, so as to save the energy and expense without violating the time-constraint requirement of their queries. We conduct the symmetric Nash Equilibrium strategy for the clients to achieve fairness, and also compare EPGA with other schemes by experiments. The EPGA approach shows its effectiveness in joint optimization of energy and expense among the mobile clients, especially the ones far away from the data server.", "paper_title": "Distance-Aware Approach for Time-Constraint Wireless Data Querying Based on Game Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000345497200013"}
