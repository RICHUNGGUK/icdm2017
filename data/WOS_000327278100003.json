However, existing schemes suffer a low generation rate and a low entropy, and mainly rely on nodes' mobility. To overcome this limitation, we present a key generation protocol with known artificial interference, named SmokeGrenade, a new physical-layer approach for secret key generation in a narrowband fading channel. Our scheme utilizes artificial interference to contribute to the change of measured values on channel states. Our theoretical analysis shows that the key generation rate increases with the increment of the interference power. Particularly, the achievable key rate of SmokeGrenade gains three times better than that of the traditional key generation schemes when the average interference power is normalized to 1. Simulation results also demonstrate that SmokeGrenade achieves a higher generation rate and entropy compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "SmokeGrenade: An Efficient Key Generation Protocol With Artificial Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000327278100003"}
