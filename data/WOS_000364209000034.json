For real-time embedded systems, worst case execution time (WCET) is more important than average-case performance. We address the problem of allocating program data variables between main memory and SPM to minimize the energy consumption due to data variable accesses, while respecting a given upper bound on a program's WCET. We present an optimal branch-and-bound algorithm; and an efficient heuristic algorithm. Our approach provides a flexible framework for the designer to perform tradeoff analysis between the program WCET and the energy consumption based on application requirements.", "paper_title": "WCET-Aware Energy-Efficient Data Allocation on Scratchpad Memory for Real-Time Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000034"}
