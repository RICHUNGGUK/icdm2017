Jitter is analyzed by considering separate and combined components. The primary goal is the generation of a signal containing a known amount of each jitter component. This signal can then be used for testing high speed serial data channels. Initially, jitter components are analyzed and modeled individually. Next, sequences for combining them are modeled, simulated and evaluated. Model simulation using Matlab is utilized to show the unique features of the components when they are combined into different injection sequences for producing the total jitter. Sequence dependency is investigated in depth and the validity of superposition of jitter components for typical values is confirmed. A good agreement between theory and simulation is verified; these results allow test engineers to have an insight into the interactions among jitter components in serial data channels.", "paper_title": "Analysis and simulation of jitter sequences for testing serial data channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000256404500007"}
