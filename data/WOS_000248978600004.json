The close relationship between Kruppa equations and Poncelet's Porism is investigated, leading, in particular, to a closed-form geometrically meaningful parameterization of the set of Euclidean reconstructions compatible with two images taken with cameras with constant intrinsic parameters and known pixel shape. An experiment with real images, showing the applicability of the method, is included.", "paper_title": "Conic geometry and autocalibration from two images", "paper_id": "WOS:000248978600004"}
