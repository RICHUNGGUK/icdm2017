The fally-informed (FI) protocol proposed in the literature is known as the best CIC protocol so far. Such a protocol is originally designed according to the classical indexing strategy. In this paper, we show how to apply the FI protocol to another improved indexing strategy, called lazy indexing strategy in the context. The lazy-indexing version of such a protocol can reduce number of forced checkpoints for a distributed computation with the lazy indexing strategy. Particularly, the management of a boolean array in FI's control information carried on a message must be modified. Finally, we present a simulation experiment to analyze the impact of such a modification.", "paper_title": "Applying the fully-informed checkpointing protocol to the lazy indexing strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000249934900020"}
