Self-optimization, as a critical functionality of self-organization, employs a decentralized paradigm to dynamically adapt the varying environmental circumstances while without relying on centralized control or human intervention. In this paper, we present comprehensive surveys of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) and investigate the enhanced self-optimization models. Self-optimization approaches such as dynamic mobile access network selection, spectrum resource allocation and power control for HetNets, etc., are surveyed and compared, with possible methodologies to achieve self-optimization summarized. We hope this survey paper can provide the insight and the roadmap for future research efforts in the self- optimization of convergence networks.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Self-optimization Approaches for HetNets", "paper_id": "WOS:000358995800001"}
