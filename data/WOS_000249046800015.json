This is a frequency approach in which the low-frequency part is obtained through a classical technique while the medium-frequency part is handled through the Variational Theory of Complex Rays (VTCR) initially introduced for vibrations. The aim of this paper is to show the capabilities of the method for transient analyses of complex engineering structures submitted to impact loadings. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
