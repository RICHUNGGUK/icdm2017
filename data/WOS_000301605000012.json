The existing classification techniques are mainly based on statistical analysis and modeling approaches. This paper presents a classification technique based on combinatory and Boolean theory. It is shown that LAD is particularly suitable for detecting the state of equipment because of its new way of pre-processing noisy and missing data. A numerical example and an application are presented.", "paper_title": "LAD-CBM; new data processing tool for diagnosis and prognosis in condition-based maintenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000301605000012"}
