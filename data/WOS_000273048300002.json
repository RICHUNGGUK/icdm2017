This lifetime depends naturally on the rate at which energy is consumed; however, it also depends on the usage pattern of the battery. Continuous drawing of a high current results in an excessive drop of residual capacity. However, during intervals with no or very small currents, batteries do recover to a certain extent. The usage pattern of a device can be well modelled with stochastic workload models. However, one still needs a battery model to describe the effects of the power consumption on the state of the battery. Over the years many different types of battery models have been developed for different application areas. In this study we give a detailed analysis of two well-known analytical models, the kinetic battery model (KiBaM) and the so-called diffusion model. We show that the KiBaM is actually an approximation of the more complex diffusion model; this was not known previously. Furthermore, we tested the suitability of these models for performance evaluation purposes, and found that both models are well suited for doing battery lifetime predictions. However, one should not draw conclusions on what is the best usage pattern based on only a few workload traces.", "paper_title": "Which battery model to use?", "paper_id": "WOS:000273048300002"}
