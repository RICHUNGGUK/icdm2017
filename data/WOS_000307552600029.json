Compared with the existing literature, this paper removes the commonly used assumption that the interconnections are bounded by known functions multiplying unknown parameters, and all unknown interconnections are lumped in a suitable function which is compensated by only a neural network in each subsystem. So, the controller is simpler even than that for the strict-feedback systems described by the ordinary differential equation. Moreover, the circle criterion is applied to designing nonlinear observers for the estimates of system states. A simulation example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of control scheme proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Decentralized backstepping output-feedback control for stochastic interconnected systems with time-varying delays using neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552600029"}
