This approach is not in line with the ETSI guidelines, which state that the coverage and capacity of a UMTS system must be evaluated when the system is working with a given fraction of satisfied users. In this paper, we present an analytical model capable of taking into account user satisfaction. A comparison between analytical and simulation results confirms the validity of the proposed model. In addition, we discuss coverage-capacity curves as a function of the percentage of satisfied users, taking into account also the imperfections of the real power-control procedures.", "paper_title": "An analytical model based on the ETSI criteria for the evaluation of user satisfaction in UMTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137900011"}
