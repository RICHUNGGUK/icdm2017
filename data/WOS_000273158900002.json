Our aim is to analyze this process when the underlying graph is the complete graph on n vertices lying in [0,1] (d) , and edge set weighted with the Euclidean distance. The height of the binary tree explaining the merging process is proved to be I similar to(n) on average. On the way to the proof, we obtain similar results for the complete graph and the d-dimensional square lattice with i.i.d. edge weights.", "paper_title": "Note on the Structure of Kruskal's Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000273158900002"}
