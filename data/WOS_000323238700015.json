Many attempts have been made to address this issue that ranges from taking medication to doing exercise to following a diet plan to playing games. Few approaches combine exercise and game to engage the obese people in playing fun-based games or purposeful games, also known as serious games, while monitoring their bio-signals. However, existing work hardly provides a configurable, scalable and context-aware serious game framework that can be used as a support for obesity treatment. In this paper, we take an attempt to propose such a framework. The proposed framework facilitates bio-signal monitoring based on body sensor network, context-awareness based on pervasive sensors, and on-the-spot activity recommendation based on current game-playing context. It uses the cloud computing platform as infrastructural support that ensures the scalability of the framework. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed framework, we developed a sample serious game; deploy it over a cloud platform; and experiment with it by capturing some psycho-physical data while the obese are engaged in game-play. We observed that the obese people were very much engaged in game-play and they had positive experience using the system.", "paper_title": "A Cloud-Based Pervasive Serious Game Framework to Support Obesity Treatment", "paper_id": "WOS:000323238700015"}
