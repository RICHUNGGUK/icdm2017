Renewable energy sources are characterized by a fluctuating and intermittent nature, which simply means that energy may be available when it is not needed, and vice versa. Energy storage devices can help rectify the mismatch between generation and demand at any loading condition. Such devices can also provide some ancillary services, such as frequency regulation, voltage support, power quality improvement, transmission congestion relief, and system upgrade deferral. This paper presents an overview of the flywheel as a promising energy storage element. Electrical machines used with flywheels are surveyed along with their control techniques. Loss minimization and bearing system development are introduced. In addition, power system applications of flywheels are summarized. Finally, some outstanding technical difficulties are recommended for future research work.", "paper_title": "Energy Storage in Flywheels: An Overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000356700300014"}
