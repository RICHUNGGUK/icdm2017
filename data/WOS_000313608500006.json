Basically, it corresponds to a kernel discriminant analysis computed from a kernel on a graph together with a class betweenness measure. As for standard discriminant analysis, the projected nodes are maximally separated with respect to the ratio of between-class inertia on total inertia - the distances being computed according to the kernel. The visualization of various graphs shows that the resulting display conveys useful information. Moreover, semi-supervised classification experiments indicate that the discriminant analysis indeed extracts relevant node features that are able to classify unlabeled nodes with competing performance.
