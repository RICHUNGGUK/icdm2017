This system can be integrated with different HPC cluster middleware, such as Batch-Queuing Systems or Cloud Management Systems, and can also use different mechanisms for powering on and off the computing nodes. The presented system makes it possible to implement different energy-saving policies depending on the priorities and particularities of the cluster. It also provides a hook system to extend the functionality, and a sensor system in order to take into account environmental information. The paper describes the successful integration of the system proposed with some popular Batch-Queuing Systems, and also with some Cloud Management middlewares, presenting two real use-cases that show significant energy/costs savings of 27% and 17%.
