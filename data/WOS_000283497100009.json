Voltage impulses are transmitted along two wires and the signals are considered as predicate expressions. The developed simple gates and components perform the predicate logical operations AND, NOT, and OR with these expressions. For design and verification of all components and the processor, the CPLD and FPGA boards and corresponding software are used. The designed processor is compatible with classical computers and applicable in the area of artificial intelligence as well as linguistic calculations, database machines, SQL servers, etc.", "paper_title": "PREDICATE GATES, COMPONENTS AND A PROCESSOR FOR SPATIAL LOGIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000283497100009"}
