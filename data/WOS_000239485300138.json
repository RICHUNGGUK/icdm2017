But due to its intrinsic linear character, it performs badly in nonlinear process monitoring. Kernel PCA (KPCA) can extract useful information in nonlinear data. However KPCA-based monitoring is not suitable for on-line monitoring because of large calculation and much memory occupation. The paper introduces an on-line monitoring method based on KPCA and neural network (NN), where KPCA is used to extract nonlinear principal components (PCs) and then NN approximates the relationship between process data and nonlinear PCs. We can obtain nonlinear PCs by NN to compute the monitoring indices and then achieve the on-line monitoring. The case study shows the validity of the method.", "paper_title": "On-line nonlinear process monitoring using kernel principal component analysis and neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300138"}
