Research in intrusion detection systems aims to reduce the impact of these attacks. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of Intrusion Response Systems (IRS) and Intrusion Risk Assessment (IRA), two important components of an intrusion detection solution. We achieve this by classifying a number of studies published during the last two decades. We discuss the key features of existing IRS and IRA. We show how characterizing security risks and choosing the right countermeasures are an important and challenging part of designing an IRS and an IRA. Poorly designed IRS and IRA may reduce network performance and wrongly disconnect users from a network. We propose techniques on how to address these challenges and highlight the need for a comprehensive defense mechanism approach. We believe that this taxonomy will open up interesting areas for future research in the growing field of intrusion risk assessment and response systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
