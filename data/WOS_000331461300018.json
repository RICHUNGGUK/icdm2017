In recent years, ray tracing based propagation prediction algorithms have been successfully used in prediction of indoor radio propagation. Even though these algorithms have its own noticeable benefits, it suffers from lack of accuracy and sluggish performance. To overcome these shortcomings, a new three dimensional (3D) ray tracing algorithm is presented here. This algorithm is based on balanced Binary Space Partitioning (BSP). For optimization purposes, novel concepts of Nearest Object Priority (NOP) and In Contact Surface (ICS) are combined with this BSP. Using of BSP as well as optimization techniques make the algorithm faster and more accurate. The obtained results show that, among all of the scenarios of five considered environments, the maximum accuracy increase can be 87.27% and the maximum computation time reduction can be 33.60% than the existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "An Enhanced Binary Space Partitioning Algorithm for Indoor Radio Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000331461300018"}
