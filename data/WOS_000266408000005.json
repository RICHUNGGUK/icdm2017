However, the models favored by existing synthesis approaches are not sufficiently expressive to describe both universal constraints provided by requirements and existential statements provided by scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel synthesis technique that constructs behavior models in the form of Modal Transition Systems (MTS) from a combination of safety properties and scenarios. MTSs distinguish required, possible, and proscribed behavior, and their elaboration not only guarantees the preservation of the properties and scenarios used for synthesis but also supports further elicitation of new requirements.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Partial Behavior Models from Properties and Scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000266408000005"}
