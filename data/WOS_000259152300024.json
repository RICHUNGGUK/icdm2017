The adaptive antenna in an optimal radiation pattern design can adjustably suppress interference by placing nulls at the interfering source directions and provide a maximum main lobe in the direction of the desired signal at the same time. The proposed method maximizes the Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR). The memetic algorithm is applied to find the optimal radiation pattern for the proposed adaptive antenna using a two-way convergent method. The memetic algorithm combines the advantages of efficient heuristics incorporating domain knowledge and population-based search approaches for optimization problems. This study shows the usefulness of a memetic algorithm for global search and flexible stopping criteria. The memetic algorithm is an easy and effective approach that can be used to search for the optimal phase weighting vector of the adaptive array factor. Two examples are provided to justify the proposed memetic algorithm approach. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using simulations and experimental data.", "paper_title": "Optimal radiation pattern design of adaptive linear phased array antenna using memetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300024"}
