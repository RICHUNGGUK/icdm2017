The language adopts a declarative paradigm, wherein users may concern themselves solely with the relations between the models rather than needing to deal explicitly with issues such as order of rule execution and pattern searching/traversal of input models. In this paper, we demonstrate the language using a provided example and highlight a number of language features used in solving the problem, a simple object-to-relational mapping.", "paper_title": "Practical declarative model transformation with Tekfat", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807000015"}
