This paper presents a QoS based storage model for effective client negotiation in terms of performance, cost and reliability. Clients can create their own profile with respect to certain QoS attributes in order to specify their profile and requirements. A QoS negotiation model is proposed based on an available disk simulator which is experimented under artificial request workload towards proposing improved system's responsiveness, performance and functionality. Certain remarks and conclusions are raised with respect to meeting the clients's QoS requirements under the negotiated scheduling algorithms, the redundancy scheme and the capacity available to the client's environment according to the client's QoS requirements.
