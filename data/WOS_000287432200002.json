It provides support for a broad set of users, with distinct knowledge about the online triggering system, ranging from casual testers to final system deployers. This level of automatization improves the overall ATLAS TDAQ work flow for software and hardware tests and speeds-up system modifications and deployment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
