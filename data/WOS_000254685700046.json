A partitioned approach using a volume spline solution procedure is applied for the coupling of fluid dynamics and structural dynamics codes. For comparative study, two commercial packages for combustion and structural analysis are used. Results of numerical investigations of FSI between unsteady flow and vibrating liner in a combustion chamber are presented and show good agreement with experimental data.
