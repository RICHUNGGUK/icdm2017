XML warehousing imposes challenges, which are not found in the relational data warehouses. In this paper, we firstly present a framework to build an XML data warehouse schema. For the purpose of scalability due to the increase of data volume, we propose a number of partitioning techniques for multi-version XML data warehouses, including document based partitioning, schema based partitioning, and cascaded (mixed) partitioning model. Finally, we formulate cost models to evaluate various types of queries for an XML data warehouse.", "paper_title": "Partitioning methods for multi-version XML data warehouses", "paper_id": "WOS:000263976900004"}
