These components include a commonly used patch antenna and a bandpass filter operating at 35 GHz. The components have the advantages of easier fabrication and feeding compared with the commonly used traditional components operating at fundamental frequencies. The harmonic components are also used to build an antenna array. Good performance is obtained from these harmonic components in comparison with the traditional components.", "paper_title": "A new class of harmonic components for millimeter-wave applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000251648900008"}
