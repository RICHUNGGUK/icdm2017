We model the features of perceptually identical media as ANNs in the feature set and show that ANN indexing can well meet the robustness and discrimination requirements of feature quantization. A feature quantization algorithm is then developed by exploiting the random-projection based ANN indexing. For performance study, the distortion tolerance and randomness of the quantizer are analytically derived. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed work is superior to state-of-the-art quantizers, and its random nature can provide robust hashing with security against hash forgery.", "paper_title": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Based Feature Quantization Algorithm for Robust Hashing", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146300046"}
