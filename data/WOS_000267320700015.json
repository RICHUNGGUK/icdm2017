The proposed model considers unrelated parallel machines. The jobs have non-identical due dates and ready times, and there are some precedence relations between them. Furthermore, sequence-dependent setup times, which are included in the proposed model, may be different for each machine depending on their characteristics. Obtaining an optimal solution for this type of complex, large-sized problem in reasonable computational time using traditional approaches or optimization tools is extremely difficult This paper proposes an efficient genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the bi-objective parallel machine scheduling problem. The performance of the presented model and the proposed CA is verified by a number of numerical experiments. The related results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and CA for small and large-sized problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
