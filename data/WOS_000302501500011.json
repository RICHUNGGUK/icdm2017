The numerical scheme is designed to solve the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations and an evolution equation for the surfactant concentration in the bulk phase, and simultaneously, an evolution equation for the surfactant concentration on the interface. Second-order isoparametric finite elements on moving meshes and second-order isoparametric surface finite elements are used to solve these equations. The interface-resolved moving meshes allow the accurate incorporation of surface forces, Marangoni forces and jumps in the material parameters. The lower-dimensional finite-element meshes for solving the surface evolution equation are part of the interface-resolved moving meshes. The numerical scheme is validated for problems with known analytical solutions. A number of computations to study the influence of the surfactants in 3D-axisymmetric rising bubbles have been performed. The proposed scheme shows excellent conservation of fluid mass and of the total mass of the surfactant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
