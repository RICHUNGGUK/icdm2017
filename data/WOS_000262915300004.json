Inspired by Gold's notion of limiting recursion and by the Limit-Computable Mathematics by Hayashi, we investigate the idea of learning in the limit in the general case, where both guess retraction and resumption are allowed. The main contribution is the characterization of the limits of non-monotonic learning sequences in terms of the extension relation between guesses. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
