The necessity of approaching the boundary between the feasible and infeasible search space for many constrained optimization problems is a paramount challenge for every constraint-handling technique. Our proposed technique precisely focuses the search on the boundary region and can be either used alone or in combination with other constraint-handling techniques depending on the type and number of problem constraints. For validation purposes, an ant algorithm is adopted as our search engine. We compare our proposed approach with respect to constraint-handling techniques that are representative of the state-of-the-art in constrained evolutionary optimization using a set of standard test functions.", "paper_title": "Boundary search for constrained numerical optimization problems in ACO algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100010"}
