An important aspect of visual realism is real-time processing of transparent objects. In order to provide a realistic solution to be considered for future graphics cards, proposed extensions to the hardware need to be small. In this paper, we propose two new hardware oriented proposals for computing order independent transparency for any number of layers. The first proposal is based on the precomputation of the contribution factor of each element to the final colour of the pixel. This permits the evaluation of the transparent objects without requiring their previous sorting. The second proposal is based on the utilization of a pre-sorting stage so that the transparent objects are organized in a back to front order. In both proposals, time requirements are reduced with respect to previous solutions.", "paper_title": "Hardware oriented algorithms for rendering order-independent transparency", "paper_id": "WOS:000235771500007"}
