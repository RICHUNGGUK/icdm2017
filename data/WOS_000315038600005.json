In this paper, a new approach for feature selection is proposed for writer-independent (WI) off-line SV. First, one or more preexisting techniques are employed to extract features at different scales. Multiple feature extraction increases the diversity of information produced from signature images, allowing to produce signature representations that mitigate intra-personal variability. Dichotomy transformation is then applied in the resulting feature space to allow for WI classification. This alleviates the challenges of designing off-line SV systems with a limited number of reference signatures from a large number of users. Finally, boosting feature selection is used to design low-cost classifiers that automatically select relevant features while training. Using this global WI feature selection approach allows to explore and select from large feature sets based on knowledge of a population of users. Experiments performed with real-world SV data comprised of random, simple, and skilled forgeries indicate that the proposed approach provides a high level of performance when extended shadow code and directional probability density function features are extracted at multiple scales. Comparing simulation results to those of off-line SV systems found in literature confirms the viability of the new approach, even when few reference signatures are available. Moreover, it provides an efficient framework for designing a wide range of biometric systems from limited samples with few or no counterexamples, but where new training samples emerge during operations.", "paper_title": "Multi-feature extraction and selection in writer-independent off-line signature verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000315038600005"}
