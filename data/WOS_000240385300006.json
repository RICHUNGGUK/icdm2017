In this paper, we propose a sports image classification system that properly classifies sports images into one of eight classes. The proposed system uses normalized MPEG-7 visual descriptors as the input of the neural network system. The experimental results show that the MPEG-7 descriptorscan be used as the main feature of image classification system.", "paper_title": "A novel approach in sports image classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300006"}
