In this case, to remain connected to the group, the leader-agent (LA) must perform an active leading strategy. In this paper, an active leading algorithm is proposed which monitors the neighborhood of the LA and adjusts its velocity. The algorithm is based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) technique. As a real time optimization package, the ACO algorithm maximizes influence of the LA on the group, leading to fast flocking. Comparison with another optimization method is provided as well. Simulations show that the algorithm is successful and cost effective. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
