One of the key challenges in object-oriented design is how to apply appropriate design patterns during the system development. In this paper, design pattern is analyzed from different perspectives to see how it can facilitate design activities, handle non-functional requirement, solve design problems and resolve design conflicts. Based on the analysis, various kinds of applicability of design patterns are explored and integrated with a goal-driven approach to guiding developers to construct the object-oriented design model in a systematic manner. There are three benefits to the proposed approach: making it easy to meet requirements, helping resolve design conflicts, and facilitating improvement of the design quality.", "paper_title": "Object-oriented design: A goal-driven and pattern-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000261289000005"}
