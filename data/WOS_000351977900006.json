There are no clear results regarding short term therapy with low concentrations of O-2 in hypoxemic patients. We seek to demonstrate, by measuring the characteristics of drawing, these effects on psychomotor function of hypoxemic patients treated with O-2. Methods: Eight patients (7/1) M/F, age 69.5 (9.9) yr, mean (SD) with hypoxemia (P-a O-2 62.2 (6.9) mmHg) performed two drawings of pictures. Tests were performed before and after 30 min breathing with O-2. Results: Stroke velocity increased after O-2 for the house drawing (i.e. velocity 27.6 (5.5) mm/s basal, 30.9 (7.1) mm/s with O-2, mean (SD), p < 0.025, Wilcoxon test). The drawing time 'down' or fraction time the pen is touching the paper during the drawing phase decreased (i.e. time down 20.7 (6.6) s basal, 17.4 (6.3) s with O-2, p < 0.017, Wilcoxon test). Conclusions: This study shows that in patients with chronic hypoxemia, a short period of oxygen therapy produces changes in psychomotor function that can be measured by means of drawing analysis.
