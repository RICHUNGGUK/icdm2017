In that context, this paper presents a framework for visual text mining to support exploration of both general structure and relevant topics within a textual document collection. Our approach starts by building a visualization from the text data set. On top of that, a novel technique is presented that generates and filters association rules to detect and display topics from a group of documents. Results have shown a very consistent match between topics extracted using this approach to those actually present in the data set. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
