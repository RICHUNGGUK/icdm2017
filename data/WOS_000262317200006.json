Within the broad applications of algorithm visualization, there still remain performance issues that deserve further research, e. g., system portability, collaboration capability, and animation effect in 3D environments. Using modern technologies of Java programming, we develop an algorithm visualization and debugging system, dubbed GeoBuilder, for geometric computing. The GeoBuilder system features Java's promising portability, engagement of collaboration in algorithm development, and automatic camera positioning for tracking 3D geometric objects. In this paper, we describe the design of the GeoBuilder system and demonstrate its applications.", "paper_title": "GeoBuilder: A Geometric Algorithm Visualization and Debugging System for 2D and 3D Geometric Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000262317200006"}
