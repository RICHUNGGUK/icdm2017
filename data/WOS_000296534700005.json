We also formalize conditions for security for certificateless partially-blind signature schemes. We also present a practical certificateless partially-blind signature scheme to make electronic cash untraceable. We prove the scheme to be unforgeable in the face of message attacks under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
