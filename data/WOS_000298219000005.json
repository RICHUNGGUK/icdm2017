Two methods of constructing visual codebook ensembles are proposed in this study. The first technique introduces diverse individual visual codebooks using different clustering algorithms. The second uses various visual codebooks of different sizes for constructing an ensemble with high diversity. Codebook ensembles are trained to capture and convey image properties from different aspects. Based on these codebook ensembles, different types of image representations can be acquired. A classifier ensemble can be trained based on different expression datasets from the same training image set. The use of a classifier ensemble to categorize new images can lead to improved performance. Detailed experimental analysis on a Pascal VOC challenge dataset reveals that the present ensemble approach performs well, consistently improves the performance of visual object classifiers, and results in state-of-the-art performance in categorization.
