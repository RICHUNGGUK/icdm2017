The proposed scheme estimates the channel state by using the condition number and then the number of layers for the QRD-M is changed according to the condition number of channel. After the number of layers is determined, the proposed scheme performs the combined QRD-M and CLLL. Simulation results show that the BER curves of the proposed scheme and QRD-M using CLLL have similar performance. However, the complexity of the proposed scheme is about 27% less than QRD-M detection using CLLL.", "paper_title": "Channel-Adaptive Detection Scheme Based on Threshold in MIMO-OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784300028"}
