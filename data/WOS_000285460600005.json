This paper examines how cognitive radios initially find one another among the expanse of ever-changing open spectrum, termed the rendezvous problem. Specifically, it addresses the problem of rendezvous under varying levels of system capabilities, spectrum policies, and environmental conditions. The focus is on rendezvous when there are are no control channels or centralized controllers, which we term the blind rendezvous problem. Under these conditions, a sequence-based and modular clock blind rendezvous algorithms are proposed, and it is shown that the performance of these algorithms compares favorably to that of a random blind rendezvous algorithm. Specifically, the sequence-based algorithm provides a bounded Time To Rendezvous (TTR) and the ability to prioritize channels where rendezvous is more likely to occur; the modular clock algorithm reduces the expected TTR, requires little precoordination among radios attempting to rendezvous, and is robust to radios sensing different sets of available channels.", "paper_title": "Rendezvous for Cognitive Radios", "paper_id": "WOS:000285460600005"}
