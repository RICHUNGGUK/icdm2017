The nonlinear strategy we implement is categorized as a kernel method, but solving large-scale instances of the resulting optimization problem in a direct manner is computationally intractable in the literature. In order to overcome this difficulty, we employ a dimensionality reduction technique which is often used in principal component analysis. Numerical experiments show that our strategy works not only to reduce the computation time, but also to improve out-of-sample investment performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
