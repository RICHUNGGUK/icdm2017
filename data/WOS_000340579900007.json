First, we consider unbounded Toffli gates as additional gates and deal with the weak simulation, i.e., sampling the output probability distribution. We show that there exists a constant-depth quantum circuit with only one unbounded Toffoli gate that is not weakly simulatable, unless BQP subset of PostBPP boolean AND AM. Then, we consider unbounded fan-out gates as additional gates and deal with the strong simulation, i.e., computing the output probability. We show that there exists a constant-depth quantum circuit with only two unbounded fan-out gates that is not strongly simulatable, unless P = PP. These results are in contrast to the fact that any constant-depth quantum circuit without additional gates on an unbounded number of qubits is strongly and weakly simulatable.", "paper_title": "HARDNESS OF CLASSICALLY SIMULATING QUANTUM CIRCUITS WITH UNBOUNDED TOFFOLI AND FAN-OUT GATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579900007"}
