However, although technically feasible, it is not clear that there are valid methodologies for the use of web-based group decision support (wGDSS). Many approaches to decision support are driven by the perspective of a single decision maker. Yet there are many reasons to expect that the extension of individualistic theories to a group context will be fraught with difficulty. This paper explores these issues and considers the way forward for the design and use of wGDSS and for a more substantive approach to participative e-democracy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
