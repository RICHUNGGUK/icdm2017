This paper presents a new secure transmission for big data based on nested sparse sampling and coprime sampling. With nested sampling and coprime sampling, besides the advantage of higher spectrum efficiency, big data could also achieve higher power spectral density for binary frequency shift keying (BFSK) signal. When the sampling spacing pairs are big enough, the spectrum of BFSK signal performs like frequency hopping. This property has great advantage in the security of big data collection and transmission using FH/BFSK, as it could achieve low error probability. With the same multitone interfering signal added to FH/BFSK, the error probability becomes much lower using nested sampling and coprime sampling compared with the original FH/BFSK signal. This proves that both nested sampling and coprime sampling could be used in big data transmission to resist interference, while guaranteeing the transmission performance.
