This system includes several modules, namely: user management, subject management, classification management, question entry, question management, paper generation, and paper management. The design process performs the analysis and composes the examination paper using an efficient algorithm with a high possibility of success. With this algorithm, the user needs to identify the subject, the question type and the difficulty level. From this input, the examination paper will be generated automatically. On the basis of a study of the JSP and Microsoft Word interface, we find that the system combines with Word very well. Therefore the editing of questions and answers is performed using Word and the final paper may be stored as \".doc'' files. The system has characteristics such as easy operation, a good interface, good usability, high security, high stability, and reliability. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
