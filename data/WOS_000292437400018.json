Commonly used types of games devices were grouped into three main categories: large-screen/TV-based games, small handheld game devices and active game devices. A survey was conducted among 476 students in a local primary school, with 258 males and 205 females in the age range of 8-13. A self-reported questionnaire was administered at the school and students reported on the frequency and duration of play with eight types of common electronic game devices in the past month and any bodily discomforts associated with this activity. The results showed that use of several game devices (as many as 3-5 types) were common, with about 40% of the respondents being weekly users and 18% daily users. The design of the different electronic game controllers may affect the postures and muscle loading in the body in different ways, and prolonged exposure can lead to musculoskeletal symptoms. Nearly one third of the respondents (28.9%) reported some bodily discomfort associated with electronic game use. Neck discomfort was most commonly reported, followed by shoulders and fingers. Use of more than 2 h daily of small-screen handheld game devices significantly increased the risk of developing bodily discomfort in any region with an odds ratio of 4.75. The present results have highlighted the importance of monitoring primary school children's exposure to electronic games, especially with small handheld devices, as this may have adverse effect on their musculoskeletal health.
