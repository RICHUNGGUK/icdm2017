Furthermore, it becomes more difficult to deal with on the emerging heterogeneous PC cluster environments. In this paper, we propose a performance-based scheme, which dynamically partitions loop iterations according to the performance ratio of cluster nodes. To verify our approach, a heterogeneous cluster is built, and two kinds of application programs are implemented to be executed in this testbed. Experimental results show that our approach performs better than traditional schemes.", "paper_title": "A dynamic partitioning self-scheduling scheme for parallel loops on heterogeneous clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200107"}
