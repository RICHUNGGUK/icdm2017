Positioning error measurement and compensation based on 2D vision system is a cost-effective way to improve the positioning accuracy in robotic drilling. In this paper, we first discuss the principle of error measurement and compensation with a 2D vision system for robotic drilling and the determination of tool center point of the vision system so that the Abbe errors are eliminated in the measurement process. Measurement errors due to nonideal measurement conditions, i.e. nonperpendicularity of the camera optical axis to the workpiece surface and incorrect object distance, are mathematically modeled and experimentally verified. A method utilizing four laser displacement sensors is proposed to ensure perpendicularity of the camera optical axis to the workpiece surface and correct object distance in the measurement process, and hence to achieve high accuracy in 2D vision-based measurement. Experiments performed on a robotic drilling system show that the 2D vision system can achieve an accuracy of approximately 0.1 mm with the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
