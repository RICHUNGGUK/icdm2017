It integrates the knowledge of 230 reviews that were carefully checked by specialists for their accuracy and then converted to 230 dynamic mathematical pathway models. MACPAK comprises a total of 24 009 entities and 12 774 processes and is described in the Cell System Markup Language (CSML), an XML format that runs on the Cell Illustrator platform and can be visualized with a customized Cytoscape for further analysis.", "paper_title": "Systems biology model repository for macrophage pathway simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000291062400027"}
