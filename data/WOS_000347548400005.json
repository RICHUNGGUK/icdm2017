The plans are proposed when the standard deviation of the normal distribution is known or unknown. The plan parameters for both cases are determined such that the given producer's risk and consumer's risk are satisfied. The proposed plan includes the ordinary variable single sampling plan as a special case and its advantage over the single sampling plan is discussed in terms of the sample size. Extensive tables are provided for industrial use.", "paper_title": "A new lot inspection procedure based on exponentially weighted moving average", "paper_id": "WOS:000347548400005"}
