To attract consumer interest, a multi-standard design on a single device is the trend of current audio decoder development. This paper presents a configurable common filterbank processor (CCFP) for AC-3, MP3 and AAC audio decoder. It is used as an accelerator for general purpose processors to improve performance. All the filterbank transforms are derived to even- or odd-point IFFT flows. In the architecture, a fully pipelined approach is developed which can be configured for different operation modes. This design is synthesized using UMC 0.18 mu m library and takes about 26.7 K gates. By the fast algorithm and fully pipelined architecture, the operation cycles are greatly reduced. Therefore, it can be executed at a very low operation frequency with the range of 1.3 to 3.6 MHz. Besides, the power consumption is only 0.9 mW, 3.2 mW and I row for AC-3, MP3 and AAC respectively. We further port our design on an ARM Integrator platform to make a real play system. On average, over 50% ARM performance loading can be saved and used for handling other applications.", "paper_title": "A configurable common filterbank processor for multi-standard audio decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093700024"}
