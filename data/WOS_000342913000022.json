However, the design of individual MIPs is a critical parameter governing the performance of this technology with respect to capture uniformity and specificity. MIPgen is a user-friendly package that simplifies the process of designing custom MIP assays to arbitrary targets. New logistic and SVM-derived models enable in silico predictions of assay success, and assay redesign exhibits improved coverage uniformity relative to previous methods, which in turn improves the utility of MIPs for cost-effective targeted sequencing for candidate gene validation and for diagnostic sequencing in a clinical setting.", "paper_title": "MIPgen: optimized modeling and design of molecular inversion probes for targeted resequencing", "paper_id": "WOS:000342913000022"}
