Five IS success constructs and a balanced scorecard were used to predict ERP systems success. The theoretical model was tested using a survey of 257 companies that had already implemented ERP systems in Taiwan. Structural equation modelling (LISREL) was used to validate the research model. Results of the study are consistent with the IS success factors for explaining ERP systems success. System quality and information quality were found to have a significant effect on system use and user satisfaction. System use and user satisfaction were associated with individual impact. Individual impact had a significant effect on four balanced scorecard perspectives.", "paper_title": "ERP systems success: An integration of IS success model and balanced scorecard", "paper_id": "WOS:000240205700002"}
