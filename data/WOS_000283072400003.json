The transmitter has two independent messages, each of which is intended for one of the receivers but needs to be kept asymptotically perfectly secret from the other. It is shown that, surprisingly, under a matrix power constraint, both messages can be simultaneously transmitted at their respective maximal secrecy rates. To prove this result, the MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel is revisited and a new characterization of its secrecy capacity is provided via a new coding scheme that uses artificial noise (an additive prefix channel) and random binning.", "paper_title": "Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Gaussian Broadcast Channels With Confidential Messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400003"}
