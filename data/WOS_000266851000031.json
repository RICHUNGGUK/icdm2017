A fuzzy interactive decision making approach is proposed to derive a satisfactory solution for decision makers not only considering the dominated action of the leader but also treating the ratios of satisfaction between the leader and the followers. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
