Heterogeneous networks will be dominant in the next generation wireless networks. In such networks, providing a seamless handoff and quality of service (QoS) guarantees is one of the key issues for real-time services. In this paper, we propose a horizontal handoff scheme that reduces the horizontal handoff latency based on the location and movement pattern of a mobile node (MN). We also present a vertical handoff scheme for providing seamless services between Wi-Fi and WiMAX networks. Finally, by performance evaluation using computer simulations, we show that the proposed scheme can reduce the handoff latency significantly.
