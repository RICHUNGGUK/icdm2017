We present a wavelet thresholding based estimation procedure to estimate the components of the partial linear model by establishing a connection between an l(1)-penalty based wavelet estimator of the nonparametric component and Huber's M-estimation of a standard linear model with outliers. Some general results on the large sample properties of the estimates of both the parametric and the nonparametric part of the model are established. Simulations are used to illustrate the general results and to compare the proposed methodology with other methods available in the recent literature.", "paper_title": "Robust estimation and wavelet thresholding in partially linear models", "paper_id": "WOS:000249409100001"}
