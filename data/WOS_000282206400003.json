Our protocol, called MultiPath OLSR (MP-OLSR), is a multipath routing protocol based on OLSR [1]. The Multi path Dijkstra Algorithm is proposed to obtain multiple paths. The algorithm gains great flexibility and extensibility by employing different link metrics and cost functions. In addition, route recovery and loop detection are implemented in MP-OLSR in order to improve quality of service regarding OLSR. The backward compatibility with OLSR based on IP source routing is also studied. Simulation based on Qualnet simulator is performed in different scenarios. A testbed is also set up to validate the protocol in real world. The results reveal that MP-OLSR is suitable for mobile, large and dense networks with large traffic, and could satisfy critical multimedia applications with high on time constraints.
