We address the contemporary problem of simultaneously conducting covariate selection and determining the number of mixture components from a Bayesian perspective that can incorporate prior information. We propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm with reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation to accomplish concurrent covariate selection and mixture component determination in FMR models. Our Bayesian approach contains innovative features compared to previously developed reversible jump algorithms. In addition, we introduce component-adaptive weighted g priors for regression coefficients, and illustrate their improved performance in covariate selection. Numerical studies show that the Gibbs sampler with reversible jump implementation performs well, and that the proposed weighted priors can be superior to non-adaptive unweighted priors.", "paper_title": "Model selection in finite mixture of regression models: a Bayesian approach with innovative weighted g priors and reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000354465400008"}
