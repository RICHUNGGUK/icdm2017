Such systems may consist of a complicated hierarchical structure with many chips that transmit images among them in real time, while performing some processing (for example, convolutions). In developing AER-based systems it is very convenient to have available some means of generating AER streams from on-computer stored images. Rank order coding (ROC) and Poisson rate coding are the extremes of spikes coding. In this paper, we present a pseudo-random hardware method for generating AER streams in real time from a sequence of images stored in a computer's memory. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test has been applied to quantify that this method follows a Poisson distribution of the spikes. A USB-AER board, developed by our RTCAR group, have been used for the measurements. An example scenario of use under the EU CAVIAR project is presented. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
