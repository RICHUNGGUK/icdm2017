This paper defines a new class of view-independent curves, denoted demarcating curves. In a nutshell, demarcating curves are the loci of the \"strongest\" inflections on the surface. Due to their appealing capabilities to extract and emphasize 3D textures, they are applied to artifact illustration in archaeology, where they can serve as a worthy alternative to the expensive, time-consuming, and biased manual depiction currently used.", "paper_title": "Demarcating Curves for Shape Illustration", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100051"}
