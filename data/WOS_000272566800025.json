As a result, cooperative systems are already being used in many areas. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) are also expected to be efficiently solved by cooperative systems. However, we have trouble describing a CSP in system description languages (SDL) such as SystemC or SystemVerilog, because these SDL don't have enough power to describe CSPs, or they do have enough theoretical support for partitioning and Mapping. We developed a framework in which a CSP can be described easily and a program can be partitioned into a distributed cooperation environment. In this framework, Equivalent Transformation (ET) language serves an important role. CSPs can be easily described in ET. Besides ET computation can be divided into a variety of parallel computations so that ET computation is easily mapped to a distributed cooperation system. Also we developed ET-HwNet Server System. that enables ET programs to cooperate with FPGA boards, and demonstrate how the system accelerates computations.", "paper_title": "ET-BASED DISTRIBUTED COOPERATIVE SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800025"}
