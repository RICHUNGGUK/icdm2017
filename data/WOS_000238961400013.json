Performance is evaluated in terms of the expected number of handoffs, the expected handoff delay, standard deviation of handoff location, and the expected link degradation probability as well. Numerical results and simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the handoff schemes with static hysteresis levels. The effect of distance error is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Adaptive handoff with dynamic hysteresis value using distance information in cellular communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961400013"}
