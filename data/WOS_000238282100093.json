The system is a cluster of powerful yet low cost general-purpose PCs interconnected in a network. While, most applications written for cluster systems are programmed in MPI-C, results from the proposed system have shown that it is advantageous to use Java due to its simplicity, distribution enabling, and mobility. These results suggest there are advantages in considering a Java-enhanced cluster platform for many engineering and science applications.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of an efficient parallel object oriented platform (EPOOP) for control intensive intelligent applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100093"}
