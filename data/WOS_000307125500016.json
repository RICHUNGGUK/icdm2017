As circuits become increasingly exposed to process and temperature variations, there is a strong need to augment these models to account for thermal effects and for the impact of adaptive body biasing, a compensatory technique that is used to overcome on-chip variations. However, a straightforward extension of CSMs to incorporate timing analysis at multiple body biases and temperatures results in unreasonably large characterization tables for each cell. We propose a new approach to compactly capture body bias and temperature effects within a mainstream CSM framework. Our approach features a table reduction method for compaction of tables and a fast and novel waveform sensitivity method for timing evaluation under any body bias and temperature condition. On a 45-nm technology, we demonstrate high accuracy, with mean errors of under 4% in both slew and delay as compared to HSPICE. We show a speedup of over five orders of magnitude over HSPICE and a speedup of about 92x over conventional CSMs.", "paper_title": "Compact Current Source Models for Timing Analysis Under Temperature and Body Bias Variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000307125500016"}
