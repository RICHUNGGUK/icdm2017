The proposed method not only can modulate the threshold in halftoning dynamically but also can determine the weights of the error diffusion filter adaptively to diffuse the quantization error to neighboring pixels properly. Under six testing images, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed new error diffusion method has a good compromise between the edge enhancement effect in the halftone image and the image quality effect in the corresponding inverse halftone image when compared to the methods by Floyd-Steinberg, Eschbach and Knox, Hwang et al.. Li, and Feng et al., but it has some execution-time degradation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
