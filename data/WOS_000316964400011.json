The PipeProbe system works by dropping a tiny wireless sensor capsule into the source of a water pipeline. As the PipeProbe capsule traverses the pipelines, it gathers and transmits pressure and angular velocity readings. Through spatiotemporal analysis of these sensor readings, the proposed algorithm locates all turning points in the pipelines and maps their 3D spatial topology. This study expands upon previous research by developing new sensing techniques that identify variable-diameter pipes and differentiate 90-degree pipe turns from 45-degree pipe bends.", "paper_title": "Mapping Hidden Water Pipelines Using a Mobile Sensor Droplet", "paper_id": "WOS:000316964400011"}
