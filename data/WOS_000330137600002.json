In this paper, we propose an effective scheme to segment each tooth in periapical radiographs. The method consists of four stages: image enhancement using adaptive power law transformation, local singularity analysis using Holder exponent, tooth recognition using Otsu's thresholding and connected component analysis, and tooth delineation using snake boundary tracking and morphological operations. Experimental results of 28 periapical radiographs containing 106 teeth in total and 75 useful for dental examination demonstrate that 105 teeth are successfully isolated and segmented, and the overall mean segmentation accuracy of all 75 useful teeth in terms of (TP, FP) is (0.8959, 0.0093) with standard deviation (0.0737, 0.0096), respectively.
