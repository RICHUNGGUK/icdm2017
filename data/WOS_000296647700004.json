The proposed network decomposition algorithm employs bus-tearing and Diakoptics concepts. In combination with Large Change Sensitivity (LCS) analysis, which allows the procedure to evaluate system responses without resolving the whole problem, an accurate method is developed to solve the simultaneous unbalances in T/S analysis. The proposed method is implemented successfully in software and the results are validated in comparison with time domain simulations. The performance of our proposed method is investigated in this paper for a 14-bus IEEE test system. The results reveal the credibility of the method.", "paper_title": "Simulation of simultaneous unbalances in power system transient stability analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000296647700004"}
