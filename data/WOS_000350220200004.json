We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear optimization problem, and show that, depending on the flow aggregation policy used in the network, the problem can be either convex or non-convex. We optimally solve the problem in both cases, and prove that the schedulability does depend on the aggregation policy. This allows us to derive rules of thumb to identify which policy improves the schedulability with a given traffic. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic solution strategy that allows good suboptimal solutions to the scheduling problem to be computed in relatively small times, comparable to those required for online admission control in relatively large WMNs.", "paper_title": "On the Schedulability of Deadline-Constrained Traffic in TDMA Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000350220200004"}
