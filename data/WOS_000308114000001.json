Partial Mulliken oxygen atomic charges in protonated structures were calculated at the level of B3LYP/6-31G*. The MD simulation was performed using the Discover module of Material Studio by compass force field. The results indicate the abilities of donating electrons of the oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups that are closely associated with the antiresorptive potency. The binding energies, including vdw and electrostatic, are used to discuss the mechanism of antiresorption. The results of calculations show that the strength of interaction of the HAP (100) face with the bisphosphonates is N-4 > N-6 > N-7 > N-5 > N-3 > N-2 > N-1 according to their experimental pIC(50) values.", "paper_title": "Modeling the interaction of seven bisphosphonates with the hydroxyapatite(100) face", "paper_id": "WOS:000308114000001"}
