After the formal definition of the model net was given, a construction algorithm is introduced. Then, two simplification algorithms are put forward to show how this approach can reduce the computational complexity of model composition for a specific decision problem. In succession, a model composition algorithm is worked out based on the simplification algorithms. As a result, this algorithm is capable of finding out all the candidate composite models for a specific decision problem. Finally, several advantages of the model net are discussed briefly.", "paper_title": "Model net: A representation of the static structure of modelbase", "paper_id": "WOS:000251312600012"}
