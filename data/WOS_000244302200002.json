In the embryonic heart all myocytes have sinus node type pacemaker channels (I (f)) in their sarcolemma. Shortly before birth, these channels disappear from the ventricular myocytes. The response of the adult sinus node to changes in the interstitium, in particular to (neuro)transmitters, results from the interplay between the responses of all of its constituent cells. The response of the whole sinus node cannot be simply deduced from these cellular responses, because all cells have different responses to specific agonists. A biological pacemaker will be more homogeneous. Therefore it can be anticipated that tuning of cycle length may be problematic. It is discussed that efforts to create a biological pacemaker responsive to vagal stimulation, may be counterproductive, because it may have the potential risk of 'standstill' of the biological pacemaker. A normal sinus node remains spontaneously active at high concentrations of acetylcholine, because it has areas that are unresponsive to acetylcholine. The same is pertinent to other substances with a negative chronotropic effect. Such functional inhomogeneity is lacking in biological pacemakers.", "paper_title": "Embryological development of pacemaker hierarchy and membrane currents related to the function of the adult sinus node: implications for autonomic modulation of biopacemakers", "paper_id": "WOS:000244302200002"}
