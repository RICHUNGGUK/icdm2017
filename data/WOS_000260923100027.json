The proposed approach is employed to search for eigenvalues of a T-S fuzzy model in any mixed weighting cases. This effective method is developed by a well-known Routh stability criterion as well as the root locus method to judge the stability of the nonlinear system approximated by a T-S fuzzy model, furthermore the root locus can be used to indicate the transient response of a T-S fuzzy model. The proposed method gets much more relaxed than that these reported previously. The efficiency and the power are demonstrated via several examples.", "paper_title": "AN ALTERNATE APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF A T-S FUZZY MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000260923100027"}
