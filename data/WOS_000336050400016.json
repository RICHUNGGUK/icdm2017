The Oncosimulator is defined as an information technology system simulating in vivo tumor response to therapeutic modalities within the clinical trial context. Chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, according to two real clinical trials concerning nephroblastoma and breast cancer, has been considered. The spatiotemporal simulation module embedded in the Oncosimulator is based on the multiscale, predominantly top-down, discrete entity-discrete event cancer simulation technique developed by the In Silico Oncology Group, National Technical University of Athens. The technology modules include multiscale data handling, image processing, invocation of code execution via a spreadsheet-inspired environment portal, execution of the code on the grid, and the visualization of the predictions. A refining scenario for the eventual coupling of the oncosimulator with immunological models is also presented. Parameter values have been adapted to multiscale clinical trial data in a consistent way, thus supporting the predictive potential of the oncosimulator. Indicative results demonstrating various aspects of the clinical adaptation and validation process are presented. Completion of these processes is expected to pave the way for the clinical translation of the system.", "paper_title": "The Technologically Integrated Oncosimulator: Combining Multiscale Cancer Modeling With Information Technology in the In Silico Oncology Context", "paper_id": "WOS:000336050400016"}
