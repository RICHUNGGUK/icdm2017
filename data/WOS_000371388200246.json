Both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios were considered. Measurements were performed by fixing a transmit pyramidal horn antenna, and rotating another one in the receiver site at 10 steps in azimuth. The antenna outputs are viewed as array signals, and a space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is applied to estimate delay and angular parameters of multipath components. Benefiting from high resolution achieved by using the SAGE and deembedding of antenna radiation pattern and system responses, more multipath clusters with less spreads in delay and azimuth are found per channel compared with existing works on 28-GHz propagation. The statistics of channel parameters extracted here constitute a preliminary stochastic multipath-cluster spatial channel model.", "paper_title": "Experimental Multipath-Cluster Characteristics of 28-GHz Propagation Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200246"}
