CBM systems help maintainers to detect and manage the condition of aviation system components and take maintenance actions when there is evidence of need. In this paper we describe the application of a software prototype, which is an automation of the CBM practices. We briefly explain the novel framework on which it is built. We illustrate the building of the configuration information, required to generate the maintenance reports that are deemed essential for continuous improvement under CBM, using a markup language called XML. We explain the procedure in generating the reports using the developed prototype. We demonstrate that the developed prototype has the functional capabilities essential to implement CBM on any aircraft and is valuable in cutting down the software maintenance costs as it can perform new operations without having to modify the existing source codes.", "paper_title": "Application of the condition based maintenance checking system for aircrafts", "paper_id": "WOS:000301605000013"}
