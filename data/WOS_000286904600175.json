They are highly automatic, dynamic, heterogeneous, and lack protection against corruption of processes. High risks are imposed on the services (including the consumers and providers) in collaboration. Hence, avoiding illegal collection of private data disclosed in services collaboration is becoming increasingly important. This paper studies how to realize the minimal privacy disclosure while achieving the functional objectives through role mechanisms. Initially, it proposes a revised role-based framework for privacy-aware services collaborations, which considers the impact on the reputation degree of the historic experiences of services in playing roles. Next, it models the privacy behaviors of services by extending the interface automata to support privacy semantics. Furthermore, it quantitatively analyzes the minimal privacy authorization: and presents the minimal privacy delegation algorithm, which allows us to automatically derive optimal privacy policies for an cross-organizational services collaborations system. Finally, it verifies the correctness and efficiency of this role-based approach through a case study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
