The disambiguation is performed at the concept-level based on semantic closeness over the domain ontology. The semantic closeness is a function of the distance between the concept to be disambiguated and selected associated concepts in the ontology. In this process, the image concepts will be disambiguated with any associated concept from the image and/or the text. The ability of the text concepts to resolve the ambiguity in the image concepts is varied. The best talent to resolve the ambiguity of an image concept occurs when the same concept(s) is stated clearly in both image and text, while, the worst case occurs when the image concept is an isolated concept that has no semantically close text concept. WordNet and the image labels with selected senses are used to construct the domain ontology used in the disambiguation process. The improved accuracy, as shown in the results, proves the ability of the proposed disambiguation process.", "paper_title": "Multimodal concept fusion using semantic closeness for image concept disambiguation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306345000005"}
