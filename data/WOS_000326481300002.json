The possibility and necessity measures are used to determine the bailout payback period in the fuzzy case. A modification of the fuzzy payback period method is formulated, where the possibility and necessity measures are used to give the decision maker more choice as to the way the final investment decision is made. All the new methods are illustrated by means of examples and compared to what has been known in the literature.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Capital Budgeting - Fuzzy Bailout Payback Period and Fuzzy Accrual Accounting Rate of Return Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000326481300002"}
