In this paper, the regularity of emitting fumes from asphalt and the effect of suppressing smoke with additives on asphalt were investigated. The results showed that the amount of fumes emitted was related to temperature, thickness and surface area of the asphalt; the amount of fumes was reduced by using melamine, polyethylene, and activated carbon additives respectively, and good effects were achieved. It has great significance on improving working condition on the pavement placement and promoting the construction of environment-friendly society.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON REGULARITY OF FUMES EMITTING FROM ASPHALT", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468700023"}
