CROWN exploits a service-oriented architecture based on OGSA. In CROWN, remote service deployment is highly desirable. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no successful solution to ensure the enabling remote and hot service deployment in grid systems. Traditionally, remote deployment is supported in a cold fashion, which results in many disadvantages, such as low efficiency. Moreover, since the deployer and the target container may be in different domains, great security challenges arise when a service is deployed to a remote container. In this paper, we present ROST, an original scheme of Remote and hOt Service deployment with Trustworthiness. By dynamically updating runtime environment configurations, ROST avoids restarting the runtime system during deployment. In addition, we include trust negotiation in ROST, which greatly increases the flexibility and security of the CROWN Grid. ROST has been successfully implemented. We conduct comprehensive experiments with real applications, and the results show that ROST is viable and significantly improves the service efficiency and quality of CROWN. We believe that the wide deployment of ROST would also benefit other grid systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
