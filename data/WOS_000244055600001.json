We find that the local distribution of the site-site interaction energy has the same form as in the equilibrium case, a result that allows us to define an instantaneous temperature theta during the systems relaxation. We also find that, after an undercritical quench, theta equals the heat bath temperature in a finite time, while the total system energy is still decreasing due to the coarsening process.", "paper_title": "Temperature of nonequilibrium lattice systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244055600001"}
