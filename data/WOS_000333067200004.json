Multi-agent systems play an important role in today's software development of web application. For this purpose, we introduce here a novel concept involving the development of an adaptive e-Learning web application that explores several recent technologies and including web design. The Adaptive E-Learning system based on agent technology is useful in developing continuous improvement strategies. The goal this work is to propose a generic model to assess and evaluate the students learning outcomes related to e-content. Based on the analysis and evaluation of the students learning outcomes results, the instructor identifies the low achievers of the e-content and makes a correction plan to improve them. An exploratory implementation has been developed and used in practice. database.", "paper_title": "WEB APPLICATION FOR AN ADAPTIVE MULTI-AGENT E-LEARNING SYSTEM: A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF E-CONTENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000333067200004"}
