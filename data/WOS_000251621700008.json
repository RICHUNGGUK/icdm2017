For instance, there are some investigations into the detection of Internet worms and intrusions by discovering abnormal traffic patterns. However, since network traffic data contain information about the Internet usage patterns of users, network users' privacy may be compromised during the mining process. In this paper, we propose an efficient and practical method that preserves privacy during sequential pattern mining on network traffic data. In order to discover frequent sequential patterns without violating privacy, our method uses the N-repository server model, which operates as a single mining server and the retention replacement technique, which changes the answer to a query probabilistically. In addition, our method accelerates the overall mining process by maintaining the meta tables in each site so as to determine quickly whether candidate patterns have ever occurred in the site or not. Extensive experiments with real-world network traffic data revealed the correctness and the efficiency of the proposed method. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
