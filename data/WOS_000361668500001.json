This paper describes how network latency may impact monitoring over wide area networks, especially when the monitoring system is hundreds or thousands of miles away from the monitored servers. Furthermore, an idea of local distributor is proposed to reduce the time of events data collection from multiple geographic locations.", "paper_title": "Network Latency in Systems Event Monitoring for Multiple Locations", "paper_id": "WOS:000361668500001"}
