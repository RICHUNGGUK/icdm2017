The proposed segregation method is executed with sound intensity differences that are due to the particular arrangement of the four directivity microphones and the existence of a robot head acting as a sound barrier. The proposed method consists of three-layered signal processing: two-line SAFIA (binary masking based on the narrow band sound intensity comparison), two-line spectral subtraction and their integration. We performed 20K vocabulary continuous speech recognition test in the presence of three speakers' simultaneous talk, and achieved more than 70% word error reduction compared with the case without any segregation processing.", "paper_title": "Ears of the robot: Three simultaneous speech segregation and recognition using robot-mounted microphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000250094600018"}
