This article proposes and develops an efficient procedure of simulating multivariate individual choices given their aggregate sums, capitalizing on a sequence of auxiliary distributions. In this framework, a joint distribution of multiple binary vectors given their sums is approximated as a sequence of conditional Bernoulli distributions. The proposed approach is evaluated through a simulation study and is applied to a political science study.", "paper_title": "Efficient Bayesian analysis of multivariate aggregate choices", "paper_id": "WOS:000360278800013"}
