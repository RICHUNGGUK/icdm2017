Our goal is to provide familiar ways for people to conceive, create and manipulate three-dimensional shapes. To this end, we developed on-and-above-the-surface interaction techniques based on asymmetric bimanual interaction for creating and editing 3D models in a stereoscopic environment. Our approach combines both hand and finger tracking in the space on and above a multi-touch surface. This combination brings forth an alternative design environment where users can seamlessly switch between interacting on the surface or above it to leverage the benefit of both interaction spaces. A formal user evaluation conducted with experienced users shows very promising avenues for further work towards providing an alternative to current user interfaces for modeling.
