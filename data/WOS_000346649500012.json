Although inspections detect the majority of defects in the early stages of the development process, this technique is not a common practice in the software industry, especially in small and medium enterprises. In this paper, we propose a model for the inspection process intended to be applicable and acceptable to both small and medium enterprises and large software organisations. The model was implemented in two organisations: one in a medium-scale company and the other one in a department of a big company where its feasibility and benefits were confirmed. A comparison with recent alternative inspection models has also been performed showing the practicality of the proposal and ease of adoption and cost-effectiveness.
