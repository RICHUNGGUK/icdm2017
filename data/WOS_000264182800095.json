A heuristic partitioning algorithm for solving the multicast routing problem with separate paths in ad hoc networks is presented. We consider scheduling a set of multicast requests which may have a source node with multiple destinations respectively through a wireless network. Our heuristic method for partitioning arbitrary routing requests is both effective in finding a near-optimal solution, and efficient to solve large multicast requests. Our simulation shows that the average overall latency reduces up to 38%. We also find that the handling scales up well from 8 nodes to 64 nodes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
