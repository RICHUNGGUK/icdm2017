However, when a system has only a reference monitor, the system is vulnerable to a low-level detour or a physical attack. In addition, when a system has only a cryptographic file system, the file system has a difficulty in protecting itself. To address these problems, we designed and developed a security OS with a reference monitor, a cryptographic file system, authentication limitation, and session limitation. Here we describe the model its implementation and its overheads.", "paper_title": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY OS: A CASE STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000263340200006"}
