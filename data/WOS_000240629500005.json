We give a pure geometric proof that the P4P problem could have up to five solutions. We also give a clear picture on how these five solutions could be realized. We prove that with probability one, the P4P problem has a unique solution which can be represented by a set of rational functions in the parameters. The simulant experiments show that to solve the P4P problem with the rational functions is stable and accurate.", "paper_title": "On the probability of the number of solutiong for the P4P problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000240629500005"}
