In group-based service discovery protocols, selective forwarding service requests only based on the service group maybe lead to unnecessary forwarding, which produces large packet redundancy. This paper proposes an efficient service discovery protocol: SIGIFSDP (Service Id Guided Intelligent Forwarding Service Discovery Protocol). In SIGIFSDP, based on GSD, SIGIF (Service Id Guided Intelligent Forwarding) is introduced to select the exact forwarding nodes based on the service id. Theoretical analysis and simulation results using GloMosim verify that SIGIFSDP can save the response time, reduce the service request packets, and improve the efficiency of service discovery.", "paper_title": "SIGIFSDP: A SERVICE ID GUIDED INTELLIGENT FORWARDING SERVICE DISCOVERY PROTOCOL IN PERVASIVE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287768300014"}
