Starting from chemical composition we have tested USPEX on numerous systems (with up to 80 atoms in the unit cell) for which the stable structure is known and have observed a success rate of nearly 100%, simultaneously finding large sets of competitive metastable structures. Here focus is on implementation and discussion of our method. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
