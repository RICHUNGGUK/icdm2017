For two vertices u and v, the hitting time H-uv is the expected time it takes a random walk to travel from u to v. The commute distance is its symmetrized version C-uv = H-uv + H-vu. In our paper we study the behavior of hitting times and commute distances when the number n of vertices in the graph tends to infinity. We focus on random geometric graphs (epsilon-graphs, kNN graphs and Gaussian similarity graphs), but our results also extend to graphs with a given expected degree distribution or Erd6s-Renyi graphs with planted partitions. We prove that in these graph families, the suitably rescaled hitting time H uv converges to 1/d(v) and the rescaled commute time to 1/d(u) + 1/d(v) where du and dv denote the degrees of vertices u and v. In these cases, hitting and commute times do not provide information about the structure of the graph, and their use is discouraged in many machine learning applications.", "paper_title": "Hitting and Commute Times in Large Random Neighborhood Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000344638100005"}
