Our proposal relies on fuzzy events to define a fuzzy set of central points for a distribution (or a family of distributions, including imprecise probability models). This framework has a natural interpretation in terms of fuzzy logic and unifies many known notions from statistics, including the mean, median and mode, interquantile intervals, the Lorenz curve, the halfspace median, the zonoid and lift zonoid, the coverage function and several expectations and medians of random sets, and the Choquet integral against an infinitely alternating or infinitely monotone capacity.
