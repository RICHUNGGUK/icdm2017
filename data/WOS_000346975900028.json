This technique has the advantage over other tractography methods in terms of computational efficiency, due to the fact that the UKF simultaneously estimates the diffusion tensors and propagates the most consistent direction to track along. This UKF and its variants reported later in literature however are not intrinsic to the space of diffusion tensors. Lack of this key property can possibly lead to inaccuracies in the multitensor estimation as well as in the tractography. In this paper, we propose a novel intrinsic unscented Kalman filter (IUKF) in the space of diffusion tensors which are symmetric positive definite matrices, that can be used for simultaneous recursive estimation of multitensors and propagation of directional information for use in fiber tractography from diffusion weighted MR data. In addition to being more accurate, IUKF retains all the advantages of UKF mentioned above. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method via experiments publicly available phantom data from the fiber cup-challenge (MICCAI 2009) and diffusion weighted MR scans acquired from human brains and rat spinal cords.", "paper_title": "Tractography From HARDI Using an Intrinsic Unscented Kalman Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000346975900028"}
