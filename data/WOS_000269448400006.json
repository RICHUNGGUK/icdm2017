A comparator-based inverter is employed along with two switches of an NMOS and a PMOS, the bisection method can let only half of comparators in a flash ADC work in every clock cycle for reducing power consumption. A practical example of 6-bit flash ADC operates at 200 MHz sampling rate and 3.3 V supply voltage is demonstrated. The power consumption of proposed circuit is only 40.75 mW with HSPICE simulation. Compared with the traditional flash ADC, our bisection method can reduce up to 43.18% in terms of power dissipation.", "paper_title": "A BISECTION-BASED POWER REDUCTION DESIGN FOR CMOS FLASH ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269448400006"}
