Define the random Kronecker graph K(n,alpha, gamma, beta) to be the graph with vertex set Z(2)(n) , where the probability that u is adjacent to v is given by p(u,v) =alpha(u.v)gamma(1-u).(1-v)beta n-u.v-(1-u).(1-v). This model has been shown to obey several useful properties of real-world networks. We establish the asymptotic size of the giant component in the random Kronecker graph.
