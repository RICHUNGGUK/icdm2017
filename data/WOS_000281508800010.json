Laplacian-like energy of a graph is newly proposed graph invariant, defined as the sum of square roots of Laplacian eigenvalues. For bipartite graphs, the Laplacian-like energy coincides with the recently defined incidence energy IE(G) of a graph. In [D. Stevanovic, Laplacian-like energy of trees, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 61 (2009), 407-417.] the author introduced a partial ordering of graphs based on Laplacian coefficients. We point out that original proof was incorrect and illustrate the error on the example using Laplacian Estrada index. Furthermore, we found the inverse of Jacobian matrix with elements representing derivatives of symmetric polynomials of order n, and provide a corrected elementary proof of the fact: Let G and H be two n-vertex graphs; if for Laplacian coefficients holds c(k)(G) <= c(k)(H) for k = 1,2, ... , n - 1, then LEL(G) <= LEL(H). In addition, we generalize this theorem and provide a necessary condition for functions that satisfy partial ordering based on Laplacian coefficients.", "paper_title": "On Laplacian Like Energy of Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000281508800010"}
