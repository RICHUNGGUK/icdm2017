One of the major drawbacks is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which results in intercarrier interference, high out-of-band radiation, and bit error rate performance degradation, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the high power amplifier. This paper reviews the conventional PAPR reduction schemes and their modifications for achieving the low computational complexity required for practical implementation in wireless communication systems.", "paper_title": "An Overview of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction Schemes for OFDM Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000267954200002"}
