This paper demonstrates that none of these schemes can satisfy the contributory nature of key agreement. To fill the gaps, we present a secure key agreement protocol based on chaotic Hash. The proposed scheme utilizes the chaotic Hash function to achieve the contributory nature anti enhance its security. Cryptanalysis demonstrates that our chaotic Hash-based scheme can overcome all the current deficiencies.
