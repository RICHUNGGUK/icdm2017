The user first cuts needed parts from some existing objects and puts them in right pose. Then, a radial basis function (RBF) based implicit surface is adopted to smoothly fuse the parts. To achieve better shape control for the transition part in fusion, our method let users using sketches to specify the expected silhouette. After that, the implicit surface is sampled by particles and meshed into a polygonal surface joining the separated parts into one single model. Compared with other previous methods, our mesh fusion approach overcomes the topological limitations and can merge multiple parts together at once.", "paper_title": "Sketch based mesh fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600008"}
