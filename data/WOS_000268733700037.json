Radiologists are not always accustomed to make sense of the biochemical information provided by MRS and they may benefit from computer-based support in their decision making. The high dimensionality of the MR spectra obscures atypical aspects of the data that may jeopardize their classification. In this study, we describe a method to overcome this problem that combines nonlinear dimensionality reduction, outlier detection, and expert opinion. MR spectra subsequently undergo a feature selection process followed by classification. The impact of outlier removal on classification performance is assessed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
