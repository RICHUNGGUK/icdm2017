This is done by performing CPU booking. This prediction is used to establish a temporal commitment with the client that invokes the execution of the task. This kind of scheduler is very useful in scenarios where Service-Oriented Computing is deployed and the execution time is used as a parameter for QoS. This scheduler is part of an architecture that is based on the Distributed Goal-Oriented Computing paradigm, which allows agents to express their own goals and to reach them by means of service compositions. Moreover, the scheduler is also able to prioritize those tasks which provide greater benefits to the OS. In this work, the scheduler has been designed in several iterations and tested by means of a set of experiments that compare the scheduler algorithm with a representative set of scheduling algorithms.
