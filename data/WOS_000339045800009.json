A 64 x 64 pixel array was fabricated using standard 130-nm CMOS process consuming only 5.9 nW/pixel with integration time of 2 ms at +0.5 V supply. The high fill factor of 58% facilitated a better SNR at a low supply voltage when compared with other CIS architectures. The pixel has a dynamic range of 54 dB with 7.8 frame per second.", "paper_title": "High Fill Factor Low-Voltage CMOS Image Sensor Based on Time-to-Threshold PWM VLSI Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000339045800009"}
