This new class of codes is shown to be useful in recursive constructions for constant-weight and constant-composition codes. Large classes of group divisible codes are constructed which enabled the determination of the sizes of optimal constant-composition codes of weight three (and specified distance), leaving only four cases undetermined. Previously, the sizes of constant-composition codes of weight three were known only for those of sufficiently large length.", "paper_title": "Group divisible codes and their application in the construction of optimal constant-composition codes of weight three", "paper_id": "WOS:000257861400012"}
