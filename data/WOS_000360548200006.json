To address these challenges, we present a new network paradigm by taking advantage of an emerging type of user-provided network. In particular, the proposed scheme allows end users to play a crucial role in both QoE evaluation and network improvement. Some points for possible challenges and future research are given. Also, a case study with the proposed resource scheduling algorithm is conducted to illustrate the win-win situation created by the proposed network paradigm.", "paper_title": "USER-PROVIDED NETWORKING FOR QOE PROVISIONING IN MOBILE NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000360548200006"}
