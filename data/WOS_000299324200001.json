First, we propose to evolve directly both the particle population and memory population (archive population), called the P&A pattern, to enhance the efficiency of the PSO for solving multimodal optimization functions, and investigate illustratively the niching capability of the PSO and the PSOP&A. It is found that the global version PSO is disable, but the local version PSOP&A is able, to niche multiple species for locating multiple optima. Second, the recombination-replacement crowding strategy that works on the archive population is introduced to improve the exploration capability, and the hybrid niching PSOP&A (HN-PSOP&A) is developed. Finally, experiments are carried out on multimodal functions for testing the niching efficiency and scalability of the proposed method, and it is verified that the proposed method has a sub-quadratic scalability with dimension in terms of fitness function evaluations on specific MMFO problems.
