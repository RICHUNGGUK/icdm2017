It is shown that an SbW system can be represented by a nominal model and an unknown portion. A nominal feedback controller can then be used to stabilize the nominal model and a sliding mode compensator (SMC) is designed to remove the effects of both the unknown system dynamics and uncertain road conditions on the steering performance. For practical consideration, robust exact differentiator (RED) technique is utilized to estimate the derivatives of the position signals for controller design. It is further shown that the designed RCS is able to guarantee a robust steering performance against system and road uncertainties. The comparative experimental studies are given to verify the excellent performance of the proposed RCS for SbW systems.", "paper_title": "Robust Control for Steer-by-Wire Systems With Partially Known Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000344995800003"}
