A substantial number of single solution-based local search metaheuristics has been proposed so far, and an attempt of unifying existing approaches is here presented. Based on a fine-grained decomposition, a conceptual model is proposed and is validated by regarding a number of state-of-the-art methodologies as simple variants of the same structure. This model is then incorporated into the ParadisEO-MO software framework. This framework has proven its efficiency and high flexibility by enabling the resolution of many academic and real-world optimization problems from science and industry.", "paper_title": "ParadisEO-MO: from fitness landscape analysis to efficient local search algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000326888000002"}
