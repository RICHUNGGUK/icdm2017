Transaction management for pervasive environments has to provide mobile users with reliable and transparent services anytime anywhere. To make such a vision a reality, the communication of pervasive transaction processing should be context-aware for adapting to dynamically changing execution environments, and energy-efficient for prolonging the lifetime of battery-powered mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a context model and a context-aware transaction model for pervasive transactions, and present a context-adaptive and energy-efficient transaction management mechanism (CETM) that can dynamically adjust transaction execution behaviors in terms of current context information. Moreover, we model and verify the correctness of the CETM through Petri nets. The simulation results have demonstrated that our transaction management mechanism CETM can significantly reduce the failed probability of concurrent pervasive transactions.", "paper_title": "Context-adaptive and energy-efficient mobile transaction management in pervasive environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000301189100004"}
