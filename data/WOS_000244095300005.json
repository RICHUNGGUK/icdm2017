Our scheme automatically calculates the necessary constraints needed to deform the first model's silhouette into the second model's in 2D, and creates a 3D deformation function based on these constraints while minimizing the object's distortion in all areas but the silhouette. The motivation of this work stems from the artwork of conceptual artists such as Shigeo Fukuda [9] and Markus Raetz [19].", "paper_title": "Generation of view dependent models using free form deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000244095300005"}
