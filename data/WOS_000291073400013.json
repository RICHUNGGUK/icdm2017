A primary use of fuzzy rough set theory is to perform attribute reduction for decision systems with numerical conditional attribute values and crisp (symbolic) decision attributes. In this paper we define inconsistent fuzzy decision system and their reductions, and develop discernibility matrix-based algorithms to find reducts. Finally, two heuristic algorithms are developed and comparison study is provided with the existing algorithms of attribute reduction with fuzzy rough sets. The proposed method in this paper can deal with decision systems with numerical conditional attribute values and fuzzy decision attributes rather than crisp ones. Experimental results imply that our algorithm of attribute reduction with general fuzzy rough sets is feasible and valid. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.
