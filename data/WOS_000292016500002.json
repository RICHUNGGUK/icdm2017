In this study, two promising switching control gain adaptation and chattering reduction techniques are investigated, and the effectiveness of chattering suppression for current regulation of PM DC drives is tested. The sampling rate was also examined to determine how it affects the amplitude of chattering. This paper concentrates on various combinations of observer-based methods in order to find the best solution for chattering reduction. To find a practical solution a tunable low-pass filter (LPF) was used to average the discontinuous control term. The validity of the existing conditions for the gain adaptation methods are examined and observer gain value was determined through simulations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of each method, several experiments were performed on a DSP-based PM DC motor drive system. Then, the newly proposed combinations of these methods were implemented. The hardware implementation results are comparatively presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Sliding mode controller gain adaptation and chattering reduction techniques for DSP-based PM DC motor drives", "paper_id": "WOS:000292016500002"}
