Extensive simulations have been undertaken to verify the derived analytical expressions via generated mobility traces. Results demonstrate that the proposed analytical model can characterize the dynamic statistics well. Furthermore, the mathematical results of expected link life and expected new link arrival rate are provided to be used in analyzing the network connectivity. Combining with queueing theory, the upper bound connectivity of a VANET is obtained. This work thus provides a fundamental guideline on designing new mobility models, new routing protocols, and the corresponding performance analysis in VANET.", "paper_title": "Effective Transmission Coverage Area-Based Link Dynamics Characterization of VANET in Highway Scenario", "paper_id": "WOS:000364679600001"}
