We show that these problems are complete for subclasses of the counting hierarchy which had few or no known natural complete problems before. We also study these questions for circuits computing multilinear polynomials and for univariate multiplicatively disjoint circuits.", "paper_title": "Monomials in Arithmetic Circuits: Complete Problems in the Counting Hierarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000351224100001"}
