L-MtAlaDH has been proposed to be a potential target in the treatment of tuberculosis. Based on the crystal structures of this enzyme, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the conformational changes of L-MtAlaDH induced by coenzyme NADH. The results show that the presence of NADH in the binding domain restricts the motions and conformational distributions of L-MtAlaDH. There are two loops (residues 94-99 and 238-251) playing important roles for the binding of NADH, while another loop (residues 267-293) is responsible for the binding of substrate. The opening/closing and twisting motions of two domains are closely related to the conformational changes of L-MtAlaDH induced by NADH. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
