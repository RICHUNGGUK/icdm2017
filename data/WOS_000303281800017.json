Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques aim to represent the knowledge in a way that can be applied to solving complex problems or supporting decision making processes. During the last years the semantic web techniques have supported the share of knowledge by means of ontologies. Ontologies have been used for both annotating resources and reasoning. Business Process Management is one of the specific fields in which the use of ontologies has been widely applied. This paper presents SABUMO, a framework based on ontologies that allows experts to represent and share their knowledge with other experts by means of shared and controlled vocabularies. The framework also allows the execution of business processes represented by experts. The execution of this knowledge does not require the installation of complex AI programs. Initial results of the evaluation setup show promising results both in usability and recommendation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
