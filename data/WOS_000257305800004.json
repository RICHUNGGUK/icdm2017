We refer to this form of the matrix as block diagonal matrix with overlap. The partitioned matrix is suitable for applying the explicit formulation of multiplicative Schwarz (EFMS) [G.A. Atenekeng Kahou, E. Kamgnia, B. Philippe, An explicit formulation of the multiplicative Schwarz preconditioner, Journal of Applied Numerical Mathematics 57 (2007) 1197-1213] used as a preconditioner for solving a sparse unsymmetric system of linear equations Ax = b. The proposed algorithm partitions the graph of the matrix A into k parts such that every part Vi has connecting edges with at most two neighbors Vi-1 and Vi+1. First, an ordering algorithm that reduces the profile of the matrix, and an initial block-diagonal partition with overlap is obtained. Second, an iterative strategy is used to further refine the partitioning by allowing vertices to be moved between partitions. Experiments performed on real-world matrices show the usefulness of this approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
