In this paper, we fully extend Winskel's approach to single-pushout grammars providing them with a categorical concurrent semantics expressed as a coreflection between the category of (semi-weighted) graph grammars and the category of prime algebraic domains, which factorises through the category of occurrence grammars and the category of asymmetric event structures. For general, possibly nonsemi-weighted single-pushout grammars, we define an analogous functorial concurrent semantics, which, however, is not characterised as an adjunction. Similar results can be obtained for double-pushout graph grammars, under the assumptions that nodes are never deleted. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
