The underlying architecture of this manipulator is briefly addressed with emphasis on the practical realization of the articulated travelling plate. On the basis of the kinematic analysis of the 1T3R parallel manipulator, its optimal design considering the force and motion transmissibility is carried out, in which the generalized virtual power transmissibility of this manipulator is defined. This paper aims at laying a solid theoretical and technical foundation for the prototype design and manufacture of the 1T3R parallel manipulator. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
