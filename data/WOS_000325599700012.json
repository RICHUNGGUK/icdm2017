When the coupling pi is the coupling with all arches parallel pi(0) (the \"rarest\" one), this formula states the equality of the number of corresponding HTFPLs to the number of cyclically-symmetric plane partition of the same size. We provide a bijective proof of this fact. While there is no similar expression for HTFPLs of odd size, we study the number of HTFPLs whose coupling is a slit version of pi(0), and discover new puzzling enumerative coincidences involving countings of tilings of hexagons and various symmetry classes of FPLs.
