It is based on LZ complexity and (0,1) characteristic sequences of DNA sequences. This weighted measure enables biologists to extract similarity information from biological sequences according to their requirements. For example, by this weighted measure, one can obtain either the full similarity information or a similarity analysis from a given biological aspect. Moreover, the length of DNA sequence is not problematic. The application of the weighted measure to the similarity analysis of beta-globin genes from nine species shows its flexibility.", "paper_title": "A weighted measure for the similarity analysis of DNA sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000240900700018"}
