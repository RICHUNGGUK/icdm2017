In subsequent issues the discussion can continue through letters to the editor. With these comments on the paper \"Combining Health Data Uses to Ignite Health System Learning\", written by John D. Ainsworth and Iain E. Buchan [1], the journal seeks to stimulate a broad discussion on new ways for combining data sources for the reuse of health data in order to identify new opportunities for health system learning. An international group of experts has been invited by the editor of Methods to comment on this paper. Each of the invited commentaries forms one section of this paper.", "paper_title": "Discussion of \"Combining Health Data Uses to Ignite Health System Learning\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000366043500003"}
