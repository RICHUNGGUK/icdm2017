In this study also transportation capacity and transportation among machines times are explicitly considered. We establish a mixed integer programming model and propose a heuristic algorithm based on the basic idea of Johnson's algorithm. Since the problem under study is NP-hard, a genetic algorithm is also proposed to minimize makespan. The effectiveness of our solution procedures is evaluated through computational experiments. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the genetic algorithm is a viable and effective approach that is capable to produce consistently good results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.
