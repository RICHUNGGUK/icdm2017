Many maintenance policies help to decrease the unexpected failures and reduce high operational cost such as conventional preventive maintenance. But these conventional preventive maintenance policies have the same time interval T that may easily neglect system's reliability, because the system deteriorates with increased usage and age. Hence, this study has developed a reliability-centred sequential preventive maintenance model for monitored repairable deteriorating system. It is supposed that system's reliability could be monitored continuously and perfectly, whenever it reaches the threshold R, the imperfect repair must be performed to restore the system. In this model, system's failure rate function and operational cost are both considered by the effect of system's corresponding condition, which helps to decide the optimal reliability threshold R and preventive maintenance cycle number. Finally, through case study, the simulation results show that the improved sequential preventive maintenance policy is more practical and efficient.", "paper_title": "Preventive maintenance scheduling for repairable system with deterioration", "paper_id": "WOS:000284509700020"}
