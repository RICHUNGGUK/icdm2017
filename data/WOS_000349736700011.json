Finding the optimal positions increases spatial coverage and reduces deployment costs. This paper presents an approach for the case that two attributes have to be measured with a different number of available sensors. The proposed cokriging method performs cross-attribute fusion in sensor networks by being based on the analysis of multi-variable spatial correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this scientific work is the first one considering kriging and cokriging interpolations as IF methods. The single-variable ordinary kriging and bi-variable methods were applied to experimental data. The combination of humidity and temperature data in a refrigerated container is used as exemplary case, humidity measurements are considered to be the expensive attribute to measure. The average estimation error for intermediate points was estimated as a function of the number of humidity sensors. When variability is high, data fusion using the bi-variable method produced results as accurate as the single-variable one, without the necessity of deploying a large number of humidity measuring points, by complementing the estimation with temperature measurements.
