This correction interface performs analysis region detection, user intention understanding and error correction utterance recognition, all from a single user utterance input. We evaluate the performance of each component first, and then compare the effectiveness of our interface to two previous interfaces. Our evaluation demonstrates that each component is technically superior to the baselines and that our one-step error detection and correction method yields an error correction interface that is more convenient and natural than the two previous interfaces.", "paper_title": "One-Step Error Detection and Correction Approach for Voice Word Processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000359474600008"}
