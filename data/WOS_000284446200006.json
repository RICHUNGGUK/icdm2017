We propose a new, efficient spectral approach, which integrates the two costs for clustering numerical vectors and clustering nodes in a network into a matrix trace, reducing the issue to a trace optimization problem which can be solved by an eigenvalue decomposition. We empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach through a variety of experiments, including both synthetic and real biological datasets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
