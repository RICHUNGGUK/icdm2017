We control the thickness of the film at the take-up point using the shape of the nozzle and the initial thickness. The control goal consists in finding an even thickness profile. To achieve this goal, we minimize an appropriate cost functional. The resulting minimization problem is solved numerically by a steepest descent method. The gradient of the cost functional is approximated using the adjoint variables of the problem with fixed film width. Numerical simulations show the applicability of the proposed method.
