For every surface S, a property P of graphs embeddable in S is decidable in polynomial time if and only if it is definable in fixed-point logic with counting. It is a consequence of this result that for every surface S there is a k such that a simple combinatorial algorithm, namely \"the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm\", decides isomorphism of graphs embeddable in S in polynomial time. We also present (without proof) generalizations of these results to arbitrary classes of graphs with excluded minors.", "paper_title": "Fixed-Point Definability and Polynomial Time on Graphs with Excluded Minors", "paper_id": "WOS:000311294200006"}
