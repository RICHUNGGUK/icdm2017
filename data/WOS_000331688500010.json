This article presents a library of dynamic modelling tools for estimating MP fluxes within Integrated Urban Wastewater and Stormwater system (IUWS - including drainage network, stormwater treatment units, wastewater treatment plants, sludge treatment, and the receiving water body). The models are developed by considering the high temporal variability of the processes taking place in the IUWS, providing a basis for the elaboration of pollution control strategies (including both source control and treatment options) at the small spatial scale of urban areas. Existing and well-established water quality models for the different parts of the IUWS (e.g. ASM models) are extended by adding MP fate processes. These are modelled by using substance inherent properties, following an approach commonly used in large-scale MP multimedia fate and transport models. The chosen level of complexity ensures a low data requirement and minimizes the need for field measurements. Next to a synthesis of model applications, a didactic example is presented to illustrate the potential of the use of the developed model library for developing, evaluating and comparing strategies for reduction of MP emissions from urban areas.
