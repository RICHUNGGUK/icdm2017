Traditionally, to maximize design flexibility, interchip and intrachip communication architectures are separately designed under different constraints. Jointly designing communication architectures for both interchip and intrachip communication could, however, potentially yield better solutions. In this paper, we present a unified inter/intrachip optical network, called UNION, for chip multiprocessors (CMPs). UNION is based on recent progresses in nanophotonic technologies. It connects not only cores on a single CMP, but also multiple CMPs in a system. UNION employs a hierarchical optical network to separate interchip communication traffic from intrachip communication traffic. It fully utilizes a single optical network to transmit both payload and control packets. The network controller on each CMP not only manages intrachip communications, but also collaborates with each other to facilitate interchip communications. We compared UNION with a matched electrical counterpart in 45-nm process. Simulation results for eight real CMP applications show that on average UNION improves CMP performance by 3x while reducing 88% of network energy consumption.", "paper_title": "UNION: A Unified Inter/Intrachip Optical Network for Chip Multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000337159500012"}
