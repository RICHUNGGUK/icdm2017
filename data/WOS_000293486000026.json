The new version now supports four external geometry optimization codes (VASP, GULP, PWSCF, and CASTEP), as well as three queuing systems: PBS, SGE, SLURM, and \"Local\". The local queuing system allows the geometry optimizations to be performed on the user's workstation if an external computational cluster is unavailable. Support for the Windows operating system has been added, and a Windows installer is provided. Numerous bugfixes and feature enhancements have been made in the new release as well.", "paper_title": "XTALOPT version r7: An open-source evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000293486000026"}
