Previous research on Groebner Bases expert systems has so far been connected to modeling expert systems based on propositional logics. Our approach instead is based on the well-known Artificial Intelligence 'Concept-Attribute-Value' paradigm for representing knowledge. More precisely, our research is based on translating an already existent expert system described in terms of the 'Concept-Attribute-Value' paradigm to a new algebraic model which represents knowledge by means of polynomials. In this way, issues about consistence and inference within this expert system will be, through this new model, transformed into algebraic problems involving calculating Groebner Bases. By using this new model of ours, some interesting advantages ensue: on the one hand, knowledge representation may be performed in a more straightforward and intuitive way; on the other, calculating the Groebner Bases associated to our algebraic model is usually faster adopting this new 'Concept-Attribute-Value'-based paradigm than it was in previous propositional logic-based expert systems.
