We model the thalamocortical loop with a neuronal network where each thalamic neuron is described by a system of coupled differential equations reflecting neurophysiological properties. The computational simulations reflect neurochemical features of PD and ADHD. Our results suggest that the mesothalamic dopamine hypoactivity causes difficulties in attentional shifting. Conversely, the mesothalamic dopamine hyperactivity hinders the attentional focus consolidation. Furthermore, regardless of the amount of mesothalamic dopamine activity, the mesocortical dopamine hypoactivity leads to loss of attentional focus. Finally, we identify a unique neuronal mechanism underlying attention deficits in PD and ADHD and relate different inattention symptoms in ADHD to different dopaminergic levels in the brain circuit modeled.", "paper_title": "Attentional Focus Modulated by Mesothalamic Dopamine: Consequences in Parkinson's Disease and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder", "paper_id": "WOS:000292776200003"}
