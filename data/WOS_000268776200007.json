The window query is one of the essential spatial queries, which finds spatial objects located within a given window. In this paper, we propose a Hilbert curve-based distributed index for window queries in the wireless data broadcast systems. Our proposed algorithm allocates spatial objects in the Hilbert-curve order to preserve the spatial locality. Moreover, to quickly answer window queries, our proposed algorithm utilizes the neighbor-link index, which has knowledge about neighbor objects, to return the answered objects. From our experimental study, we have shown that our proposed algorithm outperforms the distributed spatial index.", "paper_title": "A Hilbert Curve-Based Distributed Index for Window Queries in Wireless Data Broadcast Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000268776200007"}
