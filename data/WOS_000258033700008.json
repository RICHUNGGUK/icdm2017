In particular, these bounds apply to secure frameproof codes, which are equivalent to separating hash families of type {w,w}. We also consider existence results for separating hash families of type {w(1),w(2)} that can be obtained from the probabilistic method. The asymptotic behavior of these bounds is analyzed.", "paper_title": "Some improved bounds for secure frameproof codes and related separating hash families", "paper_id": "WOS:000258033700008"}
