An important problem is related to the scale, or range of scales, for which a feature is relevant. We propose a new robust method to detect features on digital data (surface of objects in Z(3), which exploits asymptotic properties of recent digital curvature estimators. In Coeurjolly et al [1] and Levallois et al. [1,2], authors have proposed curvature estimators (mean, principal and Gaussian) on 2D and 3D digitized shapes and have demonstrated their multigrid convergence (for C-3-smooth surfaces). Since such approaches integrate local information within a ball around points of interest the radius is a crucial parameter. In this paper, we consider the radius as a scale-space parameter. By analyzing the behavior of such curvature estimators as the ball radius tends to zero, we propose a tool to efficiently characterize and extract several relevant features (edges, smooth and flat parts) on digital surfaces.
