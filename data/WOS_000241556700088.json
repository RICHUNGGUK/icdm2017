In this registration problem, it is of utmost importance to correct only for differences in patient positioning and to preserve other diagnostically important differences between both images, resulting from anatomical and pathological changes between both acquisitions. Classical free form deformation algorithms are therefore less suited, since they allow too large local volume changes and their deformation is not biomechanically based. Instead of adding constraints or penalties to these methods in order to restrict unwanted deformations, we developed a truly biomechanically based registration method where the position of skin and muscle surface are used as the only boundary conditions. Results of our registration method show an important improvement in correspondence between the reference and the deformed floating image, without introducing physically implausible deformations and within a short computational time.", "paper_title": "Biomechanically based elastic breast registration using mass tensor simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700088"}
