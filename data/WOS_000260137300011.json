To overcome the problem of semantic heterogeneity and encode domain knowledge in reusable format, a large-scale and well-defined ontology is also required in the traditional Chinese medicine discipline. We argue that to meet the on-demand and scalability requirement ontology-based systems Should go beyond the use of static ontology and be able to self-evolve and specialize for the domain knowledge they possess. In particular, we refer to the context-specific Portions from large-scale ontologies like the traditional Chinese medicine ontology as sub-ontologies. Ontology-based systems are able to reuse sub-ontologies in local repository called ontology cache. In order to improve the overall Performance of ontology cache, we propose to evolve sub-ontologies in ontology cache to optimize the knowledge Structure of sub-ontologies. Moreover, we present the sub-ontology evolution approach based on a genetic algorithm for reusing large-scale ontologies. We evaluate the proposed evolution approach with the traditional Chinese medicine ontology and obtain promising results. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
