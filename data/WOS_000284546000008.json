It combines the desirable attributes of current memory technologies such as SRAM, DRAM, and flash memories (fast access time, low cost, high density, and non-volatility). It also solves the critical drawbacks of conventional MRAM technology: poor scalability and high write current. However, variations in process parameters can lead to a large number of cells to fail, severely affecting the yield of the memory array. In this paper, we analyzed and modeled the failure probabilities of STT MRAM cells due to parameter variations. Based on the model, we performed a thorough analysis of the impact of design parameters on parametric failures due to process variations. To achieve high memory yield without incurring expensive technology modification, we developed an efficient design paradigm from circuit and/or architecture perspective-to improve the robustness and integration density. The proposed technique effectively relaxes or completely decouples the conflicting design requirements for read stability, writability and cell area. It can be used at an early stage of the design cycle for yield enhancement.", "paper_title": "Design Paradigm for Robust Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic RAM (STT MRAM) From Circuit/Architecture Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000284546000008"}
