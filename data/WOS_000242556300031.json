The Dynamic TSP (DTSP) is arguably even more difficult than general static TSP. Moreover the DTSP is widely applicable to real-world applications, arguably even more than its static equivalent. However its investigation is only in the preliminary stages. There are many open questions to be investigated. This paper proposes an effective algorithm to solve DTSP. Experiments showed that this algorithm is effective, as it can find very high quality solutions using only a very short time step.", "paper_title": "A new approach to solving dynamic traveling salesman problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300031"}
