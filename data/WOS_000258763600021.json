Determining the neighborhood size both in the space and time domain can considerably reduce the complexity of the set of candidate model terms for the identification of coupled map lattice models. The computation requirements of the model identification algorithm can also be greatly reduced instead of the more direct identification approach of searching over the entire spatiotemporal neighborhood in the original space. In this paper, a new neighborhood detection method is introduced based on embedding theory for nonlinear dynamical systems to produce an initial spatiotemporal neighborhood for the identification of spatiotemporal systems. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the new neighborhood detection method.", "paper_title": "Neighborhood detection for the identification of spatiotemporal systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258763600021"}
