The proposed neural network banks exploit the possibility of separating the average TOC series into its known components, applying different neural networks as input to different structures which form the final bank. These neural network banks have proven to be very effective in the experiments carried out, obtaining important improvements over standard networks in the prediction of average TOC data series over the Iberian Peninsula. Also, we show that this good performance of the neural network banks is maintained when different procedures of deseasonalization are applied to the ozone measure and also to the prediction variables.
