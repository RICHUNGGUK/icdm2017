However, traditional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models cannot measure the efficiency evaluation of these undesirable outputs. This article aims to solve this problem. It gives an improved DEA-SBM model, named ISBM-DEA, and constructs an illustration to compare it with the Slacks-based measured DEA model. The results show that the new model's computing conclusions are highly related to the efficiency assessment of the DEA-SBM model, and it has a greater focus on the affects of undesirable outputs on production efficiency than the latter, which means that this new model has a greater extensive value for application and provides a better quantitative theoretical basis for environmental policy analysis.
