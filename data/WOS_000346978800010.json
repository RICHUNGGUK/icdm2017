A presented four-parametric affinity hydration model captures well the hydration kinetics when three parameters are treated as fuzzy numbers. The equations for the fuzzy affinity hydration model are derived using Zadeh's extension principle, which allows for simplifying calculations to obtain a fuzzy solution. The fuzzy model validates Portland cements with different mineral compositions, water-cement ratii raging from 0.16 to 0.50, and curing temperatures varying from 10 to 30 degrees C. Also, the fuzzy model is verified against CEMHYD3D and s-shape hydration model. In summary, validation and verification results show that the fuzzy model permits to predict vague conditions without lacking the credibility of results.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy affinity hydration model", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800010"}
