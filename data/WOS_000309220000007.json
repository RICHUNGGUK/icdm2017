In this scheme, the whole network is divided into several independent domains, and each domain contains a congestion control server (CCS) and several control modules (CM). The CCS is used to collect credit information and make punishment decisions based on the credit information, while the CM creates signaling packets to calculate responsibility mark. Violators will be punished according to their responsibility mark. The effectiveness of this scheme is also analyzed. We provide simulation results to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can process congestion and provide better performance gains.", "paper_title": "A Credibility-based Congestion Control Scheme and its Performance Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000007"}
