We first provide a theoretical analysis to identify the simplest possible operations for editing irregular vertices and then introduce a hierarchy of editing operations to control the type, location, and number of irregular vertices. We demonstrate the power of our editing framework with an example application in pattern design on surfaces.", "paper_title": "Editing Operations for Irregular Vertices in Triangle Meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000284943000017"}
