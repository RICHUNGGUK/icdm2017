Current wireless transceiver front-ends are designed for worst case channel conditions and a limited degree of post manufacture tuning is performed to compensate for process variations. It is shown how the proposed architecture can result in significant power savings over current practice without compromising system-level bit-error rate (while keeping the end-user experience unaffected). In contrast to traditional wireless circuits with limited tunability, such a zero-margin design is achieved by close loop adaptation of the wireless front-end circuits to ensure that they only consume the minimum power and deliver just enough performance (and not any more) for any channel condition. The adaptation methodology is applied to a WLAN receiver design and hardware measurement data for an adaptive receiver is presented showing a > 3 x power improvement under best case channel conditions.", "paper_title": "Process-Variation Tolerant Channel-Adaptive Virtually Zero-Margin Low-Power Wireless Receiver Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000345518500001"}
