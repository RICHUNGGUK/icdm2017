Workflow composition is traditionally addressed in various ways, generally via theorem proving techniques. Recent research [1] observed that building a composite workflow bears strong relationships with finite model search, and that some workflow languages can be defined as constrained object metamodels [2,3]. This lead to consider the viability of applying configuration techniques to this problem, which was proven feasible. Constrained based configuration expects a constrained object model as input. The purpose of this document is to formally specify the constrained object model involved in ongoing experiments and research using the Z specification language.", "paper_title": "A constrained object model for configuration based workflow composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100008"}
