This important change of the concept of anonymity has recently attracted attentions in mobile wireless security research. This paper presents identity-free routing and on-demand routing as two design principles of anonymous routing in mobile ad hoc networks. We devise ANODR ( ANonymous On-Demand Routing) as the needed anonymous routing scheme that is compliant with the design principles. Our security analysis and simulation study verify the effectiveness and efficiency of ANODR.", "paper_title": "An identity-free and on-demand routing scheme against anonymity threats in mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247246300003"}
