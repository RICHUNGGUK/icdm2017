We present a novel method that resolves intersections between two intersecting surface regions by inducing relative displacements which minimize the length of the intersection contour between them. This method, which does not rely on intersection regions, has a broader application field than existing methods, and its implementation is also much simpler, allowing integration into most existing collision response schemes. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method through examples in the context of cloth simulation.", "paper_title": "Resolving surface collisions through intersection contour minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239817400079"}
