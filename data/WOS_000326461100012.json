For the economy and the efficiency reasons, the hybrid cloud environment should be able to automatically maximize the utilization rate of the private cloud and minimize the cost of the public cloud when users submit their computing jobs to the environment. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive-Scheduling-with-QoS-Satisfaction algorithm, namely AsQ, for the hybrid cloud environment to raise the resource utilization rate of the private cloud and to diminish task response time as much as possible. We exploit runtime estimation and several fast scheduling strategies for near-optimal resource allocation, which results in high resource utilization rate and low execution time in the private cloud. Moreover, the near-optimal allocation in the private cloud can reduce the amount of tasks that need to be executed on the public cloud to satisfy their deadline. For the tasks that have to be dispatched to the public cloud, we choose the minimal cost strategy to reduce the cost of using public clouds based on the characteristics of tasks such as workload size and data size. Therefore, the AsQ can achieve a total optimization regarding cost and deadline constraints. Many experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed AsQ. The results show that the performance of the proposed AsQ is superior to recent similar algorithms in terms of task waiting time, task execution time and task finish time. The results also show that the proposed algorithm achieves a better QoS satisfaction rate than other similar studies.", "paper_title": "Adaptive scheduling for parallel tasks with QoS satisfaction for hybrid cloud environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100012"}
