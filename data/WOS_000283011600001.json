Therefore, growing intention to use numerical methods has created lots of interests in developing new tools. Finite Element Method (FEM) as a fundamental numerical technique is one of the strongest tools for solving the complicated physical domains. As a pre-requisite, discretizing the domain is the first step in finite element modeling. In this paper, a particular meshing scheme based on Delaunay algorithm is presented. Although the node distribution method obtained by this algorithm has the ability to generate all types of elements such as triangular, quadrilateral, hexagonal elements among others, but here the emphasis is on 2D triangular element generation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated, and its numerical results have been presented. Eventually, several applicable examples in the field of marine engineering have been selected and meshed using the outlined algorithm. Results have shown good efficiency of the algorithm for two dimensional domains. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
