The best-possible upper bound for the set of copulas with a given opposite diagonal section being known, we focus on the best-possible lower bound, which in general is a quasi-copula. Moreover, it exhibits an interesting type of bivariate symmetry called opposite symmetry.", "paper_title": "OPPOSITE DIAGONAL SECTIONS OF QUASI-COPULAS AND COPULAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268592700002"}
