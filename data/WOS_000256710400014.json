By using the linear matrix inequality method and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, some sufficient conditions are provided for ensuring the global asymptotic stability of the unique equilibrium point of the networks. Compared with the methods given in the earlier literature, our method presented here is simpler and more straightforward. An example is provided to show the usefulness of the results.", "paper_title": "Generalized LMI-based approach to the global asymptotic stability of discrete-time delayed recurrent neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256710400014"}
