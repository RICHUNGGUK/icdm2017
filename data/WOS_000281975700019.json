This implies the implementation of an inversion procedure. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new non-iterative inversion methodology in the field of microwave characterization allowing reducing the computation cost comparatively to iterative procedures. Design/methodology/approach - The inversion methodology combines the support vector machine (SVM) technique and the finite element method (FEM). The SVM are used as inverse models. They show good approximation and generalization capabilities. FEM allows the generation of the data sets required by the SVM parameter adjustment. A data set is constituted of input (complex admittance and frequency) and output (complex permittivity) pairs. Findings - The results show the applicability of SVM to solve microwave inverse problems instead of using traditional iterative inversion methods which can be very time-consuming. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy which can be provided by the SVM technique. Practical implications - The paper allows extending the capability of microwave characterization cells developed at Laboratoire de Genie Electrique de Paris. Originality/value - A new inversion method is developed and applied to microwave characterization. This new concept introduces SVM in the context of microwave characterization. SVM results and iterative inversion procedure results are compared in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed technique.", "paper_title": "Support vector machines for measuring dielectric properties of materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000281975700019"}
