Its Newton polytope Delta(f) is the convex closure in a R(n) of the origin and the exponent vectors (viewed as points in R(n) ) of monomials in f(X). The minimal dilation of Delta(f) such that it contains at least one lattice point of Z(>0)(n) plays a vital pole in the p-adic estimate of the number of zeros of f(X) in F(q). Using this fact, we obtain several tight and computational bounds for the dilation which unify and improve a number of previous results in this direction.", "paper_title": "Dilation of Newton Polytope and p-adic Estimate", "paper_id": "WOS:000287146600010"}
