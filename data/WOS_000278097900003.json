The oscillator consists of an inverting amplifier and a feedback thermal filter that are integrated on a silicon chip. The thermal filter consists of a polysilicon heater and a MOSFET thermosensor separated from each other by a S(i)O(2) heat-conducting layer.(1) An input signal for the filter travels from the heater to the thermosensor through the S(i)O(2) layer in the form of heat. The filter accepts the output of the inverting amplifier, produces a phase shift due to the heat conduction, and returns a 180 degrees-shifted feedback signal to the amplifier. The oscillator produces oscillation at a specific frequency determined by the dimensions of the filter and the thermal conductivity and specific heat of Si and S(i)O(2).", "paper_title": "A CMOS PHASE-SHIFT OSCILLATOR BASED ON THE CONDUCTION OF HEAT", "paper_id": "WOS:000278097900003"}
