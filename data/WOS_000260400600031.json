The algorithm 1) automatically selects the most suitable images from a database of downloaded images and 2) seamlessly completes the input image using, the selected images with minimal user intervention. Experimental results on in- put images captured at various locations and scene conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in seamlessly reconstructing user-defined occlusions.", "paper_title": "An Image Completion Algorithm Using Occlusion-Free Images from Internet Photo Sharing Sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400600031"}
