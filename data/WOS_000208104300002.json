The subjects' task was to walk through a virtual aperture of variable widths. In the case of presence, the subjects' body orientation, while walking, was hypothesized to be adapted to the width of the aperture and to their own shoulder width. Results show that most subjects adapted their behavior to both their body architecture and the virtual width constraints. These subjects exhibited a behavioral transition from frontal walking to body rotation while walking through broad to narrow apertures. The same behavioral transition has already been documented in real environments (Warren and Whang in J Exp Psychol Human Percept Perform 13(3):371-383, 1987). This behavioral adjustment is thus assumed to be an objective indication of presence. Beyond these results, the present study suggests that every afforded action could be a potential tool for sensorimotor assessment of physical presence.", "paper_title": "Afforded actions as a behavioral assessment of physical presence in virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000208104300002"}
