Starting with a document list ranked by the query-likelihood retrieval model, we demonstrate the score's relationship to query ambiguity with respect to the collection. We also show that the clarity score is correlated with the average precision of a query and lay the groundwork for useful predictions by discussing a method of setting decision thresholds automatically. We then show that passage-based clarity scores correlate with average-precision measures of ranked lists of passages, where a passage is judged relevant if it contains correct answer text, which extends the basic method to passage-based systems. Next, we introduce variants of document-based clarity scores to improve the robustness, applicability, and predictive ability of clarity scores. In particular, we introduce the ranked list clarity score that can be computed with only a ranked list of documents, and the weighted clarity score where query terms contribute more than other terms. Finally, we show an approach to predicting queries that perform poorly on query expansion that uses techniques expanding on the ideas presented earlier.", "paper_title": "Precision prediction based on ranked list coherence", "paper_id": "WOS:000240803200005"}
