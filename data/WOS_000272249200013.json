In this paper, we propose one efficient algorithm to solve this problem with the help of merging texture synthesis and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) techniques. Using a single normal-sized image input, we can efficiently obtain texture sizes with different resolutions and update these in real-time rendering with the help of DWT. The results of our experiments prove that our algorithm can smoothly and efficiently render the non-uniform scenes based on viewpoint.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT MULTI-RESOLUTION TEXTURE SYNTHESIZING METHOD BASED ON WAVELET TRANSFORM", "paper_id": "WOS:000272249200013"}
