The studied electronic ballast is found to have high conversion efficiency due to its single-stage circuit with zero-voltage switching features. A high power factor can be achieved by using developed single-stage topology. The operation principles and design considerations are analyzed and discussed in detail. A laboratory prototype is designed and implemented for driving a 150 W projector lamp. The simulation and experimental waveforms are given to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A SINGLE-STAGE PHASE-SHIFTED FULL-BRIDGE ELECTRONIC BALLAST FOR HIGH-PRESSURE MERCURY LAMPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283501400007"}
