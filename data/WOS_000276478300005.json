The inspection process normally involves a visual examination according to the ripeness standards of crops, and this grading is subject to expert knowledge and interpretation. Therefore, the quality inspection process of fruits needs to be conducted properly to ensure that high-quality fruit bunches are selected for production. However, human subjective judgments during the evaluation make the fruit grading inexact. The objectives of this paper are to build a fuzzy hierarchical evaluation model that characterises the criteria of oil palm fruits to decide the fuzzy weights of these criteria based on a fuzzy regression model, and to help inspectors conduct a proper total evaluation. A numerical example is included to illustrate the computational process of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy regression approach to a hierarchical evaluation model for oil palm fruit grading", "paper_id": "WOS:000276478300005"}
