They are associated to partitions of a set X = {x (1), . . . , x (n) } of items into clusters C (1), . . . , C (k) of prescribed sizes kappa (1) a parts per thousand yen center dot center dot center dot a parts per thousand yenA kappa (k) . We derive upper bounds on the diameter in the form of kappa (1) + kappa (2), n - kappa (1) and . This is a direct generalization of the diameter-2 result for the Birkhoff polytope. The bounds are established using a constructive, graph-theoretical approach where we show that special sets of vertices in graphs that decompose into cycles can be covered by a set of vertex-disjoint cycles. Further, we give exact diameters for partition polytopes with k = 2 or k = 3 and prove that, for all k a parts per thousand yen 4 and all kappa (1), kappa (2), there are cluster sizes kappa (3), . . . , kappa (k) such that the diameter of the corresponding partition polytope is at least . Finally, we provide an algorithm for an edge-walk connecting two given vertices of a partition polytope that also adheres to our diameter bounds.", "paper_title": "On the diameter of partition polytopes and vertex-disjoint cycle cover", "paper_id": "WOS:000324232100001"}
