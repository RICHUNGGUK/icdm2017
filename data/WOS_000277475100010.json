Since the objective function in the primal optimization problem of this framework is always not differentiable, the optimal solution cannot be obtained directly. With the aid of the deterministic annealing approach, a differentiable objective function is derived subject to a constraint on the randomness of the solution. The problem can be approximated by solving a sequence of differentiable optimization problems, and such approximation converges to the original problem asymptotically. Based on this approach, class-conditional posterior probabilities can be calculated directly without assuming the underlying probabilistic model. We also notice that there is a connection between our approach and some existing statistical models, such as Fisher discriminant analysis and logistic regression. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
