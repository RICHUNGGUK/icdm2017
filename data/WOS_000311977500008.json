Key to our approach is the integration of lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge from WordNet and Wikipedia. In addition, Machine Translation is applied to enrich the resource with lexical information for all languages. We first conduct in vitro experiments on new and existing gold-standard datasets to show the high quality and coverage of BabelNet. We then show that our lexical resource can be used successfully to perform both monolingual and cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation: thanks to its wide lexical coverage and novel semantic relations, we are able to achieve state-of the-art results on three different SemEval evaluation tasks.
