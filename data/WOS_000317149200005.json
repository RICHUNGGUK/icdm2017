However, in low bit rate situations, on the whole the videos usually have relatively low visual quality while attention is paid on the videos. To improve the problem, this paper proposes Attention Emphasis bit arrangement in 3-D SPIHT video coding algorithm (AE-SPIHT) to rearrange bits efficiently from eye-insensitive regions to eye-sensitive regions, so that the whole video can obtain a better visual condition. AE-SPIHT properly exploits a bit-arrangement method rearranging bits foveately from eye-insensitive regions, according to texture content and bit-rate, to eye-sensitive ones. Experiments show that AE-SPIHT algorithm improves the visual quality of attention regions in conventional 3-D SPIHT in most cases. Compared with other bit arrangement methods, the proposed method also achieves a better visual condition in arranging the bits. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
