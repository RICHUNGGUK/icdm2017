The Isar proof language provides general principles that may be instantiated to particular object-logics and applications. We discuss specific Isar language elements that support complex induction patterns of practical importance. Despite the additional bookkeeping required for induction with local facts and parameters, definitions, simultaneous goals and multiple rules, the resulting Isar proof texts turn out well-structured and readable. Our techniques can be applied to non-standard variants of induction as well, such as co-induction and nominal induction. This demonstrates that Isar provides a viable platform for building domain-specific tools that support fully-formal mathematical proof composition.", "paper_title": "Structured induction proofs in Isabelle/Isar", "paper_id": "WOS:000239954600002"}
