In this paper, a literature survey of computer aided fixture design and automation over the past decade is proposed. First, an introduction is given on the fixture applications in industry. Then, significant works done in the CAFD field, including their approaches, requirements and working principles are discussed. Finally, some prospective research trends are also discussed.
