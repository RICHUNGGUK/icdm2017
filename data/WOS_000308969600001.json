With power consumption becoming an increasingly important issue for the operation and maintenance of the hosting centers, corporate and business owners are becoming increasingly concerned. Furthermore, provisioning resources in a cost-optimal manner so as to meet different performance criteria, such as throughput or response time, has become a critical challenge. The goal of this paper is to provide an introduction to resource provisioning and power or thermal management problems in datacenters, and to review strategies that maximize the datacenter energy efficiency subject to peak or total power consumption and thermal constraints, while meeting stipulated service level agreements in terms of task throughput and/or response time.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Datacenters", "paper_id": "WOS:000308969600001"}
