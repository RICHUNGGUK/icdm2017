Within this method, potential sites of metabolism (SOMs) are represented as \"metabolophores\": A concept that describes the hierarchical combination of topological and quantum chemical descriptors needed to represent the reactivity of potential metabolic reaction sites. RS-Predictor modeling involves the use of metabolophore descriptors together with multiple-instance ranking (MERank) to generate an optimized descriptor weight vector that encodes regioselectivity trends across all cases in a training set. The resulting pathway-independent (O-dealkylation vs N-oxidation vs Csp(3) hydroxylation, etc.), isozyme-specific regioselectivity model may be used to predict potential metabolic liabilities. In the present work, cross-validated RS-Predictor models were generated for a set of 394 substrates of CYP 3A4 as a proof-of-principle for the method. Rank aggregation was then employed to merge independently generated predictions for each substrate into a single consensus prediction. The resulting consensus RS-Predictor models were shown to reliably identify at least one observed site of metabolism in the top two rank-positions on 78% of the substrates. Comparisons between RS-Predictor and previously described regioselectivity prediction methods reveal new insights into how in silico metabolite prediction methods should be compared.", "paper_title": "RS-Predictor: A New Tool for Predicting Sites of Cytochrome P450-Mediated Metabolism Applied to CYP 3A4", "paper_id": "WOS:000293035400016"}
