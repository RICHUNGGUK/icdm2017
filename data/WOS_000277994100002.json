The nozzle placed centrally at the bottom of the cylinder ejects high-velocity hot gaseous products so that atmospheric air gets sucked into the funnel. The objective of the work is to compute the ratio of the rate of mass suction to that of the mass ejected by the nozzle for different operating conditions and geometrical size of the funnel. From the computation it has been found that there exists optimum funnel diameter and optimum funnel height for which the mass suction is the highest. The protruding length of the nozzle into the funnel has almost no effect on the mass suction rate after a certain funnel height. The louvers opening area has a very high impact on the mass suction rate. The entrance length for such a sucking funnel is strikingly much lower compared with a simple cylindrical pipe having uniform flow at the inlet at same Reynolds number. A new correlation has been developed to propose the entrance length for a sucking pipe, the rate of mass suction into it and the exhaust plume temperature over a wide range of operating parameters that are normally encountered in a general funnel operations of naval or merchant ship.
