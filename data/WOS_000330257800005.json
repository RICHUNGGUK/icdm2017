This paper presents a novel robust reversible watermarking scheme based on using the Slantlet transform matrix to transform small blocks of the original image and hiding the watermark bits by modifying the mean values of the carrier subbands. The problem of overflow/underflow has been avoided by using histogram modification process. Extensive experimental tests based on 100 general images and 100 medical images demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme has robustness against different kinds of attacks and the results prove that it is completely reversible with improved capacity, robustness, and invisibility in comparison with the previous methods.
