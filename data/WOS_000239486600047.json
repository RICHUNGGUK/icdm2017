In this paper, we present a novel feature sensitive mesh chartification technique that can handle huge meshes with limited main memory. Our technique adapts the mesh chartification approach using Lloyd-Max quantization to out-of-core processing. While the previous approach updates chartification globally at each iteration of Lloyd-Max quantization, we propose a local update algorithm where only a part of the chartification is processed at a time. By repeating the local updates, we can obtain a chartification of a huge mesh that cannot fit into the main memory. We verify the accuracy of the serialized local updates by comparing the results with the global update approach. We demonstrate that our technique can successfully process huge meshes for applications, such as mesh compression, shape approximation, and remeshing.", "paper_title": "Feature sensitive out-of-core chartification of large polygonal meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600047"}
