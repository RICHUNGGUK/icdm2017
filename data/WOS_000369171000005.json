Design/methodology/approach - The model modifies and clarifies the attributes and relationships regarding non-Roman languages of the current FRAD model, based on the definitions of transliteration, transcription, and Romanization in ISO 5127:2001. The modified model overcomes the problems inherent in the current FRAD model when handling writing systems in non-Roman languages. Findings - The proposed model clearly shows the hierarchy of Controlled Access Points (CAPs). CAPs are either based directly on names or derived from other CAPs. For name or person identification, a CAP and its derivations should be treated as a set. The proposed model also resolves ambiguity in the definition of the word transliteration in the current FRAD model. Originality/value - By establishing new relationships and amending the attributes of the FRADmodel, the proposed model better expresses personal names in non-Roman languages as well as names in western languages. It also organizes complex writing systems of non-Roman languages. The proposed model could lead to an improved format for authority data and will facilitate international sharing of data.", "paper_title": "A modification of the FRAD model for personal names in non-Roman languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000369171000005"}
