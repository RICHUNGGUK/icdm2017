Analysis of the relations between the input and the output variables reveals that this oscillating chemical reaction is suitable to process infinite-valued fuzzy logic, and that all fundamental fuzzy logic operators (AND, OR, NOT) can be implemented with it. We discuss the possibility for biological oscillators such as neurons or pacemaker cells to process information using principles of fuzzy logic.", "paper_title": "Belousov-Zhabotinsky \"Chemical Neuron\" as a Binary and Fuzzy Logic Processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000305599300005"}
