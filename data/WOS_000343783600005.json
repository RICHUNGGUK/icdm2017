We discuss at length the definitions of quantaloid, quantaloid-enriched category, distributor and functor, always giving several examples that - hopefully - appeal to the intended readership. To indicate the strength of this general theory, we explain in considerable detail how (co)limits are dealt with, and particularly how the Yoneda embedding of a quantaloid-enriched category in its free (co)completion comes to be. Our insistence on quantaloid-enrichment (rather than quantale-enrichment) is duly explained by examples requiring a notion of \"partial elements\" (sheaves, partial metric spaces). A final section glosses over some further topics, providing ample references for the interested reader. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
