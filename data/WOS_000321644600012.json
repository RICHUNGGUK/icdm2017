Yet lack of complete knowledge of transitions and the associated rates is one major challenge for accurate KMC predictions. In this paper, a reliable KMC (R-KMC) mechanism is proposed in which sampling is based on random sets instead of random numbers to improve the robustness of KMC results. In R-KMC, rates or propensities are interval estimates instead of precise numbers. A multi-event algorithm based on generalized interval probability is developed. The weak convergence of the multi-event algorithm towards the traditional KMC is demonstrated with a generalized Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.", "paper_title": "Reliable kinetic Monte Carlo simulation based on random set sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000321644600012"}
