The learners joined the online Independent English Study Group (IESG) and worked both individually and collaboratively. This qualitative case study aims (a) to assess college-level ESL learners' use of reading strategies for online second language (L2) texts and (b) to examine their use of hypertext and hypermedia resources while they read online L2 text. The seven strategies were (a) using hypermedia, (b) using computer applications and accessories, (c) dialoguing, (d) setting up reading purposes and planning, (e) previewing and determining what to read, (f) connecting prior knowledge and experiences with texts and tasks, and (g) inferring. The first two strategies were unique to online readings: the five remaining strategies apply to both online readings and paper-based text readings. The findings also revealed that \"hybrid\" online reading emphasized participants' various reaction patterns and preferences in their hypermedia learning environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
