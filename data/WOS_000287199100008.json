This algorithm works for all types of semi-online restrictions, including the ones studied before, like sorted (decreasing) jobs, known sum of processing times, known maximal processing time, their combinations, and so on. Based on the analysis of this algorithm, we derive some global relations between various semi-online restrictions and tight bounds on the approximation ratios for a small number of machines.", "paper_title": "Semi-Online Preemptive Scheduling: One Algorithm for All Variants", "paper_id": "WOS:000287199100008"}
