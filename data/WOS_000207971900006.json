In this paper, we review these protocols with a particular focus on security aspects. The protocols differ in terms of routing methodologies and the information used to make routing decisions. Four representative routing protocols are chosen for analysis and evaluation including: Ad Hoc on demand Distance Vector routing (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA). Secure ad hoc networks have to meet five security requirements: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and availability. The analyses of the secure versions of the proposed protocols are discussed with respect to the above security requirements.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Secure Mobile Ad Hoc Routing Protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971900006"}
