By the use of the static condensation technique at the element level, the extra computation time in using these elements can be ignored. Plane stress problems are used as examples in this paper. The numerical results show that these enriched elements are more accurate than the traditional serendipity elements. The convergence rate of the proposed elements is the same as the traditional serendipity elements. The error norm of the second and third order proposed elements can be reduced from 40% to 60% when compared with the use of the traditional serendipity elements. In the numerical examples, the use of the second and third order proposed elements not only give an improvement in element accuracy but also save computation time, when the precondition conjugate gradient method is used to solve the system of equations. The saving of computation time is due to the decrease of iteration number in iteration method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
