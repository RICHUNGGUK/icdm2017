Greedy routing is applied first and may fail at concave nodes, in which case, face routing is applied to recover from the greedy fail. This may cause extra hops in routing and decrease the routing efficiency in networks containing voids. In this paper, we propose a Hill-Area-Restricted (HAR) routing protocol. It avoids the extra hops as in the original GFG routing, which makes it more efficient in hop count. Compared with the previous work of Node Elevation Ad hoc Routing (NEAR), the proposed HAR guarantees the packet delivery and decreases the communication cost largely. Our simulation results show that the communication cost in bytes of all messages sent by each node in the proposed HAR is 99.2% less than that in NEAR. This makes the HAR more desirable for mobile ad hoc and sensor networks.", "paper_title": "A Hill-Area-Restricted Geographic Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307171400003"}
