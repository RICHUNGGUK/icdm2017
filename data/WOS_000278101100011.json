This work develops a fast, accurate, and robust method for the computation of the three-dimensional orientation distribution function for individual grains of the material in consideration. We study two iterative large-scale reconstruction algorithms, the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and conjugate gradients for least squares (CGLS), and demonstrate that right preconditioning is necessary in both algorithms to provide satisfactory reconstructions. Our right preconditioner is not a traditional one that accelerates convergence; its purpose is to modify the smoothness properties of the reconstruction. We also show that a new stopping criterion, based on the information available in the residual vector, provides a robust choice of the number of iterations for these preconditioned methods.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of Single-Grain Orientation Distribution Functions for Crystalline Materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101100011"}
