Now, instead of buying their own IT resources, they can use the services offered by Cloud Computing with reasonable costs based on a \"pay-per-use\" model. However, with the wide adoption of Cloud Computing, the costs for maintaining the Cloud infrastructure have become a vital issue for the providers, especially with the large input of energy costs to underpin these resources. Thus, this paper proposes a system architecture that can be used for profiling the resources usage in terms of the energy consumption. From the profiled data, the application developers can enhance their energy-aware decisions when creating or optimising the applications to be more energy efficient. This paper also presents an adapted existing Cloud architecture to enable energy-aware profiling based on the proposed system. The results of the conducted experiments show energy-awareness at physical host and virtual machine levels.", "paper_title": "Energy-Aware Profiling for Cloud Computing Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000365198300007"}
