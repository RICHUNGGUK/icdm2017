In this paper, we formulate the data extraction problem as the decoding process of page generation based on structured data and tree templates. We propose an unsupervised, page-level data extraction approach to deduce the schema and templates for each individual Deep Website, which contains either singleton or multiple data records in one Webpage. FiVaTech applies tree matching, tree alignment, and mining techniques to achieve the challenging task. In experiments, FiVaTech has much higher precision than EXALG and is comparable with other record-level extraction systems like ViPER and MSE. The experiments show an encouraging result for the test pages used in many state-of-the-art Web data extraction works.", "paper_title": "FiVaTech: Page-Level Web Data Extraction from Template Pages", "paper_id": "WOS:000272838500007"}
