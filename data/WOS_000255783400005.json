We discuss two discretization methods for Delaunay meshes that are based on the unstructured neighborhood information. In addition a comparison to an element based method is given. Overall good convergence is achieved by applying these methods in a TCAD environment for the calculation of the driving force, electric field, and the current density vector. An example simulation of a diode in breakdown and a bipolar structure in snap-back operation is presented.", "paper_title": "Vector discretization schemes in technology CAD environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000255783400005"}
