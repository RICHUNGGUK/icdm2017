This and some related statistics which we discuss, can also be interpreted within the context of bargraph polygons and bargraph walks of area n. In this context, absolute variation corresponds to the interior vertical perimeter of a bargraph polygon or to the interior vertical length of a bargraph walk.", "paper_title": "Variation Statistics on Compositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000305269500003"}
