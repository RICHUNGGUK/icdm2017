However, this property cannot be adopted to optimize the problem of a linear fractional objective function. This study presents an efficient method to optimize such a linear fractional programming problem. First, some theoretical results are developed based on the properties of max-Archimedean t-norm composition. The result is used to reduce the feasible domain. The problem can thus be simplified and converted into a traditional linear fractional programming problem, and eventually optimized in a small search space. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the procedure. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
