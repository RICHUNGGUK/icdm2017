By the combination of fuzzy logic systems and an HGO, the state variables are not required to be measurable. The proposed feedback and adaptation mechanisms guarantee that each subsystem is able to adaptively compensate for interconnections and disturbances with unknown bounds. It is ascertained using a singular perturbation method that all the signals of the closed-loop large-scale system stand uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking errors converge to tunable neighbourhoods of the origin. Simulation results of correlated double inverted pendulums substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "HGO-based decentralised indirect adaptive fuzzy control for a class of large-scale nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000302231300011"}
