Known wide-sense nonblocking distributors are either having high costs or not efficiently routable. We present a wide-sense nonblocking distributor of O(N log N) cost, O(log N) diameter, O(N log N) control cost, and O(log N) routing time. This is the first wide-sense nonblocking distributor that is optimal in all four aspects.", "paper_title": "An Optimal Wide-Sense Nonblocking Distributor", "paper_id": "WOS:000283718100011"}
