Lately, due to the complementary nature of these areas, there is a growing trend in integrating them to support various applications that can go beyond passive monitoring and allow us to actually interact with the environment through autonomous and teleoperated robots. Such applications can extensively be used in medicine, science, military, industry, nuclear power stations, underwater, and space explorations. In this paper, we start with a review of the history of WSNs, robotics and mobility in WSNs, and teleoperation. We then introduce a system model integrating these areas as Wireless Sensor and Robot Networks with Teleoperation capabilities (WSRNT). Using this model, we define the problems associated with WSRNT. Finally, we discuss the recent research efforts and open research challenges in merging these fields with respect to major WSRNT tasks and communication requirements. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
