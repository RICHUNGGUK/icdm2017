A Lyapunov function, which is quadratic in the state and presents a multi-polynomial dependence on the fuzzy weighting functions at the current and past instants of time, is proposed.This function contains, as particular cases, other previous Lyapunov functions already used in the literature, being able to provide less conservative conditions of control design for TS fuzzy systems. The structure of the proposed Lyapunov function also motivates the design of a new stabilising compensator for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems. The main novelty of the proposed state feedback control law is that the gain is composed of matrices with multi-polynomial dependence on the fuzzy weighting functions at a set of past instants of time, including the current one. The conditions for the existence of a stabilising state feedback control law that minimises an upper bound to the [GRAPHICS] or [GRAPHICS] norms are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical examples show that the approach can be less conservative and more efficient than other methods available in the literature.", "paper_title": "H-infinity and H-2 nonquadratic stabilisation of discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno systems based on multi-instant fuzzy Lyapunov functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000344245000006"}
