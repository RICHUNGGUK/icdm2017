So far, we had developed a model for conceptual design of lean production systems by means of FR-DP relationships, the key characteristics of axiomatic design (AD) methodology, appeared in the proceedings of Second International Conference of Axiomatic Design. Albeit the model in question was thorough enough to be applied in various cases, its embedded abstract principles hamper straightforward applications and the required resources, tools, and techniques are not clarified. In AD terms, it lacks PVs created by mapping the design parameters (DPs) to the process domain to clarify the means that produce the specified DPs. Owing to the difficulties involved in the definition of PVs for manufacturing systems, there is few works in this area. This paper is an attempt to introduce PVs in production system design. When we are developing a product (i.e. a part), we can simply interpret the set of PVs as the process design. In the case of a production system we interpret PVs as the tools, methods, and resources, required for implementing a lean production system. In this paper, according to AD methodology, we have developed a hierarchical structure to model the design process of a lean production system, composed of FRs, DPs, and PVs. Serving as an efficient guideline for the design process and clarifying the required tools, methods, and resources, this structure is general enough to be applied for different cases.
