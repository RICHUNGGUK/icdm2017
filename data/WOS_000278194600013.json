Quantifying the purity of an experimentally achieved graph state could in principle be accomplished using full-state tomography. This method requires a number of measurement settings growing exponentially with the number of constituents involved. Thus, full-state tomography becomes experimentally infeasible even for a moderate number of qubits. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the purity of experimentally achieved graph states with simple measurements. The observables we consider are the stabilizers of the underlying graph. Then, we formulate the problem as: \"What is the state with the least purity that is compatible with the measurement data?\" We solve this problem analytically and compare the obtained bounds with results from full-state tomography for simulated data.", "paper_title": "ESTIMATING PURITY AND ENTROPY IN STABILIZER STATE EXPERIMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194600013"}
