A construction of binary sequences with three-level autocorrelation was recently presented. This construction is generic and powerful in the sense that many classes of binary sequences with three-level autocorrelation could be obtained from any difference set with Singer parameters. The objective of this paper is to determine both the linear complexity and the minimal polynomial of two classes of binary sequences, i.e., the class based on the Singer difference set, and the class based on the GMW difference set.", "paper_title": "The Linear Complexity of Some Binary Sequences With Three-Level Autocorrelation", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700029"}
