The corpus is recorded under unscripted interview and conversational settings from 157 Singaporean and Malaysian speakers who spoke a mixture of Mandarin and English within a single sentence. About 82 % of the transcribed utterances are intra-sentential code-switching speech and the corpus will be release by LDC in 2015. This paper presents an analysis of the code-switching statistics of the corpus, such as the duration of monolingual segments and the frequency of language turns in code-switch utterances. We also summarize the development effort, details such as the processing time for transcription, validation and language boundary labelling. Lastly, we present textual analyses of code-switch segments examining the word length of monolingual segments in code-switch utterances and the most common single word and two-word phrase of such segments.", "paper_title": "Mandarin-English code-switching speech corpus in South-East Asia: SEAME", "paper_id": "WOS:000358361300004"}
