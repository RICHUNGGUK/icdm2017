We amplify the estimated clean speech signal at the far-end based on the estimated ambient noise spectrum at the near-end, as opposed to reinforcing the noisy far-end speech signal, so that it can be heard more intelligibly in far-end noisy environments. To obtain an effective reinforcement technique, we adopt the soft decision scheme incorporating a speech absence probability (SAP) in the frequency dependent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) recovery method where the clean speech spectrum is estimated and the reinforcement gain is inherently derived and modified within the unified framework. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated by a subjective testing under various noisy environments. This is an improvement over previous approaches.", "paper_title": "Speech Reinforcement Based on Soft Decision under Far-End Noise Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648400042"}
