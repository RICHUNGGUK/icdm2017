In TOD mode, a few traffic patterns that exist in the historical volume data are recognized and used to find the signal timing plans needed to achieve optimum performance of the intersections during the day. Traffic engineers usually determine TOD breakpoints by analyzing 1 or 2 days worth of traffic data and relying on their engineering judgment. The current statistical methods, such as hierarchical and K-means clustering methods, determine TOD breakpoints but introduce a large number of transitions. This paper proposes adopting the Z-score of the traffic flow and time variable in the K-means clustering to reduce the number of transitions. The numbers of optimum breakpoints are chosen based on a microscopic simulation model considering a set of performance measures. By using simulation and the K-means algorithm, it was found that five clusters are the optimum for a major arterial in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. As an alternative to the simulation-based approach, a subtractive algorithm-based K-means technique is introduced to determine the optimum number of TODs. Through simulation, it was found that both approaches results in almost the same values of measure of effectiveness (MOE). The proposed two approaches seem promising for similar studies in other regions, and both of them can be extended for different types of roads. The paper also suggests a procedure for considering the cyclic nature of the daily traffic in the clustering effort. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000099.
