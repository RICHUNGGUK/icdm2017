As a result, digital literacy, an essential skill for career development, lifelong learning, freedom of expression and social inclusion, is now one of the most important issues facing women today. The aim of this study was to identify the key factors and the possible mechanisms that motivate middle-aged and older females to acquire and utilize ICT skills. Drawing on Social Cognitive and Social Capital theories, we developed a theoretical model and validated it through Partial Least Squares (PLS) and mediation analyses. A survey was administered to 181 participants in an ICT learning program for digital-illiterate and middle-aged females. 133 responses were available for final analysis. The study revealed that social capital does not directly predict computer self-efficacy but depends on learning satisfaction as a mediator. In other words, unless participants develop a sense of satisfaction in class learning, a high level of social capital may not transfer into a high level of computer self-efficacy. In addition, our study shows that computer self-efficacy mediates the relationship between learning satisfaction and ICT usage, and that ICT usage and social capital both predict increases in subjective well-being. ICT utilization plays an important role in the well-being of the middle-aged and older females who often are unable to use ICT regularly due to their cultural roles. This study provides practical implications for the delivery of ICT training programs for females and other under-privileged groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
