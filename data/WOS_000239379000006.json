It is one characteristic that is used for segregating wheat to meet the needs for various products. Kernel virteousness is a visual marker for hardness and is the characteristic assessed during the grading process. The potential of classifying vitreous and non-vitreous durum wheat kernels, in c-ease-down position, using imaging systems based on real time soft X-rays or transmitted light was assessed in this study. Durum wheat kernels at 14, 15 and 16% moisture contents were used as samples in this study. Image features modeling gray level distribution, textural and shape moments were measured and used to develop a classification system for vitreous and non-vitreous durum wheat kernels. The classification accuracies were 76% for vitreous kernels and 82% for non-vitreous kernels at 16% moisture content using the soft X-ray system but for the transmitted light system, the classification accuracies were 86% for vitreous and 93% for non-vitreous kernels. Moisture content had no effect on classifying vitreous or non-vitreous kernels by the transmitted light system but the classification accuracies increased with moisture content for non-vitreous kernels by the soft X-ray system.
