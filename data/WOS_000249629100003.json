The block modes and motion vectors in the MPEG-4 bitstream are utilized in the H.264 encoder for the block mode conversion and motion vector interpolation methods. Four types of motion vector interpolation methods are proposed in order to avoid the use of brute-force motion estimation in H.264. According to the experimental results, the proposed methods achieve a 3 similar to 4 times improvement in the computational complexity compared to the cascade pixel-domain transcoding method, while the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) is degraded by 0.2 similar to 0.9 dB depending on the bitrates.", "paper_title": "MPEG-4 to H.264 transcoding with frame rate reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000249629100003"}
