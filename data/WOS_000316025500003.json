The surface of the domain is implicitly described through a level set function and the moving boundary is determined by the time-dependent dynamic knots of the radial basis functions (RBFs). A method of Partition of Unity (POU) is leveraged to calculate the solution, which divides the domain into some smaller overlapping local sub-domains and reconstructs them into the global surface with less numerical cost. Apart from the convergence properties, numerical results are given and discussed.", "paper_title": "Parametric structural optimization with dynamic knot RBFs and partition of unity method", "paper_id": "WOS:000316025500003"}
