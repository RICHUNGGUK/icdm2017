A new technique for leak detection is presented and this was accomplished by combining back-propagation neural network, discrete wavelet transformation (DWT), and continuous transformation (CWT). Different types of BPNN models were constructed with raw, DWT, and CWT data and these are referred to as raw, DWT, and CWT models, respectively. Constructed models were validated with a total of 47 data sets for normal and leaky chamber conditions. The experimental data were in-situ collected by using an optical emission spectroscopy. Both raw and DWT models could detect all abnormal data sets. Worst detection by CWT model was noted. Wider detection margin provided by DWT model was attributed to enhanced sensitivity of model to leaky condition. A modified cumulative control chart was applied to the statistical mean of raw OES spectra as well as to DWT and CWT data. The statistical mean-based CUSUM control chart was unable to detect chamber leaks. In contrast, chamber leaks could be identified by all model-based CUSUM control charts. Of the proposed models, DWT model is identified to be the most appropriate to chamber leak detection. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
