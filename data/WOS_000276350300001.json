We introduce the notion of deterministic tiling system and the corresponding family of languages (DREC) and study its structural and closure properties. Furthermore we show that, in contrast with the one-dimensional case, there exist other classes between deterministic and non-deterministic families that we separate by means of examples and decidability properties.", "paper_title": "Deterministic and Unambiguous Families within Recognizable Two-dimensional Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000276350300001"}
