At the same time, considerable development has taken place regarding statistical evaluation paradigms for such markers. As a consequence, such endpoints are given more extensive consideration for practice than previously had been the case. A particular but important instance is where the true endpoint is the ultimate assessment in a sequence of repeated measures. It is then appealing to consider earlier measures, either in isolation or several combined, as a potential surrogate endpoint. The length and cost reducing potential has to be weighed carefully against loss in precision and the risks of an inappropriate decision regarding a new compound's fate. Quantitative criteria to do so are developed, embedded in a meta-analytic framework. The methodology's behavior is assessed through simulations and applied to data from a pair of clinical trials, one in ophthalmology and one in schizophrenia. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
