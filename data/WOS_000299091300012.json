For both systems, increments and decrements are supported using a constant number of digit changes per operation. Moreover, for the regular skew system, the operation of adding two numbers is supported efficiently. Our basic message is that some data-structural problems are better formulated at the level of a numeral system. The relationship between number representations and data representations, as well as operations on them, can be utilized for an elegant description and a clean analysis of algorithms. In many cases, a pure mathematical treatment may also be interesting in its own right. As an application of numeral systems to data structures, we consider how to implement a priority queue as a forest of pointer-based binary heaps. Some of the number-representation features that influence the efficiency of the priority-queue operations include weighting of digits, carry-propagation and borrowing mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Two Skew-Binary Numeral Systems and One Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000299091300012"}
