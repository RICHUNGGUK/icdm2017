BPR is based on a known property of Y that games can be reduced to a single value indicating the fully connected player (if any) through a sequence of reduction operations. We adapt this process for bitwise-parallel implementation and demonstrate its benefit over a range of board sizes. BPR is by far the fastest known method if connection tests only need to be performed once per game, for example, to evaluate board fills following Monte Carlo playouts.", "paper_title": "Bitwise-Parallel Reduction for Connection Tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000305586300004"}
