The Crank-Nicolson scheme is used for time integration. The accuracy and stability of the loosely coupled solution algorithm are analyzed analytically. Based on the accuracy analysis, the design order of the time integration scheme is preserved by following a predictor (implicit)-corrector (explicit) approach. Hence, the need to perform an additional implicit solve (a subiteration) at each time step is avoided. The analytical stability analysis shows that by using the Crank-Nicolson scheme for time integration, the partitioned algorithm is unstable for large Fourier numbers, unlike the monolithic approach. Accordingly, using the stability analysis, a stability criterion is obtained for the Crank-Nicolson scheme that imposes restriction on t given the material properties and mesh spacings of the coupled domains. As the ratio of the thermal effusivities of the coupled domains reaches unity, the stability of the algorithm reduces. To demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm, a numerical example is considered (an unsteady conjugate natural convection in an enclosure).
