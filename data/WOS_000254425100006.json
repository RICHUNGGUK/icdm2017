Xu's method. By incorporating translation invariant wavelet transform, minimizers of the new methods can be understood as the alternative to translation invariant wavelet shrinkage with weight that is dependent on the wavelet decomposition scale and the Besov smooth order. And we generalize the iterative regularization methods to a new class of nonlinear inverse scale spaces with scale and Besov smooth order dependent weight. The numerical results show an excellent denoising effect and improvement over J.
