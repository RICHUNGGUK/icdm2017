In this work, we put forward a framework (called as transpositional thinking principle) for reasoning about and predicting the behavior of others and propose an approach to planning the cooperation among agents based on the principle. By using the principle, agents can richen their understanding about the behavior patterns of their partners and then infer their partners' actions more and more accurately. The experiments show that the cooperation among agents will be performed more efficiently and at a low cost when agents can anticipate the behavior of others with a high enough accuracy.", "paper_title": "MULTI-AGENT COOPERATION VIA REASONING ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273990300003"}
