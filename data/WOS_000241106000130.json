We have proposed a Computer Aided Diagnosis and monitoring system framework for the high risk patient exploiting the ubiquitous artifacts available in the contemporary medical environment. The proposed framework monitors patients using bio signal devices while they are staying at their homes. Furthermore, the agent based learning process is used to make intelligent inferences and adaptive learning of these private data using Computer Aided Diagnosis system. It can monitor acute COPD using integrated home medical server. The services include prevention, emergency call center and ambulance service in a common platform of ubiquitous environment.", "paper_title": "Neural based CAD and CAP agent system framework for high risk patients in ubiquitous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000130"}
