This approach consists of a log-linear combination of a translation model based on n-grams of bilingual units, which are referred to as tuples, along with four specific feature functions. Translation performance, which happens to be in the state of the art, is demonstrated with Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish translations of the European Parliament Plenary Sessions (EPPS).", "paper_title": "N-gram-based machine translation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242377300004"}
