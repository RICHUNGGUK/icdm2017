Coupled map lattices (CML) is introduced to the market maker framework. It results in market cluster sharing the same sign of deviation in the chaotic interval. Distribution plots are applied to understand the deviation persistence enhancement from the coupling effect. Besides that, external disturbance is employed to the system to examine the market pattern stability and the propagation of the disturbance. The goal of the paper is to introduce coupling effect as a bridge for multi-market interactions with heterogeneous agents. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
