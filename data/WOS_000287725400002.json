Their effectiveness depends, to a large degree, on the ability of domain experts to retrieve information from them ad-hoc. For large scale models, however, existing query facilities are inadequate. The visual model query language (VMQL) is a novel approach that uses the respective modeling language of the source model as the query language, too. The semantics of VMQL is defined formally based on graphs, so that query execution can be defined as graph matching. VMQL has been applied to several visual modeling languages, implemented, and validated in small case studies, and several controlled experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
