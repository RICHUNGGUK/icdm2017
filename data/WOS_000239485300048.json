The WNN is trained by a heuristic algorithm and can generate a random sequence which is used for encrypting and decrypting. Furthermore, some simulated experiments, including key space analysis, key sensitivity test, statistical analysis, are performed to substantiate that our scheme can make cipher-text more confusion and diffusion and that the method can resist several attacks, effectively.", "paper_title": "A novel cryptographic scheme based on wavelet neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300048"}
