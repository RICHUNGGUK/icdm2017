The SNP ratio test (SRT) compares the proportion of significant to all SNPs within genes that are part of a pathway and computes an empirical P-value based on comparisons to ratios in datasets where the assignment of case/control status has been randomized. We applied the SRT to a Parkinson's disease GWAS dataset, using the KEGG database, revealing significance for Parkinson's disease and related pathways.", "paper_title": "The SNP ratio test: pathway analysis of genome-wide association datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000270685200029"}
