In this paper, we propose a moving target oriented opportunistic routing algorithm in vehicular networks for message delivery from information source to a moving target vehicle. In order to adapt the constantly changing topology of networks, the forwarding decisions are made locally by each intermediate vehicle based on the trajectory information of the target vehicle. The simulation and real trace experiment show that our design provides an efficient message delivery with a higher success ratio, shorter success time, and lower transmission overhead compared with other reference approaches.", "paper_title": "Moving Target Oriented Opportunistic Routing Algorithm in Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317511000001"}
