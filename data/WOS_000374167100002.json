The methodology is generic in nature and can generate a baseline population for cities for which detailed population summary tables are not available. The joint probabilities of population demographics are estimated using the International Public Use Microsimulation Data (IPUMS) sample set. Agents are assigned various activities based on several characteristics. The agent-based model for the city of Lahore, Pakistan is synthesized and a rule based disease spread model of influenza is simulated. The simulation results are visualized to produce semantic analysis for the spatio-temporal dynamics of the epidemic. The results show that the proposed model can be used by officials and medical experts to simulate an outbreak.", "paper_title": "A Knowledge Driven Agent-Based Semantic Model for Epidemic Surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000374167100002"}
