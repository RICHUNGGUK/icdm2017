This augmented solver involves the presence of the source terms, ensuring convergence to the exact solution by including an extra wave associated to the change in the material properties and the friction term. The resulting numerical scheme is energy-balanced, that is, ensures equilibrium in rest conditions and is able to ensure numerically a constant level of energy in steady cases with velocity. The resulting numerical solver allows simulating directly mass transport without creating non-physical oscillations. The numerical scheme is assessed using steady and unsteady problems with exact solutions and is compared with models of the systemic arterial tree published in literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
