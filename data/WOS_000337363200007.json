The sensor failures are assumed to happen in a random way, namely, randomly occurring sensor failures (ROSF), and the failure probability is governed by a random variable obeying the Bernoulli distribution. The stochastic nonlinearities described by statistical means could cover several types of well-studied stochastic nonlinearities. The purpose of this problem is to design an output feedback controller such that the closed-loop system meets the desired H-infinity performance over a finite horizon. Sufficient condition for the existence of the desired controller is given, where the feedback gains at each time point k can be obtained by solving certain convex optimisation problems iteratively. A numerical computing algorithm is presented, and then a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Reliable H-infinity control for a class of nonlinear time-varying stochastic systems with randomly occurring sensor failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363200007"}
