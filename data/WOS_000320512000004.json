This measure is used to assess the patient condition, mainly in hypertension and it is computed as the ratio between artery and vein widths. To this end, the vessels are segmented and measured in several circumferences concentric to the optic nerve. The resulting vessel segments at each radius are classified as artery or vein independently. After that, a tracking procedure joins vessel segments in different radii that belong to the same vessel. Finally, a voting system is applied to obtain the final class of the whole vessel. The methodology has been tested in a data set of 100 images labeled manually by two medical experts and a classification rate of over 87.68 % has been obtained.", "paper_title": "Improving retinal artery and vein classification by means of a minimal path approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000320512000004"}
