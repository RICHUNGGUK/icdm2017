At the same time the change of a few terms should not cause a significant decrease of the N-adic complexity. This requirement leads to the concept of the k-error N-adic complexity. In this paper, an algorithm for upper bounding the k-error N-adic complexity of the sequence with period T = p(n), and p is just a prime, is proposed by extending the 2-adic complexity synthesis algorithm of Wilfried Meidl, and the Stamp-Martin algorithm. This algorithm is the first concrete construction of the algorithm for calculating the k-error N-adic complexity. Using the algorithm proposed, the upper bound of the k-error N-adic complexity can be obtained in n steps.", "paper_title": "Computing the k-error N-adic complexity of a sequence of period p(n)", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000016"}
