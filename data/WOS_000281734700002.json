Traditionally, User Stories are used in agile projects to describe a system's usage scenarios and are utilized as a basis for developing acceptance tests. This paper introduces a technique that aims to achieve the benefits of acceptance testing within large-scale development projects that deploy a V-model development process, specifically those that utilize use case models. The approach is based on utilizing a number of artifacts: use case models supported by robustness diagrams and domain models. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to a real-world system-the RestoMapper system. The results show that a comprehensive set of acceptance tests can be developed based upon use case models.", "paper_title": "Developing comprehensive acceptance tests from use cases and robustness diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000281734700002"}
