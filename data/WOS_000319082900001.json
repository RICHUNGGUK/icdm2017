This algebraic framework is then applied to the modified Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model in order to obtain the time evolution of certain special parameters related to the Robertson-Schrodinger (RS) uncertainty principle and some particular proposals of entanglement measure based on collective angular-momentum generators. Our results reinforce the connection between both the squeezing and entanglement effects, as well as allow to investigate the basic role of spin correlations through the discrete representatives of quasiprobability distribution functions. Entropy functionals are also discussed in this context. The main sequence correlations bar right arrow entanglement bar right arrow squeezing of quantum effects embraces a new set of insights and interpretations in this framework, which represents an effective gain for future researches in different spin systems.", "paper_title": "SPIN SQUEEZING AND ENTANGLEMENT VIA FINITE-DIMENSIONAL DISCRETE PHASE-SPACE DESCRIPTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000319082900001"}
