A dynamic slicing method was proposed for non-parametric dependence testing, which has been demonstrated to have higher powers compared with traditional methods such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We introduce an R package dslice to facilitate the use of dynamic slicing method in bioinformatic applications such as quantitative trait loci study and gene set enrichment analysis.", "paper_title": "dslice: an R package for nonparametric testing of associations with application in QTL and gene set analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000356625300022"}
