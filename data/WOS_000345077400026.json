However, DF assumes infinite buffer space that is not possible in real time applications. In addition, quality value computation considers the encountering history and does not account for additional network parameters such as aging and transitive connectivity. In this paper, we have proposed a routing protocol called as DF++ that compute quality value based on probabilistic model used in PRoPHET protocol and forwards the message to current node by adaptive computation of available buffer space. We have compared performance of DF++ with DF, Epidemic and PRoPHET routing protocols. The proposed DF++ has higher delivery probability and fewer message drop and transmissions.", "paper_title": "DF plus plus : an adaptive buffer-aware probabilistic delegation forwarding protocol for Delay Tolerant Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000345077400026"}
