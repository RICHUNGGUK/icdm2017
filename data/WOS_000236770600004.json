In this paper, we develop and analyze Cluster Overlay Broadcast (COB), a low-complexity routing algorithm for MANETs. COB runs on top of a one-hop cluster cover of the network, which can be created and maintained using, for instance, the Least Cluster Change (LCC) algorithm. We formally prove that the LCC algorithm maintains a cluster cover with a constant density of cluster leaders with minimal update cost. COB discovers routes by flooding (broadcasting) route requests through the network of cluster leaders with a doubling radius technique. Building on the constant density property of the network of cluster leaders, we formally prove that, if there exists a route from a source to a destination node with a minimum hop count of Delta, then COB discovers a route with at most O(Delta) hops from the source to the destination node in at most O(Delta) time and by sending at most O(Delta(2)) messages. We prove this result for arbitrary node distributions and mobility patterns and also show that COB adapts asymptotically optimally to the mobility of the nodes. In our simulation experiments, we examine the network layer performance of COB, compare it with Dynamic Source Routing, and investigate the impact of the MAC layer on COB routing.", "paper_title": "Cluster Overlay Broadcast (COB): MANET routing with complexity polynomial in source-destination distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000236770600004"}
