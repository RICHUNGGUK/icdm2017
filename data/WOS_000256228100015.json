Our study aims at evaluating acceptance, usability and learning effect of the CBT system virtX that simulates C-arm based X-ray imaging in the context of surgical case scenarios. Methods: Prospective, interventional study conducted during an ORP course with three groups: intervention group 1(training on a PC using virtX), and 2 (virtX with a C-arm as input device), and a control group (training without virtX) - IV1, IV2 and CG. All participants finished training with the some exercise. Time needed to produce an image of sufficient quality was recorded and analyzed using One-Way-ANOVA and Dunnett post hoc test (alpha=.05). Acceptance and usability of virtX have been evaluated using a questionnaire. Results. CG members (n = 21) needed more time for the exercise than those of IV2 (n = 20): 133 +/- 55 vs. 101 +/- 37 sec. (p=.03). IV1 (n = 12) also performed better than CG (128 48 sec.), but this was not statistically significant. Seventy-nine participants returned a questionnaire (81% female, age 34 +/- 9 years, professional experience 8.3 +/- 7.6 years, 77% regularly used a C-arm). 83% considered virtX a useful addition to conventional C-arm training. 91% assessed virtual radiography as helpful for understanding C-arm operation. Conclusions. Trainees experienced virtX as substantial enhancement of C-arm training. Training with virtX can reduce the time needed to perform an imaging task.", "paper_title": "virtX - Evaluation of a computer-based training system for mobile C-arm systems in trauma and orthopedic surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000256228100015"}
