Whenever operation is completed in processing element (PE) at the present stage, every possible current source in the PE at the previous stage is cut off, which greatly reduces the wasted power dissipation due to steady current flows during standby states. The completion of the operation can be easily detected using \"operation monitor\" that observes input and output signals at latches, and that generates control signal immediately at the time completed. Since the wires of data and control signals are shared in the proposed MVCM circuit, no additional wires are required for current-flow control. In fact, it is demonstrated that the power consumption of the MVCM circuit using the proposed method is reduced to 53 percent in comparison with that without current-source control.", "paper_title": "Energy-Aware Multiple-Valued Current-Mode Sequential Circuits Using a Completion-Detection Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342300009"}
