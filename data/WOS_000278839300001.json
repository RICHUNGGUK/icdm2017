In this paper, it shows that DEMATEL is the specific case of fuzzy decision maps (FDM) when the threshold function is linear. Both FDM and DEMATEL have the same direct and indirect influence matrix. FDM incorporates the eigenvalue method, the fuzzy cognitive maps, and the weighting equation. In addition two numerical examples are illustrated to demonstrate the proposed results. On the basis of the mathematical proof and numerical results, we can conclude that FDM is a generalization of DEMATEL method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy decision maps: a generalization of the DEMATEL methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000278839300001"}
