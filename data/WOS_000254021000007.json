Volume sources from the rod wake are found to play a non-negligible role at high frequencies and surface contributions might be flawed if the surfaces cross highly turbulent flow regions even if surrounding volume terms are accounted for. The DES approach is based on a novel cubic explicit algebraic stress turbulence model which is built on a two-equation k-epsilon model from Lien and Lechziner. This DES has been recently implemented at the Berlin University of Technology in the compressible Navier-Stokes flow solver ELAN. The aerodynamic results are compared to experimental data obtained at the ECL by Jacob et al., as well as to previous Large Eddy Simulations results from the Proust/Turbflow code by Boudet et al. and DES simulations from Greschner et al. based on standard turbulence models. The acoustic analogy is applied both with and without volume terms to rigid and permeable control surfaces surrounding the rod-airfoil system. Aeroacoustic results are compared to experimental data from the literature, showing that the inclusion of volume terms improves the aeroacoustic prediction in the broadband high frequency range.
