Here we present a resolution calculus for CTL that involves the translation of formulae to a normal form and the application of a number of resolution rules. We use indices in the normal form to represent particular paths and the application of the resolution rules is restricted dependent on an ordering and selection function to reduce the search space. We show that the translation preserves satisfiability, the calculus is sound, complete, and terminating, and consider the complexity of the calculus.", "paper_title": "A Resolution Calculus for the Branching-Time Temporal Logic CTL", "paper_id": "WOS:000332383000010"}
