Unweighted matroid matching for linearly represented matroids was solved by Lovasz, and the problem is known to be intractable for general matroids. We present a polynomial-time approximation scheme for unweighted matroid matching for general matroids. In contrast, we show that natural linear-programming relaxations that have been studied have an Omega(n) integrality gap, and, moreover, Omega(n) rounds of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy are necessary to bring the gap down to a constant. More generally, for any fixed k >= 2 and epsilon > 0, we obtain a (k/2+ epsilon)-approximation for matroid matching in k-uniform hypergraphs, also known as the matroid k-parity problem. As a consequence, we obtain a (k/2+ epsilon)-approximation for the problem of finding the maximum-cardinality set in the intersection of k matroids. We also give a 3/2-approximation for the weighted version of a special case of matroid matching, the matchoid problem.", "paper_title": "MATROID MATCHING: THE POWER OF LOCAL SEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000315579100014"}
