The distillation model is verified by real data. The FLC control algorithm usually consists of a transformer, a state estimator and an external linear controller. Here, two state estimators, namely extended Kalman filter (EKF) and short-cut model-based open-loop estimator (SMBOLE), have been developed to device the hybrid FLC-EKF and FLC-SMBOLE control systems, respectively. In order to avoid estimator design complexity as well as computational burden, an ideal binary distillation model [ light key (LK)/heavy key (HK)] has been used as an EKF predictor and open-loop estimator (OLE). In this article, a comparative study has been conducted between the FLC-EKF, FLC-SMBOLE and a classical dual-loop proportional integral derivative (PID) control structure. Simulation results show that despite the significant process/model mismatch, the proposed FLC controllers perform better than the PID control scheme.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid FLC-EKF Scheme for Temperature Control of a Refinery Debutanizer Column", "paper_id": "WOS:000274383700005"}
