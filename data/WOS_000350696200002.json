YuruBackup enables fine-grained data de-duplication with hierarchical partitioning to improve space efficiency to reduce bandwidth of both backup and restore processes, and storage costs. On the other hand, YuruBackup explores a highly scalable architecture for fingerprint servers that allows to add one or more fingerprint servers dynamically to cope with increasing clients. In this architecture, the fingerprint servers in a DB cluster are used for scaling writes of fingerprint catalog, while the slaves are used for scaling reads of fingerprint catalog. We present the system architecture of YuruBackup and its components, and we have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of YuruBackup. By conducting performance evaluation in a public cloud, experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the system.", "paper_title": "YuruBackup: A Space-Efficient and Highly Scalable Incremental Backup System in the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000350696200002"}
