However, privacy and security concerns often prevent sharing of data, thus derailing data mining projects. Recently, there has been growing focus on finding solutions to this problem. Several algorithms have been proposed that do distributed knowledge discovery, while providing guarantees on the non-disclosure of data. Classification is an important data mining problem applicable in many diverse domains. The goal of classification is to build a model which can predict an attribute (binary attribute in this work) based on the rest of attributes. We propose an efficient and secure privacy-preserving algorithm for support vector machine (SVM) classification over vertically partitioned data.", "paper_title": "Privacy-preserving SVM classification on vertically partitioned data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600074"}
