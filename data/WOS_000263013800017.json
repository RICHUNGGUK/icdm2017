Different from traditional P2P applications, the quality of P2P streaming is strictly determined by performance metrics such as streaming delay. To meet these requirements, previous studies resorted to intuitions and heuristics to construct peer selection solutions incorporating topology and proximity concerns. However, the impact of proximity-aware methodology and delay tolerance of peers on the scalability of P2P system remains an unanswered question. In this paper, we study this problem via an analytical approach. To address the challenge of incorporating Internet topology into P2P streaming analysis, we construct a H-sphere network model which maps the network topology from the space of discrete graph to the continuous geometric domain, meanwhile capturing the power-law property of Internet. Based on this model, we analyze a series of peer selection methods by evaluating their performance via key scalability metrics. Our analytical observations are further verified via simulation on Internet topologies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
