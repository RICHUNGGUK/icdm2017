The corresponding NP-hard optimization problems are motivated by applications concerning control in elections and social network analysis. Continuing previous work for the directed case, we show that the problem is W[2]-hard when parameterized by the graph's feedback arc set number, whereas it becomes fixed-parameter tractable when combining the parameters \"feedback vertex set number\" and \"number of vertices to delete\". For the so far unstudied undirected case, we show that the problem is NP-hard and W[1]-hard when parameterized by the \"number of vertices to delete\". On the positive side, we show fixed-parameter tractability for several parameterizations measuring tree-likeness. In particular, we provide a dynamic programming algorithm for graphs of bounded treewidth and a vertex-linear problem kernel with respect to the parameter \"feedback edge set number\". On the contrary, we show a non-existence result concerning polynomial-size problem kernels for the combined parameter \"vertex cover number and number of vertices to delete\", implying corresponding non-existence results when replacing vertex cover number by treewidth or feedback vertex set number.", "paper_title": "On Making a Distinguished Vertex of Minimum Degree by Vertex Deletion", "paper_id": "WOS:000330969900008"}
