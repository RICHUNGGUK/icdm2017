One of its strengths is the use of an adaptive mechanism to match the constraints of the underlying network. This work is focused on how this mechanism can maximize the video quality as perceived by the viewers using objective assessment methods. We built a testbed to stream certain video sequences through Skype between two clients over impaired communication channels. Original and recorded videos were compared to assess the achieved quality. Extensive experimentation has shown that Skype has problems when transmitting high motion videos and especially complex videos with frequent interchange between frames of low and high temporal information. The results suggest that random packet loss intensifies quality degradation for those videos more than packet loss bursts or jitter.", "paper_title": "SKYPE RESILIENCE TO HIGH MOTION VIDEOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000319995600008"}
