By jointly considering the rate allocation and the Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC), our proposal aims at maximizing the QoS provisioning under the given resource constraint. At first, we develop and evaluate a framework for optimal video rate allocation over multiple networks based on the observed Available Bit Rate (ABR) and the Round Trip Time (RTT) over each access network, as well as the video rate-distortion characteristics. The rate allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem that minimizes the sum of all video streams expected distortion. Then, we propose an analytical JSCC scheme for error-resilient scalable encoded video, and integrate the JSCC with the specific rate allocation algorithm to improve the constructed video quality by optimally applying the appropriate channel coding rate given the constraints imposed by the transmission rate and the prevailing channel conditions. Objective and subjective simulation results are provided which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed joint scheme.", "paper_title": "Multi-User Video Streaming over Multiple Heterogeneous Wireless Networks: A Distributed, Cross-Layer Design Paradigm", "paper_id": "WOS:000263407200001"}
