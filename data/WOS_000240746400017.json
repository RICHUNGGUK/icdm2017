As far as the language-theoretic properties of this operation are concerned, we prove that in a trio the closure under shuffle is equivalent to the closure under synchronized shuffle on a regular set of backbones. Based on this result we show that a set of backbones is regular if and only if the synchronized shuffle of every two regular languages on that set is also regular. Some relationships between this operation and the synchronized shuffle operations introduced in [5] are presented and some open problem are finally discussed.", "paper_title": "Synchronized shuffle on backbones", "paper_id": "WOS:000240746400017"}
