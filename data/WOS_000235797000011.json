Exponential families, a standard tool in statistics, can be used to unify many existing machine learning algorithms based on kernels (such as SVM) and to invent novel ones quite effortlessly. A new derivation of the novelty detection algorithm based on the one class SVM is proposed to illustrate the power of the exponential family model in an RKHS.
