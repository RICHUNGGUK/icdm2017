When the mineral dissolution ratio approaches zero, the theoretical value of the porosity gradient tends to infinity at the chemical dissolution front. Even for a very small value of the mineral dissolution ratio, which is very common in geochemical systems, the porosity gradient can be large enough to cause the solution hard to converge when the conventional finite element method is used to solve a chemical dissolution problem in a fluid-saturated porous medium where the pore-fluid is compressible. To improve the convergent speed of solution, a porosity-gradient replacement approach, in which the term involving porosity-gradient computation is replaced by a new term consisting of pore-fluid density-gradient and pressure-gradient computation, is first proposed and then incorporated into the finite element method in this study. Through comparing the numerical results obtained from the proposed approach with the theoretical solutions for a benchmark problem, it has been demonstrated that not only can the solution divergence be avoid, but also the accurate simulation results can be obtained when the proposed porosity-gradient replacement approach is used to solve chemical-dissolution-front propagation problems in fluid-saturated porous media including pore-fluid compressibility.", "paper_title": "A porosity-gradient replacement approach for computational simulation of chemical-dissolution front propagation in fluid-saturated porous media including pore-fluid compressibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000303583800014"}
