Recently Zhang et al. [MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 67 (2012) 347] considered the q-analog of W, motivated by the theory of hypergeometric series. We obtain explicit formulas for the q-Wiener index of cluster and corona of graphs, of which thorny and bridge graphs are special cases. Using these formulas, the q-Wiener indices of several classes of chemical graphs are computed.", "paper_title": "Chemical Graphs Constructed of Composite Graphs and Their q-Wiener Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000346106900019"}
