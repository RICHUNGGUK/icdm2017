Also, Expectation Maximization by itself cannot estimate time-varying density functions. In this paper, a novel stochastic technique is introduced to overcome these two limitations. Kernel density estimation is used to obtain a discrete estimate of the true density of the given data. A Stochastic Learning Automaton is then used to select the number of mixture components that minimizes the distance between the density function estimated using the Expectation Maximization and discrete estimate of the density. The validity of the proposed approach is verified using synthetic and real univariate and bivariate observation data.", "paper_title": "Estimating time-varying densities using a stochastic learning automaton", "paper_id": "WOS:000238318100004"}
