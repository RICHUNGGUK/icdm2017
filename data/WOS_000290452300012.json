The speed-up is mainly achieved by early termination of either 4 x 4 intra prediction or 16 x 16 intra prediction. The executions of intra 4 x 4 and 16 x 16 predictions are serialized and the second prediction is terminated early by using the cost of the first prediction as the stop criterion. A simple and efficient algorithm by making use of spatial locality is proposed to select the mode that is processed first. To avoid the bubble cycles caused by this serialized execution of 4 x 4 and 16 x 16 predictions, the modified processing order presented in (Jung et al. 2008) is employed for intra 4 x 4 prediction in order to schedule dependent 4 x 4 blocks apart from each other. To further reduce the execution time of 4 x 4 prediction, neighboring pixels with the same value are grouped, and only one prediction mode in the group is evaluated. Experimental results show that the PSNR drop is 0.0619 dB and the bitrate increase is 0.842% when compared with the JM reference software. The additional hardware cost to support the proposed methods is less than eight thousand gates which are very small when compared with the hardware size of a whole intra frame encoder.", "paper_title": "A Fast H.264 Intra Frame Encoder with Serialized Execution of 4 x 4 and 16 x 16 Predictions and Early Termination", "paper_id": "WOS:000290452300012"}
