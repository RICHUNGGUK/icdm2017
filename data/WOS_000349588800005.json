Our contribution is two fold: (1) to develop a linear programming algorithm that produces a consistent approximation of the maximum value and optimal policy functions in the context of stochastic impulse controls: and (2) to illustrate the economic benefits of impulse controls optimized, using our framework, and calibrated to the population dynamics of a marine fishery. We contend that the framework has wide applicability and offers the possibility of higher economic pay-off for a wide-range of policy problems in the presence of discontinuities and adverse shocks.
