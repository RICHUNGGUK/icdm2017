Our measurements-based channel model captures large and small time-scale signal correlations, giving an accurate picture of the signal variation, specifically, the deep fades which are the features that mostly affect the behavior of the MAC. We test the effect of the channel model on the performance of the 802.15.4 MAC both in contention access mode and TDMA access mode. We show that there are considerable differences in the performance of the MAC compared to simulations that do not model channel temporal variation. Furthermore, explaining the behavior of the MAC under a temporal varying channel, we can suggest specific design choices for the emerging BAN MAC standard.", "paper_title": "Impact of Wireless Channel Temporal Variation on MAC Design for Body Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308659300013"}
