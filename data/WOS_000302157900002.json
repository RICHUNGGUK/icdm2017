In this review, I will provide a brief overview of LBD, both past and present, and will propose some new directions for the next decade. The prevalent ABC model is not \"wrong\"; however, it is only one of several different types of models that can contribute to the development of the next generation of LBD tools. Perhaps the most urgent need is to develop a series of objective literature-based interestingness measures, which can customize the output of LBD systems for different types of scientific investigations.", "paper_title": "Literature-Based Discovery: Beyond the ABCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000302157900002"}
