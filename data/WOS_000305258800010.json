The control scheme induces a PD controller with a gain switching technique plus a learning feedforward term, is exploited to predict the desired actuator torque. By using Lyapunov method, an adaptive iterative learning control scheme is presented for robotic system with both structured and unstructured uncertainty, and the overall stability of the closed-loop system in the iterative domain is established. The validity of the scheme is confirmed through a numerical simulation.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Iterative Learning Control for Robot Manipulator in Task Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000305258800010"}
