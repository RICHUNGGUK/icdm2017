The Kullback-Leibler divergence measure is used to compare the original network to its perturbation. By setting the regression coefficients to zero or non-zero values, the proposed method can remove or add arcs, making it possible to compare different network structures. The methodology is implemented with some case studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
