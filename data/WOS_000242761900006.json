First, the diverse manufacturing resources, which may be heterogeneous and physically distributed, are MAS-based agentified and CORBA-based encapsulated as the resource agents. Second, the source agents are registered at the system manager agent (SMA) as member agents and subsequently integrated under the proposed architecture to form an ACMS. Third, the member agents communicate and interact with each other to conduct collaborative manufacturing by means of agent interoperation and human-machine interaction. In order to validate the methodology, an experimental system is developed, where several heterogeneous manufacturing resources are well-integrated via their agents in a plug-and-play manner to establish an ACMS prototype. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture, characterized by distribution and openness, provides a feasible solution for developing ACMS, where integratability, reconfigurability, flexibility and agility are achieved.", "paper_title": "A CORBA- and MAS-based architecture for agile collaborative manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242761900006"}
