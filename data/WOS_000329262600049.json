A data completion problem on a fictitious domain, which can be rather larger or smaller than the real one, is analyzed and the land-sea interface at the null hydraulic head isovalue is identified. Examples are given for different dimensions of the domain for a case of sea water intrusion and one of land water discharge. The sensitivity of the identification process to noisy data is considered.
