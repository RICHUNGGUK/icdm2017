A Godunov-type reformulation combining the Haar wavelet is achieved to enable solution-driven resolution adaptivity (both coarsening and refinement) by depending on the wavelet's threshold value. The ability to properly model irregular topographies and wetting/drying is transferred from the (baseline) FV uniform mesh model, with no extra notable efforts. Selected hydraulic tests are employed to analyse the performance of the Haar wavelet FV shallow water solver considering adaptivity and practical issues including choice for the threshold value driving the adaptivity, mesh convergence study, shock and wet/dry front capturing abilities. Our findings show that Haar wavelet-based adaptive FV solutions offer great potential to improve the reliability of multiscale shallow water models.", "paper_title": "Haar wavelet-based adaptive finite volume shallow water solver", "paper_id": "WOS:000371777100002"}
