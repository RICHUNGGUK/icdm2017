While the problem has been widely studied in fully connected fixed networks, few studies have been carried out in the context of self-organizing mobile networks such as mobile ad hoc networks. We present a randomized consensus protocol with three additional modules for the case of dynamic networks: participant detectors, failure detectors and maintainer. We assume an asynchronous network with unknown participants where processes can be fixed or move continuously for departing or joining the network. We suppose that the channels are fair-lossy and the number of processes is unknown. In comparison with the related works, our system model is weaker which is more realistic. Also, the proposed protocol is more scalable and satisfies the strongest possible mobility condition in Byzantine agreement. Our experiments and case studies show that the number of execution rounds is significantly less than what is expected in the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Byzantine consensus for unknown dynamic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352360300018"}
