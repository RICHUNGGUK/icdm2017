In this paper, we propose an ensemble of niching algorithms (ENA) and illustrate the concept by an instantiation which is realized using four different parallel populations. The offspring of each population is considered by all parallel populations. The instantiation is tested on a set of 16 real and binary problems and compared against the single niching methods with respect to searching ability and computation time. Results confirm that ENA method is as good as or better than the best single method in it on every test problem. Moreover, comparison with other state-of-the-art niching algorithms demonstrates the competitiveness of our proposed ENA. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
