Relevance feedback is often used in a CBIR system to help users express their preference and improve query results. Traditional relevance feedback relies on positive and negative examples to reformulate the query. Furthermore, if the system employs several visual features for a query, the weight of each feature is adjusted manually by the user or system predetermined and fixed by the system. In this paper we propose a new relevance feedback model suitable for medical image retrieval. The proposed method enables the user to rank the results in relevance order. According to the ranking, the system can automatically determine the importance ranking of features, and use this ranking to automatically adjust the weight of each feature. The experimental results show that the new relevance feedback mechanism outperforms previous relevance feedback models. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
