Two new methods have recently appeared that seek to solve this problem based on correspondence analysis, using certain characteristics of multiple factorial analysis. These methods are Simultaneous Analysis (SA) and Multiple Factorial Analysis for Contingency Tables (MFACT). The two methods are very similar, but the main difference between them lies in the allocation of the weights attributed to each table. Similarities and differences between them are discussed and a brief example is provided to show the factorial results provided by each one. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
