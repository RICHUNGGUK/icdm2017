A smart home is intelligent space that studies patterns of home contexts that is acquired in a home, and provides automatic home services for the human. The ubiquitous intelligent sensing system acquires seven sensing contexts from four sensor devices. We utilize association rules of data mining and linear support machine to analyze context patterns of seven contexts. Also, we analyze stress rates of the human through the HRV pattern of the ECG. If the human is suffering from stress, the ubiquitous intelligent sensing system provides home service to reduce one's stress. In this paper, we present the architecture and algorithms of the ubiquitous intelligent sensing system. We present the management toolkit to control the ubiquitous intelligent sensing system, and show implementation results of the smart home using the ubiquitous intelligent sensing system.", "paper_title": "Ubiquitous intelligent sensing system for a smart home", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100035"}
