In fact, a tile is a set of points in the Cartesian space. The goal is to partition the space of the points as tiles with optimal dimensions and shapes such that a number of predefined semantic relations holds amongst the tiles. So far, this problem has been solved in special cases with two or three dimensions. The problem of determining the optimal tile is an NP-Hard problem. Presenting a novel constraint genetic algorithm in this paper, we have been able to solve the tiling problem in Cartesian spaces with more than two dimensions, for the loop parallelization problem.", "paper_title": "A new genetic algorithm for loop tiling", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262500002"}
