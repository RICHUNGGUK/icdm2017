In this paper, the \"InfoMin\" principle is proposed, which asserts that the information through some neighboring signals on a two-dimensional mapping must be minimized. It is shown that the standard Comon's ICA can be derived from the combination of the InfoMax principle for the whole signals and the InfoMin one for each signal under a linear model with sufficiently large noise. It is also shown that the InfoMin principle for the signals within neighboring areas can generate a topographic mapping in the same way as in topographic ICA.", "paper_title": "The InfoMin principle for ICA and topographic mappings", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300119"}
