The method is designed to have three key features: accurate, practical, and applicable to a wide range of sensors. The method requires only a planar surface to be imaged from various poses. The calibration does not use depth discontinuities in the depth image, which makes it flexible and robust to noise. We apply this calibration to a Kinect device and present a new depth distortion model for the depth sensor. We perform experiments that show an improved accuracy with respect to the manufacturer's calibration.", "paper_title": "Joint Depth and Color Camera Calibration with Distortion Correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000307522700015"}
