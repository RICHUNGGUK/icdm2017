For large 3D problems, the computation is no longer feasible on a single processor, and the memory requirements increase rapidly. Therefore, parallelization of the solver is needed. We employ a complex shifted-Laplace preconditioner combined with the Bi-CGSTAB iterative method and use a multigrid method to approximate the inverse of the resulting preconditioning operator. A 3D multigrid method with 2D semi-coarsening is employed. We show numerical results for large problems arising in geophysical applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
