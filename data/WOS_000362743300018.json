The divisible scheduling in these three networks are uniformly formulated as the Maximum Finish Time Minimization (MFTM) problem. It involves minimizing the makespan of the load distribution and processing. The MTFM problem, a relaxed MFTM problem, a linear programming problem version and a heuristic algorithm are described and solved. The first three of these problems have identical solutions. The heuristic algorithm is close in performance to the optimal solution, significantly outperforms the previously described dimensional algorithm, and has much wider application range than the previously proposed phase algorithm.", "paper_title": "Scheduling Divisible Loads in Gaussian, Mesh and Torus Network of Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000362743300018"}
