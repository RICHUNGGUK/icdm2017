We combine both phenomena for the first time and illustrate how the integration of a sustainability benchmarking service into an on-demand ERP platform provides added value beyond pure cost savings. By applying a qualitative system dynamics approach we identify self-reinforcing mechanisms which allow a faster and more comprehensive market penetration compared to providing these services separately.", "paper_title": "ERP On Demand Platform Complementary Effects Using the Example of a Sustainability Benchmarking Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000300215900003"}
