We find that characteristics of aggregated frame traffic are affected by both mean frame size and the proportion of specified frame types. Based on this new knowledge, an adaptative frame size optimization (AFSO) mechanism is proposed to improve the transmission efficiency by adaptively adjusting data frame size according to the proportions of different frame types. Simulation results show that our proposed mechanism can effectively regulate the burstiness of aggregated frame traffic and improve the successful delivery rate of data frames when a fixed throughput target is set for 802.11 wireless networks.", "paper_title": "AFSO: An Adaptative Frame Size Optimization Mechanism for 802.11 Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279378500001"}
