We show analytically the number of optimal sequences and the range of gamma in which each of the sequence is optimal We prove that the number of optimal sequences is {1 + Sigma(x)(k=1) (2k)} if n is odd, and {1 + Sigma(x)(k=1) (2k - 1)} if n is even The value of x is left perpendicular n/2 right perpendicular - 1 when n is odd, and x is n/2 when is even The number of optimal sequences depends only on n, the number of jobs, and not on gamma We also show analytically that when gamma > (n-3)/2(n-2), the optimal sequence unique and Is obtained by placing the longest job in first position and the rest of the yobs in SPT order in positions 2 to n.", "paper_title": "A PARAMETRIC ANALYSIS FOR SINGLE MACHINE SCHEDULING WITH PAST-SEQUENCE-DEPENDENT SETUP TIMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800024"}
