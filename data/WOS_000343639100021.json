The minimum independent dominating set (MIDS) problem does not admit a polynomial running time approximation algorithm with worst-case performance ratio of n(1-epsilon) for any epsilon > 0. We prove that the size of the minimum independent dominating set in g(G, p), denoted as i(g(G, p)), is asymptotically almost surely in e(log I V). Furthermore, we show that the probability of i(g(G, p)) >= root 4 vertical bar V vertical bar/p is no more than 2(-vertical bar V vertical bar), and present a simple greedy algorithm of proven worst-case performance ratio root 4 vertical bar V vertical bar/p and with polynomial expected running time.
