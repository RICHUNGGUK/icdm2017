In general, capacitor mismatch can result from two sources of errors: random mismatch and systematic mismatch. Paralleling unit capacitance (UC) with a common-centroid structure can alleviate the random mismatch errors. The complexity of generating an optimal solution to the UC placement problem is extremely high, let alone if both placement and routing problems are to be optimized simultaneously. This article evaluates the performance of the UC placement generated in an existing work and proposes an alternative UC placement to achieve optimal ratiomismatch M and better linearity performance of SAR ADC design. Results show that the proposed UC placement achieves a ratio mismatch of M = 0.695, the effective number of bits ENOB = 8.314 bits, and the integral nonlinearity INL = 0.816 LSB (least significant bits) for a 9-bit SAR ADC design.", "paper_title": "Performance-Driven Unit-Capacitor Placement of Successive-Approximation-Register ADCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000366897700014"}
