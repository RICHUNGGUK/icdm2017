In these contexts the detection of corrupted mappings, as a consequence of a change in the source or in the target schema, is a key problem. A corrupted mapping fails in matching the target or the source schema, hence it is not able to transform data conforming to a schema S into data conforming to a schema T, nor it can be used for effective query reformulation. This article describes a novel technique for maintaining schema mappings in XML data integration systems, based on a notion of mapping correctness relying on the denotational semantics of mappings.", "paper_title": "Detection of Corrupted Schema Mappings in XML Data Integration Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000271213800002"}
