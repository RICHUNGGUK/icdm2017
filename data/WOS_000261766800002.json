In fact, most approaches disregard the importance of notes as musicological units having dynamic nature. In this paper we propose a mechanism for quantizing the temporal sequences of the detected fundamental frequencies into note symbols, characterized by precise temporal boundaries and note pitches (namely, MIDI note numbers). The developed method aims to cope with typical dynamics and performing styles such as vibrato, glissando or legato.", "paper_title": "From Pitches to Notes: Creation and Segmentation of Pitch Tracks for Melody Detection in Polyphonic Audio", "paper_id": "WOS:000261766800002"}
