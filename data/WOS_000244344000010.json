Unfortunately, back-propagation algorithm suffers the problems of slow convergence, inefficiency, and lack of robustness. This paper introduces a multi-stage optimization approach (MSOA) used in back-propagation algorithm for training neural network to forecast the Chinese food grain price. We divide the training sample of neural network into two parts considering the truth that the recent observations is more important than the older ones. Firstly, we use the first training sample to train the neural network and achieve the network structure. Secondly, we continue to use the second training sample to further optimize the structure of neural network based on the previous step. Empirical results show that MSOA overcomes the weakness of conventional BP algorithm to some extend. Furthermore the neural network based on MSOA can improve the forecasting performance significantly in terms of the error and directional evaluation measurements. The paper also proves accurate price estimation may not be a good predictor of the direction of change in the price levels in food market. The neural network based on MSOA can be used as an alternative forecasting method for future Chinese food price forecasting. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
