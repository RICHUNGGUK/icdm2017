The dorsal hand vein image is segmented using the K-means technique and the region of interest is extracted based on the morphological analysis operators and normalised using adaptive histogram equalisation. Veins are extracted using a maximum curvature algorithm. The locations and vascular connections between crossovers, bifurcations and terminations in a hand vein pattern define a hand vein graph. The matching performance of BGM for hand vein graphs is tested with two cost functions and compared with the matching performance of two standard point patterns matching algorithms, iterative closest point (ICP) and modified Hausdorff distance. Experiments are conducted on two public databases captured using far infrared and near infrared (NIR) cameras. BGM's matching performance is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on the databases despite using small and concise templates. For both databases, BGM performed at least as well as ICP. For the small sized graphs from the NIR database, BGM significantly outperformed point pattern matching. The size of the common subgraph of a pair of graphs is the most significant discriminating measure between genuine and imposter comparisons.", "paper_title": "Hand vein authentication using biometric graph matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000346562800013"}
