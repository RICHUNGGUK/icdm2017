In order to cope with this complex behavior, traditional forms of engineering design solutions are reasonably simplified. Incorporating simplifying assumptions into the development of the traditional methods may lead to very large errors. This paper presents an endeavor to exploit a robust multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) method for the analysis of geotechnical and earthquake engineering systems. MGGP is a modified genetic programming approach for model structure selection combined with a classical technique for parameter estimation. To justify the abilities of MGGP, it is systematically employed to formulate the complex geotechnical engineering problems. Different classes of the problems analyzed include the assessment of (i) undrained lateral load capacity of piles, (ii) undrained side resistance alpha factor for drilled shafts, (iii) settlement around tunnels, and (iv) soil liquefaction. The validity of the derived models is tested for a part of test results beyond the training data domain. Numerical examples show the superb accuracy, efficiency, and great potential of MGGP. Contrary to artificial neural networks and many other soft computing tools, MGGP provides constitutive prediction equations. The MGG-based solutions are particularly valuable for pre-design practices.", "paper_title": "A new multi-gene genetic programming approach to non-linear system modeling.
