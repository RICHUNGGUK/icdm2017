We prove that weighted bisimilarity is a congruence on systems defined by weighted GSOS specifications. We illustrate the flexibility of the framework by instantiating it to handle some special cases, most notably that of stochastic transition systems. Through examples we provide weighted-GSOS definitions for common stochastic operators in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
