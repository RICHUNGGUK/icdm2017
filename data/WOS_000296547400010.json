Current music classification systems follow a frame-based analysis model. A whole song is split into frames, where a feature vector is extracted from each local frame. Each song can then be represented by a set of feature vectors. How to utilize the feature set for global song-level classification is an important problem in music classification. Previous studies have used summary features and probability models which are either overly restrictive in modeling power or numerically too difficult to solve. In this paper, we investigate the bag-of-features approach for music classification which can effectively aggregate the local features for song-level feature representation. Moreover, we have extended the standard bag-of-features approach by proposing a multiple codebook model to exploit the randomness in the generation of codebooks. Experimental results for genre classification and artist identification on benchmark data sets show that the proposed classification system is highly competitive against the standard methods.
