An important problem in such an environment is to protect user privacy while querying data from the cloud. To address this problem, researchers have proposed several techniques. However, existing techniques incur heavy computational and bandwidth related costs, which will be unacceptable to users. In this paper, we propose a cooperative private searching (COPS) protocol that provides the same privacy protections as prior protocols, but with much lower overhead. Our protocol allows multiple users to combine their queries to reduce the querying cost while protecting their privacy. Extensive evaluations have been conducted on both analytical models and on a real cloud environment to examine the effectiveness of our protocol. Our simulation results show that the proposed protocol reduces computational costs by 80% and bandwidth cost by 37%, even when only five users query data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
