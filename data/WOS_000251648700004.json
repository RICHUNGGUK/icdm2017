The paper summarizes the relevant aspects of each technique and describes how they can be used together to create design models of an autonomic system and its environment. The discussion is illustrated through a consideration of the development of a generic computing system to help manage the technology used in an organisation.", "paper_title": "Autonomic system design based on the integrated use of SSM and VSM", "paper_id": "WOS:000251648700004"}
