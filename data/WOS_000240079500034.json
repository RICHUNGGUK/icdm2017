For the purpose of adapting to a large range of transform parameters in a high registration accuracy, the registration procedure includes two steps: a principle components analysis (PCA) based coarse registration and a Hausdorff distance based fine registration. Both steps are free from the correspondence of the feature points of MRI and Atlas. We implemented this registration method in a rat brain 3D reconstruction and analysis system. Experiments have demonstrated that this two-step method can be successfully applied to registering the low resolution and noise affection MRI with Paxinos-Watson Atlas of rat brain.", "paper_title": "A novel 3D correspondence-less method for MRI and Paxinos-Watson atlas of rat brain registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500034"}
