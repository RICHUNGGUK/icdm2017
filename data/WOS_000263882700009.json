Our method is based on the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and utilizes the Gene Ontology annotations as prior knowledge to guide the process of grouping functionally related genes. Unlike traditional clustering methods, our method is capable of assigning genes to multiple clusters, which is a more appropriate representation of the behavior of genes. Two datasets of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression profiles were applied to compare our method with other state-of-the-art clustering methods. Our experiments show that our method can produce far better biologically meaningful clusters even with the use of a small percentage of Gene Ontology annotations. In addition, our experiments further indicate that the utilization of prior knowledge in our method can predict gene functions effectively.
