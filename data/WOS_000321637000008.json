In this study, a novel partitioned block preconditioner in conjunction with the Krylov subspace iterative method symmetric quasiminimal residual is proposed to solve such linear equations. The performance of these investigated preconditioners is evaluated and compared on both the CPU architecture and the hybrid CPU-graphics processing units (GPU) computing environment. On the hybrid CPU-GPU computing platform, the capability of GPU in parallel implementation and high-intensity floating point operations is exploited to accelerate the iterative solutions, and particular attention is paid to the matrix-vector multiplications involved in the iterative process. Based on a pile-group foundation example and a tunneling example, numerical results show that the partitioned block preconditioners investigated are very efficient for the soil-structure interaction problems. However, their comparative performances may apparently depend on the computer architecture. When the CPU computer architecture is used, the novel partitioned block symmetric successive over-relaxation preconditioner appears to be the most efficient, but when the hybrid CPU-GPU computer architecture is adopted, it is shown that the inexact block diagonal preconditioners embedded with simple diagonal approximation to the soil block outperform the others.", "paper_title": "GPU-accelerated iterative solutions for finite element analysis of soil-structure interaction problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000321637000008"}
