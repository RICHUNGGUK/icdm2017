The resource allocation on it is very challenging since it not only involves various types of divisible resources but needs to cope with social competitions. We propose a novel resource allocation scheme with three features on ex-post efficiency. (1) Ex-post win-win effect: each participant (consumers and suppliers) should always feel satisfied with their ex-post payoffs. (2) Incentive compatibility: we can prove each rational participant gets its optimal payoff iff their resource demands and expected prices are truthfully declared. (3) Ex-post maximized efficiency: more powerful resources should be consumed with higher likelihood, such that the whole system runs quite efficiently with maximized resource utilization. Our simulation shows the approach significantly improves resource suppliers' incomes by 20% compared to their expectations. Meanwhile, we can guarantee consumers' payments below their budgets, with no any degradation of task execution performance.
