[W. Shi, X. Wu, Comput. Phys. Comm. 183 (2012) 1250]. However, the symplecticity conditions in that paper are not sufficient, one of the conditions should be made stronger to guarantee the symplecticity of the methods. For this reason, we will reanalyze and present more precisely the symplecticity conditions for the ARKN methods in this note. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
