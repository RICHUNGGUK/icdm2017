The purpose of the proposed new coding technique is to diminish the switching and coupling activities on instruction address busses effectively. The proposed bus coding method is called the exclusive-OR and bus inverter transition signaling (XOR-BITS) code. The XOR-BITS code has four advantages. Firstly, it can save a large number of switching activities. Secondly, it can also save a large number of coupling activities. Thirdly, its architecture belongs to a low-complexity architecture. Finally, its delay is short after optimizations. Experimental results show that the XOR-BITS coding indicates an average reduction in 78.5% switching activities and 21.9% coupling activities on instruction address busses. It surpasses the other address coding methods in total power dissipations when the load capacitance is more than 1 pF/bit with the TSMC 0.13 mu m CMOS technology. For a 50 pF/bit load capacitance, it achieves a 74.9% average reduction in total power dissipations, compared with the un-coded schemes by using seven benchmarks. Similarly, our method also surpasses the other address bus coding methods with the TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "LOW-POWER INSTRUCTION ADDRESS BUS CODING WITH XOR-BITS ARCHITECTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000264491200004"}
