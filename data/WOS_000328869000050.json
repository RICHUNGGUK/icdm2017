The method is able to consistently select and estimate the main effects even when strong correlations are present. In addition, the potential pitfall of time-dependent covariates is clarified. Both asymptotic theory and simulation results reveal the effectiveness of penalization as a data mining tool for longitudinal data, especially when a large number of variables is present. The method is illustrated by mining for the main determinants of life expectancy in Europe. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
