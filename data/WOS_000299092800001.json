For systems that support (only) read, write, and comparison primitives (such as compare-and-swap), we establish a lower bound that precludes a deterministic algorithm with o(k) time complexity, where k is point contention. In particular, it is impossible to construct a deterministic O(log k) algorithm based on such primitives.", "paper_title": "A time complexity lower bound for adaptive mutual exclusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000299092800001"}
