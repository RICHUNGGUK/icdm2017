These are charging schemes where charge is moved across vertices of different graphs. Such methods have recently been used to obtain various properties of triangulations that are embedded in a fixed set of points in the plane. We generalize this method to obtain results for various other types of graphs that are embedded in the plane. Specifically, we obtain a new bound of O*(187.53(N)) (where the O*(.) notation hides polynomial factors) for the maximum number of crossing-free straight-edge graphs that can be embedded in any specific set of N points in the plane (improving upon the previous best upper bound 207.85(N) in Hoffmann, Schulz, Sharir, Sheffer, Toth and Welzl [14]). We also derive upper bounds for numbers of several other types of plane graphs (such as connected and bi-connected plane graphs), and obtain various bounds on the expected vertex-degrees in graphs that are uniformly chosen from the set of all crossing-free straight-edge graphs that can be embedded in a specific point set. We then apply the cross-graph charging-scheme method to graphs that allow certain types of crossings. Specifically, we consider graphs with no set of k pairwise crossing edges (more commonly known as k-quasi-planar graphs). For k = 3 and k = 4, we prove that, for any set S of N points in the plane, the number of graphs that have a straight-edge k-quasi-planar embedding over S is only exponential in N.", "paper_title": "Counting Plane Graphs: Cross-Graph Charging Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000325645400007"}
