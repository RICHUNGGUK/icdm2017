Clustering is also usually accompanied by functional characterization of gene sets by assessing statistical enrichments of structured vocabularies, such as the gene ontology (GO) [Gene Ontology Consortium. The gene ontology (GO) project in 2006. Nucleic Acids Research (Database issue), vol. 34: 2006. p. D322-6]. If different clusters are generated for correlated experiments, a machine learning step termed cluster meta-analysis may be performed, in order to discover relations among the components of such sets. Several approaches have been proposed: in particular, kernel methods may be used to exploit the graphical structure of typical ontologies such as GO. Following up the formulation of such approach [Merico D, Zoppis I, Antoniotti M, Mauri G. Evaluating graph kernel methods for relation discovery in GO-annotated clusters.
