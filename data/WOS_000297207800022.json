In this paper, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), a mesoscopic NavierStokes solver, is shown to be an appropriate pore-scale fluid flow model. The accuracy and lattice sensitivity of LBM as a fluid dynamics solver is demonstrated in the Poiseuille channel flow problem (2-D) and duct flow problem (3-D). Well-studied problems of fluid creeping through idealized 2-D and 3-D porous media (J. Fluid Mech. 1959; 5(2):317328, J. Fluid Mech. 1982; 115:1326, Int. J. Multiphase Flow 1982; 8(4):343360, Phys.

Multiphase Flow 1982; 8(3):193206) are then simulated using LBM to measure the friction coefficient for various pore throats. The simulation results agree well with the data reported in the literature. The lattice sensitivity of the frictional coefficient is also investigated.
