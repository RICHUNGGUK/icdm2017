In many cases, the running time is better than that of the naive algorithm. We also present several useful applications of the algorithm, such as determining the dominant color among monochromatic simplices in a red-blue edge-colored hypergraph, approximating the number of independent simplices in a random hypergraph, and counting induced occurrences of a given 3-uniforrn k-vertex hypergraph in a larger k-clique free hypergraph.
