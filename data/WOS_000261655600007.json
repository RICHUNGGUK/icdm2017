In this paper, we present the different stages in the life cycle of new media artworks and we illustrate the use of the canonical processes of media production in this context. This work is a first step towards a process modeling framework for the description and documentation of new media artworks.", "paper_title": "Process modeling for new media artworks", "paper_id": "WOS:000261655600007"}
