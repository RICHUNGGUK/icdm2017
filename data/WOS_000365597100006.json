It represents an excellent example of a good international cooperation in education field. Namely, conducted by the professor from Germany, and assistant from Serbia, the course is presented in Tirana, Albania, on Polytechnic University, Faculty of Information Technology. The course itself was created as a part of an international educational project, comprising nine countries, and fifteen universities. So far, the course has been conducted seven times, and hopefully it helped sharing of knowledge in this very important field of computer science. What is even more important, it certainly helped in sharing good will, improving communication between people and countries, and creating multi-cultural environment for studies.
