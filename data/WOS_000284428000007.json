To facilitate this crucial integration, the global standardization organization GS1 is currently developing a range of service specifications. Yet, the services specified so far do not enable event-based interaction schemes and do not leverage the detection of distributed complex events. In this paper we propose to fill this gap by means of a peer-to-peer based broker network that can realize event-based interaction on top of existing specifications. For this infrastructure we present a new method to improve in-network processing. As shown by our experiments, our method significantly reduces overall system load by exploiting a priori knowledge about the observed processes.", "paper_title": "Sharing RFID and complex event data among organizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000284428000007"}
