Our goal is to control the occurrence dates of the controllable events so that the functioning of the system respects given specifications. The system to be controlled is modeled by a time Petri net. In a previous work we proposed a systematic method to build the timed automaton which models the exact behavior of a time Petri net. Furthermore, the forbidden behaviors of the system are modeled by forbidden timed automaton locations. This paper focuses on the control synthesis method, which consists in computing new firing conditions for the timed automaton transitions so that the forbidden locations are no longer reachable.
