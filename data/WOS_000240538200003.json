In particular, to achieve timing closure, it is necessary and critical to consider the interconnect delay at an early stage of the synthesis process. It has been known that resource sharing in high-level synthesis is one of the major synthesis tasks which greatly affect the final synthesis/layout results. In this paper, we propose a new layout-aware resource sharing approach to overcome some of the limitations of the previous works in which the effects of layout on the synthesis have never been taken into account or considered in local and limited ways, or whose computation time is excessively large. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (Step 1) We relax the integrated resource sharing and placement into an efficient linear programming (LP) formulation based on the concept of discretisizing placement space; (Step 2) We derive a feasible solution from the solution obtained in Step 1. Then, we employ an iterative mechanism based on the two steps to tightly integrate resource sharing and placement tasks so that the slack time violation due to interconnect delay (determined by placement) as well as logic delay (determined by resource sharing) should be minimized. From experiments using a set of benchmark designs, it is shown that the approach is effective, and efficient, completely removing the slack time violation produced by conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Resource sharing combined with layout effects in high-level synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000240538200003"}
