Complex properties can be analyzed using abstract interpretation, provided that an adequate abstract domain is defined. Each domain can represent and manipulate a family of properties, providing a different trade-off between the precision and complexity of the analysis. The contribution of this paper is a new numerical abstract domain called octahedron that represents constraints of the form (Sigma x(i) - Sigma x(j) >= k). The implementation of octahedra is based on a new kind of decision diagram called Octahedron Decision Diagrams (OhDD). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
