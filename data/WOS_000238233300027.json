One such research is fuzzy ranking models, which have been showing their superior performance in handling the uncertainty involved in the retrieval process. However, these conventional fuzzy ranking models have a limited ability to incorporate the user preference when calculating the rank of documents. To address this issue, in this study we develop a new fuzzy ranking model based on the user preference. Through the experiments on the TREC-2 collection of Wall Street Journal documents, we show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional fuzzy ranking models.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy ranking model based on user preference", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233300027"}
