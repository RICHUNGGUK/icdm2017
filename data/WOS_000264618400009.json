The models include nonlinear effects of building blocks and can accurately predict the dynamic or stable characteristic of the closed loop. A three-order I I\" pound fractional-N PLL based frequency synthesizer with a 1.9 GHz central output frequency is implemented with the presented way. Cadence SpectreVerilog simulation results show that the behavioral modeling can provide a great speed-up over the transistor-level simulation. Correspondingly, the phase noise, spurious tones and loop locked time can also be accurately predicted, so it is helpful to optimization design based on system-level.", "paper_title": "Behavioral modeling and simulation of fractional-N frequency synthesizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000264618400009"}
