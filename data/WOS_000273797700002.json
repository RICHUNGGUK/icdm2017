Mathematical models have been developed for describing emotion in mammals. These models, similar to other bioinspired models, must be implemented in embedded platforms for industrial and real applications. In this paper, brain emotional learning based intelligent controller, which is based on mammalian middle brain, is designed and implemented on field-programmable gate arrays, and this emotional controller is applied for controlling of laboratorial overhead traveling crane in model-free and embedded manner. The main features of this controller are leaning capability, providing a model-free control algorithm, robustness and the ability to respond swiftly. By designing appropriate stress signals, a designer can implement a proper trade among control objectives.", "paper_title": "Real-time embedded emotional controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000273797700002"}
