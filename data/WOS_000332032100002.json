Stable secondary structure is the key feature of many non-coding RNAs. Taking into account huge amounts of genomic data, development of computational methods to survey genomes for structured RNAs remains an actual problem, especially when homologous sequences are not available for comparative analysis. Existing programs scan genomes with a fixed window by efficiently constructing a matrix of RNA minimum free energies. A wide range of lengths of structured RNAs necessitates the use of many different window lengths that substantially increases the output size and computational efforts. Results: In this article, we present an algorithm RNASurface to efficiently scan genomes by constructing a matrix of significance of RNA secondary structures and to identify all locally optimal structured RNA segments up to a predefined size. RNASurface significantly improves precision of identification of known ncRNA in Bacillus subtilis.", "paper_title": "RNASurface: fast and accurate detection of locally optimal potentially structured RNA segments", "paper_id": "WOS:000332032100002"}
