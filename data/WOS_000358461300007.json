Companies in these project-based businesses have special requirements for product configuration. Products have configuration dependencies with each other and there are system level configuration dependencies between several products. Incomplete product configuration items that are subject to change or require engineering work prior to production can occur. This paper introduces the requirements for system level configuration and proposes a prototype solution for ship projects and engine-room related supply chains. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
