This paper proposes a novel segmentation method based on merging texture superpixels by computing inner similarity. Firstly, we design a set of Gabor filters to compute the amplitude responses of original image and compute the texture map by a salience model. Secondly, we employ the simple clustering to extract superpixles by affinity of color, coordinates and texture map. Then, we design a normalized histograms descriptor for superpixels integrated color and texture information of inner pixels. To obtain the final segmentation result, all adjacent superpixels are merged by the homogeneity comparison of normalized color-texture features until the stop criteria is satisfied. The experiments are conducted on natural scene images and synthesis texture images demonstrate that the proposed segmentation algorithm can achieve ideal segmentation on complex texture regions.", "paper_title": "Texture superpixels merging by color-texture histograms for color image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000345331400011"}
