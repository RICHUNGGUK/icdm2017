This paper presents an investigation into the relationship of algorithms performance and the different control parameter settings. Two tour building methods are used in this paper including the max probability selection and the roulette wheel selection. Four parameters are used, which are two control parameters of transition probability alpha and beta, pheromone decrease factor rho, and proportion factor q(0) in building methods. By simulated result analysis, the parameter selection rule will be given.", "paper_title": "Study of parametric relation in ant colony optimization approach to traveling salesman problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400003"}
