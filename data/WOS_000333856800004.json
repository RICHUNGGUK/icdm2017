Recently, many parallel swarm based algorithms have been developed for running on GPU (Graphic Processing Unit). Since nowadays developing a parallel Bee Algorithm running on the GPU becomes very important. In this paper, we extend the Bees Algorithm (CUBA (i.e. CUDA based Bees Algorithm)) in order to be run on the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). CUBA (CUDA based Bees Algorithm). We evaluate the performance of CUBA by conducting some experiments based on numerous famous optimization problems. Results show that CUBA significantly outperforms standard Bees Algorithm in numerous different optimization problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
