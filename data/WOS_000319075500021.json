Network-on-Chip is an efficient communication solution for many-core system. However, enhancing performance with lower energy consumption is still a challenge. One critical issue is mapping applications to NoC. This work proposed an online mapping method, which optimizes task mapping algorithm to reduce communication energy consumption. The communication status of applications at runtime is analyzed first. Then, the algorithm computes the mapping placement dynamically and implements the real-time mapping online. Experimental results based on simulation show that the algorithm proposed in this article can achieve more than 20% communication energy saving compared with first fit mapping and nearest neighbor mapping. The migration cost caused by the remapping process is also considered, and can be calculated at the runtime to estimate the effect of remapping.", "paper_title": "An energy-aware online task mapping algorithm in NoC-based system", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500021"}
