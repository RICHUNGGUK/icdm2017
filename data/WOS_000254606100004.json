In this paper, we proposed two types of combination methods of noise suppression algorithms: selection of front-end processor and combination of results from multiple recognition processes. Recognition results on the CENSREC-1 task showed the effectiveness of our proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Noisy speech recognition based on Integration/Selection of multiple noise suppression methods using noise GMMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000254606100004"}
