A variety of scaffold analyses have been carried out to derive statistics for scaffold distributions, generate structural organization schemes, or identify scaffolds that preferentially occur in given compound activity classes. Herein we further extend scaffold analysis by identifying scaffolds that display defined SAR profiles consisting of multiple properties. A structural relationship-based scaffold network has been designed as the basic data structure underlying our analysis. From network representations of scaffolds extracted from compounds active against 32 different target families, scaffolds with different SAR profiles have been extracted on the basis of decision trees that capture structural and functional characteristics of scaffolds in different ways. More than 600 scaffolds and 100 scaffold dusters were assigned to 10 SAR profiles. These scaffold sets represent different activity and target selectivity profiles and are provided for further SAR investigations including, for example, the exploration of alternative analog series for a given target of target family or the design of novel compounds on the basis of scaffold(s) with desired SAR profiles.", "paper_title": "Target Family-Directed Exploration of Scaffolds with Different SAR Profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000298315900012"}
