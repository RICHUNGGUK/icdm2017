In the Tree-turn model, links are classified as either a tree link or a cross link and six directions are associated with the channels of links. Then we can prohibit some of the turns formed by these six directions such that an efficient deadlock-free routing algorithm, Tree-turn routing, can be derived. There are three phases to develop the Tree-turn routing. First, a coordinated tree for a given topology is created. Second, a communication graph is constructed based on the topology and the corresponding coordinated tree. Third, the forwarding table is set up by using all-pairs shortest path algorithm according to the prohibited turns in the Tree-turn model and the directions of the channels in the communication graph. To evaluate the performance of the proposed Tree-turn routing, we develop a simulator and implement Tree-turn routing along with up*/down* routing, L-turn routing, and up*/down* routing with DFS methodology. The simulation results show that Tree-turn routing outperforms other routing algorithms for all the test cases.", "paper_title": "Tree-turn routing: an efficient deadlock-free routing algorithm for irregular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298297000015"}
