After stating the problem, we introduce some basic knowledge of level-2 fuzzy sets and the way to transform them to normal fuzzy sets. Then we use the CCP model to handle the bifuzzy objective functions and constraints, based on a series of preparations, we transform the multi-objective integer model under bifuzzy environment into a deterministic model, then use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve this problem. The model is illustrated with an actual application to construction material supply. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
