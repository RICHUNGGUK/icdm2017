The patterns are partitioned into clusters to group together similar patterns, a training set is built using the patterns that belong to a cluster. Each of the new sets is used to train a classifier. We show that the approach here presented, called FuzzyBagging, obtains performance better than Bagging. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
