Direct architectural support for these algorithms in future SWAR instruction sets could further increase performance as well as simplifying the programming task. A set of simple SWAR instruction set extensions are proposed for this purpose based on the principle of systematic support for inductive doubling as an algorithmic technique. These extensions are shown to significantly reduce instruction count in core parallel bit stream algorithms, often providing a 3X or better improvement. The extensions are also shown to be useful for SWAR programming in other application areas, including providing a systematic treatment for horizontal operations. An implementation model for these extensions involves relatively simple circuitry added to the operand fetch components in a pipelined processor.", "paper_title": "Architectural Support for SWAR Text Processing with Parallel Bit Streams: The Inductive Doubling Principle", "paper_id": "WOS:000266820200029"}
