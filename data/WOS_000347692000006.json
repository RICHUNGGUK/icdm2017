This system unites the power of formal methods with the accessibility of natural language, providing controllers for implementable high-level task specifications, easy-to-understand feedback on those that cannot be achieved, and natural language explanation of the reason for the robot's actions during execution. The natural language system uses domain-general components that can easily be adapted to cover the vocabulary of new applications. Generation of a linear temporal logic specification from the user's natural language input uses a novel data structure that allows for subsequent mapping of logical propositions back to natural language, enabling natural language feedback about problems with the specification that are only identifiable in the logical form. We demonstrate the robustness of the natural language understanding system through a user study where participants interacted with a simulated robot in a search and rescue scenario. Automated analysis and user feedback on unimplementable specifications is demonstrated using an example involving a robot assistant in a hospital.", "paper_title": "Provably correct reactive control from natural language", "paper_id": "WOS:000347692000006"}
