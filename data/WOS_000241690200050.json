In this paper, we propose a hybrid model for sentence ordering in extractive multi-document summarization that combines four relations between sentences. This model regards sentence as vertex and combined relation as edge of a directed graph on which the approximately optimal ordering can be generated with PageRank analysis. Evaluation of our hybrid model shows a significant improvement of the ordering over strategies losing some relations and the results also indicate that this hybrid model is robust for articles with different genre.", "paper_title": "A hybrid model for sentence ordering in extractive multi-document summarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200050"}
