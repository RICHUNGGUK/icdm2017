Initial work showed that FIPP p-cycle networks are comparable in capacity efficiency to existing methods of shared-backup path protection but employ fully pre-cross-connected protection paths. This makes FIPP p-cycles as fast as conventional span protecting p-cycles, and much faster than shared-backup path protection where spare channels must be assembled into protection paths in real time following a failure. The property of full pre-cross-connection of the protection structures is also an attractive advantage in transparent optical networking, where on-the-fly transparent concatenation of wavelength channels to form protection paths may not provide an adequate a priori assurance of optical path integrity. Thus, there are several motivations for interest in this new concept. Prior work on this topic has, however, considered only the design of FIPP p-cycle networks where the working demands are routed before decisions are made about the protection structures. Here we consider the problem of jointly optimized FIPP p-cycle network design and provide some insights, guidelines, and a semiheuristic procedure for coordinated routing of working demands and the generation of the protection structures.
