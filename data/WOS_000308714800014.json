The model is constructed in the Modelica language and the JModelica.org platform is used for optimization. The cost function expresses the economical profit during a grade change and is formulated using on-grade intervals for seven polymer quality variables such as melt index, density and reactor split factors. Additionally, incentives to produce polymer with quality variables on grade target values, not only inside grade intervals, are added. Twelve inflows and three purge flows are used as decision variables. Two grade changes are thoroughly reviewed, showing the effect of using a cost function that regards plant economy. Resulting trajectories can be divided into three phases with distinguishing features, and the synchronization of inflows and usage of recycle area off-gas flows are important in the grade changes.
