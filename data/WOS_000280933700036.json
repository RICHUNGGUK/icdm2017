Two methods are proposed to solve this equation. In both methods the spatial part of the equations is discretized using a high order spectral element method, based on assuming that the neutron flux can be expanded in terms of the modified Dubiner's polynomials. For the time discretization of the equations two different strategies have been considered. For the first a finite differences one-step implicit method has been used and the other method is based on a modal expansion of the flux in terms of the dominant Lambda modes of the reactor core. The performance of both methods has been tested for an hypothetical transient in a 2-dimensional VVER 440 reactor. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
