An Arnoldi-based technique is used to create compact models from the system matrices generated by a piezoelectric finite-element solver. The proposed approach also preserves the passivity of the generated compact models. The modeling results of a Rosen-type piezoelectric transformer are presented. The transient and frequency responses of the devices can be accurately simulated by the compact models. Moreover, compared with the full-meshed simulations, the compact models give computational speed-ups of at least two orders of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Generating Passive Compact Models for Piezoelectric Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000287658900012"}
