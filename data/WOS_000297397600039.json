The portfolio model integrates uncertainty in asset prices as well as several important real-world trading constraints. The resulting formulation is a structured large-scale problem that is solved using a model specific algorithm that consists of a decomposition, warm-start, and iterative procedure to minimize constraint violations. We present computational results and portfolio return values in comparison to a market performance measure. For many of the test cases the algorithm produces optimal solutions, where CPU time is improved greatly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
