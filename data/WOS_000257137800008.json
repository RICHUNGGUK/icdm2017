Direct video recordings of flow patterns were made using a simple technique of particles visualization. For the positively chamfered closely spaced ribs (p/e <= 5) vigorous vortex shedding has been seen compared to the square or negatively chamfered ribs, which is found to be a function of the Reynolds number. For the widely spaced ribs, the study shows flow separation at the ribs and reattachment in the inter-rib region. Local mass transfer studies, based on the variation in colour of cobaltous chloride solution impregnated paper due to evaporation of water, showed a significant improvement in mass transfer rate in the recirculating region in the wake of ribs with the change in the chamfer angle from -15 degrees to 15 degrees. The positively chamfered 15 degrees ribs are found to be better than square section ribs at p/e <= 7.5. The performance of negatively chamfered ribs is found to be poor compared to other ribs irrespective of the relative roughness pitch.", "paper_title": "Flow visualization and local mass transfer studies for turbulent now in a wind tunnel with chamfered ribs", "paper_id": "WOS:000257137800008"}
