For this NP-hard problem, the asymptotic optimality of the shortest processing time block (SPTB) heuristic is proven in the sense of limit. Moreover, three different improvements, namely, the job-insert scheme, tabu search and genetic algorithm, are introduced to enhance the quality of the original solution generated by the SPTB heuristic. At the end of the article, a series of numerical experiments demonstrate the convergence of the heuristic, the performance of the improvements and the effectiveness of the quadratic objective.", "paper_title": "On the asymptotic optimality and improved strategies of SPTB heuristic for open-shop scheduling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363600005"}
