Our model strengthens previous models to capture more attacks and achieve essential security goals for multipath key establishment. In this model, we can apply protocols for perfectly secure message transmission to solve the multipath key establishment problem. We propose a simple new protocol for optimal one-round perfectly secure message transmission based on Reed-Solomon codes. Then, we use this protocol to obtain two new multipath key establishment schemes that can be applied provided that fewer than one-third of the paths are controlled by the adversary. Finally, we describe another MPKE scheme that tolerates a higher fraction (less than half) of paths controlled by the adversary. This scheme is based on a new protocol for a weakened version of message transmission, which is very simple and efficient. Our multipath key establishment schemes achieve improved security and lower communication complexity, as compared to previous schemes.", "paper_title": "Three Improved Algorithms for Multipath Key Establishment in Sensor Networks Using Protocols for Secure Message Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000294783800011"}
