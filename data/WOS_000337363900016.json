Based on this approach, the systems are shown to own a strong property, namely, small-controllability. As an immediate application, the obtained small-controllability results are generalised to the continuous-time Hammerstein-nonlinear systems and some continuous-time versions of small-controllability are presented.", "paper_title": "On small-controllability of a class of Hammerstein-nonlinear systems - an implicit function approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363900016"}
