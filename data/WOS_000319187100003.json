Range and precision analysis are two important steps of this process to assign suitable integer and fractional bit-widths to the fixed-point variables and constant coefficients in a design such that no overflow occurs and a given error bound on maximum mismatch (MM) or mean-square-error (MSE) and signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) is satisfied. This paper explores efficient optimization algorithms based on robust analyses of MM and MSE/SQNR for fixed-point polynomial data-flow graphs. Experimental results illustrate the robustness of our analyses and the efficiency of the optimization algorithms compared to previous work.", "paper_title": "On the Fixed-Point Accuracy Analysis and Optimization of Polynomial Specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000319187100003"}
