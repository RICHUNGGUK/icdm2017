This problem is of interest to the nuclear industry where the morphology of deposited material impacts on its associated criticality risk. An existing model for simulating geological-stalagmite formations is adapted to the case of dripping salt-solutions which form thin films of fluid that precipitate out over time, forming accumulations. The implementation of a CFD Volume-ofFluid multiphase model is developed such that the fluid-flow is coupled to the crystallisation kinetics and a moving-boundary model is used for describing the size and shape of growing crystalline deposits. The fluid-flow and forming accumulation are fully coupled, with the model able to account for solute diffusion and solvent evaporation. Results are in good agreement with experimental data for surrogate salt-solutions. Numerical results are presented to assess the sensitivity to process and environmental parameters.
