One is to modify feature searching engines based on optimization theory, and the other is to improve the regularization capability using point injection techniques. The second topic is undoubtedly important in the situations where overfilling is likely to be met, for example, the ones with only small sample sets available. Synthetic and real data are used to demonstrate the contribution of our proposed strategies.", "paper_title": "An excellent feature selection model using gradient-based and point injection techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100076"}
