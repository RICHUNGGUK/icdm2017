In this paper, a new mechanism is presented that the multiple ring formation is a result of shear layer instability. According to our DNS observation, a momentum deficit zone is formed above the original hairpin vortex tube due to the ejection of the streamwise hairpin vortex tube, which brings the low speed flow from the lower level to the higher level of the boundary layer through vortex rotation. Then the momentum deficit zone generates a sharp olive-shaped shear layer surrounded by the high speed flow. As the shear layer moves up, inviscid instability is developed due to the existence of inflection points (inflection surface in 3-D). Consequently, the new vortex rings are formed one by one. During the new spanwise vortex ring formation process, the spanwise vorticity is increased; however, the original streamwise hairpin vortex tube is weakened with decreasing of the streamwise vorticity. This process follows the Helmoholtz vorticity conservation law. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
