However, few existing works dedicatedly consider the Continuous Data Collection (CDC) capacity for WSNs under the protocol interference model. In this paper, we propose a multipath scheduling algorithm for SDC in single-radio multichannel WSNs and derive its network capacity which is a tighter lower bound compared with the previously best result [10]. We also propose a novel CDC method for dual-radio multichannel WSNs. It significantly speeds up the data collection process, and achieves a capacity of nW/12Minverted right perpendicular(3.63 rho(2)+c(3)rho+c(4))/Hinverted left perpendicular when Delta(e) <= 12 or nW/M Delta(e) inverted right perpendicular(3.63 rho(2)+c(3)rho+c(4))/Hinverted left perpendicular when Delta(e) > 12, where n is the number of the sensors, M is a constant value and usually M << n, Delta(e) is the maximum number of the leaf nodes having a same parent in the data collection tree, W is the channel bandwidth, H is the number of available orthogonal channels, rho is the ratio of the interference radius over the transmission radius, c(3) = 8 pi/root 3 + pi + 2, and c(4) = 8 pi/root 3 + 2 pi + 6. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms improve network capacity significantly compared with existing works.", "paper_title": "Continuous Data Collection Capacity of Dual-Radio Multichannel Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307824600004"}
