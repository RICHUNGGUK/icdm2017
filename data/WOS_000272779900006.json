The spatial distribution of node locations in a mobile model plays a key role when investigating the characteristics of a MANET. However, most existing mobility models with random and simple straight line movement lead to unrealistic scenarios and non-uniform distributions, and can not describe the actual movement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) connected via a MANET. To address this issue, a novel mobility model based on semi-random circular movement (SRCM) is presented. The approximate node distribution function in SRCM is derived within a 2D disk region. The relationship between application performance and node distribution is investigated for a UAV MANET, with focus on scan coverage and network connectivity. A simulation using the NS2 tool is conducted. It is shown that the presented model with a uniform distribution performs better than the popular Random Waypoint mobility model. The SRCM model with the NS2 simulator provides a realistic way for simulation and performance evaluation of UAV MANETs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
