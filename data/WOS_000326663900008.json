There is an urgent need for an integrated view on the provision and use of these services for better governance and productivity. Developing an integrated view is challenging due to the dispersion of relevant data sets and the underlying complexity of increasingly interconnected infrastructure networks. Using a case study in New South Wales (Australia), we demonstrate how tools and processes in Geospatial Business Intelligence (Geo-BI) can be harnessed using a collective design approach to develop an integrated solution; the SMART Infrastructure Dashboard (SID). While providing a much needed planning and policy support tool for the local governance of infrastructure services, SID pushes the boundary of Geo-BI beyond its traditional use.
