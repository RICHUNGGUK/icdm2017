We study the degradable processor arrays to achieve fault tolerance by employing reconfiguration. Three bypass schemes and three rerouting schemes are proposed to reconfigure three-dimensional processor arrays with defective processors to achieve target arrays without faults. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to construct a target array on the selected rows and columns. It is also proved that the proposed greedy plane rerouting algorithm (GPR) produces maximum target array. In addition, the problem of constructing the communication efficient array is considered in this paper. An algorithm is proposed to refine the communication among processors within the target array constructed by GPR. Experimental study shows that the proposed algorithm GPR produces target arrays with higher harvest and lower degradation on the host arrays with fault density no more than 5%. In addition, the communication performance is significantly optimized by reducing the number of long interconnects, and the average improvement is about 34% for all cases considered in this paper.
