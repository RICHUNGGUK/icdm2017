The length and rate of these events have a significant effect on network quality of service (QoS). The packet delay resulting from these congestion events also influences QoS. In this paper a technique for predicting these properties of congestion events in the presence of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) traffic is developed.", "paper_title": "Predicting properties of congestion events for a queueing system with fBm traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000250245300010"}
