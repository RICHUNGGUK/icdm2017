In this method, a suitable reference model is chosen by parameters estimation and fuzzy rules when changes occurred to the original model parameters. A successful application to the speed servo system of a dynamic model of a Brushless DC motor (BLDCM) shows this method works well with high dynamic performance under the condition of command speed change and load torque disturbance, so the applicability and validity of FMRMAC in pa-rameters variation system accommodation control was proven.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy multiple reference models adaptive control scheme study", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100041"}
