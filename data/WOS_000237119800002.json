Since omega < 2.38, this algorithm breaks through the O(n(1.5)) barrier for the matching problem. This is the first result of this kind for general planar graphs. We also present an algorithm for generating perfect matchings in planar graphs uniformly at random using O(n(omega/2)) arithmetic operations. Our algorithms are based on the Gaussian elimination approach to maximum matchings introduced in [16].", "paper_title": "Maximum matchings in planar graphs via Gaussian elimination", "paper_id": "WOS:000237119800002"}
