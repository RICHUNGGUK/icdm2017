It provides a framework for a web-based 3D assembly system that uses a customizable product model to significantly simplify the configuration and the assembly process, and a customer-driven recommendation helper to assist the customers make their design decisions. Two assembly-specific data formats - Assembly ML and Parametric Product ML are developed for archival and data transfer. The system aims to capture the customers' needs and convert them into technical specifications, indirectly helping to promote e-commerce for manufacturing enterprises.", "paper_title": "Customer-driven collaborative product assembler for Internet-based commerce", "paper_id": "WOS:000240563600002"}
