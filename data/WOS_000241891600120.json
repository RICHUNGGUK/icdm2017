SOPSO emphasizes the information interactions between the particle-lever and the swarm-lever, and introduce feedback to simulate the function. Through the feedback information, the particles can perceive the swarm-lever state and adopt favorable behavior model to modify their behavior, which not only can modify the exploitation and the exploration of the algorithm adaptively, but also can vary the diversity of the swarm and contribute to a global optimum output in the swarm. Relative experiments have been done; the results show SOPSO performs very well on benchmark problems, and outperforms the basic PSO in search ability.", "paper_title": "Self-organization particle swarm optimization based on information feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600120"}
