In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to similar to 24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to similar to 8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.", "paper_title": "CD-HIT: accelerated for clustering the next-generation sequencing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000311902700023"}
