In this paper, a novel predictive model of MI, fuzzy functions with dynamic fuzzy neural networks (FF-D-FNN), which combines the universal approximation property of fuzzy functions and the parsimonious structure with high performance of dynamic fuzzy neural networks (D-FNN), is first proposed. Research on the FF-D-FNN is further accomplished with the data from a real PP plant and the results are compared among the neural network, fuzzy neural networks, D-FNN and FF-D-FNN models. The research results show the accuracy and universality of the presented model for the online MI prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
