The uncertainty band around the balance set is introduced to account for unpredictable variations of important parameters or utilities created by instability in multi-objective optimization of large scale projects. Then, instability of dynamic models of growth is considered including population dynamics with saturation and long term optimal planning in social and economic spheres. A method of successive refinement in a synthetic multi-model system is proposed, and application of the sequence of refined models is illustrated on a real-life example of construction of a darn with yearly refinements of the initial model, based on past history of project realization.
