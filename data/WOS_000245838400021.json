Topically, marker-driven watershed segmentation extracts seeds indicating the presence of objects or background at specific image locations. The marker locations are then set to be regional minima within the topological surface (typically, the gradient of the original input image), and the watershed algorithm is applied. In contrast, our approach uses two classifiers, one trained to produce markers, the other trained to produce object boundaries. As a result of using machine-learned pixel classification, the proposed algorithm is directly applicable to both single channel and multichannel image data. Additionally, rather than flooding the gradient image, we use the inverted probability map produced by the second aforementioned classifier as input to the watershed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the classification-driven watershed segmentation algorithm for the tasks of 1) image-based granulometry and 2) remote sensing.", "paper_title": "Classification-driven watershed segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000245838400021"}
