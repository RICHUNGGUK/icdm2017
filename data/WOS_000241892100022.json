Comparison of optimization performance between KPSO and PSO with three test functions shows that KPSO has better optimization performance than PSO. The combination of KPSO and ANN is also introduced (KPSONN). Then, KPSONN is applied to construct a soft-sensor of acrylonitrile yield. After comparing with practical industrial data, the result shows that KPSONN is feasible and effective in soft-sensor of acrylonitrile yield.", "paper_title": "The Kalman particle swarm optimization algorithm and its application in soft-sensor of acrylonitrile yield", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100022"}
