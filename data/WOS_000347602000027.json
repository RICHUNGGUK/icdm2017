The goal is to maximize the sum of the jobs payoffs, which are defined with regard to some common delivery dates. The problem is strongly NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a polynomial time approximation algorithm with both absolute and relative performance guarantees. The time complexity of the approximation algorithm is O (KN log N), N being the number of jobs and K the number of delivery dates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
