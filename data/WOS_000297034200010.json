The technique combines features from the double-flux multi-component model, nonlinear error-controlled WENO, adaptive TVD slope limiters, rotated Riemann solvers, and adaptive mesh refinement to obtain a method that is both robust and accurate. Success of the technique is demonstrated using an extensive series of numerical experiments including premixed deflagrations, Chapman-Jouget detonations, re-shocked Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, shock-wave and hydrogen gas column interaction, and multi-dimensional detonations. This technique is relatively straight-forward to implement using an existing compressible Navier-Stokes solver based on Godunov's method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
