Routing and transmission scheduling have a major impact on the capacity provided to the clients. A cross-layer optimization of these problems allows the routing to take into account contentions due to radio interference. We present a generic mixed integer linear programing description of the configurations of a given WMN, addressing gateway placement, routing, and scheduling optimizations. We then develop new optimization models that can take into account a large variety of radio interference models, and QoS requirements on the routing. We also provide efficient resolution methods that deal with realistic size instances. It allows to work around the combinatoric of simultaneously achievable transmissions and point out a critical region in the network bounding the network achievable capacity. Based upon strong duality arguments, it is then possible to restrict the computation to a bounded area. It allows for computing solutions very efficiently on large networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
