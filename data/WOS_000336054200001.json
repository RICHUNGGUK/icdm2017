In this paper, we propose an automatic approach for straightening up slanted man-made structures in an input image to improve its perceptual quality. We call this type of correction upright adjustment. We propose a set of criteria for upright adjustment based on human perception studies, and develop an optimization framework which yields an optimal homography for adjustment. We also develop a new optimization-based camera calibration method that performs favorably to previous methods and allows the proposed system to work reliably for a wide range of images. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated by both quantitative comparisons and qualitative user study.", "paper_title": "Automatic Upright Adjustment of Photographs with Robust Camera Calibration", "paper_id": "WOS:000336054200001"}
