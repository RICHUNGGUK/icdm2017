Possible alternatives to reduce the power consumption in generic sensor nodes are presented. After, these alternatives are evaluated for a specific sensor node, the Crossbow Mica2. The case analysis for this sensor node showed that, among the possible alternatives to reduce the power consumption, the radio communication channel presented the best opportunity. A novel solution that integrates the transmitted signal power control with the received information quality is presented in a dynamic mechanism called Maximal Survival Capacity.", "paper_title": "An approach for the reduction of power consumption in sensor nodes of wireless sensor networks: Case analysis of Mica2", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423500015"}
