Appearance-based estimation methods usually require a ground-truth dataset taken from a scene that is similar to test video sequences. However, it is almost impossible to acquire many manually labeled head images for each scene. We introduce an approach that automatically aggregates labeled head images by inferring head direction labels from walking direction. Furthermore, in order to deal with large variations that occur in head appearance even within the same scene, we introduce an approach that segments a scene into multiple regions according to the similarity of head appearances. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieved higher accuracy in head direction estimation than conventional approaches that use a scene-independent generic dataset.
