The non-Newtonian behaviour of blood flow is modelled by the Carreau-Yasuda viscosity model. Higher velocity and shear stress magnitudes, relative to Newtonian cases, are observed for the shear-thinning simulations in response to changes in the shear-rate dependent Womersley parameter. We also investigate the flexibility of the method through the shear-thinning behaviour of the lattice Boltzmann relaxation parameter at different Deborah numbers.", "paper_title": "Mesoscopic simulations of unsteady shear-thinning flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400011"}
