In this paper, we deal with the problem of computing a next-to-shortest (u,v)-path. We propose an an O(n(2)) time algorithm for solving this problem, which significantly improves the bound of a previous one in O(n(3)) time where n is the number of vertices in G.", "paper_title": "A Quadratic Algorithm for Finding Next-to-Shortest Paths in Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000293234800009"}
