In order to evaluate security protocols against any attack, formal methods are equipped with a number of techniques. Unfortunately, formal methods are applicable for static state only, and don't guarantee detecting all possible flaws. Therefore, formal methods should be complemented with dynamic protection. Anomaly detection systems are very suitable for security protocols environments as dynamic activities protectors. This paper presents an intrusion detection system that uses a number of different anomaly detection techniques to detect attacks against security protocols.", "paper_title": "Security protocols protection based on anomaly detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000234952100023"}
