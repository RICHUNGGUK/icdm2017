This study uses the case study of intelligent parking services with the mobile application technology and vehicle license plate recognition system in a high-end shopping mall. In the problem definition stage, the research analyzes the enterprise problem. In the service resolution stage, the TRIZ contradiction analysis and the service blueprint of the parking service as it existed is depicted from the principles of problem resolution. In the solution evaluation stage, new intelligent parking mobile applications (apps) are proposed following the principles generated in the second stage. Furthermore, the failure points and waiting points in the prior service blueprint are overcome and the new service performance is significantly improved. It contributes to enriching the service design literature, and extends the range of TRIZ applications for future parking technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
