Users in superior classes should be allowed to derive the secret keys belonging to subordinate classes. In this Paper, We propose a new time bound hierarchy key assignment scheme to achieve this goal. Compared with the existing similar schemes, our scheme is more secure and needs less computational time. Furthermore, our scheme does not need tamper-resistant device, Which makes our scheme much more practical.", "paper_title": "A PRACTICAL TIME BOUND HIERARCHICAL KEY SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000271036900027"}
