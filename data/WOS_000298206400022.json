The algorithm imitates the procedure of human visual attention derived in a psychological experiment. The merit of human visual attention is to neglect most inner points directly. The proposed algorithm achieves a significant saving in time and space in comparison with the two best convex hull algorithms mentioned in a latest review proposed by Chadnov and Skvortsov in 2004. Furthermore, we propose to use an affine transformation to solve the narrow shape problem for computing the convex hull faster. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
