Maximization of these differences would improve characterization of the arrhythmogenic substrate. A novel spectral estimator (NSE) has been shown previously to provide greater distinction in AF spectral parameters as compared with the Fourier transform estimator. Herein, it is described how the differences in NSE spectral parameters can be further improved. Method: In 10 persistent and 9 paroxysmal AF patients undergoing electrophysiologic study, fractionated electrograms were acquired from the distal bipolar ablation electrode. A total of 204 electrograms were recorded from the pulmonary vein (PV) antra and from the anterior and posterior left atrial free wall. The following spectral parameters were measured: the dominant frequency (DF), which reflects local activation rate, the DF amplitude (DA), and the mean spectral profile (MP), which represents background electrical activity. To optimize differences in parameters between paroxysmal versus persistent AF patients, the NSE was varied by selectively removing subharmonics, using a threshold. The threshold was altered in steps to determine the optimal subharmonics removal. Results: At the optimal threshold level, mean differences in persistent versus paroxysmal AF spectral parameters were: Delta DA = +0.371 mV, Delta DF = +0.737 Hz, and Delta MP = -0.096 mV. When subharmonics were not removed, the differences were substantially less: Delta DA = +0.301 mV, Delta DF = +0.699 Hz, and Delta MP = -0.063 mV. Conclusions: NSE optimization produces greater spectral parameter difference between persistent versus paroxysmal AF data. Quantifying spectral parameter differences can be assistive in characterizing the arrhythmogenic substrate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
