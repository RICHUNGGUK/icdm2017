This article shows that fine-tuning these two constraints leads to different expressive strengths, some of them lying well beyond polynomial time. This is done by introducing a new semantics, called algebraic context semantics. The framework stems from Gonthier's original work (itself a model of Girard's geometry of interaction) and turns out to be a versatile and powerful tool for the quantitative analysis of normalization in the lambda calculus with constants and higher-order recursion.", "paper_title": "The Geometry of Linear Higher-Order Recursion", "paper_id": "WOS:000266012100001"}
