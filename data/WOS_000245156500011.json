The major feature of the framework is that the encoder estimates the effects of postprocessing concealment and includes those effects in the rate-distortion analysis. Based on the framework, we develop a rate-distortion optimization algorithm to generate multiple scalable bitstreams. The algorithm maximizes the expected peak signal-to-noise ratio by optimally assigning forward error control codes and transmission schemes in a constrained bandwidth. The framework is a general approach motivated by previous methods that perform concealment in the decoder, as in our special case. Simulations show that the proposed approach can be implemented efficiently and that it outperforms previous methods by more than 2 dB.", "paper_title": "Combined error concealment and error correction in rate-distortion analysis for multiple substream transmissions", "paper_id": "WOS:000245156500011"}
