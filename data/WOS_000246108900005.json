In particular, we consider the M/M/c queue, for c large, but application of the method to the repairman problem is almost identical, and the general approach presented should extend to other queue types. The estimation procedure makes use of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion approximation to the Markov process description of the queue. We demonstrate the approach through simulation studies and discuss situations in which the approximation works best.", "paper_title": "Estimation for queues from queue length data", "paper_id": "WOS:000246108900005"}
