Its concept of rich multimedia presentation together with temporal based link objects, gives a chance for use in engineering education courses, where many practical work and experiments are needed. in the article we present a strategy for the development and navigation of hypervideo application, to be used in engineering education. Example of magnetic suspension system experiment was built as hypervideo application. The system usability was tested with two methods, software usability measurement inventory (SUMI) evaluation and general approach to usability engineering. Test results have shown that hypervideo increases the users' motivation to work and helps students recognize, organize and present specific information. By applying some of the proposed improvements in future development, hypervideo could be a significant tool in the future of engineering education.
