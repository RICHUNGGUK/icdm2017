In this paper, the optimal design of the EIR filter by the semi-infinite programming (SIP) is investigated and an iterative technique for optimally designing the EIR filter is proposed. The simulation experiment validates the effectiveness of the SIP technique and the proposed iterative technique in the optimal design of the EIR filter.", "paper_title": "An Iterative Technique for Optimally Designing Extrapolated Impulse Response Filter in the Mini-Max Sense", "paper_id": "WOS:000326667500016"}
