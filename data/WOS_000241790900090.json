The difference of two shapes is measured by the distance between their corresponding CLF. The proposed CLF is invariant to rotation, scaling and translation. It is robust to noise and simple to compute. Experimental results indicate that CLF is an effective shape descriptor.", "paper_title": "Shape matching using chord-length function", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900090"}
