To do this, a Measure (called the belief that process is in control) is first defined and then an equation is developed to update the belief recursively by taking new observations on the quality characteristic under consideration. Finally. the tipper and the lower control limits on the belief are derived such that when the updated belief falls Outside the control limits an out-of-control alarm is received. In order to understand the proposed methodology and to evaluate its performance, some numerical examples are provided by means of simulation. In these examples, the in and out-of-control average run lengths (ARL) of the proposed method are compared to the corresponding ARL's of the optimal EWMA, Shewhart EWMA, GEWMA, GLR, and CUSUM [11] methods within different scenarios of the process mean shifts. The simulation results show that the proposed methodology performs better than other charts for all of the examined shift scenarios. In addition. for an autocorrelated AR(1) process, the performance of the proposed control chart compared to the other existing residual-based control charts turns out to be promising.
