The governing differential equations are discretized with a consistent mass conservative scheme that naturally applies to all flow regimes. The resulting mildly nonlinear system, at every time step, is efficiently solved with a converging, properly devised, nested Newton-type algorithm. It will be shown that with the proposed semi-implicit model, high accuracy can be achieved at a moderate computational cost.
