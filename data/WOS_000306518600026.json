In this paper, we focus exclusively on the reader-to-tag channel. The first part of this paper presents modulation codes that possess a high minimum and a high average power. This is important, since the tag gets its entire power from the received signal, and the information should be modulated in a way that maximizes the power transferred to the tag. The presented modulation codes compare favorably to codes used in radio frequency identification applications today. The second part of the paper describes modulation codes with some error-correcting capabilities. In fact, most errors in the reader-to-tag channel are due to incorrect timing. Here, we propose to model the timing errors in the reader-to-tag communication channel by a simple bit-shift channel, and we will present optimal (in the sense of maximizing the code rate for a given block length) single bit-shift error-correcting codes for this simple bit-shift channel that also have large average power.", "paper_title": "Coding for Inductively Coupled Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518600026"}
