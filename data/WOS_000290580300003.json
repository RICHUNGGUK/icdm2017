And a common characteristic of these factors is that they are dynamic in nature. Such factors include new vulnerabilities and threats, the network policy structure and traffic. These factors can be divided into two broad categories. Network risk and service risk. As the name implies, the former one corresponds to risk associated with the network policy whereas the later one depends on the services and software running on the system. Therefore, evaluating security from both the service and policy perspective can allow the management system to make decisions regarding how a system should be changed to enhance security as par the management objective. Such decision making includes choosing between alternative security architectures, designing security countermeasures, and to systematically modify security configurations to improve security. As there may be real time changes to the network threat, this evaluation must be done dynamically to handle such changes. In this paper, we provide a security metric framework that quantifies objectively the most significant security risk factors, which include existing vulnerabilities, historical trend of vulnerabilities of the remotely accessible services, prediction of potential vulnerabilities for these services and their estimated severity, unused address space and finally propagation of an attack within the network. These factors cover both the service aspect and the network aspect of risk toward a system. We have implemented this framework as a user-friendly tool called Risk based prOactive seCurity cOnfiguration maNAger (ROCONA) and showed how this tool simplifies security configuration management of services and policies in a system using risk measurement and mitigation. We also combine all the components into one single metric and present validation experiments using real-life vulnerability data from National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and show comparison with two existing risk measurement tools.", "paper_title": "Objective Risk Evaluation for Automated Security Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000290580300003"}
