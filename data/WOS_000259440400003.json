A hidden Markov model (HMM)-based cry classification algorithm is presented. A parallel HMM (PHMM) for coping with age masking, based on a maximum-likelihood decision rule, is introduced. The performance of the proposed algorithm under different model parameters and different feature sets is studied using a database of cries of infants with cleft palate (CLP). The proposed algorithm yields an average of 91% correct classification rate in a subject- and age-dependent experiment. In addition, it is shown that the PHMM significantly outperforms the HMM performance in classification of cries of CLP infants of different ages.", "paper_title": "Classification of cries of infants with cleft-palate using parallel hidden Markov models", "paper_id": "WOS:000259440400003"}
