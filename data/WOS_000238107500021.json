TIMEDTTCN-3 is a real-time extension of test specification language TTCN-3. In this paper, test notations for real-time interoperability testing are studied. Test behavior trees are constructed from specifications of system under test and then transformed to TIMEDTTCN-3 test cases. We also investigate real-time TTCN and analyze the insufficiency of its capabilities in specifying time constraints. Possible extensions for real-time TTCN are given to specify real-time interoperability test cases. From the comparisons between the two real-time test notations, it can be concluded that TIMEDTTCN-3 is more powerful and flexible than real-time TTCN and can be suitable for real-time interoperability testing.", "paper_title": "Using TIMEDTTCN-3 in interoperability testing for real-time communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107500021"}
