Measured vibrations in accelerations from passing metro trains were used as nonperiodic excitation of the object on the level of its foundation slab. Results of the dynamic calculation are used to document the nature of the building structure response, and of the reduction/amplification of the vibrations at selected points of individual storeys during the pass of metro trains, including the frequency characteristics of the response. The comparison of the building response without and with vibro-isolation is used to demonstrate the efficiency of using a rubber layer in the footing bottom for reducing the transfer of vibrations from the metro to the building. Measurement of the vibrations when the construction had been finished allowed to compare the vibration prognosis to vibrations actually measured in the finished structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
