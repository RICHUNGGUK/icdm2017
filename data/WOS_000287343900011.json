Although such an approach seems interesting to the students, researchers have emphasized the need for well-designed learning support in order to improve the students' learning achievements. Therefore, it has become an important issue to develop methodologies or tools to assist the students to learn in a mobile learning environment. Based on this perspective, this study proposes a formative assessment-based approach for improving the learning achievements of students in a mobile learning environment. A mobile learning environment has been developed based on this approach, and an experiment on a local culture course has been conducted in southern Taiwan to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only promotes the students' learning interest and attitude, but also improves their learning achievement. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
