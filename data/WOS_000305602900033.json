Complexes were fully optimized in C-s symmetry with the metal ions coordinated either to nitrogen (1a) or oxygen atoms (1b). For all the cases performed in this work, 1a was always more stable than 1b. Considering each row it is possible to see that the binding energy increases with the atomic number. The M2+ cation binding energies increase in the following order: Fe2+ < Ru2+ < Co2+ < Ni2+ < Rh2+ < Pd2+. In addition, it was observed the preference of Pd2+ and Rh2+ complexes for a tetrahedral arrangement, while Fe2+, Ru2+, Co2+, Ni2+ complexes had a preference for the octahedral arrangement. From the orbital representation results, it was seen that 1b unsymmetrical orbitals may influence the susceptibility over metal ions orientation toward heteroatoms orbitals.", "paper_title": "First- and second-row transition metal oxa-aza macrocyclic complexes: a DFT study of an octahedral conformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000305602900033"}
