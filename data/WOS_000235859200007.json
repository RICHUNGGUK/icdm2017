Unfortunately, almost all the different approaches work on a pixel-by-pixel basis, yielding them unusable in real-time situations as well as not much expressive at a semantic level of the video. We present in this paper a novel method of tracking objects through occlusions that exploits the wealth of information due to the spatial coherence between pixels, using a graph-based, multi-resolution representation of the moving regions. The experimental results show that the approach is promising. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
