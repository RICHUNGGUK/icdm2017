However, these methods represent individual efforts. In this paper, we show that by combining different algorithms and their outcome, the results improve significantly. For this reason, CONAN has been created, a system which combines different programs and their outcome. Its methods include tagging of gene/protein names, finding interaction and mutation data, tagging of biological concepts and linking to MeSH and Gene Ontology terms. Results: In this paper, we will present data that show that combining different text-mining algorithms significantly improves the results. Not only is CONAN a full-scale approach that will ultimately cover all of PubMed/MEDLINE, we also show that this universality has no effect on quality: our system performs as well as or better than existing systems. Availability: The LDD corpus presented is available by request to the author. The system will be available shortly.
