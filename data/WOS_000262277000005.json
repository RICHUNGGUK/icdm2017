In gossiping, every vertex holds a message that has to be transmitted to all other vertices. This article deals with k-failure tolerant gossiping, which investigates the minimum number of transmissions (calls) required by the communication process, provided that at most k transmissions may fail. We show new bounds for the number of transmissions, an improvement over previous results if k is sufficiently large. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
