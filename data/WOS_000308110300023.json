To achieve fine-grained access control over the outsourced data, we propose Self-Healing Attribute-based Privacy Aware Data Sharing in Cloud (SAPDS). The proposed system delegates the key distribution and management process to a cloud server without seeping out any confidential information. It facilitates data owner to restrain access of the user with whom data has been shared. User revocation is achieved by merely changing one attribute associated with the decryption policy, instead of modifying the entire access control policy. It enables authorized users to update their decryption keys followed by each user revocation, making it self-healing, without ever interacting with the data owner. Computation analysis of the proposed system shows that data owner can revoke n' users with the complexity of O(n'). Besides this, legitimate users can update their decryption keys with the complexity of O(1).", "paper_title": "SAPDS: self-healing attribute-based privacy aware data sharing in cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000308110300023"}
