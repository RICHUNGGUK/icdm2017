In OR, the sensor nodes in intermediate cluster generate the independent coding vector through simple forwarding or decoding-recoding manners opportunistically, so that the number of received packets can be reduced. To evaluate the algorithm, we derive the average number of received packets, the transmitting nodes, and decoding failure probability under specific assumption. The obtained theoretical and simulation results verify the effectiveness offered by the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Novel Energy-Efficient Reception Method Based on Random Network Coding in Cooperative Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356685700001"}
