With a parametric evaluation function method, the Z-scores of all the proteins in a training set are optimized simultaneously to obtain the best parameter set of the potential. For this multi-objective and multi-constraint problem, the new optimization scheme is very effective. The derived potential is then tested on two high-quality decoy sets and compared with other classical fold recognition potentials. With the simplified energy potential, we achieve a high level of discrimination capability between correct and incorrect folds.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Energy Potential for Protein Fold Recognition with Parametric Evaluation Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000263770200002"}
