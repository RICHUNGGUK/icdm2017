In this model, a B cell makes a key role that takes antigens in, so as to generate antibodies as its outputs. Under five different kinds of adjustment by suppressor T cells, number of antibodies will keep to a certain degree through influencing the B cell's activation. On the other hand, with help T cells, different B cells could cooperate from each other, which makes the system's dynamic behavior appear more complex, such as phenomena of limit cycle, chaos, etc. Simulative results show that limit cycle and chaos may exist simultaneously when four units are in connection, and the network's characteristic has a close relationship with the intensity of suppressor T cell's function.", "paper_title": "A novel model of artificial immune network and simulations on its dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000133"}
