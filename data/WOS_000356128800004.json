In this paper, new quantitative quality assessments are proposed to separately evaluate the capabilities of single channel speech enhancement algorithms in terms of maintaining the clean speech, noise reduction and overall performance. Based on these aspects, three evaluation results can be provided for any one test speech signal by analyzing the residual signal which is the difference between the clean speech and the processed speech. Several common speech enhancement algorithms are compared by these objective measures as well as subjective listening tests. High correlations between the scores of the objective measures and subjective ratings clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation methodologies on the different speech enhancement algorithms.
