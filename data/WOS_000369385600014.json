In this paper, a service-oriented approach cloud process service is proposed to achieve a collaborative processing environment for distributed participants. In order to implement the cloud process service, it's important to identify the existing process resources and capabilities, then virtualize them as processing services. In the first place, basic features of process service are summarized, and a standardized business model and process knowledge base are built to describe concept, cloud service and relevant features. Besides, a seven layer structure of cloud platform is proposed with a virtualization methodology to describe process service, source provider and process service requests. In the end, a case is presented to demonstrate the ability of integrating cloud process services.", "paper_title": "Approaches of Collaborative Cloud Process Service: Constructing Service-Oriented Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000369385600014"}
