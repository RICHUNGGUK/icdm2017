Citizens are increasingly aware of this importance. This awareness results in an increasing demand for environmental information tailored to their specific needs and background. We present an environmental information platform that supports submission of user queries related to environmental conditions and orchestrates results from complementary services to generate personalized suggestions. The system discovers and processes reliable data in the Web in order to convert them into knowledge. At runtime, this information is transferred into an ontology-structured knowledge base, from which then information relevant to the specific user is deduced and communicated in the language of their preference. The platform is demonstrated with real world use cases in the south area of Finland, showing the impact it can have on the quality of everyday life.", "paper_title": "Getting the environmental information across: from the Web to the user", "paper_id": "WOS:000355958900006"}
