This system is an extended version of the original uni-directional FT-TR ring architecture, in which every node is equipped with a fixed-tuned transmitter and a tunable reciever on each ring. This study proposes a novel FAirness and REservation integrated protocol, designated FARE, which incorporates three mechanisms designed specifically to resolve the receiver collision problem, to achieve fairness among all of the network nodes, and to meet the tight delay requirements of multimedia applications. Simulation results are presents to demonstrate that FARE provides a high performance for real-time traffic while simultaneously providing significant performance improvement for the best-effort traffic.
