In any decision process, the former phase is usually the premise of the latter one. Alternatives' evaluation is the concept that largely depends on the experts and their expertise, which increase uncertainty in the decision-making process. In addition to all proposed methods for having the experts' knowledge as evaluations of the alternatives, utilizing expert decision support systems (EDSS) can be a sensible response to such a need. Having evaluated the alternatives in the first phase of a decision-making process, the second phase of the process deals with the ranking the alternatives based on their performances obtained from the first phase. In this paper, we discuss the architecture of a fuzzy system including both modules, utilizing fuzzy concept for dealing with the uncertainty of the problem. Concerning the problem we had been dealt with, our system comprises a fuzzy evaluation module, which is a fuzzy expert system and an appropriate tool for evaluating the existing alternatives promptly and smoothly, without the imposed time delays by the experts to propose their comments and the uncertainty of such expertise-based comments, and a fuzzy ranking module, which is a fuzzy version of ELECTRE III method ranking the alternatives based on their outranking relations and by considering the existing uncertainty in their performances. This way the final ranking is resulted from an independent fuzzy system, which has considered the existing uncertainty in the evaluations not once but twice. Our proposed system has been applied to a real case of vendor selection process in one of the greatest and the most famous companies in the Iranian oil industry, OIEC, and the results are discussed.
