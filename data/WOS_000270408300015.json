We present a novel bandwidth scheduling scheme that integrates specific scheduling implementations in the optical line terminal and optical network units. This scheduling enables multiservice access with scalable quality of service support for the triple-play (video, voice, and data) services and open access. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm performs very well in supporting service differentiation and fair allocation of bandwidth to different service providers. A performance comparison between 1G and 10G systems is also presented. To the best of our knowledge, no detailed study of DBA in a 10G EPON can be found in the literature so far.", "paper_title": "Joint Bandwidth Scheduling to Support Differentiated Services and Multiple Service Providers in 1G and 10G EPONs", "paper_id": "WOS:000270408300015"}
