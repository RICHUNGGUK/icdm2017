The security of QPC protocol using the EPR pairs is re-examined. Unfortunately, we find that TP can use the fake EPR pairs to steal all the secret information. Furthermore, we give two simple and feasible solutions to improve the original QPC protocol. It is shown that the improved protocol is secure, which can resist various kinds of attacks from both the outside eavesdroppers and the inside participants, even the semi-honest TP.", "paper_title": "CRYPTANALYSIS AND IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE QUANTUM PRIVATE COMPARISON PROTOCOL USING EPR PAIRS", "paper_id": "WOS:000324407200004"}
