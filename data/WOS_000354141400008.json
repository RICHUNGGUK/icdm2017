Different from previous approaches that were formulated in spectral space, the proposed method is developed in a physical-space representation and allows for determining numerical dissipation rates and viscosities locally, that is, at the individual cell level, or for arbitrary subdomains of the computational domain. The method is self-contained and uses only the results produced by the Navier-Stokes solver being investigated. As no further information is required, it is suitable for a straightforward quantification of numerical dissipation as a post-processing step. We demonstrate the method's capabilities on the example of implicit large-eddy simulations of a three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex flow, serving as a test flow going through laminar, transitional, and turbulent stages of time evolution. For validation, we compare results for the effective numerical dissipation rate with exact reference data we obtained with an accurate, spectral-space approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
