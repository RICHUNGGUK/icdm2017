ODAS/SS reduces the data traffic using spatial interpolation and overhearing, which is a typical characteristic of wireless communications. In addition, ODAS/SS applies a sleep scheduling mechanism, which lets some nodes transit to the sleep mode while guaranteeing the coverage in the target region, in order to further reduce the energy consumption and suppress the variation in residual energy among nodes. Furthermore, we present the results of simulation experiments to verify the effectiveness of ODAS/SS.", "paper_title": "Integration of traffic reduction and sleep scheduling for energy-efficient data gathering in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328181500004"}
