Many existing range-free localization methods encounter high localization error, especially for the network with a coverage hole. One reason for high localization error is unreasonable distance estimation method. Another reason is that unknown nodes use the shortest distance which has large cumulative distance error to estimate their positions. In this paper, a two-stage centralized range-free localization algorithm (TCRL) is proposed. In the first stage, we design a novel rational distance estimation method to alleviate the distance estimation error between neighbor nodes based on the connectivity information and geometric features. In the second stage, a novel neighborhood function is derived from the estimated distances between neighbor nodes. Then a new localization strategy is proposed based on greedy idea. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with the same type algorithms in two network scenarios, namely, random deployment and random deployment with a coverage hole. The simulation results show that TCRL achieves more accurate and reliable results than most of existing range-free methods in the two network scenarios.", "paper_title": "A Two-Stage Range-Free Localization Method for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349230500001"}
