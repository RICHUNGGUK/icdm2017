The algorithm processes any sequence of edge deletions in O(mn) time and answers queries in constant time. Previously, such time bound has only been achieved by a randomized Las Vegas algorithm. In addition to that, a few decremental algorithms for maintaining strongly connected components are shown, whose time complexity is O(n(1.5)) for planar graphs, O(n log n) for graphs with bounded treewidth and O(mn) for general digraphs.", "paper_title": "Improved Deterministic Algorithms for Decremental Reachability and Strongly Connected Components", "paper_id": "WOS:000321646300008"}
