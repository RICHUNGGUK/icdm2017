The proposed method is based on Kalman filtering in the time domain combined with spectral subtraction. Comparison with discrete Kalman filter in the frequency domain shows better performance of the proposed technique. The performance is evaluated by using the segmental signal-to-noise ratio and the Itakura-Saito's distance. Results have shown that Kalman's filter in time combined with spectral subtraction is more robust and efficient, improving the Itakura-Saito's distance by up to four times. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
