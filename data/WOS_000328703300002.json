This contrasts with the notion that words are simply mapped \"onto\" previously existing categories. To investigate the computational foundations of a system in which word and object categories develop simultaneously and in an interactive fashion, we present a model of word learning based on interacting self-organizing maps that represent the auditory and visual modalities, respectively. While other models of lexical development have employed similar dual-map architectures, our model uses active Hebbian connections to propagate activation between the visual and auditory maps during learning. Our results show that categorical perception emerges from these early audio-visual interactions in both domains. We argue that the learning mechanism introduced in our model could play a role in the facilitation of infants' categorization through verbal labeling.", "paper_title": "Modeling Cross-Modal Interactions in Early Word Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000328703300002"}
