Unlike traditional data applications, multimedia applications require QoS support in order to satisfy the user's service requirements. Admission control has been advocated as a promising approach to tackle this challenging issue since it is a key management function for which a new flow is admitted based on the condition that the QoS requirements of all flows in the network can still be met after the new flow begins. In this paper, a Rate Adaptive Routing on Cliques Admission Control protocol (so-called RA-RCAC) for WMNs is proposed, which is able to provide feedbacks to the application layer whenever congestion occurs in the network. The RA-RCAC scheme merges the design features of two chosen benchmarking schemes, namely, an Interference-Aware Admission Control and QoS routing protocol in WMN (so-called IAAC) and a distributed admission control protocol for WMNs (so-called RCAC) to produce a protocol design that satisfies the QoS guarantee. Our proposed RA-RCAC protocol is evaluated using simulation analysis. The performance evaluation results demonstrate its superiority over the aforementioned benchmark schemes in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, and loss ratio performance evaluation metrics.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Adaptive Admission Control Scheme for Multimedia Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355211600026"}
