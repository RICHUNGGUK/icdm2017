However. DEA does not provide more information about the efficient DMUs. In this research, the researchers will be proposed two ranking methods. In the first method, an ideal line will be defined and determined a common set of weights for efficient DMUs then a new efficiency score will be obtained and ranked them with it. In the second method, a special line will be defined then compared all efficient DMUs with it and ranked them. An example 20 branch banks of Iran illustrates two ranking methods.
