In this study we introduce a novel registration technique based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) to decompose a given time-series into a low rank and a sparse component. This allows robust separation of motion components that can be registered, from intensity variations that are left unchanged. This Robust Data Decomposition Registration (RDDR) is demonstrated on both simulated and a wide range of clinical data. Robustness to different types of motion and breathing choices during acquisition is demonstrated for a variety of imaged organs including liver, small bowel and prostate. The analysis of clinically relevant regions of interest showed both a decrease of error (15-62% reduction following registration) in tissue time-intensity curves and improved areas under the curve (AUC(60)) at early enhancement.
