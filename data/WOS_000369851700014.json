Parallelization of the problem is carried out using Domain Decomposition (DD) parallel communication approach with Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) to enable better flexibility in parallel execution, and greater ease of parallel implementation across the different domain of block sizes. We described the parallelization of the method by the use of Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) technique. The 1-D ATCP is implemented on a parallel cluster (Geo Cluster), with the ability to exploit inherent parallelism of the computation. The parallelization and performance strategies are discussed, and results of the parallel experiments are presented.", "paper_title": "Parallel Domain Decomposition for 1-D Active Thermal Control Problem with PVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000369851700014"}
