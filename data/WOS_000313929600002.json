In next generation wireless networks, load balancing can be easily implemented by tuning handover (HO) margins, achieving a decrease in call blocking. However, call dropping can be increased as a negative effect of the HO-based load balancing, because users usually are handed over to cells where the radio conditions are worse. In this work, a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) optimized by the fuzzy Q-Learning algorithm is proposed for the load balancing problem, with the aim of decreasing call blocking in congested cells, while at the same time restricting call dropping in neighboring cells according to the network policy. In particular, two different approaches for the FLC optimization are evaluated in this work, highlighting that one of the proposed methods allows to accurately preserve the call quality constraint during the load balancing, while the other can adapt to network variations. Results show that the optimized FLC provides a notable reduction in call blocking while preserving call dropping under the operator constraint. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
