The sharp distance bounds between a Bezier curve and its cutdown polygon, which is introduced recently, are first obtained. The result is a further extension and consolidation over recent results. A polygon named corner cutting polygon is further constructed by using the well-known de Casteljau central corner cutting algorithm. The sharp bounds for Bezier curve approximation using the corner cutting polygon are also obtained. Based on similar methods, various sharp bounds for Bezier curve approximation using control polygons and quasi control polygons are further addressed and extended to parametric Bezier curves in multi-dimensional spaces.
