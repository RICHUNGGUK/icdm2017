The human desire to acquire useful information and to automatically control devices anytime and anywhere has increased the necessity to develop systems with high reliability. However, the CPS associated with the physical world and cyber world involve managing complexity and incurring the respective maintenance costs, such that it has been impossible to produce systems that are completely reliable. Thus, this paper presents an 'Autonomic Control System for High-reliable Cyber-Physical Systems' that is comprised of eight processes, including fault analysis, fault event analysis, fault modeling, fault state interpretation, fault strategy decision, fault detection, diagnosis & reasoning, and maneuver execution. These processes facilitate the design and implementation of an autonomic control system that is superior to what was available before. As proof of the approach, we used an intelligent service robot (ISR) as a case study. The experimental results show that the ISR is able to detect a fault event during autonomic control of the CPS.", "paper_title": "An autonomic control system for high-reliable CPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000354412400009"}
