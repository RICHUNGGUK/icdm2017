Each set of selected descriptors was regressed against the bioactivities of a series of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) inhibitors, through linear and nonlinear regression methods, namely multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machines (SVM). The fuzzy rough set ACO/SVM-based model gave the best estimation/prediction results, demonstrating the nonlinear nature of this analysis and suggesting fuzzy rough set ACO, first introduced in chemistry here, as an improved variable selection method in QSAR for the class of GSK-3 beta inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Feature Selection and Linear/Nonlinear Regression Methods for the Accurate Prediction of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 beta Inhibitory Activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000265528400008"}
