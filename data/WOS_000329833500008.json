We present performance analysis of several parallel asynchronous implementations of Jacobi's method for solving systems of linear equations, using MPI, SHMEM and OpenMP. In particular we have solved systems of over 4 billion unknowns using up to 32,768 processes on a Cray XE6 supercomputer. We show that the precise implementation details of asynchronous algorithms can strongly affect the resulting performance and convergence behaviour of our solvers in unexpected ways, discuss how our specific implementations could be generalised to other classes of problem, and suggest how existing parallel programming models might be extended to allow asynchronous algorithms to be expressed more easily.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of asynchronous Jacobi's method implemented in MPI, SHMEM and OpenMP", "paper_id": "WOS:000329833500008"}
