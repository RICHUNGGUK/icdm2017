The aim of the control is to support the maximum speed on the express lanes by redistributing flows at the entrances. This is achieved with regard to the state of general purpose lanes and the condition of minimal growth of queues at the entrances. To describe the algorithm and its properties, the discretized hydrodynamic traffic flow model of Lighthill, Whitham, and Richards is used.", "paper_title": "Controlling the state of a motorway using express lanes", "paper_id": "WOS:000355623700010"}
