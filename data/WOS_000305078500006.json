This redundancy results in high reliability/robustness but may significantly increase packet overhead. This paper proposes a mesh-based multicast protocol, called centered protocol for unified multicasting through announcements (CPUMA), that achieves comparable reliability as existing mesh-based multicast protocols, however, with significantly much less data overhead. In CPUMA, a distributed core-selection and maintenance algorithm is used to find the source-centric center of a shared mesh. We leverage data packets to center the core of each multicast group shared mesh instead of using GPS or any pre-assignment of cores to groups (the case of existing protocols). The proposed centering scheme allows reducing data packet overhead and creating forwarding paths toward the nearest mesh member instead of the core to reduce latency. We show, via simulations, that CPUMA outperforms existing multicast protocols in terms of data packet overhead, and latency while maintaining a constant or better packet delivery ratio, at the cost of a small increase in control overhead in a few scenarios.
