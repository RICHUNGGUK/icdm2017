For example, it is well known that Hopfield neural networks has limited stored patterns, local minimum problems, limited noise ratio, retrieve reverse value of pattern, and shifting and scaling problems. This research will propose multi-connect architecture (MCA) associative memory to improve the Hopfield neural network by modifying the net architecture, learning and convergence processes. This modification is to increase the performance of associative memory neural network by avoiding most of the Hopfield neural network limitations. In general, MCA is a single layer neural network uses auto-association tasks and working in two phases, that is learning and convergence phases. MCA was developed based on two principles. First, the smallest net size will be used rather than depending on the pattern size. Second, the learning process will be performed to the limited parts of the pattern only to avoid learning similar parts several times. The experiments performed show promising results when MCA shows high efficiency associative memory by avoiding most of the Hopfield net limitations. The results proved that the MCA net can learn and recognize unlimited patterns in varying size with acceptable percentage noise rate in comparison to the traditional Hopfield neural network.", "paper_title": "MULTI-CONNECT ARCHITECTURE (MCA) ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY: A MODIFIED HOPFIELD NEURAL NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000309020100006"}
