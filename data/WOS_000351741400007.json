The measurement results show that the circuit generates 508.5 mV reference voltage while consuming 9.8 mu A from a single 3.3 V supply. The achieved temperature coefficient is less then 10 ppm/A degrees C over a temperature range from -40 to 130 A degrees C after 8-bit trimming. The circuit operates down to 1.8 V with a line regulation of 781.2 ppm/V while its supply voltage changes from 1.8 to 3.6 V. The measured power supply rejection of the circuit is -65.2 dB at 100 Hz. The rms output noise voltage integrated within the frequency range of 0.1-10 Hz is 3.75 mu V. The proposed circuit occupies an area of (350 x 250 mu m(2)) 0.0875 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A compact curvature corrected bandgap reference in 0.35 mu m CMOS process", "paper_id": "WOS:000351741400007"}
