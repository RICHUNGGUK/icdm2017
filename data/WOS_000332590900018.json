An actual gait signal is always subject to change due to many factors including variation of sensor attachment. In this research, we tackle to the practical sensor-orientation inconsistency, for which signal sequences are captured at different sensor orientations. We present an iterative signal matching algorithm based on phase-registration technique to simultaneously estimate relative sensor-orientation and register the 3D acceleration signals. The iterative framework is initialized by using ID orientation-invariant resultant signals which are computed from 3D signals. As a result, the matching algorithm is robust to any initial sensor-orientation. This matching algorithm is used to match a probe and a gallery signals in the proposed owner authentication method. Experiments using actual gait signals under various conditions such as different days, sensors, weights being carried, and sensor orientations show that our authentication method achieves positive results..", "paper_title": "Orientation-Compensative Signal Registration for Owner Authentication Using an Accelerometer", "paper_id": "WOS:000332590900018"}
