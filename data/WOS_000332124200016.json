Moreover, we formulate the all-digital phase-locked loop optimization process as a search problem, during which we can find a good configuration that not only meets the user-defined requirement but also achieves a smaller area and lower power consumption than a typical manual design. The silicon measurement results show that this is indeed a promising new alternative for analog phase-locked loops, especially for advanced nanometer technologies.", "paper_title": "Parameterized All-Digital PLL Architecture and its Compiler to Support Easy Process Migration", "paper_id": "WOS:000332124200016"}
