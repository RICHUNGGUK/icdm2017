The direct manipulation of the regulatory mechanisms offers enormous possibilities for deciphering the machinery that activates and controls gene expression. We propose a novel bi-clustering algorithm for generating non-overlapping clusters of reporter genes and conditions and demonstrate how this information can be interpreted in order to assist in the construction of transcription factor interaction networks.
