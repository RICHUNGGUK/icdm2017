In iPTT, a distributed and mobile-operator independent network architecture is presented to accelerate the deployment of the PTT service. Based on the serverless architecture, we develop two mechanisms, that is, flooding-based floor control mechanism (FFC) and tree-based floor control mechanism (TFC), for real-time talk-burst determination. The determination algorithms and the corresponding message flows for these two mechanisms are designed to show the feasibility of FFC and TFC. The performance of FFC and TFC is investigated through our analytical and simulation models in terms of the determination latency and the number of floor-control message exchanges.
