Calculations were performed on the crystallographic conformations of alpha-CDs after their separation from the ligand and without minimization. The results show that the computational strategy adopted is able to distinguish Type 1 from Type 2 complexes and that it can be applied to all CD families. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
