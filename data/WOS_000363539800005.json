Design automation methodologies address some of the complexity through design abstractions from two different angles, namely functionality and architecture. Algorithm-level design (ALD), such as Simulink, focuses on managing the functional complexity through algorithm modeling. Meanwhile, system-level design (SLD) addresses the platform complexity by exploring and synthesizing architecture models from specifications captured in a system-level design language (SLDL). However, these two design methodologies are inherently disjoint as they focus on different design domains at separate abstraction levels. As a result, transition from algorithm models to system-level explorations often requires re-authoring of the functional SLDL specification to expose hierarchy and parallelism. This thus forms the Specification Gap causing a loss of productivity and stalling the overall design cycle. This paper proposes to join ALD and SLD to close the specification gap through a Specification Synthesis approach. We introduce Algo2Spec, which synthesizes an SLDL specification out of an algorithm model in Simulink. Algo2Spec enables a rapid heterogeneous Design Space Exploration while still tuning the algorithm according to functional needs. With Algo2Spec, system level design principles propagate up to higher abstraction levels and a new joint algorithm/architecture co-design flow is created. The joint flow seamlessly spans from algorithm modeling down to heterogeneous implementations crossing multiple abstractions. Our approach empowers designers to create, simulate, and explore models in a rapid design cycle. Utilizing the joint flow, we demonstrate opportunities for algorithm and architecture co-design on a set of real-world benchmark applications ranging from 57 to 5733 Simulink blocks. The automatic synthesis avoids the tedious and error-prone manual conversion of Simulink algorithm models into SLDL specifications. Algo2Spec executes in 4.5 s on average to synthesize a single Simulink block to a fully functional SLDL behavior. Compared to an estimated 5.18 h of manual editing, Algo2Spec improves productivity by three orders of magnitude for obtaining the system-level specifications from Simulink models.", "paper_title": "Towards closing the specification gap by integrating algorithm-level and system-level design", "paper_id": "WOS:000363539800005"}
