We present a computationally flexible ECM procedure for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters. A score test statistic for testing the existence of autocorrelation among within-subject errors of each characteristic is derived. The techniques for the estimation of random effects and the prediction of further responses given past repeated measures are also investigated. The methodology is illustrated through an application to a set of AIDS data and two small simulation studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
