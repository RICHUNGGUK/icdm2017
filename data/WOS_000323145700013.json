The test uses the Vasicek entropy estimate. Two special cases of the test for location-scale and shape families are discussed. The results are used to introduce goodness-of-fit tests for the uniform, Laplace, Weibull and beta distributions. The critical values and powers for some alternatives are obtained by simulation.", "paper_title": "General treatment of goodness-of-fit tests based on Kullback-Leibler information", "paper_id": "WOS:000323145700013"}
