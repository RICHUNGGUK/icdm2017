However. the way the mobile phone manufacturers adopt a pricing policy is not flexible enough to maximize the profit under the competitive environment. In this paper, we derive a dynamic pricing model for considering the price change of product itself but also the relative price change of competing products. Scenario analysis is performed to find optimal pricing policy based on genetic algorithm. Our proposed model is expected to provide adaptable pricing policy in a competitive market for a mobile phone set. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
