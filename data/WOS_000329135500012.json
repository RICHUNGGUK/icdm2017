Mainly, the inherent high design complexity of concurrent PL/OO behaviors makes the manual approaches tedious and error-prone. To tackle the complicated modeling task, this article presents an automatic approach that performs systematic abstraction and generation of fast-and-accurate simulation models. The experimental results show that our approach reduces 21 times modeling efforts, while our generated models perform simulation an order of magnitude faster than Cycle-Accurate models with the same PL/OO transaction execution cycle counts preserved.", "paper_title": "Automatic Generation of High-Speed Accurate TLM Models for Out-of-Order Pipelined Bus", "paper_id": "WOS:000329135500012"}
