This environment makes group coordination difficult due to relatively high packet loss and the presence of a continuously evolving network topology that leads to a changing set of participants. We describe and evaluate an application-level mobile reliable broadcast protocol (M-RBP) that provides applications with network characteristics well-suited to supporting coordinated interaction, such as reliable broadcast with data consistency and global ordering. The protocol is time-, rather than event-driven, providing it with unique, deterministic operational characteristics that can be verified in a relatively straightforward manner.
