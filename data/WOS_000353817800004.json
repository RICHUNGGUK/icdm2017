In switched network selection policy, each user selects only a single network. An optimal bid is obtained according to both quality function and interference quality function. Then the network allocates the resource to the user who gives the highest bid. In parallel network selection scheme, each user can access multiple networks; however the user who gives the higher bid will obtain more resources. Both the mathematical analysis and simulations show that the network selection strategy based on auction theory can achieve higher network throughput and lower outage probability.", "paper_title": "Network selection policy based on auction theory in heterogeneous wireless communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000353817800004"}
