In the virtual world, however, it is difficult to trust contributions from people we do not know, because of the variety of information sources and behaviors. In this context, a Reputation Model for CoP (ReCoP) was developed. This paper presents a case study that evaluates one ReCoP mechanism: the degree of agreement among members in evaluating artifacts shared within the community. Data was extracted from a real scenario, and the results provide useful feedback for further studies and improvements in implementing the model.", "paper_title": "Applying Reputation Mechanisms in Communities of Practice: A Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000270880000010"}
