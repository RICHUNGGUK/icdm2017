The LLNS equations incorporate thermal fluctuation into macroscopic hydrodynamics by the addition of white noise fluxes whose magnitudes are set by a fluctuation dissipation theorem. The study focuses on capturing the correct variance and correlations computed at equilibrium flows, which are compared with available theoretical values. Moreover, a numerical test for the random walk of standing shock wave has been considered for capturing the shock location. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
