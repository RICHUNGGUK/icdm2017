In this paper, a novel spiral ganglion cell model, the dynamics of which is described by an asynchronous cellular automaton, is presented. It is shown that the model can reproduce typical nonlinear responses of the spiral ganglion cell in the mammalian cochlea, e.g., spontaneous spiking, parallel spike density modulation, and adaptation. Also, FPGA experiments validate reproductions of these nonlinear responses.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous Cellular Automaton Model of Spiral Ganglion Cell in the Mammalian Cochlea: Theoretical Analyses and FPGA Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400031"}
