RNN are derived from the well-established static multi layer perceptron feedforward neural networks (MLPFF), that have been largely adopted for steady-state mapping of SI engines. The main contribution of this work is the development of a procedure that allows identifying a RNN-based AFR simulator with high generalization and limited training data set. The procedure has been tested by comparing RNN simulations with AFR transients generated using a nonlinear-dynamic engine model. The results show how training the network making use of inputs that are uncorrelated and distributed over the entire engine operating domain allows improving model generalization and reducing the experimental burden. Potential areas of application of the procedure developed can be either the use of RNN as virtual AFR sensors (e.g. engine or individual AFR prediction) or the implementation of RNN in the framework of model-based control architectures.
