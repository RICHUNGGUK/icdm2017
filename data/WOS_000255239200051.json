By using Lyapunov-Krasovskii-type functional, the quality of negative definite matrix and Cauchy criterion, we obtain the sufficient conditions for global exponential stability and global asymptotic stability of such model, in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI), which depend on the delays. Two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
