We define an architectural model for the integration of VANETs and cellular networks, according to a push mode paradigm where VANETs are used primarily to disseminate service announcements and general interest messages. Cooperation with cellular network is addressed by comparing architecture alternatives. A set of information dissemination protocols for VANETs is compared via simulations on a real urban map. Some results from a lab testbed based on IEEE 802.11p boards are presented along with an application developed for Android operating system to demonstrate the concept of the paper.", "paper_title": "Infotainment Services Based on Push-Mode Dissemination in an Integrated VANET and 3G Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000318701400008"}
