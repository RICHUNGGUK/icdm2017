Results show that stoichiometrically GeO2 can be achieved by N2O plasma oxidation at 350 degrees C. The transmission electron microscope observation reveals that the GeO2/Ge interface is automatically smooth and the thickness of GeO2 is similar to 0.9 nm with 120 s N2O plasma oxidation. The interface state density of Ge surface after N2O plasma passivation is about similar to 3x10(11) cm(-2)eV(-1). WithGeO(2) passivation, the hysteresis of MOS capacitor with Al2O3 as gate dielectric is reduced to similar to 55 mV, compared to 130 mV of the untreated one. The Fermi-level at GeO2/Ge interface is unpinned, and the surface potential is effectively modulated by the gate voltage, which is promising for high performance NMOSFETs fabrication.", "paper_title": "Ge surface passivation by GeO2 fabricated by N2O plasma oxidation", "paper_id": "WOS:000353817800002"}
