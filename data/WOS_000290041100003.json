A set covering-based surrogate approach is proposed to solve the sup-T equation constrained optimization problem with a separable and monotone objective function in each of the variables. This is our first trial of developing integer programming-based techniques to solve sup-T equation constrained optimization problems. Our computational results confirm the efficiency of the proposed method and show its potential for solving large scale sup-T equation constrained optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Set covering-based surrogate approach for solving sup-T equation constrained optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290041100003"}
