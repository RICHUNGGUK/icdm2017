In this paper, this problem is addressed in the way that a neural network algorithm named BP-MLL, i.e., Backpropagation for Multilabel Learning, is proposed. It is derived from the popular Backpropogation algorithm through employing a novel error function capturing the characteristics of multilabel learning, i.e., the labels belonging to an instance should be ranked higher than those not belonging to that instance. Applications to two real-world multilabel learning problems, i.e., functional genomics and text categorization, show that the performance of BP-MLL is superior to that of some well-established multilabel learning algorithms.", "paper_title": "Multilabel neural networks with applications to functional genomics and text categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239814600004"}
