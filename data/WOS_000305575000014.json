The (unconditional) Renyi entropy depends on a parameter alpha, which for the case of min-entropy takes the value infinity. Even for this particular case, there are several proposals for the definition of conditional entropy. This paper describes three general definitions of conditional Renyi entropy that were found or suggested in the literature. Their properties are studied and their values, as a function of alpha, are compared. The particular case of min-entropy is widely used in cryptography as a security parameter; this case is studied in some detail.", "paper_title": "Conditional Renyi Entropies", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000014"}
