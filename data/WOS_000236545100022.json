As there was no fast and effective detection method of suspected SARS cases,this paper proposes a computer aided SARS detection system (CADSARS) based on data mining techniques. 'Typical pneumonia' and SARS X-Ray chest radiographs were collected. Feature extraction of these images was performed after segmenting out pulmonary fields. Feature vectors were then constructed to build rules for the discrimination of SARS and 'typical pneumonia'. Three methods were used to classify these images: C4.5, neural network and CART. Final results show that about 70.94% SARS cases can be detected. ROC charts and confusion matrix by these three methods are given and analyzed. Association rules mining was used to find whether there exists difference of lesions' location between SARS and pneumonia cases.", "paper_title": "Mining X-ray images of SARS patients", "paper_id": "WOS:000236545100022"}
