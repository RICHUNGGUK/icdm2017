We propose a co-verification procedure, in which the verification tool SpaceEx/PHAVer and simulation tool Matlab are integrated to analyze and verify hybrid systems. For the application of this procedure, a platform screen door system (PSDS, a subsystem of the subway control system), is modeled with hybrid automata and Simulink/Stateflow charts, respectively. The models of PSDS are simulated by Matlab and verified by SpaceEx/PHAVer. The simulation and verification results indicate that the sandwiched situation can be avoided under time interval conditions. We improve the model with four trains and four stations on a subway line and analyze the urgent control scenario for the safety distance requirement. In this paper, the Simulink/Stateflowmodel is a refinement of the SpaceEx/PHAVer model, which is closer to a final implementation. Moreover, the two models are complementary for some features (e.g., visualization of simulation, correctness proving by verification), stressing different aspects of the overall system and permitting complementary analysis techniques, i.e., verification versus simulation. We conclude that this integration procedure is competent in verifying subway control systems.", "paper_title": "Formal verification and simulation for platform screen doors and collision avoidance in subway control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209673200002"}
