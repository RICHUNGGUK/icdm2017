Identity recognition and verification are based on the matching of linearly time-normalized gait walking cycles. A novel feature extraction process is also proposed for the transformation of human silhouettes into low-dimensional feature vectors consisting of average pixel distances from the center of the silhouette. By using the best-performing of the proposed methodologies, improvements of 8-20% in recognition and verification performance are seen in comparison to other known methodologies on the \"Gait Challenge\" database.
