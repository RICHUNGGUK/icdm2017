This paper introduces MyBenchmark, a parallel data generation tool that takes a set of queries as input and generates database instances. Users of MyBenchmark can control the characteristics of the generated data as well as the characteristics of the resulting workload. Applications of MyBenchmark include DBMS testing, database application testing, and application-driven benchmarking. In this paper, we present the architecture and the implementation algorithms of MyBenchmark. Experimental results show that MyBenchmark is able to generate workload-aware databases for a variety of workloads including query workloads extracted from TPC-C, TPC-E, TPC-H, and TPC-W benchmarks.", "paper_title": "MyBenchmark: generating databases for query workloads", "paper_id": "WOS:000345093300004"}
