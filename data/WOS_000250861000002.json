In this paper, a full-rate and low-complexity STB coding scheme with complex orthogonal design for multiple antennas is proposed, and turbo code is employed as channel coding to improve the proposed code scheme performance further. Compared with full-diversity multiple antennas STB coding schemes, the proposed scheme can implement full data rate, partial diversity and a smaller complexity, and has more spatial redundancy information. Moreover, using the proposed scheme can form efficient spatial interleaving, thus performance loss due to partial diversity is effectively compensated by the concatenation of turbo coding. Simulation results show that on the condition of the same system throughput and concatenation of turbo code, the proposed scheme has lower bit error rate (BER) than those low-rate and full-diversity multiple antennas STB coding schemes.", "paper_title": "Full-rate and low-complexity space-time block coding concatenated with channel codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000250861000002"}
