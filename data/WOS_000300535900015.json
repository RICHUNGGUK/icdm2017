Proactive failure recovery schemes have been recently proposed to improve network performance during the failure transients. These proactive failure recovery schemes need extra infrastructural support in the form of routing table entries, extra addresses etc. In this paper, we study if the extra infrastructure support can be exploited to build disjoint paths in those frameworks, while keeping the lengths of the recovery paths close to those of the primary paths. Our evaluations show that it is possible to extend the proactive failure recovery schemes to provide support for nearly-disjoint paths which can be employed in multipath routing for load balancing and QoS.
