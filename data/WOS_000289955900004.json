Firstly, an image is divided into structure (sketchable) components and texture (non-sketchable) components, and the missing structures, such as curves and corners, are predicted by tensor voting. Secondly, the textures along structural sketches are synthesized with the sampled patches of some known structure components. Then, using the texture completion priorities decided by the confidence term, data term and distance term, the similar image patches of some known texture components are found by selecting a point with the maximum priority on the boundary of hole region. Finally, these image patches inpaint the missing textures of hole region seamlessly through graph cuts. The characteristics of this solution include: (1) introducing the primal sketch representation model to guide completion for visual consistency; (2) achieving fully automatic completion. The experiments on natural images illustrate satisfying image completion results.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATIC IMAGE COMPLETION WITH STRUCTURE PROPAGATION AND TEXTURE SYNTHESIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289955900004"}
