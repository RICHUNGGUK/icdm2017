These parameters were correlated with both RMSD and Delta G(bind) for all docking computations using a layered neural network with back-propagation algorithm (BP-NN). The model obtained from the correlation has allowed us to adjust the parameters. The most important differences between new and the default values were observed for the electrostatic, the torsion angle loss of entropy and desolvation, while the others' terms are comparable with default data. This new set of parameters could be used specifically for virtual screening against RNA targets. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
