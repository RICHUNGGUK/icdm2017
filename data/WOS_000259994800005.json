The main departure from the classical quadratic programming formulation is the inclusion in the objective function of piecewise linear, separable functions representing the transaction costs. We handle the non-smoothness in the objective function by using spline approximations. The problem is first solved approximately using a primal-dual interior-point method applied to the smoothed problem. Then, we crossover to an active set method applied to the original non-smooth problem to attain a high accuracy solution. Our numerical tests show that we can solve large scale problems efficiently and accurately.", "paper_title": "Large scale portfolio optimization with piecewise linear transaction costs", "paper_id": "WOS:000259994800005"}
