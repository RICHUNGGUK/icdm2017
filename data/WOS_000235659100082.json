However, this paper is to model the road situation with GPS data of floating vehicles. The relationship of the time and the passing velocity through a road segment is presented in the models which can reflect urban traffic situation. Moreover, a parallel algorithm is proposed to build the models and its task scheduling policy can make the efficiency of CPUs be about 75% in the heterogeneous computing platform. The experimental results also indicate it.", "paper_title": "Parallel implementing of road situation modeling with floating GPS data", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100082"}
