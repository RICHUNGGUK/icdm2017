The authors developed a simple method with a low computation effort to detect tumors on T2-weighted Magnetic Resonance lmaging (MRI) brain images, focusing on the connection between the spatial pixel value and tumor properties from four different perspectives: 1) cases having minuscule differences between two images using a fixed block-based method, 2) tumor shape and size using the edge and binary images, 3) tumor properties based on texture values using spatial pixel intensity distribution controlled by a global discriminate value, and 4) the occurrence of content-specific tumor pixel for threshold images. Measurements of the following medical datasets were performed: 1) different time interval images, and 2) different brain disease images on single and multiple slice images. Experimental results have revealed that our proposed technique incurred an overall error smaller than those in other proposed methods. In particular, the proposed method allowed decrements of false alarm and missed alarm errors, which demonstrate the effectiveness of: our proposed technique. In this paper, we also present a prototype system. known as PCB, to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods by actual experiments, comparing the detection accuracy and system performance.", "paper_title": "A simple method for detecting tumor in T2-weighted MRI brain images: An image-based analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290400048"}
