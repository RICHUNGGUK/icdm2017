Their input-output behavior serves as a unique IC \"fingerprint.\" Therefore, they have been envisioned as an IC authentication mechanism, in particular the subclass of so-called strong PUFs. The protocol proposals are typically accompanied with two PUF promises: lightweight and an increased resistance against physical attacks. In this work, we review 19 proposals in chronological order: from the original strong PUF proposal (2001) to the more complicated noise bifurcation and system of PUF proposals (2014). The assessment is aided by a unified notation and a transparent framework of PUF protocol requirements.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Lightweight Entity Authentication with Strong PUFs", "paper_id": "WOS:000368081600010"}
