As opposed to hard partitioning of the entire frequency band to different cell patterns in frequency reuse-M systems (M>1), we propose sharing this band opportunistically in time by these patterns. Through numerical examples, we show notable gains in overall network throughput due to improved multi-user diversity in comparison with a conventional frequency reuse-3 system.", "paper_title": "A Two-Level Temporal Fair Scheduler for Multi-Cell Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800011"}
