Their behaviour depends on the mover's mechanical characteristics and dynamical properties, such as inertia or friction coefficient, which are seldom known precisely. Being also dependent on the variations of the primary energy resource, not always controllable in its natural environment, this behaviour must be simulated by using a smaller and cheaper mover, whose model is sufficiently known such that to render it fully controllable. This paper explores the possibility that the desired real-time replication be achieved by means of a new method of tracking the mover's rotational speed. To this end, various controllers, both linear and nonlinear can be employed. The design steps are provided for a PI controller, as well as for two nonlinear controllers, while focusing on the practical aspects of controller implementation. Their performance results are assessed comparatively on an experimental rig for two types of prime movers: one whose mechanical torque-speed characteristic is linear and a cross-flow water turbine, having a nonlinear torque-speed characteristic.
