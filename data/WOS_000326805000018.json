Advances in multi-core processors and virtualization technologies have enabled many workloads to be consolidated in a physical server. However, current virtualization technologies do not ensure performance isolation among guest virtual machines, which results in degraded performance due to contention in shared resources along with violation of service level agreement (SLA) of the cloud service. In that sense, minimizing performance interference among co-located virtual machines is the key factor of successful server consolidation policy in the cloud computing platforms. In this work, we propose a performance model that considers interferences in the shared last-level cache and memory bus. Our performance interference model can estimate how much an application will hurt others and how much an application will suffer from others. We also present a virtual machine consolidation method called swim which is based on our interference model. Experimental results show that the average performance degradation ratio by swim is comparable to the optimal allocation.", "paper_title": "Virtual machine consolidation based on interference modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000326805000018"}
