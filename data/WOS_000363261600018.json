As a key topic for environmental protection and resource utilization, WM has received considerable attention in the scientific community over the past decades, reflecting by the vast peer-reviewed articles on WM can be retrieved by accessing the web of science database. The data retrieved covers the period from 1997 to 2014. Analyzed parameters included document type, and publication output as well as distribution of countries, institutions, source titles, subject category, and author keywords. The implications for current trends and recent hotspots were presented and discussed. Furthermore, a contrastive analysis between the topics of concern in the industrialized and developing countries was carried out. Results of this case could provide a reference to the decision-making and policy of WM for the government to some extent and help in bringing key elements on the theoretical and practical contributions so far as well as on the future challenges the field must face.", "paper_title": "A bibliometric analysis of waste management research during the period 1997-2014", "paper_id": "WOS:000363261600018"}
