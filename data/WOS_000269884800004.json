The proposed bypassing cells constituting the multiplier skip redundant signal transitions as well as computations when the horizontally partial product or the vertical operand is zero. Hence, it is a 2-dimensional bypassing method. Thorough post-layout simulations of a 8 x 8 digital multiplier using the proposed 2-dimensional bypassing method show that the power dissipation of the proposed design is reduced by more than 75% compared to prior designs. Physical measurements on silicon reveal that the proposed digital multiplier saves more than 28% even with pads' power dissipation compared to the prior works.", "paper_title": "Low-Power Multiplier Design Using a Bypassing Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000269884800004"}
