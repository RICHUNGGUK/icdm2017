The method combines Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and market-based optimal power flow (OPF) to maximize the net present value (NPV) related to the investment made by WTs' developers over a planning horizon. In particular, the MCS data feed themarket-based OPF problem with inter-temporal constraints in order to find the most convenient WTs allocation and priority on the network, based on distribution-locational marginal prices (D-LMPs) in a competitive electricity market. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with an 84-bus 11.4-kV radial distribution system.", "paper_title": "A Model for Wind Turbines Placement Within a Distribution Network Acquisition Market", "paper_id": "WOS:000350356000022"}
