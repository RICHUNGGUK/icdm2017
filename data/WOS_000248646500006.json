This partially globular protein presents four helixes centrally organized and a fifth one, H5, projecting away from the packed bundle of helixes. Comparison between solution and crystallographic data of p17 indicates a 6 angstrom displacement of a short 3(10) helix and a partial unfolding of H5 in solution related to crystal. While the behavior of the 3 10 helix has been previously addressed to virion assembly, the relevance and origin of H5 partial unfolding is possibly related to the contacts between p17 and other viral elements, such as p24. In this context, we present a 40 ns conformational sampling of monomeric p17 using molecular dynamics simulations. The performed simulations presented a progressive conversion of the p17 crystallographic structure to the NMR conformation, suggesting that the biological form of this protein may have its C-terminal portion partially unfolded.
