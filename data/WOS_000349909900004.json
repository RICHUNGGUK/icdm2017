Various models of medium resistance are considered. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, the optimal control problem is reduced to the boundary value problem for a system of two nonlinear differential equations. The qualitative analysis of the resulting system makes it possible to reveal previously unknown characteristics of optimal trajectories for a general model of the resistance force. This analysis is illustrated by a numerical simulation.", "paper_title": "Qualitative analysis of optimal trajectories of the point mass motion in a resisting medium and the brachistochrone problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000349909900004"}
