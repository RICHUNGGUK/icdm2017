The construction of sparse universal graphs for various classes F has received a considerable amount of attention. There is particular interest in tight F-universal graphs, that is, graphs whose number of vertices is equal to the largest number of vertices in a graph from F. Arguably, the most studied case is that when F is some class of trees. In this work, we are interested in T (n, Delta), the class of all n-vertex trees with maximum degree at most Delta. We show that every n-vertex graph satisfying certain natural expansion properties is T (n, Delta)-universal. Our methods also apply to the case when Delta is some function of n. Since random graphs are known to be good expanders, our result implies, in particular, that there exists a positive constant c such that the random graph G(n, cn(-1/3) log(2) n) is asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) universal for T (n, O(1)). Moreover, a corresponding result holds for the random regular graph of degree cn(2/3) log(2) n. Another interesting consequence is the existence of locally sparse n-vertex T (n, Delta)-universal graphs. For example, we show that one can (randomly) construct n-vertex T (n, O(1))-universal graphs with clique number at most five. This complements the construction of Bhatt, Chung, Leighton and Rosenberg (1989), whose T (n, Delta)-universal graphs with merely O(n) edges contain large cliques of size Omega(Delta). Finally, we show that random graphs are robustly T (n, Delta)-universal in the context of the Maker-Breaker tree-universality game.", "paper_title": "Expanders Are Universal for the Class of All Spanning Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000314296400005"}
