The method assumes that a time series of users' application downloads and activations can be represented by individual inter-personal influence factors. To achieve better predictive performance and also to avoid over-fitting, a latent feature model is employed. The method tries to extract the latent structures by monitoring cross validating predictive performances on approximated influence matrices with reduced ranks, which are generated based on an initial influence matrix obtained from a training set. The method adopts Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to reduce the influence matrix dimension and thus to extract the latent features. To validate and demonstrate its ability, about 160 university students voluntarily participated in a mobile application usage monitoring experiment. An empirical study on real collected data reveals that the influencing structure consisted of six influencing groups with two types of mutual influence, i.e. intra-group influence and inter-group influence. The results also highlight the importance of sparseness control on NMF for discovering latent influencing groups. The obtained influencing structure provides better predictive performance than state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods as well as conventional methods such as user-based collaborative filtering techniques and simple popularity.", "paper_title": "Implicit Influencing Group Discovery from Mobile Applications Usage", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146300034"}
