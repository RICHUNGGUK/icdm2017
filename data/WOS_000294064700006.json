Those functions have been shown to change due to epileptic seizures, which suggests that ictal events might be detected via the vagus electroneurogram (VENG). In this study, we characterize the association of ictal and peri-ictal VENG with cardiac parameters. The electrocorticogram (ECoG), electrocardiogram, and the VENG were recorded in anesthetized rats, which were intravenously infused with either a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) solution (PTZ-lot, n = 11) or saline (control-lot, n = 6). Control animals were subsequently vagotomized and also infused with a PTZ solution (n = 5, V-PTZ-lot). Cardiac and VENG parameters were assessed during different ECoG stages of ictal activity. None of the parameters changed in the control-lot. PTZ infusion induced seizures in all rats. Cardiac-related VENG showed distinctive firing patterns for the left and right vagus nerves. Significant ictal and post-ictal changes were seen in both the left and the right VENG in association with cardiac changes and increased parasympathetic influence on the heart. Changes in VENG parameters might provide a new way to assess the ictal state of patients, which could be suitable for triggering on-demand vagus nerve stimulation.", "paper_title": "Ictal and peri-ictal changes in cervical vagus nerve activity associated with cardiac effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000294064700006"}
