A scientific technique for analyzing a variety of short-term planning problems encountered during daily operations would therefore be of great benefit. This paper proposes the use of experimental methods to support engineers in analyzing daily production performance and making informed decisions through the implementation of a virtual production environment. In this study, a virtual shop model using a number of modeling techniques captures the intricacies of a dynamic shop environment. Specifically, the research presents solutions in modeling product uniqueness and labor productivity that are unique issues in modeling the steel fabrication process. A prototype model developed for an Edmonton-based steel fabricator is used to illustrate the development of the system and its application in project planning.", "paper_title": "Virtual shop model for experimental planning of steel fabrication projects", "paper_id": "WOS:000240003100002"}
