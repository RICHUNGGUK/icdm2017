One is in the conserved form while the other is in the convective form. It is shown that the first-order versions of both schemes, in their semi-discretized form, are unconditionally stable. Numerical experiments indicate that the first-order (resp. second-order) versions of the two schemes lead to first-order (resp. second-order) convergence rate for all variables and that these schemes are suitable for handling problems with large density ratios such as in the situation of air bubble rising in water.
