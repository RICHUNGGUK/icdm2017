In this paper, a special information structure formalized in terms of three indices (the central presentation, population or scale, and density function) is proposed. Single and mixed Gaussian models are used for single source information and their fusion results, and a parameter estimation method is also introduced. Furthermore, fuzzy similarity computing is developed for solving the fuzzy implications under a Mamdani model and a Gaussian-shaped density function. Finally, an improved rule-based Gaussian-shaped fuzzy control inference system is proposed in combination with a nonlinear conjugate gradient and a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method as compared to other fuzzy inference systems.", "paper_title": "Multi-source information fusion model in rule-based Gaussian-shaped fuzzy control inference system incorporating Gaussian density function", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200004"}
