This paper proposes a novel method called 'knowledge acquisition via information granulation' (KAIG) model which not only can remove some unnecessary details and provide a better insight into the essence of data but also effectively solve 'class imbalance' problems. In this model, the homogeneity index (H-index) and the undistinguishable ratio (U-ratio) are successfully introduced to determine a suitable level of granularity. We also developed the concept of sub-attributes to describe granules and tackle the overlapping among granules. Seven data sets from UCI data bank, including one imbalanced diagnosis data (pima-Indians-diabetes), are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of KAIG model. By using different performance indexes, overall accuracy, G-mean and Receiver Operation Characteristic (ROC) curve, the experimental results comparing with C4.5 and Support Vector Machine (SVM) demonstrate the superiority of our method.
