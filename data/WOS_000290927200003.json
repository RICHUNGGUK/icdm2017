The methodology was based on chiral recognition of ibuprofen by formation of an inclusion complex with a chiral auxiliary, beta-cyclodextrin, in the presence of 1-butanol. The strategy combines the use of PARAFAC, for extraction of the pure analyte signal, with the standard addition method, for determinations in presence of a matrix effect. A specific PARAFAC model was built for each sample and the scores were related to (S)-ibuprofen concentration using a linear regression in the standard addition method. Feasible results were obtained for determinations in the molar fraction range from 50 to 80% of (S)-ibuprofen, providing absolute errors lowers than 4.0% for plasma and urine. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
