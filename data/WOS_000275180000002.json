We argue that to avoid an undesirable disconnect between the two, one needs considerable time and patience for a science-humanities collaboration to bear fruit. In our collaboration and, we believe, in science-humanities collaborations in general, certain shared goals are required for success, including: starting with simple models before moving to more complex models; the importance of continually comparing models with empirical data where possible; and a focus on explaining statistical patterns rather than accounting for single data points individually.", "paper_title": "Can a Science-Humanities Collaboration Be Successful?", "paper_id": "WOS:000275180000002"}
