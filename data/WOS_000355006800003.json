A relationship matrix for the components on the operating interface was first constructed in the proposed method, and then, a relationship network for the operating components was constructed based on the matrix which was built by using the fuzzy graph theory. The performance of the target interface was then evaluated based on the evaluation model proposed in this study. The operation panel of a real car stereo was used in the case study so as to verify the feasibility of the proposed methodology. The results indicated that the operating performance of a product interface can be correctly evaluated by the proposed method, and new high-performance operating interfaces can be developed accordingly.", "paper_title": "A methodology for high-performance operating interface design", "paper_id": "WOS:000355006800003"}
