However, at the same time it also introduces the new privacy and security threats that have become an obstacle to the widespread use and popularity of MCC. In this paper, we propose a reliable recommendation and privacy preserving based cross-layer reputation mechanism (RP-CRM) to provide secure and privacy-aware communication process in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based MCC (WM-MCC). RP-CRM integrates the cross-layer design with recommendation reputation reliability evaluation mechanism and the privacy preserving scheme to identify and manage the internal malicious nodes and protect the security and privacy against internal multi-layer attack, bad mouthing attack and information disclosure attack. Simulation results and performance analysis demonstrate that RP-CRM can provide rapid and accurate malicious node identification and management, and provide security and privacy protection against aforementioned attacks more effectively and efficiently.
