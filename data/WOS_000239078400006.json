Each vertex u is an element of V represents a transmission station for which a transmission radius r(u) must be picked. Edges represent a continuum of demand points to be satisfied, that is, for every edge (u, v) is an element of E we ask that r(u) +/- r(v) >= l(uv). The cost of transmitting at radius r from vertex u is given by an arbitrary non-decreasing cost function c(u)(r). Our goal is to find a cover with minimum total cost Sigma(u)c(u)(r(u)). The multi-radius cover problem is NP-hard as it generalizes the well-known vertex cover problem. In this paper we present a 2-approximation algorithm for it. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
