Our scheme supports dynamic selective refinement, as in Continuous Level Of Detail models, and it generates conforming meshes at all intermediate steps. The RGB subdivision is encoded in a standard topological data structure, extended with few attributes, which can be used directly for further processing. We present an interactive tool that permits to start from a base mesh and use RGB subdivision to dynamically adjust its level of detail.", "paper_title": "RGB Subdivision", "paper_id": "WOS:000262317200011"}
