However, in many practical problems the estimation of the probabilities is far from accurate. In this paper, we present uncertain transition probabilities as close real intervals. Also, we describe a general algorithm, called gLAO*, that can solve uncertain MDPs efficiently. We demonstrate that Buffet and Aberdeen's approach, searching for the best policy under the worst model, is a special case of our approaches. Experiments show that gLAO* inherits excellent performance of LAO* for solving uncertain MDPs.", "paper_title": "Solving uncertain Markov decision problems: An interval-based method", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100120"}
