For this purpose, a new formulation is developed to directly incorporate state-space equations corresponding to the positive-real (PR) rational functions representing the frequency dependence of PUL parameters, in Telegrapher's equations. The proposed formulation overcomes the need for explicit lumped-circuit realization with all positive elements for PR rational functions of FD-PUL parameters. Proof of passivity and numerical examples are presented to validate the theory.", "paper_title": "A robust algorithm for passive reduced-order macromodeling of MTLs with FD-PUL parameters using integrated congruence transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000253840500015"}
