Several variations of a global model are presented (single/multiple neurons; bias/no bias), and corresponding PF solutions are derived. Different importance functions are given when beneficial, Rao-Blackwellization is proposed when possible, and dual/nondual versions of each algorithms are presented. The method shown can handle both white and colored noise. Using a variety of speech and noise signals and different objective quality measures, the performance of these algorithms are evaluated against other PF solutions running on linear models, as well as some traditional enhancement algorithms. A certain hierarchy in performance is established between each algorithm in the paper. Depending on the experimental conditions, the best-performing algorithms are a classical Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) running on a linear model, and a proposed PF employing a nondual, nonlinear model with multiple neurons and no biases. With consistence, the neural-network-based PF outperforms RBPF at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).", "paper_title": "Speech Enhancement Based on Nonlinear Models Using Particle Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000272484200006"}
