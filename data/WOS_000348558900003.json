[11] proved the Hyers-Ulam stability of bihomomorphisms and biderivations on normed 3-Lie systems by using the fixed point method. Under the conditions in the main theorems of [11, Section 2], we can show that the related mappings must be zero. In this paper, we correct the statements of the results in [11, Section 2], and prove the corrected theorems.", "paper_title": "THE FIXED POINT METHOD FOR PERTURBATION OF BIHOMOMORPHISMS AND BIDERIVATIONS IN NORMED 3-LIE SYSTEMS: REVISITED", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558900003"}
