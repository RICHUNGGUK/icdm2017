This is applied to predicting the sea-level near the Thames Estuary at Sheerness, from tidal gauge measurements down the east coast, astronomical tidal prediction, and meteorological data. We show that this approach can result in accurate, low-dimensional models with low computational, costs and relatively fast execution times.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Bayesian modeling of sea-level along the east coast of Britain", "paper_id": "WOS:000256670200013"}
