The results are obtained for various values of H/b and m; where b = the radius of the excavation and m = a non-dimensional parameter which accounts for the rate of the increase of cohesion with depth. The values of the stability numbers increase continuously both with increases in H/b and m. The results obtained in this study compare well with those available in literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
