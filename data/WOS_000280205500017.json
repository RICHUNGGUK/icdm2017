This problem consists in placing a minimum number of guards on the vertices of a graph such that these guards can protect the graph from any sequence of attacks on its edges. In response to an attack, each guard is allowed either to stay in his vertex, or to move to a neighboring vertex. However, at least one guard has to fix the attacked edge by moving along it. The other guards may move to reconfigure and prepare for the next attack. Thus at every step the vertices occupied by guards form a vertex cover. We show that the problem admits a kernel of size 4(k)(k + 1) + 2k, which shows that the problem is fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the number of available guards k. Finally, we also provide an algorithm with running time O(2(O(k2)) + nm) for ETERNAL VERTEX COVER, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges of the input graph. In passing we also observe that ETERNAL VERTEX COVER is NP-hard, yet it has a polynomial time 2-approximation algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
