Using the Gramian representation of a positive semidefinite matrix, the LRSDP problem can be formulated as the nonconvex nonlinear programming problem of minimizing a quadratic function with quadratic equality constraints. For the solution of this problem we propose a continuously differentiable exact merit function that exploits the special structure of the constraints and we use this function to define an efficient and globally convergent algorithm. Finally, we test our code on an extended set of instances of the maxcut problem and we report comparisons with other existing codes.", "paper_title": "An unconstrained minimization method for solving low-rank SDP relaxations of the maxcut problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000286218900005"}
