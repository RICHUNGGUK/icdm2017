The existing classification methodologies for dissimilarities between objects collected in different occasions assume a unique common underlying classification structure. However, since the objects' clustering structure often changes along the occasions, the use of a single classification to reconstruct the taxonomic information frequently appears quite unrealistic. The methodology proposed here models the dissimilarities in a likelihood framework. The goal is to identify a (secondary) partition of the occasions in homogeneous classes and, simultaneously, a (primary) consensus partition of the objects within each of such classes. Furthermore, a class-specific dimensionality reduction operator is also included which allows to identify classes of occasions such that the within-class variability is minimized. The model is formalized as a finite mixture of multivariate normal distributions and solved by a numerical method based on ECM strategy. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
