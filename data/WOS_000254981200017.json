However, these strategies are either deterministic or stochastic. Due to the requirement for the problem-based tuning of parameters, this paper introduces a novel self-adjusting cognitive selection, strategy (SCSS). It employs an information index to judge the value for cognitive coefficient of each particle associated with, the best location itself. Furthermore, a mutation strategy is introduced to avoid premature convergence, and a modified version of particle swarm optimization combined with SCSS and mutation is proposed. Simulation results show the proposed method outperforms for multi-modal benchmarks with many local optimum.", "paper_title": "Particle swarm optimization with self-adjusting cognitive selection strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981200017"}
