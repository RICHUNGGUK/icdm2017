The method of reducing computational complexity of generating weighting coefficients is proposed. Based on the approach, the efficient hardware architecture is designed under real-time requirement. Compared to the latest bi-cubic hardware design work, the architecture saves about 60% of hardware cost. The architecture is implemented on the Virtex-II FPGA, and the high-speed VLSI has been successfully designed and implemented with TSMC 0.13 mu m standard cell library. The simulation results demonstrate that the efficient VLSI of extended linear interpolation at 267MHz with 25980 gates in a 450 x 450 mu m(2) chip is able to process digital image scaling for HDTV in real-time.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Architecture of Extended Linear Interpolation for Image Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000276057900018"}
