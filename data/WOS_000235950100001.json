This model provides the possibility to define heterogeneous entities placed in regular or irregular spatial infrastructures. Different mechanisms supporting field diffusion within these structures will be described and analyzed, with reference to their performance A sample application of SCA model (a variation of Conway's Game of Life) will also be illustrated, while a more complex usage of action-at-a-distance for pedestrian simulation will be sketched.", "paper_title": "Supporting action-at-a-distance in Situated Cellular Agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000235950100001"}
