Since the proposed GEDP scheme can generate more accurate prediction results, the prediction errors tend to form a sharper Laplacian distribution. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can guarantee larger embedding capacity and produce better quality of marked images. The determination of appropriate thresholds is also a critical issue for a RDH algorithm, so we design a new systematic way to tackle this problem. In addition, a modified embedding order determination strategy is presented to reduce the distortion of a marked image. Based on typical test images, experimental results demonstrate the superior properties of the proposed algorithm in terms of embedding capacity and marked image quality. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
