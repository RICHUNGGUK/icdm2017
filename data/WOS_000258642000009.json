With such an infrastructure, researchers could share knowledge and results along with computing cycles, storage, and bandwidth. A generic, transparent cyberinfrastructure would also foster more meaningful analyses of data and visualization, modeling, and simulation of real-world phenomena.", "paper_title": "Community-cyberinfrastructure-enabled discovery in science and engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000258642000009"}
