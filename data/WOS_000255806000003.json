This is a required technology that allows a high image quality. In this paper, we will propose the new driving waveform which has varied V-scan voltage in the same sub-field for the high-speed driving. Therefore, we were obtained 39.5 V as the minimum V-data voltage at the scan pulse width of 0.8 mu s, when the newly proposed driving waveform was applied to a 4-in. test panel. This result was that the minimum V-data voltage decreased by 14.5 V from the conventional driving waveform. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
