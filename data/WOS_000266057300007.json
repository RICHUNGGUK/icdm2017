The scheme possesses the properties of elliptic curve cryptosystem and ring signature. While the technique of ring signature endows the signers with anonymity, the elliptic curve cryptosystem provides advantages like high security, low computation load, and small bandwidth requirements. Integrating the advantages of these two applications, the outcome is a highly secure and efficient anonymous signcryption scheme. Signcryption does not require an advance establishment of session key for each session. Thus, transmission load is reduced, and efficiency of performance and transmission enhanced.
