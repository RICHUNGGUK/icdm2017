It uses a specifically devised evolutionary algorithm for evolving a set of prototype feature vectors and does not require any a priori knowledge about either the actual number of prototypes or the statistical properties of the input data. Experiments performed by using both synthetic data and handwritten digits randomly extracted from the NIST database have confirmed the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary prototyping for handwriting recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862300010"}
