The mixed linear constraints and the degeneracy are the two significant characters of the problem considered in this paper. On the basis of the project properties and Lyapunov method, we get the complete convergence and the finite-time convergence of the proposed neural network in this paper. Moreover. we get that the nonsingular parts of the output trajectories respect to Q(11) and Q(22) are exponentially convergent. Particularly, we also give some analysis to the degenerate quadratic minimax problem without constraints. Furthermore, four illustrative examples are given to show the necessity of the matrix H in the network to solve this problem and the superiority of the network in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
