The algorithm is based on vector quantization of an atlas of height-fields that have been sampled over primitive shapes which approximate the geometry. We introduce novel vector quantization acceleration techniques to facilitate fast compression as well. We achieve bitrates of less than four bits per normal-equipped point. Our method enables hole-free level-of-detail point rendering. We also show that using only up to two bits per point, high-quality renderings can still be obtained if normals are estimated in image-space. Even lower bitrates are obtained for storage on disk if arithmetic coding is used. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
