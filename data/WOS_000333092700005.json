In particular, slow signal propagation permits multiple packets to concurrently travel in the underwater channel, which must be exploited to improve the overall throughput. To this end, we propose the delay-aware opportunistic transmission scheduling (DOTS) protocol that uses passively obtained local information (i.e., neighboring nodes' propagation delay map and their expected transmission schedules) to increase the chances of concurrent transmissions while reducing the likelihood of collisions. Our extensive simulation results document that DOTS outperforms existing solutions and provides fair medium access even with node mobility.", "paper_title": "DOTS: A Propagation Delay-Aware Opportunistic MAC Protocol for Mobile Underwater Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333092700005"}
