Building on the model-theoretic composition method of Shelah, we give two characterizations of the decidable theories of this form, in terms of effectiveness conditions on two types of \"homogeneous sets\". We discuss the significance of these characterizations, show that the first-order theory of successor with extra predicates is not covered by this approach, and indicate how analogous results are obtained in the semigroup theoretic and the automata theoretic framework.", "paper_title": "Decidable theories of the ordering of natural numbers with unary predicates", "paper_id": "WOS:000241587300037"}
