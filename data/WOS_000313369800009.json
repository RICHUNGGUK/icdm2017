Novel configuration rules including FI and EI rules are presented to clarify the semantics of inclusion rules when cardinalities and hierarchies of products are encountered. Then, a configuration graph is proposed to visualize structural rules and configuration rules in product configuration problem. An encoding approach is elaborated to transform the configuration graph as a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem). As a consequence, existing CSP solver, i.e. JCL (Java Constraint Library), is employed to implement the configuration system for product configuration problem with cardinality-related configuration rules. A case study of a bus configuration is used throughout this paper to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented approach.", "paper_title": "Applying constraint satisfaction approach to solve product configuration problems with cardinality-based configuration rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000313369800009"}
