Its cascading time-slot assignment scheme conciliates low end-to-end latency with a low duty-cycle, while supporting multi-sink WSN topologies. Unlike most of the current solutions, LEMMA's time-slot allocation protocol makes decisions based on the interference actually experienced by the nodes, instead of following the simple but potentially ineffective n-hop approach. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the n-hop time-slot allocation in comparison with LEMMA, as well as to evaluate the performance of LEMMA against L-MAC, T-MAC and Low Power Listening. The results show that under the target scenario conditions, LEMMA presents lower interference between assigned time-slots and lower end-to-end latency, while matching its best contender in terms of energy-efficiency.
