Public discussion for hotspots in particular generates significant volume and velocity of user-contributed text, frequently attributable to a user identifier or nom de plume. It may be feasible to determine authorship of various tracts of text on social media using n-gram analysis on the bit-level rendition of the text. This paper explores the facility of bit-level n-gram analysis with other statistical classification approaches for determining authorship on two months of captured user postings from an online news and opinion website with moderated discussion. The results show that this approach can achieve a good recognition rate with a low false negative rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
