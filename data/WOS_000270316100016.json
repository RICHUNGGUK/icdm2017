Then, a second-order TVD scheme is applied for the Burgers equation, and a linearized implicit finite difference method is used for the BBM equation. Furthermore. the Strang splitting approach is used to construct the solution in one time step. The numerical solutions of the DP equation agree with exact solutions, e.g. the multipeakon solutions very well. The proposed method also captures the formation and propagation of shockpeakon solutions, and reveals wave breaking phenomena with good accuracy.
