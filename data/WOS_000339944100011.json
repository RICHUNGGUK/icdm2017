Along with the automatic CAD/CAE integration, an adaptive metamodel-based optimization called sequential radial basis function (SRBF) is applied to truss structure optimization involving sizing, geometry and topology variables. SRBF distinguishingly features two-loops searching strategy, the \"inner loop\" and the \"outer loop\". The \"inner loop\" aims to search a feasible point through updating the factors of the augmented Lagrangian function. With the improved significant sampling space (ISSS) method, the \"outer loop\" sequentially generates new additional samples to update the RBF model. The continuous relaxation method is developed to deal with the mixed-discrete variables during the truss structure optimization. Applied to practical truss structure optimization problems from small scale to large scale, the proposed framework demonstrates feasibility of the CAD/CAE integration system during the structure modeling and analysis, and facilitates the truss structure optimization process. The comparison results between the SRBF and other approaches show that SRBF improves merit of searching global optimum and reduces the computation cost.", "paper_title": "An efficient truss structure optimization framework based on CAD/CAE integration and sequential radial basis function metamodel", "paper_id": "WOS:000339944100011"}
