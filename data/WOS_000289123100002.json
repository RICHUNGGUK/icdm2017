A new partitioning method is proposed. The quality of rectangular partitions is checked and compared with other methods, as regards load balance, edge-cut and block numbers. The partitioner is coupled with the massively parallel Hypre solver library and efficiency of the coupling is measured. Finally, the code is applied to study laminar flows (steady and unsteady) on three non-rectangular geometries. Very fine grids are used to compute reference solutions of a Z-shaped channel flow and the L-shaped and double lid driven cavities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
