Its advantage lies in that the student can learn at anytime or anyplace. However, such a learning mode relies highly on the dependence of the student. Under different environments and conditions, not all the students can be attentive. In this research, an auto-detection system has been designed, using image processing and recognition technique, for defining the facial expressions and behavior easily found when a learner is inattentive or in bad mentality under distance learning environment. From the learner's facial expressions and behavior features, the attentiveness of the student during distance learning can be determined by Bayesian Networks Model. After implementing the system of this research, and performing practical test, it is found that the accuracy of identifying the features of bad mentality and inattentive behavior is high. From Bayesian Networks assessment and inference, the learning attentiveness of the student can be determined precisely to have the teacher control the learning condition of the student explicitly.
