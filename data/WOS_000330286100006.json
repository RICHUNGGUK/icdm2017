Two broadcast schemes, based on superposition coding and embedded coding, respectively, are developed to encode information into a number of layers and use stochastic encoding to keep the corresponding information secret from an eavesdropper. The layers that can be successfully and securely transmitted are determined by the channel states to the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. The advantage of these broadcast approaches is that the transmitter does not need to know the CSI to the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, but the scheme still adapts to the channel states of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Three scenarios of block fading wiretap channels with stringent delay constraints are studied, in which either the legitimate receiver's channel, the eavesdropper's channel, or both channels are fading. For each scenario, the secrecy rate that can be achieved via the broadcast approach developed in this paper is derived, and the optimal power allocation over the layers (or the conditions on the optimal power allocation) is also characterized. A notion of probabilistic secrecy, which characterizes the probability that a certain secrecy rate of decoded messages is achieved during one block, is also introduced and studied for scenarios when the eavesdropper's channel is fading. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the impact of the CSI at the transmitter and the channel fluctuations of the eavesdropper on the average secrecy rate. These examples also demonstrate the advantage of the proposed broadcast approach over the compound channel approach.", "paper_title": "A Broadcast Approach for Fading Wiretap Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000330286100006"}
