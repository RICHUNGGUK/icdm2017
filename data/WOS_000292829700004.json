Some useful formulas in time and frequency domains are given for both deterministic and random linear time-variant systems and multipath channels. The fundamental parameters of a multipath channel are the delay and the gain coefficient of each path, and the number of significant paths. We propose a methodology for estimating path-delays and path-coefficients and its application to the ionospheric channel estimation. Also, if path coefficients are stationary random processes, the power spectral density of the coefficients can be estimated from measured data of real (actual) channels. Finally, exhaustive computer simulations have been realized for testing the algorithms and a sample of the results is provided in the paper; also, estimation results for an actual narrowband HF ionospheric channel are provided, where up to four significant paths (rays) are detected with a Doppler spread lower than 0.2 Hz.", "paper_title": "Multipath-channel estimation and application to ionospheric channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000292829700004"}
