Visual echo is defined as the appearance of projected contents observed by the camera. It can potentially saturate the projected contents, similar to audio echo in telephone conversation. Our approach to visual echo cancellation includes an offline calibration procedure that records the geometric and photometric transfer between the projector and the camera in a lookup table. During runtime, projected contents in the captured video are identified using the calibration information and suppressed, therefore achieving the goal of canceling visual echo. Our approach can accurately handle full-color images under the arbitrary reflectance of display surfaces and the photometric response of the projector or camera. It is robust to geometric registration errors and quantization effects and is therefore particularly effective for high-frequency contents such as texts and hand drawings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a variety of real images in a full-duplex projector-camera system.", "paper_title": "Robust and accurate visual echo cancellation in a full-duplex projector-camera system", "paper_id": "WOS:000258344900012"}
