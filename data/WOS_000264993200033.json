Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and free-weighting matrix method, a delay-dependent feedback controller with sector nonlinearities is proposed to achieve the synchronization in mean square in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The activation functions are assumed to be of more general descriptions. Finally, the corresponding simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed criteria. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
