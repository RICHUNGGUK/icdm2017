The Semantic Web has emerged as a possible answer to these challenges by offering an approach in organizing and sharing the Web, but it doesn't explicitly consider user needs and requirements. Heraclitus is a framework for Semantic Web adaptation in which user needs and requirements are the driving force, using text and Web usage mining to support Web site ontology and topology evolution. The result is improved user interaction with the Semantic Web.", "paper_title": "Heraclitus: A framework for semantic web adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000246207500008"}
