Non-destructive tests in aluminum plates are applied in order to extract information about possible defects: cracks, holes and other mechanical damages. Eddy-current testing (ECT) presents major benefits such as low cost, high checking speed, robustness and high sensitivity to large classes of defects. Coil based architecture probes or coil-magneto-resistive probes are usually used in ECT. In our application the GMR sensor is used to detect a magnetic field component parallel to a plate surface, when an excitation field perpendicular to the plate is imposed. A neural network processing architecture, including a multilayer perceptron and a competitive neural network, is used to classify defects using the output amplitude of the eddy-current probe (ECP) and its operation frequency. The crack detection, classification and estimation of the geometrical characteristics, for different classes of defects, are described in the paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
