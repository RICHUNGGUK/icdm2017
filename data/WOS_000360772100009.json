Firstly, IT2HFS is defined, and its operation laws and corresponding properties are discussed. Then, its score function and aggregation operators are also outlined. Moreover, a multi-criteria decision making method for interval type-2 hesitant fuzzy problems is suggested based on the aggregation operators and score function. Finally, an example is illustrated to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
