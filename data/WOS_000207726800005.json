The approach integrates and evaluates the various e-readiness assessment issues, over its well-structured domains: strategy, technology, organization, people, and environment. The case studies considered concern three Saudi organizations: a government organization, a bank, and a private sector company. The results obtained provide e-readiness indicators that illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each organization with regard to e-readiness strategic development issues, information and communication technology (ICT) issues, management and organization issues, people issues, and environment issues within which the organization operates. The work shows how the approach can be practically used, and it also provides practical results that direct the organizations concerned toward enhancing their e-readiness in response to the current trend of globalizing e-business.
