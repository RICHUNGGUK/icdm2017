We show that a DR-monoid is free iff it is pictorially stable. This allows us to associate with a set C of pictures a picture code B( C) which is the basis of the least DR-monoid including C. A weak version of the defect theorem for pictures is established. A characterization of picture codes through picture series is also given.", "paper_title": "Picture codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000242275400002"}
