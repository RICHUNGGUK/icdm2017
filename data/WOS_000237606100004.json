Quantum chemical descriptors computed by PM3 Hamiltonian were used as predictor variables. The cross-validated Q(cum)(2) value for the optimal QSPR model was 0.589, indicating good predictive capability for log t(1/2) values of PCBs in n-hexane. The QSPR results show that standard heat of formation (Delta Hf), total energy (TE), and molecular weight (M-w) have dominant effect on t(1/2) values of PCBs in n-hexane. Increasing Delta Hf and TE values or decreasing Mw values of the PCBs leads to decrease of log t(1/2) values. In addition, increasing the largest negative atomic charge on a carbon atom and dipole moment of the PCBs leads to decrease of log t(1/2) values.", "paper_title": "QSPRs for the prediction of photodegradation half-life of PCBs in n-hexane", "paper_id": "WOS:000237606100004"}
