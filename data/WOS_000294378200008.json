The purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of relationship value and dependence of supplier on long-term orientation and customer loyalty in the setting of relationships between travel agencies and their main providers. Design/methodology/approach - A partial least square regression is performed to test a proposed model that links several relational variables with outcomes in terms of customer loyalty. Findings - Results provide support for the positive indirect influence of relationship value on long-term orientation, while customer dependence of the main provider does not seem to exert a significant effect. These findings support the importance of value creation for providers in their relationships with their customers. Practical implications - This study allows us to suggest that service companies, such as travel agents, should concentrate on investing in generating benefits for customers through offering value-added services, thus providing evidence that the supplier has no incentives to opportunistic behaviors. Originality/value - Although literature has reported the importance of both relational and market conditions for customer-supplier relationships that involve physical distribution of goods and might require important investments in technological solutions to coordinate their relationships, little attention has been paid to service companies.", "paper_title": "Value, supplier dependence and long-term orientation Outcomes for B2B commerce in the travel industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000294378200008"}
