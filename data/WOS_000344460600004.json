Harmony search (HS) algorithm has been considered here as a candidate stochastic optimization technique utilized in conjunction with the Lyapunov theory to develop the hybrid models in this work. The objective of this work is to design stable adaptive fuzzy controllers which can provide high degree of automation, guarantee asymptotic stability and also achieve satisfactory transient performance by simultaneous adaptations of both the fuzzy controller structure and its free parameters. The results obtained from real-life experiments aptly demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
