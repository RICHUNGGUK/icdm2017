We present several new estimates for M-1 and M-2 and characterize the extremal trees. Lower and upper bounds on Harary index are obtained in terms of independence and matching numbers, as well as M-1 and M-2, and the extremal trees are characterized.", "paper_title": "On Zagreb and Harary Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000325443000023"}
