In this paper, a novel cooperative coevolutionary dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithm (PNSCCDMO) is proposed. The main idea of a new cooperative coevolution based on non-dominated sorting is that it allows the decomposition process of the optimization problem according to the search space of decision variables, and each species subcomponents will cooperate to evolve for better solutions. This way derives from nature and can improve convergence significantly. A modified linear regression prediction strategy is used to make rapid response to the new changes in the environment. The effectiveness of PNSCCDMO is validated against various of DMOPs compared with the other four algorithms, and the experimental result indicates PNSCCDMO has a good capability to track the Pareto front as it is changed with time in dynamic environments.", "paper_title": "A novel cooperative coevolutionary dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithm using a new predictive model", "paper_id": "WOS:000341866600005"}
