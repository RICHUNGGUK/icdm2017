Methods: In DIABCARD on evaluation study focussing on user friendliness and user acceptance was conducted. In ByMedCard-HCPP the project's system was validated and the timeliness of the project's work analyzed. Results: User friendliness and user acceptance of the DIABCARD system were fairly high. The ByMedCard-HCPP system was complete in its major components and functionalities; introducing the ByMedCard-HCPP system in clinical routine delayed the project. Conclusions. A multitude of key factors of success such as utilized technologies, user involvement, and commitment of partners seems to contribute to the success and/or failure of introducing patient card-based systems in healthcare.", "paper_title": "Introducing patient cards in clinical routine: Evaluation of two research projects", "paper_id": "WOS:000234822900012"}
