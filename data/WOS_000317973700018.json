The smallest positive integer k such that G admits a k-L(2,1)-labelling is called the lambda-number of G. In this paper we study this quantity for cubic Cayley graphs (other than the prism graphs) on dihedral groups, which are called brick product graphs or honeycomb toroidal graphs. We prove that the lambda-number of such a graph is between 5 and 7, and moreover we give a characterisation of such graphs with lambda-number 5.", "paper_title": "The L(2,1)-labelling problem for cubic Cayley graphs on dihedral groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000317973700018"}
