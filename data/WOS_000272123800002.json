We define problem P(k)(l) as a purely constraint-driven variant of hypergraph partitioning with parameters k and l as follows. Given a hypergraph on n vertices and k sizes of colours t(1),..., t(k) of sum n, can we colour the vertices with k colours of given size such that each hyperedge intersects at most I colours? We show that, for fixed parameters k and 1, P(k)(l) is: polynomial when l = 1, and NP-complete when l not equal 1 on the class of hypergraphs: NP-complete when l = 1, and linear when l not equal 1 on the class of hypergraphs with pairwise disjoint hyperedges. This inversion of complexity is possible since hypergraphs with disjoint hyperedges can be encoded in a more compact way, namely Theta(m log(n)) instead of Theta(mn) bits (n and m are the number of vertices and edges of the hypergraph).
