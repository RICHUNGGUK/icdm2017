In such cases, the costs of implementing the multiplication operation become a primary concern. We present new algorithms for reducing the space complexity of Gaussian normal basis multipliers over binary fields GF(2(m)), where m is odd. Compared with previous results, our approach incurs no additional costs in time complexity, and achieves improvements in space complexity over a wide range of finite fields and digit sizes. For the binary fields specified in the NIST FIPS 186-3 elliptic curve digital signature algorithm standards document, our algorithms reduce by 16% (respectively, 27%) the number of XOR gates needed for the implementation of a digit-level parallel-input parallel-output multiplier over a 163-bit (respectively, 409 bit) binary field.", "paper_title": "Common Subexpression Algorithms for Space-Complexity Reduction of Gaussian Normal Basis Multiplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700011"}
