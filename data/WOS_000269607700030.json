By visualizing not only the genes and the experiments in which the genes are co-expressed, but also additional properties of the modules such as the regulators and regulatory motifs that are responsible for the observed co-expression, ViTraM can assist in the biological analysis and interpretation of the output of module detection tools.", "paper_title": "ViTraM: visualization of transcriptional modules", "paper_id": "WOS:000269607700030"}
