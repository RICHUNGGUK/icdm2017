Sufficient conditions for synthesis of a fuzzy static output feedback controller for T-S fuzzy systems are derived in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In comparison with the existing literatures, the proposed approach not only simplifies the design procedure but also achieves a better H infinity performance. Three drawbacks existing in the previous papers such as coordinate transformation, same output matrices and BMI problem have been eliminated. The effectiveness of the proposed design method is demonstrated by an example for the control of a truck-trailer system. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
