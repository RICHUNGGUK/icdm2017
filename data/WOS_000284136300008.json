We show that any rational knot is a Chebyshev knot with a = 3 and also with a = 4. For every a, b,c integers (a = 3, 4 and a, b coprime), we describe an algorithm that gives all Chebyshev knots C(a, b, c, phi). We deduce the list of minimal Chebyshev representations of rational knots with 10 or fewer crossings.
