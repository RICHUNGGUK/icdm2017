The hole-transport layer are copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystrene-sulphonic acid (PEDOT: PSS), poly(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK), and N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (NPB), respectively. Compared with the other two devices, when 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphthacene (Rubrene) is inserted between PVK (or NPB) and tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum (AlQ), Rubrene's emission get enhanced. The energy transfer mechanism among PVK (NPB) AIQ and Rubrene are revealed by the absorption and emitting spectra. Moreover, the enhancement of Rubrene's emission can also be ascribed as an organic quantum well structure's trap effection. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
