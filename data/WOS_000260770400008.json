Many 4x4 filter banks are designed. The multi-spectral image fusion algorithm based on this kind of wavelet is proposed. Using this filter bank, multi-resolution wavelet decomposition of the intensity of multi-spectral image and panchromatic image is performed, and the two low-frequency components of the intensity and the panchromatic image are merged by using a tradeoff parameter. The experiment results show that this method is good in the preservation of spectral quality and high spatial resolution information. Its performance in preserving spectral quality and high spatial information is better than the fusion method based on DWFT and IHS. When the parameter t is closed to 1, the fused image can obtain rich spectral information from the original MS image. The amount of computation reduced to only half of the fusion method based on four channels wavelet transform.", "paper_title": "Multi-spectral image fusion method based on two channels non-separable wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000260770400008"}
