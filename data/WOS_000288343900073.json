Among the classes of knowledge derived, finding sequential patterns in temporal transaction databases is very important since it can help model customer behavior. In the past, researchers usually assumed databases were static to simplify data-mining problems. In real-world applications, new transactions may be added into databases frequently. Designing an efficient and effective mining algorithm that can maintain sequential patterns as a database grows is thus important. In this paper, we propose a novel incremental mining algorithm for maintaining sequential patterns based on the concept of pre-large sequences to reduce the need for rescanning original databases. Pre-large sequences are defined by a lower support threshold and an upper support threshold that act as gaps to avoid the movements of sequences directly from large to small and vice versa. The proposed algorithm does not require rescanning original databases until the accumulative amount of newly added customer sequences exceeds a safety bound, which depends on database size. Thus, as databases grow larger, the numbers of new transactions allowed before database rescanning is required also grow. The proposed approach thus becomes increasingly efficient as databases grow.
