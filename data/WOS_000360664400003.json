It is a self-biased and small area circuit that works in the nano-ampere consumption range, and under 1 V of power supply. The behavior of the circuit is analytically described, a design methodology is proposed and simulation results are presented for two CMOS processes, XFAB 0.18 mu m and IBM 0.13 mu m. Experimental results from one fabrication run demonstrate a reference voltage of 570 mV, with a temperature coefficient as low as 11 ppm/A degrees C for the 0-125 A degrees C range, while the power consumption of the whole circuit is 5 nW under a 0.9 V supply at 27 A degrees C. The occupied silicon area is 0.0022 mm.", "paper_title": "Sub-1 V supply 5 nW 11 ppm/A degrees C resistorless sub-bandgap voltage reference", "paper_id": "WOS:000360664400003"}
