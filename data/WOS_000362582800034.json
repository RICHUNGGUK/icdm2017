The controlled plant is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, and both the state feedback control and output feedback control cases are considered. By guaranteeing the decrement of Lyapunov functional at each control signal updating step, a less conservative stability condition for the state feedback NCSs is derived, and the corresponding stabilizing controller design method is also presented. Under an observer-based framework, the output feedback stabilization problem is further studied, where the main contribution is the development of the separation principle for NCSs. Illustrative examples are provided to show the advantage and effectiveness of the developed results.", "paper_title": "Stabilization and Separation Principle of Networked Control Systems Using the T-S Fuzzy Model Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000362582800034"}
