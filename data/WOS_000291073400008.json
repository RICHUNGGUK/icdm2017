However, that is a tough task since the number of customers is huge and all of the customers are geographically dispersed. Therefore, this paper presents an agile improvement system by using the action diagram and the enhanced chaotic neural network (ECNN) model, combining the merits of chaotic neural network, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP). and genetic algorithm in one consolidated model. It is expected that the proposed method will overcome most of the disadvantages of published models, particularly the accuracy of customer satisfaction model and the validity of modification decision. Also, it gives a chance to meet the demands of customers at an optimal cost and make the hard but necessary improvement decisions whenever they are required. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
