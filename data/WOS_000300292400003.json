In this paper, a paraconsistent computation tree logic, PCTL, is obtained by adding paraconsistent negation to the standard computation tree logic CTL. PCTL can be used to appropriately formalize inconsistency-tolerant temporal reasoning. A theorem for embedding PCTL into CTL is proved. The validity, satisfiability, and model-checking problems of PCTL are shown to be decidable. The embedding and decidability results indicate that we can reuse the existing CTL-based algorithms for validity, satisfiability, and model-checking. An illustrative example of medical reasoning involving the use of PCTL is presented.", "paper_title": "Paraconsistent Computation Tree Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000300292400003"}
