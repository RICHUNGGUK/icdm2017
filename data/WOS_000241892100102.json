Although many solutions help finding a optimal path, those can be applied to real world only under constrained condition, which means that it is difficult to find a universal algorithm. Moreover, a complicated computation to obtain an optimal path induces the time delay so that a robot can not avoid moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose the algorithm of path planning and obstacle avoidance using Random Access Sequence(RAS) methodology. In the proposed scheme, the cell decomposition is make first and cell neighbors are assigned as sequence code, then the path with minimum length is selected.", "paper_title": "Real-time path planning strategies for real world application using Random Access Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100102"}
