This algorithm is based on some properties of the algebraic integers over Z and is certified. It relies on a study of the perturbations in a Vandermonde system. We provide a sufficient condition on the precision of the approximate factors, depending only on the height and the degree of the polynomial. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
