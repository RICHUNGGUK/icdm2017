The platform uses multicamera stereo inside a patient manikin to measure the 3D positions of unmodified surgical instruments. It uses this information to drive a mixed- reality, computer- mediated learning system and provide objective measures of surgical skill.", "paper_title": "Mixed-reality simulation of minimally invasive surgeries", "paper_id": "WOS:000250087600011"}
