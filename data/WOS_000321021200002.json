Several routing protocols in ad hoc networks use a dominating set of the nodes for routing. None of the existing algorithms has a constant approximation factor in a constant number of rounds in 3D. In this paper, we use the nodes' geometric locations to propose the first local, constant time algorithm that constructs a Dominating Set and Connected Dominating Set of a Unit Disk Graph (UDG) in a 3D environment. Theoretical lower bounds on the size of these sets are given.", "paper_title": "3D Local Algorithm for Dominating Sets of Unit Disk Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000321021200002"}
