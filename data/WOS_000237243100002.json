First, we show that integral control can sufficiently suppress a class of slowly variant ( including constant) input disturbance and track constant references provided certain closed-loop stability is achieved. Then, sufficient conditions of integral controllability for nonlinear processes are presented. These conditions are further relaxed by using an input and output transformation.", "paper_title": "Conditions on input disturbance suppression for multivariable nonlinear systems on the basis of feedforward passivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000237243100002"}
