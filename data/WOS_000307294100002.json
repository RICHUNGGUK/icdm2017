In real projects, the trade-off between the project cost and the completion time, and the uncertainty of the environment are both considerable aspects for managers. Due to the complex external environment, this paper considers project scheduling problem with coexisted uncertainty of randomness and fuzziness, in which the philosophy of fuzzy random programming is introduced. Based on different ranking criteria of fuzzy random variables, three types of fuzzy random models are built. Besides, a searching approach by integrating fuzzy random simulations and genetic algorithm is designed for searching the optimal schedules. The goal of the paper is to provide a new method for solving project scheduling problem in hybrid uncertain environments.", "paper_title": "Solving project scheduling problem with the philosophy of fuzzy random programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000307294100002"}
