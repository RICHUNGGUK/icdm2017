One technique is based on flipping rows and columns of an arbitrary binary array until the Hamming weight constraint is satisfied in all rows and columns, and the other is based on a certain explicitly constructed \"antipodal\" matching between layers of the Boolean lattice. Both codes have a redundancy of roughly m+n and may have applications in next generation resistive memory technologies.", "paper_title": "Low Complexity Two-Dimensional Weight-Constrained Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304245100040"}
