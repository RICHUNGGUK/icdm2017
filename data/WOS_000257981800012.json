These traits are normally caused by mutations at multiple loci of unknown locations and interactions. In this work, we model the biological system that relates DNA polymorphisms with complex traits as a linear mixing process. Given this model, we propose a new fine-scale genetic mapping method based on independent component analysis. The proposed method outputs both independent associated groups of SNPs in addition to specific associated SNPs with the phenotype. It is applied to a clinical data set for schizophrenia, with 368 individuals and 42 SNPs. It is also applied to a simulation study to investigate its performance in more depth. The obtained results demonstrate the novel characteristics of the proposed method compared to other genetic mapping methods. Finally, we study the robustness of the proposed method with missing genotype values and limited sample sizes.", "paper_title": "Fine-scale genetic mapping using independent component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000257981800012"}
