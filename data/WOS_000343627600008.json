The problem of decomposing a pixel grid into disjoint base-monotone regions was first studied in the context of image segmentation. It is known that for a given pixel grid and base-lines, one can compute in polynomial time a maximum-weight region that can be decomposed into disjoint base-monotone regions with respect to the given baselines (Chun et al., 2012 [4]). We continue this line of research and show the NP-hardness of the problem of optimally locating k base-lines in a given n x n pixel grid. We then present an O (n(3))-time 2-approximation algorithm for this problem. We also study two related problems, the k base-segment problem and the quad-decomposition problem, and present some complexity results for them. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
