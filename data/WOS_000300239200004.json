This study examines how information organisation in hypertext affects users' comprehension of the hypertext structure and content of the text. In a 2 x 2 factorial design text interconnectedness (low vs. high) and coherence (coherent vs. incoherent) were manipulated. Users' mental representations were accessed by various tests such as card sorting, summary writing and questionnaires. Results showed that participants' representation of hypertext structure and content was better under the coherent than under the incoherent condition. Interconnectedness did not have an effect on users' representation. Recommendations for hypertext designers are discussed.", "paper_title": "How information organisation affects users' representation of hypertext structure and content", "paper_id": "WOS:000300239200004"}
