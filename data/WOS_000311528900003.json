We introduce two different kinds of multithreaded heuristic algorithms for the stated. NP-hard, problem. The first algorithm relies on speculation and iteration, and is suitable for any shared-memory system. The second algorithm uses dataflow principles, and is targeted at the non-conventional, massively multithreaded Cray XMT system. We study the performance of the algorithms on the Cray XMT and two multi-core systems, Sun Niagara 2 and Intel Nehalem. Together, the three systems represent a spectrum of multithreading capabilities and memory structure. As testbed, we use synthetically generated large-scale graphs carefully chosen to cover a wide range of input types. The results show that the algorithms have scalable runtime performance and use nearly the same number of colors as the underlying serial algorithm, which in turn is effective in practice. The study provides insight into the design of high performance algorithms for irregular problems on many-core architectures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
