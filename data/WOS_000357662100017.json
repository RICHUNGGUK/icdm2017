In particular, since the cloud, assisting a multi-core mobile device, can be considered as a special core with powerful computation capability, the optimization of holistic energy consumption is formulated as a task-core assignment and scheduling problem. Specifically, the energy consumption models for the mobile device, network, cloud, and, more importantly, task interaction are presented, respectively. Based on these energy consumption models, a holistic energy optimization framework is then proposed, where the thermal effect, application execution deadline, transmission power, transmission bandwidth, and adaptive modulation and coding rate are jointly considered.", "paper_title": "A HOLISTIC ENERGY OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK FOR CLOUD-ASSISTED MOBILE COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000357662100017"}
