Several different levels of control of the service regimes are considered. Our results for the N-queue system require randomisation of service configurations but we have studied the two queue system in situations where there is less control. We use the semi-martingale methods described in Fayolle, Malyshev and Menshikov [3] and our results generalise Kurkova [8] and complement Foley and McDonald [4] and [5].", "paper_title": "Stability criteria for controlled queueing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236829100005"}
