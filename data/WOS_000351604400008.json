It is a computer vision library divided in three main areas: 2D package is featured for classical computer vision processing; 3D package, which includes a complete 3D geometric toolset, is used for 3D vision computing; Desktop package comprises a tool for graphic designing and testing of new algorithms. JavaVis is designed to be easy to use, both for launching and testing existing algorithms and for developing new ones. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
