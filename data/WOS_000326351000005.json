Unfortunately, the creation of suitable meshes for these models is a challenging and time-intensive task. This paper presents an automated method of generating fully hexahedral meshes of the bones of the feet which requires only surface representations as inputs. The method is outlined and example meshes, using two human feet and the foot of a Japanese macaque, are given to demonstrate its flexibility. Mesh quality is also evaluated for the calcaneus, first metatarsal, navicular and talus. Streamlining the generation of finite element meshes of the foot will ease investigations into the patient-specific biomechanics of injury.", "paper_title": "Patient-specific modelling of the foot: automated hexahedral meshing of the bones", "paper_id": "WOS:000326351000005"}
