To describe the dynamic processes properly, a dynamic PLS algorithm is proposed in this paper for dynamic process modeling, which captures the dynamic correlation between the measurement block and quality data block. For the purpose of process monitoring, a dynamic total PLS (T-PLS) model is presented to decompose the measurement block into four subspaces. The new model is the dynamic extension of the T-PLS model, which is efficient for detecting quality-related abnormal situation. Several examples are given to show the effectiveness of dynamic T-PLS models and the corresponding fault detection methods.", "paper_title": "Quality Relevant Data-Driven Modeling and Monitoring of Multivariate Dynamic Processes: The Dynamic T-PLS Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000299082900010"}
