The exponential growth of the web generates an exceptional quantity of data for which automatic knowledge capture is essential. This work describes the methodology for web-scale information extraction in the linked open data information-extraction (LODIE) project and highlights results fiom the early experiments carried out in the initial phase of the project. LODIE aims to develop information-extraction techniques able to scale at web level and adapt to user information needs. The core idea behind LODIE is the usage of linked open data, a very large-scale information resource, as a ground-breaking solution for IE, which provides invaluable annotated data on a growing number of domains. This article has two objectives, first, describing the LODIE project as a whole and depicting its general challenges and directions; and second, describing some initial steps taken toward the general solution, focusing on a specific IE sub-task, wrapper induction.", "paper_title": "Early Steps Toward Web-Scale Information Extraction with LODIE", "paper_id": "WOS:000353079700006"}
