An algorithm is proposed to detect whether a specified control point can be removed or not and to compute the new control points if the point is removable. The algorithm can be viewed as a reverse process of the T-spline local knot insertion algorithm. The extension of the algorithm to remove more control points is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Control point removal algorithm for T-spline surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900027"}
