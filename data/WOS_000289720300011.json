While the consideration of Nash equilibria forms the core of our work, also pure and correlated equilibria, as well as various concepts of iterated strategy elimination, are dealt with. As a side result, the Weihrauch-degree of solving systems of linear inequalities is settled.", "paper_title": "How Incomputable is Finding Nash Equilibria?", "paper_id": "WOS:000289720300011"}
