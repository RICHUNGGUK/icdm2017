RSK2 comprises two terminal kinase domains (NTKD and CTKD) that can be inhibited by binding with different types of inhibitors at the ATP binding sites. In the absence of a crystal structure of RSK2, we constructed a model for the 3D structure of the RSK2 NTKD by homology modeling and stepwise constrained refinement with the reported inhibitors using a molecular docking method. Structure-based virtual screening was subsequently performed against a library containing commercially available compounds using the refined model. This resulted in the identification of seven novel RSK2 inhibitors with IC(50) values ranging from 2.4 to 14.45 mu M.", "paper_title": "Identification of Inhibitors against p90 Ribosomal S6 Kinase 2 (RSK2) through Structure-Based Virtual Screening with the Inhibitor-Constrained Refined Homology Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000297275000016"}
