Additional information about some gene products may come from multiple sources, including the set of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and the set of journal abstracts related to each gene product. Gene product similarity measures can be based on evaluating sets of descriptor terms found in the GO taxonomy, and/or the index term sets of the related documents (McSH annotations). While our techniques can be applied to term sets from any taxonomy, we restrict our examples in this article to GO annotations. We investigate the use of linear order statistics (LOS) to build similarity relations on pairs of terms that are used in the GO as linguistic descriptors of genes and gene products. One of our objectives is to investigate the construction and utility of visual assessments of relational data (in this case, dissimilarity matrices) for discovering tendencies of groups of gene products to \"cluster together\". We use gene product data derived from a group of 194 gene products representing three protein families extracted from ENSEMBL. Our examples suggest that LOS similarity measures are more effective than traditional sequence-based similarity measures at capturing relationships between pairs of gene products in ENSEMBL families when annotation information is available. We show examples of how these similarity measures can assist in knowledge discovery and gene product family validation.", "paper_title": "Gene ontology similarity measures based on linear order statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000243546600001"}
