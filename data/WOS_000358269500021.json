The dense precursor gas tetraethoxysilane (TEOS - Si(C2H5O)(4)) is premixed with nitrogen and ejected through circular holes in the base of each injector into the nozzle flow at a co-flow Mach number of Ma(co-flow) approximate to 0.66 and a temperature of Tco-flow approximate to 1200 K. Immediately downstream of the blunt trailing edge of the injector the flow field is accelerated to supersonic speed. The mixing process is determined by a multi-species large-eddy simulation (LES). The analysis shows a higher mixing efficiency of the streamwise ramp configuration against the plane geometry. Especially the temporal homogeneity is improved as a result of reduced vortex shedding at the injector base. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
