The proposed method is a modification of the Rhie-Chow algorithm where the force in a cell is spread on neighboring cells by applying equivalent pressure jumps at the cell faces. The method shows excellent results when applied for simulating the flow through an actuator disk, which is relevant for wind turbine wake simulations. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
