Motivated by this problem, we consider the order of such a subgraph in a typical graph on n vertices, i.e., in a binomial random graph G(n, 1/2). We prove that with high probability a largest induced regular subgraph of G(n, 1/2) has about n(2/3) vertices. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
