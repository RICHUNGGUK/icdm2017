Such shots however are hard to capture even for professionals, especially when the foreground motion is complex (e.g., non-linear motion trajectories). In this work we propose a system to generate realistic, 3D-aware tracking shots from consumer videos. We show how computer vision techniques such as segmentation and structure-from-motion can be used to lower the barrier and help novice users create high quality tracking shots that are physically plausible. We also introduce a pseudo 3D approach for relative depth estimation to avoid expensive 3D reconstruction for improved robustness and a wider application range. We validate our system through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations.", "paper_title": "Track Cam: 3D-aware Tracking Shots from Consumer Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000345855600027"}
