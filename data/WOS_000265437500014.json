However, only a few of them support the random accessibility in decoding, which enables the details of any specific part to be available without decoding other parts. This paper proposes an effective framework for the random accessibility of mesh compression. The key component of the framework is a wire-net mesh constructed from a chartification of the given mesh. Charts are compressed separately for random access to mesh parts and a wire-net mesh provides an indexing and stitching structure for the compressed charts. Experimental results show that random accessibility can be achieved with competent compression ratio, which is only a little worse than single-rate and comparable to progressive encoding. To demonstrate the merits of the framework, we apply it to process huge meshes in an out-of-core manner such as out-of-core rendering and out-of-core editing.", "paper_title": "Random Accessible Mesh Compression Using Mesh Chartification", "paper_id": "WOS:000265437500014"}
