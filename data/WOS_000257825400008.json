Three sets of near infrared (NIR) spectra (285, 285 and 375 gasoline spectra) were used for calibration models building. Cross-validation errors and structures of optimized MLP and WNN were compared for each sample set. Four different transfer functions (Morlet wavelet and Gaussian derivative - for WNN; logistic and hyperbolic tangent - for MLP) were also compared. Wavelet neural network was found to be more effective and robust than multilayer perceptron. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
