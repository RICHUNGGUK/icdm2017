A novel switching control strategy is proposed for adaptive finite-time control design with the help of Lyapunov-based method and time-rescaling technique. With the proposed control law, the uncertain closed-loop system under consideration is finite-time stable within a given settling time. An illustrative example is also given to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE CONTROL OF UNCERTAIN NONHOLONOMIC SYSTEMS IN FINITE TIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000273488700009"}
