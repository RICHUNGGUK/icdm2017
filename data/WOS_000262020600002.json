Design/methodology/approach - The fluid dynamic behaviour analysis is carried out for the dynamic torque characteristics of reheat stop valve and for the thermal load distribution of the valve shaft-bush subassembly, which is used for evaluating the thermal deformation of valve shaft by using of finite elements method. The assembly behaviour dynamic model is developed by multibody dynamics theory, which is as the basis of developing virtual prototyping platform for analysing and evaluating the current assembly process. Findings - It is revealed that the deformation (epsilon) of valve shaft due to the thermal load, and the assembly coaxial error (e) can change the motion clearance remarkably, which lead the dynamic properties and performance of reheat stop valve changed greatly. The current assembly behaviour variable are not optimum and the initial design clearance between valve shaft and bush 4# can be optimised by the developed virtual prototyping platform on the basis of ADAMSw API. The results of evaluation for the assembly behaviour reveal the well dynamic characteristics of reheat stop valve with the optimum assembly behaviour variable. This will be useful for improving the current assembly process of reheat stop valve. Research limitations/implications - The present assembly behaviour dynamic model based on virtual prototyping for optimum assembly process design uses only single objective optimisation (the most important clearance between valve shaft and bush 4#). For a complete optimum assembly process design has to be carried out with other three clearance variables (the clearance between valve shaft and bush 1#, bush 2# and bush 3#) together. Practical implications - The present analysis provides some benchmarks for improving the current assembly process. In practice, the assembly coaxial tolerance of valve shaft-bush subassembly and the initial design clearances must be limited strictly. Originality/value - This paper provides a methodology for analysis and evaluation of reheat stop valve assembly behaviour with the consideration of combined environmental behaviours. Based on this methodology, it is possible to develop an assembly behaviour dynamic model, and further, to develop a virtual prototyping platform for analysing and evaluating the assembly process which will offer help to designers for improving the reheat stop valve assembly process.", "paper_title": "Analysis and evaluation for assembly behaviour of reheat stop valve based on virtual prototyping", "paper_id": "WOS:000262020600002"}
