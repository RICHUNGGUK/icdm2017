For the multiclass classifications, they are usually converted into binary ones before they can be used to classify the examples. In the one-against-one algorithm with SVMs, there exists an unclassifiable region where the data samples cannot be classified by its decision function. This paper extends the one-against-one algorithm to handle this problem. We also give the convergence and computational complexity analysis of the proposed method. Finally, one-against-one, fuzzy decision function (FDF), and decision-directed acyclic graph (DDAG) algorithms and our proposed method are compared using five University of California at Irvine (UCI) data sets. The results report that the proposed method can handle the unclassifiable region better than others.", "paper_title": "Nesting One-Against-One Algorithm Based on SVMs for Pattern Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000261544900005"}
