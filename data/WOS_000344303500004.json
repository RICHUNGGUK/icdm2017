Thus it is possible to represent increment, decrement, relational operations and assignment statements using spiking neural P systems. With these basic structures, it is also possible to represent programming language constructs like conditional, iterative and different types of execution constructs. In this paper we consider a general-purpose parallel programming language that handles integer variables and is implemented using spiking neural P systems with anti-spikes.", "paper_title": "Parallel Programming in Spiking Neural P Systems with Anti-Spikes", "paper_id": "WOS:000344303500004"}
