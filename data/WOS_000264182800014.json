Two key problems in. financial time series forecasting are noise and non-stationarity. Here, we assign a higher membership value to data samples that contain more relevant information, where relevance is related to recency in time. The approach requires only a single matrix inversion. For the linear case, the matrix order depends only on the dimension in which the data samples lie, and is independent of the number of samples. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on. financial datasets available in the public domain. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
