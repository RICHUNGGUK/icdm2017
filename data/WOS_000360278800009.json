The product-difference type estimator of the mean is plotted on the proposed control chart, which utilizes the information of an auxiliary variable correlated with the main quality variable. The proposed control chart is based on the outer and inner control limits so that repetitive sampling is allowed when the plotted statistic falls between the two limits. The average run length (ARL) of the proposed control chart is evaluated using the Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed control chart is compared with the Riaz M control chart and the results show the outperformance of the proposed control chart in terms of the ARL.", "paper_title": "A control chart using an auxiliary variable and repetitive sampling for monitoring process mean", "paper_id": "WOS:000360278800009"}
