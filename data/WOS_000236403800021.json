Furthermore, simulation and experimental test results of 3 kVA models are provided to confirm and verify the theoretical approach. Design/methodology/approach - Presents a converter with auxiliary transformer and bipolar PWM AC matrix-reactance chopper (MRC), based on Cuk B2 topology. The MRC has the possibility of bipolar AC voltage conversion with magnitude of voltage transformation function greater than 1. The peak voltage detection method in the control circuit is applied to fast control of the load voltage changes. The steady state and transient state theoretical analysis based on averaged models of the presented controller is used. There is a four-terminal description of the basic properties in the presented approach. Findings - In the proposed solution only half the number of switches compared with the case of full bridge matrix chopper solution is used. The nominal load voltage can be obtained even for 50 per cent step-down of the supply voltage. Originality/value - Presents new topology and properties of single-phase serial AC voltage controller.", "paper_title": "A serial AC voltage controller using bipolar matrix-reactance chopper", "paper_id": "WOS:000236403800021"}
