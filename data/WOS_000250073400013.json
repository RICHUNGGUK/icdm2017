The novel contribution in the predictive approach employed is the digitalisation of particles, container and packing space to generate complex life-like stochastic packing structures of particulate systems at relatively high speed (when compared to traditional vector-based approaches) which are comparable with experimentally packed beds without need for further conversion. of numerical data. A variety of packed column simulations, comprising more complex beds than often seen in the literature, namely shell-side beds with increasing complexity of internal structure and packed with spherical particles, have been undertaken and the resulting averaged numerical data compared like-for-like with experimental results with key trends reproduced. The overall aim of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of the technique and associated computer code as an engineering aide for research, design and optimisation of the performance of packed bed systems of any geometric complexity in terms of packing structure, as well as to highlight possible areas for further development of the code.
