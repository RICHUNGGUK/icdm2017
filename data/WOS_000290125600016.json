The effective ISF for each noise source in the oscillator is derived mathematically. According to these effective ISFs, the explicit closed-form expression for phase noise due to the total thermal noise in the series QOSC is derived, and the phase noise contribution from the flicker noise in the regenerative and coupling transistors is also figured out. The phase noise contributions from the thermal noise and the flicker noise are verified by SpectreRF simulations.", "paper_title": "A Time-Variant Analysis of Phase Noise in Series Quadrature Oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600016"}
