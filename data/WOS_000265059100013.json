The work is a multi-dimensional extension of the one-dimensional FORCE flux and is closely related to the work of Nessyahu-Tadmor and Arminjon. The resulting basic flux is first-order accurate and monotone; it is then extended to arbitrary order of accuracy in space and time on unstructured meshes in the framework of finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods. The performance of the schemes is assessed on a suite of test problems for the multi-dimensional Euler and Magnetohydrodynamics equations on unstructured meshes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
