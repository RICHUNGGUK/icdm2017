Taking advantage of the special block Toeplitz structure of the matrix of the linear system, a fast iterative and preconditioned numerical method yielding large memory savings is proposed. Several numerical experiments for general configurations are presented to show the efficiency of the numerical method. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
