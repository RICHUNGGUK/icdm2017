Such systems are heterogeneous, as are the ways they are used, the deployed anonymity measures, and finally, the possible attack methods. Implementation quality and topologies of the anonymity measures must be considered as well. We therefore propose a new measure for the anonymity degree that takes into account these various aspects of design and operation of anonymity systems. We model the effectiveness of single mixes or of mix networks in terms of information leakage, and we measure it in terms of covert-channel capacity. The relationship between the anonymity degree and information leakage is described, and an example is shown.", "paper_title": "Information Leakage as a Model for Quality of Anonymity Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263762400009"}
