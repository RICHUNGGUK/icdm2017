Since the landing position of the emitted electrons on the phosphor plate is mainly determined by the polarity of the device voltage and close to the positive voltage electrode, the same dynamic resolution can be obtained by ALDM with only half surface-conduction electron-emitters (SCEs) compared with the conventional panel. The experiment shows six luminescence lines can be generated with three SCE lines. The emitted electron excursion on the phosphor plate is analyzed with a simplified model, and it is in good agreement with the experiment result. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
