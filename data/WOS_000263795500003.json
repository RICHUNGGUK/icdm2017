In addition, since each ET mile is completely independent and individually correct, a program can be created by simply accumulating ET rules one by one. As a result, when viewed from the perspective of component-wise program creation, ET miles can confer considerable advantage. Therefore, the creation of correct ET miles is very important. The aim of this paper is to present a theory for creating correct ET rules, and propose a method for creating correct ET rules from a logical equivalence. A logical equivalence is one class of logical formulas and describes an equivalent relationship between atom conjunctions under some specified conditions. This paper examines the degree to which ET rules obtained using the proposed method can cover those created intuitively in actual programming. It also discusses the reasons why this method can create a broader range of ET rules than existing methods.", "paper_title": "CREATION OF ET RULES FROM LOGICAL FORMULAS REPRESENTING EQUIVALENT RELATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263795500003"}
