PalmHash Code and PalmPhasor Code, as two cancelable palmprint coding schemes, are proposed in this paper to balance the conflict between security and verification performance. In order to reduce computational complexity and storage cost, cancelable palmprint coding frameworks are extended from one dimension to two dimensions. Besides, two measures, perpendicular orientation transposition and multi-orientation score level fusion, are employed to further improve the performance of two dimensional (2D) cancelable palmprint codes. PalmHash Code and PalmPhasor Code are compared extensively in this paper. The experimental results and analysis confirm that 2D PalmHash Code and 2D PalmPhasor Code enhanced by the two measures are effective and secure even in stolen-token scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
