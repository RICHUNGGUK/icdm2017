The method relies on Case-Based Reasoning to adapt itself to any robot and environment through learning, both by observation and self experience. Thus, unlike in other reactive techniques, kinematics or dynamics do not need to be explicitly taken into account. Also, learning from different sources allows combination of their advantages into a safe and smooth path to the goal. The method has been succesfully implemented on a Pioneer robot wielding 8 Polaroid sonar sensors.", "paper_title": "A purely reactive navigation scheme for dynamic environments using Case-Based Reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000238858600006"}
