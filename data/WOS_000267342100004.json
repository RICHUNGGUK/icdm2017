As evidenced in the current literature, dynamic textures (image sequences with regular motion patterns) can be effectively modelled by a set of spatial and temporal motion distribution features like motion co-occurrence matrix. The aim of this paper is to develop effective feature weighting and retrieval methods for a set of dynamic textures while characterized by motion co-occurrence matrices.", "paper_title": "Feature Weighting and Retrieval Methods for Dynamic Texture Motion Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000267342100004"}
