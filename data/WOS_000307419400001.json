Specifically, the focus is on how phonetic categories and word-like units can be acquired purely on the basis of the statistical structure of speech signals, possibly aided by some articulatory or visual constraints. The outcomes and shortcomings of the existing work are reflected onto findings from experimental and theoretical studies. Finally, some of the open questions and possible future research directions related to the computational models of language acquisition are discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
