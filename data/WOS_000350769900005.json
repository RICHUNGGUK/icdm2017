The input signal characteristics are exploited to anticipate the time varying computational complexity as well as to instantiate dynamic replicas (DRs) to realize fault-resilience. The scheme employs amorphous processing elements (APEs) which either perform as active elements (AEs) to maintain quality/throughput, serve as DRs to increase reliability levels, or hibernate passively as reconfigurable slack (RS) available to other tasks. Experimental results from a hardware platform for field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based video encoding demonstrate power efficiency and fault-tolerance of the ME engine. A significant reduction in power consumption is achieved ranging from 83% for low-motion-activity scene's to 12.5% for high motion activity video scenes. The scenes motion activity is utilized to improve redundancy for the purpose of priority based diagnosis of the computing modules. In addition, a graceful degradation strategy is developed to recover from hard errors by adapting the search range of candidate motion vectors (MVs). This adaptive hardware scheme is shown to automatically demote the faulty resources in FPGA devices based on streaming performance.", "paper_title": "Activity-Based Resource Allocation for Motion Estimation Engines", "paper_id": "WOS:000350769900005"}
