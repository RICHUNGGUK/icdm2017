This calculation can be formalized as the maximum common substructure (MCS) problem, which is well-studied and has been shown to be NP-complete. Although many rigorous and heuristic algorithms have been developed, none of these algorithms is sufficiently fast and accurate. We developed a new program, called \"kcombu\" using a build-up algorithm, which is a type of the greedy heuristic algorithms. The program can search connected and disconnected MCSs as well as topologically constrained disconnected MCS (TD-MCS), which is introduced in this study. To evaluate the performance of our program, we prepared two correct standards: the exact correspondences generated by the maximum clique algorithms and the 3D correspondences obtained from superimposed 3D structure of the molecules in a complex 3D structure with the same protein. For the five sets of molecules taken from the protein structure database, the agreement value between the build-up and the exact correspondences for the connected MCS is sufficiently high, but the computation time of the build-up algorithm is much smaller than that of the exact algorithm. The comparison between the build-up and the 3D correspondences shows that the TD-MCS has the best agreement value among the other types of MCS. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between the molecular similarity and the agreement with the correct and 3D correspondences; more similar molecule pairs are more correctly matched. Molecular pairs with more than 40% Tanimoto similarities can be correctly matched for more than half of the atoms with the 3D correspondences.", "paper_title": "Build-Up Algorithm for Atomic Correspondence between Chemical Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000294081800005"}
