In particular, we employ the recently proposed Coulomb-attenuated model which was proven by other authors to improve upon conventional functionals in the case of charge-transfer excitations. For further validation, two distinct approaches to compute the property in question are compared for a phthalocyanine dimer.", "paper_title": "Long-range corrected DFT calculations of charge-transfer integrals in model metal-free phthalocyanine complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000294735900003"}
