The Code Size affects the amount of system resources needed, like ROM and RAM memory, and processing capacity. In our previous work, we have estimated the Code Size based on CFP (COSMIC Function Points) within 15% accuracy, with the purpose of deciding how much ROM memory to fit into products with high cost pressure. Our manual CFP measurement process would require 2.5 man years to estimate the ROM size required in a typical car. In this paper, we want to investigate how the manual effort involved in estimation of Code Size can be minimized. We define a UML Profile capturing all information needed for estimation of Code Size, and develop a tool for automated estimation of Code Size based on CFP. A case study will show how UML models save manual effort in a realistic case.", "paper_title": "CompSize: A Model-Based and Automated Approach to Size Estimation of Embedded Software Components", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043000003"}
