This algorithm is proved to minimize the necessary number of wavelengths. We also describe three schemes that can reduce the switch scale at the ring-concatenating nodes: separation of intra-ring and inter-ring operation, hierarchical optical path switching, and introduction of efficient protection switching. We clarify that the proposed node architectures applying the described schemes reduce the switch size by 50% to 75% compared with the conventional arrangement.", "paper_title": "Wavelength Assignment for Concatenated ROADM Ring Networks and Switch Scale Reduction in a Concatenating Node", "paper_id": "WOS:000273201000007"}
