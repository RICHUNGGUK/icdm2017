These DSRs obtained by using the criterion of maximal entropy and spatial discrimination present high appearance stability and strong spatial discriminative power, which enables them to tolerate more appearance variations and to effectively resist spatial distracters. Meanwhile, the adaptive fusion tracking incorporated k-means clustering can handle severe occlusion as well as disturbance of motion noise during target localization. In addition, an effective local update scheme is designed to adapt to the object change for ensuring the tracking robustness. Experiments are carried out on several challenging sequences and results show that our method performs well in terms of object tracking, even in the presence of occlusion, deformation, illumination change, moving camera and spatial distracter.
