A unified model has been defined for the receiver containing all first order mismatches, offsets, imperfections, and the LMS algorithm is employed to track these errors. The performance of this technique under noisy channel conditions has been verified. Moreover, a detailed complexity analysis of the calibration algorithm is provided which shows that sinc filter banks have much lower complexity than traditional continuous-time filter banks.", "paper_title": "LEAST MEAN SQUARED BACKGROUND CALIBRATION FOR OFDM MULTICHANNEL RECEIVERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305249000014"}
