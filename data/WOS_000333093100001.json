We intend to reproduce, in the volumetric texture, the interactions between pixels learned in an input 2D image. The learning is done by nonparametric Parzen-windowing. Optimization is handled voxel by a relaxation algorithm, aiming at maximizing the likelihood of each voxel in terms of its local conditional probability function. Variants are proposed regarding the relaxation algorithm and the heuristic strategies used for the simultaneous handling of the orthogonal slices containing the voxel. The procedures are materialized on various textures through a comparative study and a sensitivity analysis, highlighting the variants strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the probabilistic model is compared objectively with a nonparametric neighborhood-search-based algorithm.", "paper_title": "Maximum-Likelihood Based Synthesis of Volumetric Textures from a 2D Sample", "paper_id": "WOS:000333093100001"}
