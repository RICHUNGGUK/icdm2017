This scenario may be suppressed in computations when governing equations are approximated by schemes which do not preserve the cosymmetry property. We consider the problem for the annular porous domain in polar coordinates and derive a mimetic finite-difference scheme. This scheme allows to compute the family of convective regimes accurately and to detect the instabilities on some parts of the family. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
