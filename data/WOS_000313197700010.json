The new features include support for the specification of the roles of package authors (e. g. maintainer, author, contributor, translator, etc.) and more flexible formatting/printing tools among various other improvements. Here, we introduce the new classes and their methods and indicate how this functionality is employed in the management of R packages. Specifically, we show how the authors of R packages can be specified along with their roles in package 'DESCRIPTION' and/or 'CITATION' files and the citations produced from it.", "paper_title": "Who Did What?
