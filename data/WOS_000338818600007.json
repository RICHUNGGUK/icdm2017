The proposed symmetry analysis is performed on a B-Rep CAD model through a divide-and-conquer approach over the boundary of a component with faces as atomic entities. As a result, it is possible to identify rapidly all global symmetry planes and axisymmetry as well as local symmetries. Also, the corresponding algorithm is fast enough to be inserted in CAD/CAM operators as part of interactive modeling processes, it performs at the same level of tolerance than geometric modelers and it is independent of the face and edge parameterizations.
