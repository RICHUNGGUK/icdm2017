Channel charge injection (CCI) and clock feed-through (CFT) are two major non-ideal effects existing in TG switches and SC integrators reducing modulator total SNR, its linearity and its total gain. This paper presents a precise model for SC integrator including CCI and CFT non-ideal effects in MATLAB SIMULINK environment which allows designers to perform time-domain behavioral simulations of switched-capacitor (SC) Sigma-Delta modulators. Evaluation and validation of extracted models were performed via behavioral and transistor-level simulations for modeled SC integrator, second and third order modulators using SIMULINK and Agilent ADS environments with a generic 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. Non-idealities and nonlinearities effects are apparently observed by comparing the ideal modulator in behavioral analysis and actual modulator in circuit-level environment.
