Due to utilization of dynamic non-linear amplifier, power consumption of the converter is very low. The ADC circuit uses digital calibration technique to update the reference voltages of the comparators. The power consumption of ADC is 840 A mu W, and the ENOB is 4.05 at 1 Gsps with input signal at the Nyquist rate. At sampling rate of 10 0Msps, the power consumption is reduced to 89 A mu W and the ENOB is equal to 4.6 again at the Nyquist rate.", "paper_title": "A 1 Gsps and 840 A mu W fully dynamic asynchronous pipelined binary search ADC", "paper_id": "WOS:000342426000020"}
