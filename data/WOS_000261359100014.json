The functional unit, constant unit, register, and routing resource can be represented in the graph as well as the configuration information. The restriction in the hardware is also added in the graph by limiting the possible configuration at a node controlled by the other node. A prototype compiler called Black-Diamond with GCI is now available for three different DRPAs. It translates data-flow graph from C-like front-end description, applies placement and routing by using the GCI, and generates configuration data for each element of the DRPA. Evaluation results of simple applications show that Black-Diamond can generate reasonable designs for all three different architectures. Other target architectures can be easily treated by representing many aspects of architectural property into a GCI.", "paper_title": "A Retargetable Compiler Based on Graph Representation for Dynamically Reconfigurable Processor Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000261359100014"}
