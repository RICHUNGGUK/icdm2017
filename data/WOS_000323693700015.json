An incremental scheme is used to reduce the computational complexity. By this scheme, only a few entries in an existing histogram need to be updated to obtain a new histogram. The updating procedure makes use of a few histograms attached to the polygon's edges, which can be efficiently pre-computed in a similar incremental manner. Thus, the overall process can achieve higher computational efficiency. Further, we extend our method to efficiently evaluate objective functions on the histograms in polygonal regions. The experiments on natural images demonstrate the high efficiency of our method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
