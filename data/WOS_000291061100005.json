However, in multimedia information systems, selections generally contain expensive multimedia operations, making \"pushdown\" rules no longer able to produce optimal query execution plan. Therefore, we in this paper develop a theory for optimizing queries with expensive multimedia operations, which can establish the optimal placement of each multimedia operation in a query plan by the comprehensive consideration of selectivity and unit execution cost of each operation. Then we present an algorithm for the theory and implement it in a prototype system. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional optimization algorithms, our algorithm not only has the modest time complexity that is polynomial in the number of multimedia operations in a query plan, but also can reduce the execution cost of a query plan by orders of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Multimedia selection operation placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000291061100005"}
