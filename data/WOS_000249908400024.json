We follow its principles to have a system providing basic descriptions of the visual world to the brain's cortex. We describe a set of software and hardware tools to interface with neural tissue, in order to transmit visual information encoded into a bioinspired neural-like form. The set is composed of a retina-like encoder, and a platform to optimize electrical stimulation parameters for a multi-electrode implant. The main objective is to progress towards a functional visual neuroprosthesis for the blind. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
