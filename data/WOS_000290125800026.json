However, the optimal kernel parameters of LSVM are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose a multi-kernel LSVM (MK-LSVM) method using multi-kernel learning formulations in combination with the LSVM. Our learning formulations assume that a set of base kernels are grouped, and employ l(2) norm regularization for automatically seeking the optimal linear combination of base kernels. Experimental testing reveals that our method achieves better performance than the LSVM alone using synthetic data, the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the Caltech database of Generic Object Classification.", "paper_title": "Laplacian Support Vector Machines with Multi-Kernel Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125800026"}
