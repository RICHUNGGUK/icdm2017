In particular, command shaping is applied to move a cable suspended load at the end point of an Adept Cobra 600 4-axis SCARA robot, with the objective of minimizing load swing. The first part of this paper discusses inverse kinematics, pendulum dynamics calculations, the corresponding shaping control algorithm, and the effects of transmission time delay. Standardized Internet interface via the DataSocket software in LabVIEW is then addressed in the second part. Simulation and experimental results confirm the feasibility of real time command shaping control through the Internet.", "paper_title": "Web-based command shaping of cobra 600 robot with a swinging load", "paper_id": "WOS:000242807600006"}
