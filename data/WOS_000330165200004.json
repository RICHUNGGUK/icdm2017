Ferrari and F. Cribari-Neto, Beta regression for modelling rates and proportions, J. Appl. Stat. 31 (2004), pp. 799-815] by incorporating a discrete component that allows practitioners to model data on rates and proportions with observations that equal an interval limit. For instance, one can model responses that assume values in (0, 1]. The likelihood ratio test tends to be quite oversized (liberal, anticonservative) in inflated beta regressions estimated with a small number of observations. Indeed, our numerical results show that its null rejection rate can be almost twice the nominal level. It is thus important to develop alternative testing strategies. This paper develops small-sample adjustments to the likelihood ratio and signed likelihood ratio test statistics in inflated beta regression models. The adjustments do not require orthogonality between the parameters of interest and the nuisance parameters and are fairly simple since they only require first- and second-order log-likelihood cumulants. Simulation results show that the modified likelihood ratio tests deliver much accurate inference in small samples. An empirical application is presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Modified likelihood ratio statistics for inflated beta regressions", "paper_id": "WOS:000330165200004"}
