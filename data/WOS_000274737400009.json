The adaptive combination of multiple biometrics is employed to determine the optimal fusion strategy and the corresponding fusion parameters. The score-level fusion rules are adapted to ensure the desired system performance using a hybrid particle swarm optimization model. The rigorous experimental results presented in this paper illustrate that the proposed score-level approach can achieve significantly better and stable performance over the decision-level approach. There has been very little effort in the literature to investigate the performance of an adaptive multimodal fusion algorithm on real biometric data. This paper also presents the performance of the proposed approach from the real biometric samples which further validate the contributions from this paper.", "paper_title": "A New Framework for Adaptive Multimodal Biometrics Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000274737400009"}
