The overall idea is as follows: given a real-valued function F with a multidimensional and compact domain D, the method builds an equivalent one-dimensional problem by composing F with a linearization of D, searches for a small population of candidates and returns to the original high-dimensional domain, this time with a small set of promising starting points.
