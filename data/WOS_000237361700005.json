The design issues of the analog and digital baseband processor for the channelized receiver in a UWB transmitted reference (TR) system are investigated. In the analog part, the receiver performance is shown to be weakly dependent on the analog filter bandwidth, the filter order, and the ADC oversampling ratio assuming white input noise. In the digital part, the coarse acquisition performance is shown to be significantly better in a channelized receiver than in a fullband receiver. The implementation issues for fine synchronization and correlation window length are also studied.", "paper_title": "An analog/digital baseband processor design of a UWB channelized receiver for transmitted reference signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000237361700005"}
