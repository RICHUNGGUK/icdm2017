A lucky number of G, denoted by eta(G), is the minimum number k such that G has a lucky labeling l : V(G) --> {1, ..., k}. We prove that for a given planar 3-colorable graph G determining whether eta(G) = 2 is NP-complete. Also for every k >= 2, it is NP-complete to decide whether eta(G) = k for a given graph G.
