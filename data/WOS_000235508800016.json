The communication among MNs in MANETs is carried out without base stations or access points and the transmission of data packets is completed through relays among nodes. Due to the mobility of MNs, the topology of a MANET frequently changes and thus results in the disability of on-the-fly data transmission routes. To cope with the intrinsic properties of MANETs, Dynamic Backup Routes Routing Protocol ((DBRP)-P-2), a distributed backup routes mechanism for quick reconnection during link failures, is proposed in this paper. (DBRP)-P-2 is an on-demand routing protocol which can set up many backup routes to reach a destination node in a given period of time. The information of backup routes can be saved in a specific on-the-route node and enables backup routes to be found immediately in situation regarding disconnection. When a link fails, routes from the source node to the destination node are analyzed to obtain backup routes and to sustain quick reconnection. As a result, (DBRP)-P-2 could more thoroughly improve the quality of routing than previous routing protocols.", "paper_title": "A distributed backup routes mechanism for mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508800016"}
