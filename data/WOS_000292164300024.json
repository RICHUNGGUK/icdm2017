We present a navigation technique called Dynamic Insets that provides context awareness for graph navigation. Dynamic insets utilize the topological structure of the network to draw a visual inset for off-screen nodes that shows a portion of the surrounding area for links leaving the edge of the screen. We implement dynamic insets for general graph navigation as well as geographical maps. We also present results from a set of user studies that show that our technique is more efficient than most of the existing techniques for graph navigation in different networks.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Insets for Context-Aware Graph Navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000292164300024"}
