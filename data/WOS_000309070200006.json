In this paper we introduce perceptually optimized coded apertures for defocused deblurring. We obtain near-optimal apertures by means of optimization, with a novel evaluation function that includes two existing image quality perceptual metrics. These metrics favour results where errors in the final deblurred images will not be perceived by a human observer. Our work improves the results obtained with a similar approach that only takes into account the L2 metric in the evaluation function.", "paper_title": "Perceptually Optimized Coded Apertures for Defocus Deblurring", "paper_id": "WOS:000309070200006"}
