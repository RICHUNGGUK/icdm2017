The method is based on the introduction of intermediate regions which allows smooth transitions between kinetic and fluid zones. In this paper we extend Domain Decomposition techniques, obtained through dynamic coupling and buffer zones, to the study of plasmas and, moreover, we combine them with Asymptotic Preserving and Asymptotically Accurate strategies for the time integration. We use a hybrid scheme in which both kinetic and fluid descriptions are considered and coupled together while the kinetic model is solved by asymptotic preserving and accurate methods, in order to guarantee high efficiency and accuracy in all regimes. The numerical scheme is validated and its performances are analyzed by numerical simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
