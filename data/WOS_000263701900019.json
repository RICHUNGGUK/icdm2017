An analysis of current software for making various types of visual story is made; this identifies a gap between software which emphasises preset banks of artwork, and software which emphasises low-level construction and/or drawing. A proposal is made to fill this gap, and a prototype implementation of the proposal is described in the context of a school-based study with England and Wales's Year 5, covering ages 9-10 years. Results from this prototype study both validate the novel proposal made and demonstrate that children are capable of manipulating characters and notional camera angles in a more complex way than most current software permits.
