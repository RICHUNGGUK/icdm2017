Central to these problems is the fact that code from untrusted sources runs with full privileges. We implement information flow controls in Firefox to help prevent violations of data confidentiality and integrity. Most previous information flow techniques have primarily relied on either static type systems, which are a poor fit for JavaScript, or on dynamic analyses that sometimes get stuck due to problematic implicit flows, even in situations where the target web application correctly satisfies the desired security policy. We introduce faceted values, a new mechanism for providing information flow security in a dynamic manner that overcomes these limitations. Taking inspiration from secure multi-execution, we use faceted values to simultaneously and efficiently simulate multiple executions for different security levels, thus providing non-interference with minimal overhead, and without the reliance on the stuck executions of prior dynamic approaches.", "paper_title": "Multiple Facets for Dynamic Information Flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000300548100013"}
