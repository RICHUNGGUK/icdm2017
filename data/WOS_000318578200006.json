The traditional methods of remote sensing (RS) for agricultural pests monitoring cannot meet the needs of agricultural development, because of their long time-consuming, high cost, and low accuracy. However, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing, as a new means of remote sensing, is introduced in this paper for agricultural monitoring. UAV has advantages of strong real-time, quickness, convenience, low cost, high accuracy and abundant data. With the great flexibility of UAV remote sensing, it is not only easy to focus on regional and long-term agricultural pests monitoring, but also feasible to provide scientific basis for crop pests control. Thus, it is better to meet the time needs of pests' control. In the article, Baiyangdian agricultural area is chosen as the study area. It is discussed how to process UAV images rapidly and extract disease crop information, especially which improved scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm and object-oriented information extraction are used for image-processing. Fortunately, it has been received good results for the local crop pest control in terms of fact of treatment. With the advantages of UAV remote sensing, there is a broad application prospect in precision agriculture.", "paper_title": "THE APPLICATION OF UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE REMOTE SENSING IN QUICKLY MONITORING CROP PESTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578200006"}
