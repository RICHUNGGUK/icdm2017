The main new features included in the proposed protocol are (1) identity anonymity, which protects location privacy of mobile users in the roaming network environment; (2) one-time session key renewal, which frequently updates the session key for mobile users and hence reduces the risk of using a compromised session key to communicate with the visited network. The performance analysis shows that the computational complexity of our protocol is low and suitable to be used on mobile equipments.", "paper_title": "Self-certified mutual authentication and key exchange protocol for roaming services", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800039"}
