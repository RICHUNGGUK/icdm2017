GST is, however, sensitive to random noise since it does not regard symmetric polarities. In this paper, a bipolar edge direction constraint is proposed to obtain robustness to a noisy or complex background by introducing symmetric polarities. The capability of the novel approach is evaluated by experiments on synthetic and real images including noisy or complex backgrounds. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
