First, the independence of fuzzy variables is defined based on the concept of marginal possibility distribution function, and a discussion about the relationship between the independent fuzzy variables and the noninteractive (unrelated) fuzzy variables is included. Second, we discuss some properties of the independent fuzzy variables, and establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the independent fuzzy variables. Third, we propose the independence of fuzzy events, and deal with its fundamental properties. Finally, we apply the properties of the independent fuzzy variables to a class of fuzzy random programming problems to study their convexity.", "paper_title": "The independence of fuzzy variables with applications to fuzzy random optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000256307300002"}
