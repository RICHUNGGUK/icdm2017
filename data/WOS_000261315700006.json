Design/methodology/approach - An access control model for security and management of VE is presented by integrating generic structure of VE and applying the principles of RBAC. In addition, the application of the model to a supply chain-oriented VE illustrates that a general access control scheme can ensure the running of VE. Findings - A theory base of access control for the realization of the VE is found. Originality/value - The paper presents a very useful new model of access control for VE. This paper is aimed at researchers and engineers.", "paper_title": "Modeling of RBAC-based access control of virtual enterprise", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700006"}
