DHA-256 is a dedicated hash function with output length of 256 bits and 64 steps of operations designed to enhance SHA-256 security. In this paper, we show an attack on 35-step DHA-256. The attack finds pseudo-preimage and preimagc of 35-step DHA-256 with the time complexity of 2(240) and 2(249) compression function operations, respectively, and 2(16) x 11 words memory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that analyzes the preimage resistance of DHA-256.", "paper_title": "Preimage Attack on Reduced DHA-256", "paper_id": "WOS:000293311000008"}
