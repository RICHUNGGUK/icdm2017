Often, these data are not owned and controlled by the decision maker; their search, extraction, integration, and storage for reuse or sharing should be accomplished by decision makers without any intervention by designers or programmers. The goal of this paper is to present the framework we envision to support self-service business intelligence and the related research challenges; the underlying core idea is the notion of fusion cubes, i.e., multidimensional cubes that can be dynamically extended both in their schema and their instances, and in which situational data and metadata are associated with quality and provenance annotations.", "paper_title": "Fusion Cubes: Towards Self-Service Business Intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000323378700004"}
