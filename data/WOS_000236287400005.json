In our analysis, we assume the video sequences have uniform and constant translational motion and we model MCP as a stochastic filter. We also assume an exponential model for the distortion-rate function of the intraframe coding. The analysis is divided into two parts: the steady-state analysis and the transient analysis. In the first part, only the steady-state response of the coders is taken into account, and, thus, this analysis allows us to asses approximately the efficiency of coders with long input sequences. The transitory analysis considers both the transient and the steady-state responses of the coders, which makes it appropriate to analyze coders using periodic intraframes or with short input sequences. To validate our analysis, theoretical results have been compared to results from encodings of real video sequences using the scalable adaptive motion compensated wavelet video coder. We show that our theoretical analysis effectively describes qualitatively the main trends of every video coding strategy.", "paper_title": "An analysis of the efficiency of different SNR-scalable strategies for video coders", "paper_id": "WOS:000236287400005"}
