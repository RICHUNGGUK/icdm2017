How can we get to grips with physics in these fields where traditional equation-based modelling is difficult to implement? The so-called audience or Mexican Wave in sports stadia, in which participants jump up and raise their arms in a coordinated manner so that a wave propagates around the stadium, is an instance where structures familiar to physicists-nonlinear waves or solitons-appear in the novel context of socio-physics. Using the example of the Mexican Wave, I discuss new approaches based on cellular automata and agent-based models, and how these may be related to classical continuum physics.", "paper_title": "Agent-Based Social Simulation: A Dynamical-Systems Viewpoint", "paper_id": "WOS:000278104400001"}
