Our scheme is based on the effects of quantum statistics of indistinguishable photons emitted from the trapped atoms. In this scheme, the probability of success is independent of the state to be teleported. Moreover, in the Lamb-Dicke limit, the requirement of the simultaneous clicks of the detectors is not necessary.", "paper_title": "SCHEME FOR STATE-INDEPENDENT TELEPORTATION BETWEEN TWO DISTANT ATOMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266507700011"}
