Although CF approaches have successfully been used and have the advantage in that it is unnecessary to analyze item content when generating recommendations, they nevertheless suffer from problems with accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new CF approach to improve recommendation performance. First, a new information entropy-driven user similarity measure model is proposed to measure the relative difference between ratings. A Manhattan distance-based model is then developed to address the fat tail problem by estimating the alternative active user average rating. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is analyzed on public and private data sets. As a result of the introduction of the new similarity measure and average rating estimation, we demonstrate that the proposed new CF recommendation approach provides better recommendations.
