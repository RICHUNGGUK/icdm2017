Migration from those systems to content-aware multimedia retrieval systems is a common aim for companies from very diverse sectors. In this paper we present a semantic middleware designed to achieve a seamless integration with existing systems. This middleware outsources the semantic functionalities (e.g. knowledge extraction, semantic query expansion,aEuro broken vertical bar) that are not covered by traditional systems, thereby allowing the use of complementary content-based techniques. We include a list of key criteria to successfully deploy this middleware, which provides semantic support to many different steps of the retrieval process. Both the middleware and the design criteria are validated by two real complementary deployments in two very different industrial domains.", "paper_title": "A middleware to enhance current multimedia retrieval systems with content-based functionalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000287665400005"}
