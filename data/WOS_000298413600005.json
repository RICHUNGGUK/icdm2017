Based on the simulation results in a number of typical networks, we examine the isolating and collective effects of some structural features, including average degree, shortcuts, and level of centrality, on the categorization process. This study extends the previous simulations mainly on lexical evolution, and illustrates a general framework to systematically explore the effect of social structure on language evolution.", "paper_title": "Exploring the Roles of Complex Networks in Linguistic Categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000298413600005"}
