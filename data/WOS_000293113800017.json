The method is based on a G(2) end-point interpolation of circular arcs using quadratic Bezier biarcs. We also prove the invariance of the Hausdorff distance between two compatible curves under convolution. Using this result, we obtain the exact Hausdorff distance between an offset curve and its approximation by our method. We present the approximation algorithm and give numerical examples.
