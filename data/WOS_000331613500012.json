In this paper, a novel video fingerprinting algorithm is proposed, in which a new spatio-temporal gradient is designed to represent the spatial and temporal information for each frame, and a new partition scheme, based on concentric circle and rings, is developed to resist the attacks efficiently. The centroids of spatio-temporal gradient orientations (CSTGO) within the circle and rings are then calculated to generate a robust fingerprint. Our experiments with different attacks have demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and discrimination.", "paper_title": "A Robust Video Fingerprinting Algorithm Based on Centroid of Spatio-temporal Gradient Orientations", "paper_id": "WOS:000331613500012"}
