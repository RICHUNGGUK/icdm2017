The main components of the system include a bilateral control interface, simulation and a motion simulator control scheme. The space entertainment system uses a virtual environment that enables operators to feel the actual feedback sensing and distorted motion from the virtual environment, just as they would in the real environment. The space entertainment system integrates the dynamics of the motion simulator and the virtual environment and the operator maneuvers a steering wheel to interact with the system. The multiple bilateral control schemes employ a dynamical controller, which is designed by considering the velocity and acceleration that the operator imposes on the joystick, the environmental changes imposed on the motion simulator. In addition, we develop a calculated method to evaluate the Ratio of the simulation results. It is shown that the proposed control scheme can improve the performance of the visual entertainment system. Experiments are conducted on the virtual reality entertainment system to validate the theoretical developments.", "paper_title": "Design and Analysis of an Interactive Motion Simulator in Space Entertainment System", "paper_id": "WOS:000300519400025"}
