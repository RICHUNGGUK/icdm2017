However, color segmentation suffers from color variations incurred by irregular illumination changes. We propose a reliable color modeling approach in hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color space while considering intensity information by adopting the B-spline curve fitting to make a mathematical model for statistical characteristics of a color with respect to intensity. It is based on the fact that color distribution of a single-colored object is not invariant with respect to brightness variations even in the HS (hue-saturation) plane. The statistical characteristics contain the mean and standard deviation of hue and saturation with respect to intensity. They are mathematically expressed as four bar graphs. In order to fit the bar graphs to continuous curves, we use B-spline curve fitting procedure. From several experimental results, we verify that the proposed algorithm is successfully applied to color segmentation under various illumination conditions. (C) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.
