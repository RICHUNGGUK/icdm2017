We show that these constraints lead to a closed set of equations that allow recovery of the full geometric structure from a single image of the surface and knowledge of its undeformed shape. We show that these partial differential equations can be reduced to the Hopf equation that arises in non-linear wave propagation, and deformations of the paper can be interpreted in terms of the characteristics of this equation. A new exact integration of these equations is developed that relates the 3-D structure of the applicable surface to an image. The solution is tested by comparison with particular exact Solutions. We present results for both the forward and the inverse 3D structure recovery problem.", "paper_title": "3D structure recovery and unwarping of surfaces applicable to planes", "paper_id": "WOS:000236475400003"}
