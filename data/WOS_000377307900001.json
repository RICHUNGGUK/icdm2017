By exploiting the block sparsity of channel matrix and channel reciprocity in TDD mode, the auxiliary information based block subspace pursuit (ABSP) algorithm is proposed to recover the downlink channels, where the path delays acquired from uplink training is utilized as the auxiliary information. Unlike traditional approaches where the channel estimation overhead is proportional to the number of BS antennas, the proposed approach could provide an accurate channel estimation approaching the performance bound while reduce the pilot overhead by nearly one-third.", "paper_title": "Efficient Downlink Channel Estimation Scheme Based on Block-Structured Compressive Sensing for TDD Massive MU-MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900001"}
