By choosing proper variable transformation, the inertial BAM neural networks can be rewritten as first-order differential equations. Based on the Lyapunov functional method and the comparison principle, we derive some sufficient conditions guaranteeing the exponential stability of the neural networks under impulsive control. For different equilibrium point, the different impulsive controller can be obtained. Moreover, less conservatism impulsive controller will be designed to stabilize the zero equilibrium point. Simulation results finally demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
