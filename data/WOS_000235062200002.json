Using a characterization of the subdifferential of the perspective function, we derive \"perspective cuts\", a family of valid inequalities for the problem. Perspective cuts can be shown to belong to the general family of disjunctive cuts, but they do not require the solution of a potentially costly nonlinear programming problem to be separated. Using perspective cuts substantially improves the performance of Branch & Cut approaches for at least two models that, either \"naturally\" or after a proper reformulation, have the required structure: the Unit Commitment problem in electrical power production and the Mean-Variance problem in portfolio optimization.", "paper_title": "Perspective cuts for a class of convex 0-1 mixed integer programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235062200002"}
