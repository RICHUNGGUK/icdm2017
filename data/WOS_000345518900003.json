A novel estimation algorithm based on historical data and the output of low-order approximation models for virtual un-modeled dynamics is presented. In particular, the virtual un-modeled dynamics are decomposed into known and unknown parts, where only the unknown part is to be estimated. The method effectively avoids the need to use the unknown control input directly, and enables the estimation of the un-modeled dynamics with a relatively simple algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed algorithm overcomes the difficulty in obtaining the control solutions caused by the fact that the controller input is embedded in un-modeled dynamics. Finally, simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A Novel Estimation Algorithm Based on Data and Low-Order Models for Virtual Unmodeled Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000345518900003"}
