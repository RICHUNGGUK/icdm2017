Like many other machine learning algorithms, XCS is less effective on high-dimensional data sets. In this paper, we describe a new guided rule discovery mechanisms for XCS, inspired by feature selection techniques commonly used in machine learning. In our approach, feature quality information is used to bias the evolutionary operators. A comprehensive set of experiments is used to investigate how the number of features used to bias the evolutionary operators, population size, and feature ranking technique, affect model performance. Numerical simulations have shown that our guided rule discovery mechanism improves the performance of XCS in terms of accuracy, execution time and more generally in terms of classifier diversity in the population, especially for high-dimensional classification problems. We present a detailed discussion of the effects of model parameters and recommend settings for large scale problems.", "paper_title": "An enhanced XCS rule discovery module using feature ranking", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204100001"}
