The input data represents the measured values of magnetic flux density within the centre of the excitation coil. Design/methodology/approach - The position of a crack can be determined by taking into consideration any change in the magnetic flux density between the measured points. The depth and width are determined through the use of a finite element model. Findings - These calculations are the basis for determining a function that explains how magnetic flux density changes if the depth or width has changed. Jacobi's matrix is calculated using the determined functions' analytical derivatives. Originality/value - After wards, through the Newton-Raphson iterative procedure using the finite element method calculation results, the crack-depth and width can be obtained, this being one of the objectives in this paper. The suitability of the presented method was verified by the experimental example.", "paper_title": "Finding a crack's position and its parameters on the basis of non-destructive testing, using eddy currents", "paper_id": "WOS:000346109600011"}
