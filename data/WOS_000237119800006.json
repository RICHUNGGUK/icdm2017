We also study thick unions of lines and Minkowski sums, which are inflated with a small disc. Let b = D/epsilon be the ratio of the diameter of the region of interest and the maximum distance (or error) of the approximation. An approximate union of lines or Minkowski sum has complexity Theta(b(2)) in the worst case. The thick union of n lines has complexity Omega(n + b(2)) and O(n + b root bn), and thick Minkowski sums have complexity Omega(n(2) + b(2)) and O((n + b) n root b log n + n2 log n) in the worst case. We present algorithms that run in O(n + n(2/3+delta)b(4/3)) and O(min(bn, n(4/3+delta)b(2/3))) time (any delta > 0) for approximate and thick arrangements. For approximate Minkowski sums, the running time is O(min(b(2)n, n(2) + b(2) + (nb)(4/3+delta))); thick Minkowski sums take O(n(8/3+delta)b(2/3)) time to compute.", "paper_title": "Approximate unions of lines and Minkowski sums", "paper_id": "WOS:000237119800006"}
