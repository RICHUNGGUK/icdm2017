The total outer-connected domination number gamma (toc) (G) is the minimum size of such a set. We give some properties and bounds for gamma (toc) in general graphs and in trees. For graphs of order n, diameter 2 and minimum degree at least 3, we show that and we determine the extremal graphs.", "paper_title": "On the total outer-connected domination in graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000332006100003"}
