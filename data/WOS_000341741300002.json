When an existing system is being modeled and tested, there are various techniques to automate the process of producing the models based on the implementation. Some approaches aim to fully automated creation of the models, while others aim to automate the first steps to create an initial model to serve as a basis to start the manual modeling process. Especially graphical user interface (GUI) applications, including mobile and Web applications, have been a good domain for model extraction, reverse engineering, and specification mining approaches. In this chapter, we survey various automated modeling techniques, with a special focus on GUI models and their usefulness in analyzing and testing of the modeled GUI applications.", "paper_title": "Automated Extraction of GUI Models for Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341741300002"}
