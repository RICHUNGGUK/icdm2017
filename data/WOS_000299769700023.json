Present calculations show that the complexes possessing Au-NH2 anchoring bond are found to be energetically favored. The results of NBO and frontier molecular orbitals analysis indicate that for the complex with anchoring bonds, lone pair electrons of sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms are transferred to the antibonding orbitals of gold, while for the complex with the nonconventional hydrogen bonds (Au center dot center dot center dot H-O), the lone pair electrons of gold are transferred to the antibonding orbitals of O-H bonds during the interaction. Furthermore, the interaction energy calculations show that the complexes with Au-NH2 anchoring bond have relatively high intermolecular interaction energy, which is consistent with previous computational studies.", "paper_title": "Intermolecular interactions between gold clusters and selected amino acids cysteine and glycine: a DFT study", "paper_id": "WOS:000299769700023"}
