However, the detailed mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not entirely clear. In the present study, based on an ion-channel model described mainly in the form of Hodgkin-Huxley equations, possible mechanisms of the short-term synaptic modification are investigated. The simulation results suggest that: (1) the auto-enhancement effect might be induced by the Ca2+-dependent process on the post-synaptic AMPA receptors, which could lead to changes of the ionic channel's properties; (2) the asymmetric response to red- and green-flashes and the mutual-chromatic suppression effects might be attributed to the regulatory effects on the presynaptic glutamate release.", "paper_title": "Modeling the pre- and post-synaptic components involved in the synaptic modification between cones and horizontal cells in carp retina", "paper_id": "WOS:000244684800006"}
