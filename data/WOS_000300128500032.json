At tree-level, only one neutrino acquires a mass, in contradiction with neutrino oscillation data. Here, we describe an extension to the SOFTSUSY program which includes one-loop R-parity violating effects' contributions to neutrino masses and mixing. Including the one-loop effects refines the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking calculation, and may result in up to three massive, mixed neutrinos. This paper serves as a manual to the neutrino mass prediction mode of the program, detailing the approximations and conventions used.

Phys. Comm. 181. (2010) 232 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Calculation of neutrino masses and the neutrino mixing matrix at one-loop level in the R-parity violating minimal supersymmetric standard model. The solution to the renormalisation group equations must be consistent with a high or weak-scale boundary condition on supersymmetry breaking parameters and R-parity violating parameters, as well as a weak-scale boundary condition on gauge couplings, Yukawa couplings and the Higgs potential parameters. Solution method: Nested iterative algorithm. Reasons for new version: Added functionality (computation of all three neutrino masses and their mixings) and bug-fixes. Summary of revisions: Additional error flags for which particle has become tachyonic. Allowing tanb(MX) boundary condition. New SOFTSUSY Block 7 allows the user to change the number of loops in calculating Higgs mass and electroweak symmetry breaking calculation to be 1 or 2. mGMSB fine tuning fixed: thanks to Matthias Hamer for pointing out the bug. RPV SUSY couplings now able to be set at MZ as well as at SUSY breaking scale. Default output format from softpoint.x is SLHA. Fixed third-family mixing contribution to gluino mass. MIXING = -1 now banned. Small bug-fix in charged Higgs loop calculation, in gaugino contribution. Now respects Z2 (U1R-PQ) flip exactly due to bug-fixes in gluino mass. Gravitino default mass changed to Planck scale. Added one-loop RPV loop corrections to neutrino masses allows computation of neutrino oscillation parameters. Restrictions: SOFTSUSY will provide a solution only in the perturbative regime and it assumes that all couplings of the MSSM are real (i.e. CP-conserving). Running time: A second per parameter point.
