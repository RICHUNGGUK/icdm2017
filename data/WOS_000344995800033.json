At the same time, the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs) provides more information and enables wide-area monitoring with accurate timing. One of the challenges in the near future is converting the high quantity and quality of information provided by PMUs into useful knowledge about operational state of a global system. The use of real-time simulation in closed loop is essential to develop and validate new real-time applications of wide-area PMU data. This paper presents a simulation platform developed within the research project Secure Operation of Sustainable Power Systems (SOSPO). The SOSPO simulation platform (SOSPO-SP) functions in a closed loop integrating new real-time assessment methods to provide useful information to operators in power system control centers, and to develop new control methodologies that handle emergency situations and avoid power system blackouts.
