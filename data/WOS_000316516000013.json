As a result, there only exists a partial fit with the traditional requirements for compliance checking and risk management. This paper proposes a comprehensive rule-based process mining approach for a timely investigation of a complete set of enriched process event data. Additionally, the contribution elaborates a two-dimensional business rule taxonomy that serves as a source of business rules for the comprehensive rule-based compliance checking approach. Finally, the study provides a formal grounding for and an evaluation of the comprehensive rule-based compliance checking approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
