In this new scenario, contact with colleagues and discovery of opportunities for interaction and collaboration, previously easy due to physical proximity, becomes harder. In this paper, we describe an agent-based framework to assist users in finding opportunities for interaction that may have been overlooked. While many similar approaches have been proposed to provide \"matchmaking\" services, they rely on historic data and bring users together based on interests. In our approach, we utilize ongoing work context to produce matches that fit each user's needs. In this way, we aim to provide awareness information about other users current work, enabling individuals to become aware of what is happening in the surrounding environment.", "paper_title": "Using agents to detect opportunities for collaboration", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800025"}
