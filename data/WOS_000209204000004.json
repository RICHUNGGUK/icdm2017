For the SVM, we reveal that the classical SVM with Gaussian density kernel attempts to find a noisy GKDE based Bayesian classifier with equal prior probabilities for each class. For the SVR, the classification based epsilon-SVR attempts to obtain two noisy GKDEs for each class in the constructed binary classification dataset, and the decision boundary just corresponds to the mapping function of the original regression problem. For the MEB or SVDD, we reveal the equivalence between it and the integrated-squared-errors (ISE) criterion based GKDE and by using this equivalence a MEB based classifier with privacy-preserving function is proposed for one kind of classification tasks where the datasets contain privacy-preserving clouds. For the FS, we show that the GKDE for a regression dataset is equivalent to the construction of a zero-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system based on the same dataset. Our extensive experiments confirm the obtained conclusions and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed new machine learning and modeling methods.", "paper_title": "From Gaussian kernel density estimation to kernel methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204000004"}
