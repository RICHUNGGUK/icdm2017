Femtocells are short-range, low-power and low-cost cellular stations which are installed by the consumers in an unplanned manner. Even though current literature includes various studies towards understanding the main challenges of interference management in the presence of femtocells, little light has been shed on the open issues of mobility management (MM) in the two-tier macrocell-femtocell network. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive discussion on the key aspects and research challenges of MM support in the presence of femtocells, with the emphasis given on the phases of a) cell identification, b) access control, c) cell search, d) cell selection/reselection, e) handover (HO) decision, and f) HO execution. A detailed overview of the respective MM procedures in the LTE-A system is also provided to better comprehend the solutions and open issues posed in real-life systems. Based on the discussion for the HO decision phase, we subsequently survey and classify existing HO decision algorithms for the two-tier macrocell-femtocell network, depending on the primary HO decision criterion used. For each class, we overview up to three representative algorithms and provide detailed flowcharts to describe their fundamental operation. A comparative summary of the main decision parameters and key features of selected HO decision algorithms concludes this work, providing insights for future algorithmic design and standardization activities.", "paper_title": "Mobility Management for Femtocells in LTE-Advanced: Key Aspects and Survey of Handover Decision Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000338700300005"}
