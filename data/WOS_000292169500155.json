We study the desirable properties of the IGCOWA operator and describe families of IGCOWA operator according to the special weighting vector and generalized mean parameter. Particularly, we present the consistency induced generalized continuous ordered weighted averaging (C-IGCOWA) operator, in which the consistency indicator is the induced ordering variable to reflect the importance of interval fuzzy preference relation. Finally, the C-IGCOWA operator is applied to group decision making with interval fuzzy preference relations in a numerical example. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
