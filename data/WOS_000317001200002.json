While arrays of TSVs are needed in 3-D IC, there only exists a frequency-dependent resistance, inductance, conductance and capacitance circuit model for a pair of TSVs with coupling between them. In this paper, we develop a simple yet accurate circuit model for a multiport TSV network (e.g., coupled TSV array) by decomposing the network into a number of TSV pairs and then applying circuit models for each of them. We call the new model a pair-based model for the multiport TSV network. It is first verified against a commercial electromagnetic solver for up to 20 GHz and subsequently employed for a variety of examples for signal and power integrity analysis.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Application of Multi-Port TSV Networks in 3-D IC", "paper_id": "WOS:000317001200002"}
