To face incompleteness, frameworks for speculative computation were proposed (see references (5, 6, 7]). The idea developed in such frameworks is to allow the asking agent, while waiting for the slave agents to reply, to reason using default beliefs until replies are sent. In particular, K. Satoh and K. Yamamoto [7] proposed a framework that allows an agent not only to perform speculative computation, but also to accept iterative answer revision for yes/no questions. In this paper, we present an extension of the framework for more general types of questions using constraint logic programming (CLP).", "paper_title": "Speculative constraint processing with iterative revision for disjunctive answers", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506800019"}
