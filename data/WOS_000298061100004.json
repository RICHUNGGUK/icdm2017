However, traditional manually establish a military scenario is a time-consuming and costly task. This study addresses the issue developing a private cloud PaaS, Semantic-based Military Mission Planning platform (called SMMP platform), which is developed using Semantic Web technologies and can be combined with existing cloud service models, SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS to facilitate military scenario development. To illustrate the SMMP platform applications, the study shows how military commander can be assisted to automatically generate a military mission plan with MSDL document.", "paper_title": "An Intelligent Military Scenario Development Platform Based on Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000298061100004"}
