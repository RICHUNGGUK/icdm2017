Two types of special mixture descriptors based on SiRMS and ISIDA approaches were developed. SiRMS-based fragment descriptors involve atoms belonging to both components of the mixture, whereas the ISIDA fragments belong only to one of these components. The models were built on the data set containing the phase diagrams for 167 mixtures represented by different combinations of 67 pure liquids. Consensus models were developed using nonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Associative Neural Networks (ASNN), and Random Forest (RF) approaches. For SVM and ASNN calculations, the ISIDA fragment descriptors were used, whereas Simplex descriptors were employed in RF models. The models have been validated using three different protocols: Points out, Mixtures out and Compounds out, based on the specific rules to form training/test sets in each fold of cross-validation. A final validation of the models has been performed on an additional set of 94 mixtures represented by combinations of novel 34 compounds and modeling set chemicals with each other. The root mean squared error of predictions for new mixtures of already known liquids does not exceed 5.7 K, which outperforms COSMO-RS models. Developed QSAR methodology can be applied to the modeling of any nonadditive property of binary mixtures (antiviral activities, drug formulation, etc.)", "paper_title": "QSPR Approach to Predict Nonadditive Properties of Mixtures.
