With the help of Lyapunov function, stochastic analysis technique, generalized Halanay inequality and Hardy inequality, some novel sufficient conditions on the pth moment exponential stability of the considered system are derived. The results obtained in this paper are completely new and complement and improve some of the previously known results (Liao and Mao, Stoch Anal Appl, 14:165-185, 1996; Wan and Sun, Phys Lett A, 343:306-318, 2005; Hu et al., Chao Solitions Fractals, 27:1006-1010, 2006; Sun and Cao, Nonlinear Anal Real, 8:1171-1185, 2007; Huang et al., Inf Sci, 178:2194-2203, 2008; Wang et al., Phys Lett A, 356:346-352, 2006; Peng and Liu, Neural Comput Appl, 20:543-547, 2011). Moreover, a numerical example is also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "pth Moment Exponential Stability of Stochastic Recurrent Neural Networks with Markovian Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000327089800011"}
