This paper considers capacity problems of OSTBCs over spatially correlated multiple-input single-out (MISO) Rayleigh fading channels in the presence of spatially correlated Rayleigh co-channel interference and additive Gaussian noise, and derives exact expressions of the ergodic capacity and outage probability (capacity distribution) for such OSTBCs. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the effect of co-channel interference on the ergodic and outage capacity of OSTBCs.", "paper_title": "Capacity of orthogonal space-time block codes in MISO fading channels with co-channel interference and noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000269899800016"}
