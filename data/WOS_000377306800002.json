It is theoretically proven that the proposed distributed algorithm strictly converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the problem. Significant performance enhancement is observed by numerical results with fast convergence. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed algorithm degrades gracefully when decreasing overhead of information exchange.", "paper_title": "Weighted Sum Energy Efficiency Maximization in Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800002"}
