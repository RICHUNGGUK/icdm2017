Numerical simulations were carried out for different flow conditions, giving rise to results on the behavior of bubble velocity, void fraction, bubble generation frequency and length. Numerical results are compared with existing experimental data thanks to non-dimensional analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
