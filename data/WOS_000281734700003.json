This confusion is not just widespread in practice, but it exists even in the latest requirements engineering research and theory, leading to a number of negative consequences. In this article, we discuss these negative consequences, and present a solution based on a strict distinction between requirements per se and requirements representations. We elaborate on this distinction and classify different forms of representations in a unified requirements representations ontology, including a refinement of descriptive and model-based requirements representations.", "paper_title": "On confusion between requirements and their representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000281734700003"}
