In this paper we focus on service-based applications and we propose an adaptation framework that can be used to reduce power consumption according to the observed workload. The adaptation guarantees a trade-off between energy consumption and system performance. The approach is based on the principle of proportional energy consumption obtained by scaling down energy for unused resources, considering both the number of servers switched on and their operating frequencies. Stochastic Petri nets are proposed for the modeling of the framework concerns, their analyses give results about the trade-offs. The application of the approach to a simple case study shows its usefulness and practical applicability. Finally, different types of workloads are analyzed with validation purposes.
