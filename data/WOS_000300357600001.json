However, inadequate research efforts in the analog domain are holding back the exploitation of advanced technologies. A dearth of design expertise in the analog domain is the principal driving force for the growth of Design Automation (DA) tools. Transistor sizing is one of the most crucial steps in the analog IC design. In this paper, we put forward a new computer aided design framework for the sizing of transistors in MOS Integrated Circuit (IC) amplifiers by incorporating powerful modeling capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ANNs have proven to be efficient and accurate modeling tools in several applications. The proposed tool is capable of directly computing transistor related design parameters, of the MOS IC amplifier and associated peripheral circuitry. The proposed tool thus avoids several time-consuming simulations and/or tuning runs at the very bottom level of analog IC amplifier implementation, using a given CMOS process. It also reduces manual intervention in the design process, thus enhancing the automation of the design process. This paper presents design examples of several analog IC functional modules that are developed and verified successfully.", "paper_title": "A new approach to sizing analog CMOS building blocks using pre-compiled neural network models", "paper_id": "WOS:000300357600001"}
