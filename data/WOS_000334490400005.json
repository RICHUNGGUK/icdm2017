For such network that presumably operates under the LTE cellular network, our aim is to improve the overall throughput of D2D connections using opportunistic or fairness-based approach. Taking the practical considerations into account, our proposed framework allows a number of connections to share a single RB whenever possible, thus utilizing the radio resources. To do so, our solution first identifies a superior set of the interference-free D2D reuse groups via graph modeling and graph coloring approach. In particular, we model a D2D network with a two-overlapping disk graph for which a suitable coloring algorithm is proposed and its performance bound is calculated. Once the reuse groups are known, our solution optimizes the RB allocation among these groups based on their reported channel condition as well as the scheduling criterion, whether it is fairness-based or opportunistic. Through numerical experiments, we show that our solution can significantly improve the throughput performance of a D2D network.", "paper_title": "Efficient and practical resource block allocation for LTE-based D2D network via graph coloring", "paper_id": "WOS:000334490400005"}
