In order to predict the most efficient siRNAs, a new software tool, RNA Workbench (RNAWB), has been designed and is freely available (after registration) on http://www.rnaworkbench.com. In addition to the standard selection rules, RNAWB includes the possibility of statistical analyses of the applied selection rules (criteria). The role of RNA secondary structures in the RNA interference process as well as the application of sequence rules are discussed to show the applicability of the software.
