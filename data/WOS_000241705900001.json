Java programs are compiled into Java Bytecodes, which are executed in the Java virtual machine. Among the current hardware or software solutions to the Java virtual machine, the object-oriented related Bytecodes are implemented by software traps or microcode, and their performance does not match well with the essential requirements of memory-constraint embedded devices, such as real-time operations and low power consumptions. In this paper, a novel Java processor named jHISC is proposed, which mainly targets Java applications in the small embedded devices. In jHISC, 94% of Bytecodes and 83% of the object-oriented related Bytecodes are implemented by hardware directly. Compared with PicoJava II and JOP, jHISC speeds up the overall performance about 30% and 183%, respectively. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
