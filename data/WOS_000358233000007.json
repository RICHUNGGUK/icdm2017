Users upload video for specific reasons, but rarely state these reasons explicitly in the video metadata. Information about the reasons motivating uploaders has the potential ultimately to benefit a wide range of application areas, including video production, video-based advertising, and video search. In this paper, we apply a combination of social-Web mining and crowdsourcing to arrive at a typology that characterizes the uploader intent of a broad range of videos. We then use a set of multimodal features, including visual semantic features, found to be indicative of uploader intent in order to classify videos automatically into uploader intent classes. We evaluate our approach on a dataset containing ca. 3K crowdsourcing-annotated videos and demonstrate its usefulness in prediction tasks relevant to common application areas.", "paper_title": "Uploader Intent for Online Video: Typology, Inference, and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000358233000007"}
