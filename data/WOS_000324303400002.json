In this paper, we present a passive sensing framework for identifying trends via Twitter. In our framework, we use a multi-dimensional corpus for fine-granularity sensing of trends, and employ both vector-space and set-space methods for achieving accuracy. We present two applications of our framework. The first one is sensing trends in public opinion by using an emotion-category corpus. The second application is sensing trends in location-types in a city by using a location-category corpus. Our experiments show that the proposed methods are able to determine changes in trends effectively in both application scenarios.", "paper_title": "Trend sensing via Twitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000324303400002"}
