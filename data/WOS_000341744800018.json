On the other hand these solutions confine them with such fixed infrastructures without having any control to reorganize or include further hardware if required. Controlling the infrastructure may help localization, especially indoors where the presence of multipath is high. A dense population of infrastructure nodes placing in all required indoors may capture a precise view of the surveyed area while generating a radio map of the fingerprinting or profiling based localization. The larger the number of infrastructure nodes the higher the cost. Indeed dense node population may introduce high interference. Can we then use low-cost low-power infrastructure nodes to achieve the (1) high density, (2) low cost, (3) minimal interference in addition to have the deployment flexibility? We were curious to know the answer and designed LEMON, an indoor localization system. Extensive experiments show that in addition to have the above characteristics, LEMON also ensures good accuracy. Thus it can be a solution to locate a person (e.g., a security guard in a warehouse) or an object (e.g., equipments) indoors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
