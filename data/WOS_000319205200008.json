In this approach Harmony Search is augmented by a probability mass function which utilizes two concepts borrowed from Ant Colony Optimization algorithm: pheromone and heuristic values. The former is a dynamic weight factor assigned to each solution component and the latter is a constant one defined based on modal analysis of the structural system. Provided numerical examples show that this hybrid search scheme improves the convergence rate such that the algorithm finds qualified solutions in fewer number of iterations. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
