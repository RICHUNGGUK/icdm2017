This paper tackles the problem of creating 3D models of animals from a single, side-view sketch. We use the a priori assumptions of smoothness and structural symmetry of the animal about the sagittal plane to inform the 3D reconstruction. Our contributions include methods for identifying and inferring the contours of shape parts from the input sketch, a method for identifying the hierarchy of these structural parts including the detection of approximate symmetric pairs, and a hierarchical algorithm for positioning and blending these parts into a consistent 3D implicit-surface-based model. We validate this pipeline by showing that a number of plausible animal shapes can be automatically constructed from a single sketch. [GRAPHICS] (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
