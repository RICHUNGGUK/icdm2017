This is due to the complexity of physical quantities appearing in the LL equation. This complexity causes also interesting mathematical properties of the LL equation: nonlocal character for some quantities, nonconvex side-constraints, strongly nonlinear terms. These effects influence also numerical approximations. In this work, recent developments on the approximation of weak solutions, together with the overview of well-known methods for strong solutions, are addressed.", "paper_title": "A survey on the numerics and computations for the Landau-Lifshitz equation of micromagnetism", "paper_id": "WOS:000258084900002"}
