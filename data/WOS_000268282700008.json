Method of characteristics (MoC) is widely used for macromodeling of transmission lines, however, it may not be guaranteed passive. This paper presents a new algorithm for passivity enforcement of MoC-based macromodels of multiconductor transmission lines. The algorithm is based on the first-order perturbation of the related delay differential equations and can handle single as well as coupled interconnects. Necessary theoretical foundations and validating numerical results are presented.", "paper_title": "Passivity Compensation Algorithm for Method-of-Characteristics-Based Multiconductor Transmission Line Interconnect Macromodels", "paper_id": "WOS:000268282700008"}
