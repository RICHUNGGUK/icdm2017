In this regard, the increasing appearance of PEVs can create new challenges in the optimal operation of these devices. In this way, this paper suggests a new method for optimal coordination of PEVs for reducing the total cost of the system during the day. The proposed method makes use of the idea of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) for shifting the energy demand in the grid. The problem is then formulated in an intelligent framework based on bat algorithm (BA) and Monte Carlo method to be solved optimally. Meanwhile, we suggest a new modification method for BA to improve its search ability for optimal coordination of PEVs. The proposed problem is examined on the IEEE test system with five PEV fleets.", "paper_title": "A new intelligent method for optimal coordination of vehicle-to-grid plug-in electric vehicles in power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000349834500029"}
