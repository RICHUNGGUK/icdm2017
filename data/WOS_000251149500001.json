This algorithm does not require any special information on each local point of a line. The thickness is determined by curvature and lengths from both ends. Therefore the algorithm is applicable in a variety of line rendering situations, such as 3D rendering engines for high quality cel-animation-like effects, reuse of geometrical data designed by CAD for advertising purposes, edge enhancement in a photo retouching process with edge detection methods and so on. In addition, using the generated varying thicknesses, we have developed algorithms for shading and embossing effects.", "paper_title": "Curvature-based stroke rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000251149500001"}
