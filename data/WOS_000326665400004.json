Due to the concurrency and synchronisation characteristics of some applications, analytical modelling is helpful for planning and predicting the quality-of-service (QoS) measures of the composite services. This study proposes an optimisation method adapted from the greedy randomised adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and integrated with analytical model solving to find service providers, which will leverage the performance and reliability of a composite web service. The proposed approach finds solutions close to the best-known configurations and is computationally efficient, enabling the fast discovery of a high-quality assignment of providers even for large scenarios with thousands of possible combinations.", "paper_title": "QoS-driven optimisation of composite web services: an approach based on GRASP and analytical models", "paper_id": "WOS:000326665400004"}
