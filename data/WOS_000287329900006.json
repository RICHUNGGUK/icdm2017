Evaluation measures have been introduced to measure the effectiveness of systems at this task, but these measures have worst-case NP-hard computation time. The primary consequence of this is that there is no ranking principle akin to the Probability Ranking Principle for document relevance that provides uniform instruction on how to rank documents for novelty and diversity. We use simulation to investigate the practical implications of this for optimization and evaluation of retrieval systems.", "paper_title": "An analysis of NP-completeness in novelty and diversity ranking", "paper_id": "WOS:000287329900006"}
