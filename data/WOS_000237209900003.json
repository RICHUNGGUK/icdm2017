The initial image is lifted by the simple cells to a surface in the rototranslation group and the completion process is modeled via a diffusion driven motion by curvature. The convergence of the motion to a minimal surface is proved. Results are presented both for modal and amodal completion in classic Kanizsa images.", "paper_title": "A cortical based model of perceptual completion in the roto-translation space", "paper_id": "WOS:000237209900003"}
