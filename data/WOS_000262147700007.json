One popular approach to this problem is the cross-coupled controller (CCC). By exploiting the structure of CCC, in integrated control scheme is developed in this paper and an in-depth investigation on the issue of contour error reduction is also conducted. The proposed motion control scheme consists of a feedback controller. a feedforward controller, and a modified contour error controller (CCC equipped with a real-time contour error estimator). In addition, a fuzzy logic-based feedrate regulator is proposed to further reduce the Contour error. The proposed feedrate regulator is designed based on the real-time estimated Contour error and the Curvature Of the free-form parametric curves for machining. Several experiments arc conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
