Notably, Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks have emerged as two effective paradigms for delivering multimedia contents over the Internet. One salient feature shared between these two networks is the inherent support for path diversity streaming where a receiver receives multiple streams simultaneously on different network paths as a result of having multiple senders. In this paper, we propose a network coding framework for efficient video streaming in CDNs and P2P networks in which, multiple servers/peers are employed to simultaneously stream a video to a single receiver. We show that network coding techniques can (a) eliminate the need for tight synchronization between the senders, (b) be integrated easily with TCP, and (c) reduce server's storage in CDN settings. Importantly, we propose the Hierarchical Network Coding (HNC) technique to be used with scalable video bit stream to combat bandwidth fluctuation on the Internet. Simulations demonstrate that under certain scenarios, our proposed network coding techniques can result in bandwidth saving up to 60% over the traditional schemes.", "paper_title": "Video Streaming with Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000276185000008"}
