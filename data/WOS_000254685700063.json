An academic, representative test case is presented with associated analytical solution. The efficiency of the iterative methods is studied in terms of running time when 1-10 eigenpairs are sought for, the computational domain being discretized with 500-32000-node finite element meshes. The sensitivity of the methods to the dimension of the search subspace is also investigated.
