Based on the reduced state sequence detection (RSSD), it has the more general form compared with other reduced state SISO algorithms. The proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the state number, thus leads to the computation complexity reduction. It also minimizes the degradation in Euclidean distance with decision feedback in the reduced state trellis. Analysis and simulation results show that the performance degradation is little with proper reduction scheme.", "paper_title": "A reduced state SISO iterative decoding algorithm for serially concatenated continuous phase modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000249266300002"}
