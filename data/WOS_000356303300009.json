Two cost functions are constructed from the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix and its principal submatrices or at specially selected frequencies involving the values S-11 and S-21. The values of non-zero elements of the coupling matrix are found using solvopt and fmincon to minimize the cost functions. With the initial coupling matrix synthesized in a tridiagonal form by solving the Jacobi inverse eigenvalue problem, the proposed method provides fast convergence and good accuracy to find the final solution. In addition, as the hybrid method may be run from random initial variables whose values lie within specified limits, it has the potential to be used for series of coupling matrix synthesis problems. For demonstrating the proposed hybrid optimization algorithm, some extraordinary prototype topologies have been synthesized to validate the proposed synthesis procedure.
