Despite the success, the computation involved in the evaluation of the fitness function is substantial. To overcome this problem, a new formulation on the fitness evaluation targeted for graphics processing unit (GPU) has been developed and presented in this paper. Experimental results reveal that the proposed solution is capable of reducing the matching time while maintaining high success rates.", "paper_title": "A Graphics Processing Unit Accelerated Genetic Algorithm for Affine Invariant Matching of Broken Contours", "paper_id": "WOS:000299531400004"}
