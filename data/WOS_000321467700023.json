The scheme of cooperative communication using this empty sub-channel has been studied. But, because each user wastes the time slots in the cooperation phase, it is difficult to achieve the full rate. In this letter, a new cooperative communication scheme based on OFDMA is proposed to improve transmission rate in Rayleigh fading channel.", "paper_title": "An Improved Transmission Rate in Cooperative Communication Based on OFDMA System", "paper_id": "WOS:000321467700023"}
