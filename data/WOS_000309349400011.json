Based on the analysis results, we group every two neighboring antennas in multiple femto-CoMP configurations and proposed a new network configuration scheme that uses antenna scheduling to simultaneously improve spectral and energy efficiency. Compared with standalone femtocells, the proposed scheme is shown in a typical office building to increase energy efficiency by 64 % similar to 160 % and spectral efficiency by 2 % similar to 36 %. Compared with our previous BWA-FMDA configurations, the new scheme is able to improve energy efficiency by 6 % similar to 68 % and spectral efficiency by 15 % similar to 55 %. The exact gain depends on network configurations and transmission power levels.", "paper_title": "Energy Conservation via Antenna Scheduling in Fiber-Connected Femto Base Stations", "paper_id": "WOS:000309349400011"}
