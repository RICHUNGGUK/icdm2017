This Metaphor helps us in considering social, behavioral and existential elements related to the adoption process, offering a critical and dialectical view of it. In this paper, we review the philosophical and methodological basis of this Metaphor and its main statements. We also apply it in analyzing a case of mobile ICT adoption. The application of the Hospitality Metaphor enables a clear understanding of this process as an incremental and open one in which social, existential and 'mundane' issues play a major role, and where technology reveals its dubious character, leading to unplanned results.", "paper_title": "The Hospitality Metaphor as a theoretical lens for understanding the ICT adoption process", "paper_id": "WOS:000240243700004"}
