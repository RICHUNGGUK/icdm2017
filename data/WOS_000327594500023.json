In order to remove the loss C - C-S, we propose a multiplex coding scheme with plural independent messages. In this paper, it is shown that the proposed multiplex coding scheme can attain the channel capacity as the total rate of the plural messages and the perfect secrecy for each massage. Several bounds of achievable multiplex coding rate region are derived for general wiretap channels in the sense of information-spectral methods, by extending Hayashi's proof, in which the coding of the channel resolvability is applied to wiretap channels. Furthermore, the exact region for deterministic coding is determined for stationary memoryless full-rank wiretap channels.", "paper_title": "Secure Multiplex Coding Attaining Channel Capacity in Wiretap Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000327594500023"}
