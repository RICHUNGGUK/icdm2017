Nevertheless, it becomes challenging to estimate age from uncontrollable environments, with insufficient and incomplete training data, dealing with strong person-specificity and high within-range variance. These difficulties have been recently addressed with complex and strongly hand-crafted descriptors, difficult to replicate and compare. This paper presents two novel approaches: first, a simple yet effective fusion of descriptors based on texture and local appearance; and second, a deep learning scheme for accurate age estimation. These methods have been evaluated under a diversity of settings, and the extensive experiments carried out on two large databases (MORPH and FRGC) demonstrate state-of-the-art results over previous work.
