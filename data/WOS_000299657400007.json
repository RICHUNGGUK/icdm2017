Presently, to get some insight about the detonation velocity, a novel trigonometric model has been suggested first in 2-dimensional form and then extended to 3-dimension. In the 2D-form the detonation velocity is considered to be a function of the total energy and a newly defined \"angle of detonation\", Q, of an explosive molecule. The angle of detonation velocity is also shown to be a nonlinear function of the total energy. In the 3D-form another angle, Phi, affects the detonation velocity. Some regressed equations are obtained. It has been shown that Q, thus the detonation velocity asymptotically approaches to a constant value as the total energy increases in absolute value which has some direct relationship with the molecular weight of an explosive compound. It has been shown that tan Phi values correlate with density of explosives.", "paper_title": "A Trigonometric Approach to a Limiting Law on Detonation Velocity", "paper_id": "WOS:000299657400007"}
