Key schedule of SQUARE is simple and efficient but fully affine, so we apply a related-key attack on it. We find a 3-round related-key differential trail with probability 2(-28), which has zero differences both on its input and output states, which is called local collision in [6]. By extending of this related-key differential, we construct a successful attack on full rounds of SQUARE. In this paper, we present a key recovery attack on full rounds of SQUARE using a related-key boomerang distinguisher. We construct a 7-round related-key boomerang distinguisher with probability 2-(119) by finding local collision, and calculate its probability using ladder switch and multiple path estimation techniques. As a result, one round on top of the distinguisher is added to construct an attack on full rounds of SQUARE which recovers 16-bit key information with 2(123) encryptions and 2(121) data.", "paper_title": "Related-Key Boomerang Attack on Block Cipher SQUARE", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300002"}
