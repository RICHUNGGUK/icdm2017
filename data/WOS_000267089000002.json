It is well known that ICA and BSS depend on the statistical properties of original sources or components, such as non-Gaussianity. In the paper, using a statistical property-nonlinear autocorrelation and maximizing the nonlinear autocorrelation of source signals, we propose a fast fixed-point algorithm for BSS. We study its convergence property and show that its convergence speed is at least quadratic. Simulations by the artificial signals and the real-world applications verify the efficient implementation of the proposed method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
