We report on dedicated R&D project established in cooperation between Wroclaw University of Technology and one of the leading automotive software development companies to research possibilities of introduction of software defect prediction using an open source, extensible software measurement and defect prediction framework called DePress (Defect Prediction in Software Systems) the authors are involved in. In the first stage of the R&D project, we verified what kind of problems can be encountered. This work summarizes results of that phase.", "paper_title": "BOTTLENECKS IN SOFTWARE DEFECT PREDICTION IMPLEMENTATION IN INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000361963100002"}
