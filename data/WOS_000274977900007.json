Every expert having his own formalisms and tools, integration and collaboration of the expert tools has become a challenge to avoid design conflict along the product lifecycle. The synchronisation of heterogeneous representation of product will be a major step to integrate expert activities. In this paper, the authors propose 1) a constraint-based model to maintain complex relationships in multi-disciplinary collaborative design during synchronisation process, 2) a meta-rule concept to control the constraint network in design leading to a new notification mechanism for presenting conflict to all corresponding actors. These results should contribute to the improvement of collaborative design.", "paper_title": "A collaborative platform architecture for coherence management in multi-view integrated product modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000274977900007"}
