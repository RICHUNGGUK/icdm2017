This article proposes two kernel smoothing based approaches for estimation of the VUS. In an extensive simulation study, the proposed estimators are compared with the existing parametric and nonparametric estimators in terms of bias and root mean square error. A real data example of 203 participants from a cohort study for the detection of Glycan biomarkers for liver cancer is discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
