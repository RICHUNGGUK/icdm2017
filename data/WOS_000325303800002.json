Surprisingly, most of the existing feature selection algorithms assume the problems to address are either supervised or unsupervised, while supervised and unsupervised samples are often simultaneously available in real-world applications. Semi-supervised feature selection methods are thus necessary, and many solutions have been proposed recently. However, almost all of them exclusively tackle classification problems. This paper introduces a semi-supervised feature selection algorithm which is specifically designed for regression problems. It relies on the notion of Laplacian score, a quantity recently introduced in the unsupervised framework. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
