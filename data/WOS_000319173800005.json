The standard was developed as part of a pilot in which more than 65 private, public and scientific organisations collaborated to analyse and push 3D developments in the Netherlands (run between March 2010 and June 2011). The 3D standard was established through several steps. First, a comparison between the existing 3D computer-aided design and GIS standards was carried out that selected the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard CityGML as the optimal 3D standard to align to. Second, the equivalent concepts in CityGML and the existing national standard for large-scale topography (Information Model Geography [IMGeo]) were identified. Third, IMGeo was extended to 3D following the principles of CityGML Application Domain Extensions. The model was tested by applying it to real data. Based on the experiences of this pilot, this article proposes a framework of guidelines and principles for extending CityGML for national purposes, deduced from the modelling experiences. This is a unique contribution since experiences on extending CityGML are new and not well described in the OGC CityGML specifications. Finally, this article presents the change requests (CRs) which have been submitted to OGC to make the CityGML standard more suited for integration with existing 2D topographic information models. The CRs were formulated based on experiences from developing this nationwide 3D standard.", "paper_title": "Establishing a national standard for 3D topographic data compliant to CityGML", "paper_id": "WOS:000319173800005"}
