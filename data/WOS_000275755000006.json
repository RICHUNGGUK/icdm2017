Usually, when dealing with categorical data, topological maps use an encoding stage: categorical data are changed into numerical vectors and traditional numerical algorithms (SOM) are run. In the present paper, we propose a novel probabilistic formalism of Kohonen map dedicated to categorical data where neurons are represented by probability tables. We do not need to use any coding to encode variables. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model in four examples using real data. Our experiments show that our model provides a good quality of results when dealing with categorical data.", "paper_title": "Visualization and clustering of categorical data with probabilistic self-organizing map", "paper_id": "WOS:000275755000006"}
