However, the existing method may lead to spatial discontinuities in images because of the absence of a spatial consistency constraint. In this paper, to solve this problem, we present a novel method to force neighboring pixels with similar intensities to have similar color. Using this constraint, the color conceptualization is formalized as an optimization problem with a quadratic cost function. Moreover, we further expand two-dimensional (still image) color conceptualization to three-dimensional (video), and use the information of neighboring pixels in both space and time to improve the consistency between neighboring frames. The performance of our proposed method is demonstrated for a variety of images and video sequences.", "paper_title": "Video color conceptualization using optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000337259300014"}
