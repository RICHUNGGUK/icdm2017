By using the opinion spreading process, the similarity between any users can be obtained. The algorithm has remarkably higher accuracy than the standard collaborative filtering using the Pearson correlation. Furthermore, we introduce a free parameter beta to regulate the contributions of objects to user-user correlations. The numerical results indicate that decreasing the influence of popular objects can further improve the algorithmic accuracy and personality. We argue that a better algorithm should simultaneously require less computation and generate higher accuracy. Accordingly, we further propose an algorithm involving only the top-N similar neighbors for each target user, which has both less computational complexity higher algorithmic accuracy.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING ALGORITHM VIA INFORMATION TRANSFORMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000263880100009"}
