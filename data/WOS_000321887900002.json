BELPR is based on an extended computational model of the human brain limbic system that consists of an emotional stimuli processor. The BELPR is model free and learns the patterns in a supervised manner and evaluates the output(s) using the activation function tansig. In the numerical studies, various comparisons are made between BELPR and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a back-propagation learning algorithm. The methods are tested to classify 12 UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning data sets and to predict activity indices of the Earth's magnetosphere. The main features of BELPR are higher accuracy, decreased time and spatial complexity, and faster training.", "paper_title": "BRAIN EMOTIONAL LEARNING-BASED PATTERN RECOGNIZER", "paper_id": "WOS:000321887900002"}
