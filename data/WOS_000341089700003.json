In particular, we stress the use of bounded stochastic processes as a model of extrinsic random perturbations. In the second part, we propose three examples of molecular circuits under the influence of external fluctuations modeled by means of bounded noises. The first two examples involve the linear decay of a protein with, respectively, large or low number of molecules, so to stress different modeling approaches. The third example concerns the spatio-temporal dynamics of proteins determining the chemotaxis-driven polarization of a cell. In these examples one can observe phenomena that are dependent on the specific class of employed bounded noise.", "paper_title": "Bounded noises as a natural tool to model extrinsic fluctuations in biomolecular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341089700003"}
