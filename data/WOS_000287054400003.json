Numerous studies have been conducted to establish the stress-strain relationships for concrete under various confining reinforcement arrangements. Many empirical and semi-empirical formulas exist. Simplified analytical models have also been proposed to evaluate the increase in the strength and ductility of confined concrete. However, relatively few studies have been conducted to utilise advanced computational models for a realistic simulation of the behaviour of concrete confined by transverse reinforcement. As a matter of fact, high fidelity simulations using the latest numerical solvers in conjunction with advanced material constitutive models can be a powerful means to investigating the mechanisms underlying the confining effects of different reinforcement schemes. This paper presents a study on the use of high fidelity finite element models for the investigation of the behaviour of concrete confined by stirrups, as well as the interpretation of the numerical results. The development of the models is described in detail, and the essential modelling considerations are discussed. The models are then validated by simulating representative experimental studies on short columns with different confining reinforcement schemes. The development and distribution of the confining stress and the subsequent increase in the axial strength are examined. The models are shown to be capable of reproducing the behaviour of the confined concrete realistically, paving a way for systematic parametric studies and investigation into complicated confinement, load combination, and dynamic loading situations.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of concrete confined by transverse reinforcement", "paper_id": "WOS:000287054400003"}
