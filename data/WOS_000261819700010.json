The measure identifies common sub-regions between the images at multiple sizes, and evaluates the amount of deformation required to align the common regions. The scheme allows complex, non-rigid deformation of the images, and penalizes irregular deformations more than coherent shifts of larger sub-parts. The measure is implemented by an algorithm which is a variant of dynamic programming, extended to multi-dimensions, and is using scores measured on a relative scale. The similarity measure is shown to be robust to non-rigid deformations of parts at various positions and scales, and to capture basic characteristics of human similarity judgments.
