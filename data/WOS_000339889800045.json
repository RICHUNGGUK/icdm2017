When embedding watermark, the 24-bits color host image with size of 512 x 512 is divided into non-overlapping 4 x 4 pixel blocks and each pixel block is decomposed by QR. Then, according to the watermark information and the relation between the second row first column coefficient and the third row first column coefficient in the unitary matrix Q, the 24-bits color watermark image with size of 32 x 32 is embedded into the color host image. In addition, the new element compensatory method is used in the upper-triangle matrix R for reducing the visible distortion. When extracting watermark, only the watermarked image is needed. Compared with other SVD-based methods, the proposed method does not have the false-positive detection problem and has lower computational complexity, that is, the average running time of the proposed method only needs 1.481403 s. The experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against most common attacks including JPEG compression, JPEG 2000 compression, low-pass filtering, cropping, adding noise, blurring, rotation, scaling and sharpening et al. Compared with some related existing methods, the proposed algorithm has stronger robustness and better invisibility.", "paper_title": "A blind double color image watermarking algorithm based on QR decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000339889800045"}
