However, verification can be difficult if an analytical solution is not available for the normally complex problem that the numerical model is setting out to address. This article aims to formally verify a Bridgman furnace solidification front tracking model code in a steady state scenario. To do this an order verification procedure is applied using an established analytical solution from the literature. The model is verified as first order accurate in space for steady state Bridgman solidification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
