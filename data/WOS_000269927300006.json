In existing DGS schemes, individual traceability says that any member in the group can reveal the actual signer's identity from a given signature. In this paper, we strengthen the security notions of DGS by taking insider attack against anonymity into account, and present a concrete DGS construction with collective traceability. The idea behind collective traceability is that a sender can first choose (ad-hoc) a set of n members (including himself), and then sign a message by using the public keys of all the members, in such a way that his identity would be recovered, in case of disputes, if and only if all n members collectively cooperate. The security properties of our scheme are formally proved under reasonable assumptions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
