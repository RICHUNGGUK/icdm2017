We present here the first application of a hybrid ensemble docking and steered molecular dynamics scheme (with a minimized computational cost), which achieves a binding affinity rank-ordering of ligands with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.79 and an RMS error of 0.7 kcal/mol. The scheme, termed Flexible Enzyme Receptor Method by Steered Molecular Dynamics (FERM-SMD), is applied to an in-house collection of 17 validated ligands of glutamate racemase. The resulting improved accuracy in affinity prediction allows elucidation of the key structural components of a heretofore unreported glutamate racemase inhibitor (K-i=9 mu M), a promising new lead in the development of antibacterial therapeutics.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Steered Molecular Dynamics-Docking: An Efficient Solution to the Problem of Ranking Inhibitor Affinities Against a Flexible Drug Target", "paper_id": "WOS:000291602600007"}
