By knowing the provenance of data, users can often better understand, trust, reproduce, and validate it. A provenance-aware application has the functionality to answer questions regarding the provenance of the data it produces, by using documentation of past processes. PrIMe is a software engineering technique for adapting application designs to enable them to interact with a provenance middleware layer, thereby making them provenance-aware. In this article, we specify the steps involved in applying PrIMe, analyze its effectiveness, and illustrate its use with two case studies, in bioinformatics and medicine.", "paper_title": "PrIMe: A Methodology for Developing Provenance-Aware Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000294159500001"}
