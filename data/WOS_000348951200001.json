Practical techniques rely on selection strategies to identify finite subsets of these tests, and popular approaches are based on requirements to cover the model. In previous work, we have defined testing theories for refinement-based process algebra, namely, CSP and Circus, a state-rich process algebra. In this paper, we consider the selection of tests designed to establish traces refinement. In this case, conformance does not require that all traces of the model are available in the system under test, and this can raise challenges regarding coverage criteria for selection. To address these difficulties, we present a framework for formalising a variety of selection strategies. We exemplify its use in the formalisation of a selection criterion based on coverage of process communications for integration testing. We consider models written in Circus, whose symbolic testing theory facilitates the definition of uniformity and regularity hypotheses based on data operations, but also imposes extra challenges for selection of concrete tests. Our results, however, are relevant for any formalism where the conformance relation does not require all the traces of the specification to be executable by the system under test.
