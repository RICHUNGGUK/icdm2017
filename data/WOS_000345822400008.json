We show that for any positive integers m and n there exist three matrices M, N, B and a positive integer q such that if L is any recursively enumerable set of m x n matrices over nonnegative integers, then there is a matrix A such that the matrices in G are the nonnegative matrices in the set {AM(m1) (NMN)-N-m2...NMmq B vertical bar m(1), ... , m(q) >= 0}. We use this result to deduce an undecidability result for products of matrices which can be viewed as a variant of Rice's theorem stating that all nontrivial properties of recursively enumerable sets are undecidable.
