The data for the study were obtained from the Medline database. The aim is to determine the volume of scientific output in the above period, the countries involved and the trends in the subject matters addressed. Significant growth is observed in scientific production since 1991 and particularly in the period 1996-2001. The countries found to have the highest output are the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France and Germany. The collaboration networks established by scientists are also analysed in this study, as well as the evolution in the subject matters addressed in the papers they published, that are observed to remain essentially constant in the three sub-periods into which the study is divided.
