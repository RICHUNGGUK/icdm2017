Integrating both perspectives of perceived utility and flow experience, this research identifies the factors affecting continuance usage intention of mobile internet sites. Data were collected through a survey, and data analysis was then conducted with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that system quality and information quality affect perceived usefulness, satisfaction and flow. And these three factors determine continuance usage intention. Among them, flow has the largest effect on continuance usage intention. The results imply that service providers need to improve users' experience in order to facilitate their continuance usage of mobile internet sites.", "paper_title": "Understanding continuance usage intention of mobile internet sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000339891000007"}
