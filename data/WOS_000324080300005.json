These information service companies provide applications as public resources to support the business operation of their customers. However, no cloud computing service vendor (CCSV) can satisfy the full functional information system requirements of its customers. As a result, its customers often have to simultaneously use services distributed in different clouds and do some connectivity jobs manually. Services convergence and multi-clouds integration will lead to new business models and trigger new integration technologies that provide solutions to satisfy IT users' complicated requirements. This paper firstly reviews the development of cloud computing from business and technical viewpoints and then discusses requirements and challenges of services convergence and multi-clouds integrations. Thirdly, a model based architecture of multi-clouds integration is provided. Business logic modelling for cross-organizational collaboration, service modelling and operation modelling methods with relative model mapping technology are discussed in detail. Some key enabling technologies are also developed. At last, case studies are presented to illustrate the implementation of the technologies developed in the paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
