The functional relations between all coefficients of the 7/5 BWFB and their lifting parameters with respect to a one free lifting parameter are derived. Moreover, all coefficients of 7/5 BWFB and their lifting parameters are rational numbers, compared to CDF 9/7 filter banks of Cohen, Daubechies and Feauveau with irrational coefficients in JPEG2000 standard, 7/5 BWFB not only have advantage of easy computation but also are very suitable for VLSI hardware implementation. Finally, two 7/5 BWFB namely 7/5 BWFB-1 and 7/5 BWFB-2 are proposed. The experimental results show that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed images using 7/5 BWFB-1 and 7/5 BWFB-2 is 0.1dB less than CDF 9/7 filter banks but is higher 1.2dB than LT 5/3 filter banks of LeGall and Tabatabai within compression ratio 100:1. Therefore, the 7/5 BWFB-1 and 7/5 BWFB-2 are the ideal replacement of CDF 9/7 filter banks in the JPEG2000 standard for image compression applications.", "paper_title": "A new wavelet lifting scheme for image compression applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900049"}
