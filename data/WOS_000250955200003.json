A special kind of D-computable states is defined and the lower bound of entanglement of formation for a large class of density matrices whose decompositions lie in these D-computable quantum states is obtained. Moreover we present a kind of construction for this special state which is defined by a class of special matrices with two non-zero different eigenvalues and the other eigenvalues are zero. Making use of the D-computable we construct a class of bound entangled states.", "paper_title": "Entanglement of formation for a class of special quantum states", "paper_id": "WOS:000250955200003"}
