P2P protocols have been originally designed for traditional wired networks, and when deployed in wireless network environments, several challenges are encountered. For instance, P2P clients may depart or join the network frequently, raising the issue of identification and retrieval of data items in an efficient manner. In this scenario, the routing information in P2P clients may become overdue, leading to lookup failures. This paper continues the investigation of our recently proposed solution for Chord lookup in mobile P2P networks [ so-called mobile robust Chord (MR-Chord)]. MR-Chord was designed to maintain and update the finger table using a modified distributed hash table-based protocol, so that the necessary lookup services in the network are provided. Our contribution consists in studying the effects of node mobility on the performance of MR-Chord. Simulation results show that in the presence of node mobility, MR-Chord outperforms the original Chord protocol in terms of lookup success rate, overlay consistency, lookup delay time, lookup hot count, and total network load, chosen as performance metrics.", "paper_title": "MR-Chord: Improved Chord Lookup Performance in Structured Mobile P2P Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356714100010"}
