In the hub center problem, the main objective is one of minimizing the maximum distance/cost between origin destination pairs. In this paper, we study uncapacitated hub center problems with either single or multiple allocation. Both problems are proved to be NP-hard. We even show that the problem of finding an optimal single allocation with respect to a given set of hubs is already NP-hard. We present integer programming formulations for both problems and propose a branch-and-bound approach for solving the multiple allocation case. Numerical results are reported which show that the new formulations are superior to previous ones. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
