A polynomial-time method of O(mn) complexity is proposed to determine whether such a system has a unique minimal solution and/or a unique solution, where m, n are the dimensions of the input data. The proposed method can be extended to examining a system of fuzzy relational equations with max-T composition where T is a continuous triangular norm.", "paper_title": "On the unique solvability of fuzzy relational equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000290041100002"}
