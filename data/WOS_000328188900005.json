Because of the increasingly stringent environmental regulations, enterprises are interested in establishing green supply chains. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that environmental impact data sharing is a key success factor in developing a green supply chain. The tool set of IDEF (Integration Definition) is applied to describe the overall flow of the data-sharing process. An object-oriented analysis approach is used to represent the architecture of the collaborative data-sharing model. Finally, a case study in the textile/clothing industry is used to illustrate the process and the impact of environmental data sharing in a green supply chain.", "paper_title": "Data sharing: a collaborative model for a green textile/clothing supply chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000328188900005"}
