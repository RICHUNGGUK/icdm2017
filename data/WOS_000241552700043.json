Using these coding tools, H.264 achieves significant improvement in coding efficiency compared with existing standards. However, encoder complexity also increases tremendously. Among the tools, macroblock mode selection and motion estimation contribute most to total encoder complexity. This paper focuses on complexity reduction in macroblock mode selection. Of the macroblock modes which can be selected, inter8x8 and intra4x4 have the highest complexity. We propose two methods for complexity reduction of inter8x8 and intra4x4 by using the costs of the other macroblock modes. Simulation results show that the proposed methods save about 53% of total encoding time compared with the H.264 reference implementation, whereas the average PSNR decreases less than 0.05 dB.", "paper_title": "A fast algorithm for macroblock mode selection in H.264 video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700043"}
