Design/methodology/approach - Two practical motor versions are considered for use in light traction at low speed. Special attention is devoted to cogging torque level, magnetic field and performance characteristics. Findings - The various versions of the studied motor are dependent on the pole-slot ratio. Originality/value - The paper studies a new outer-rotor permanent magnet brushless DC motor.", "paper_title": "Finite element analysis of an outer-rotor permanent-magnet brushless DC motor for light traction", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900019"}
