The methyl acetate (MeAc) transesterification with ethanol (EtOH) to produce methanol (MeOH) and ethyl acetate (EtAc) is shown as illustrative example. The streams outside the units are evaluated by the infinity/infinity analysis to provide insights on the process behavior. Two simpler systems with recycling stream are also presented. The infinity/infinity analysis allows checking the interrelation of the system streams without any column design consideration. Unfeasible regions, low limit values, multiplicity regions, discontinuities, control difficulties, recommendable operation conditions and column profile combinations are predicted and discussed. All these information are useful to establish an early and suitable system design strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
