However, remote biometric authentication systems demand wider array of measures for maximum protection. This paper proposes a remote cancelable palmprint authentication protocol based on multi-directional two-dimensional PalmPhasor-fusion. The main contribution is three-fold. First, with a transposition direction selection mechanism, multi-directional two-dimensional PalmPhasor (MTDPP) improves the accuracy performance of two-dimensional PalmPhasor. Second, we provide the theoretical analysis of the effect of transposition on the accuracy performance of two-dimensional PalmPhasor, and hence establish an effective transposition direction range for the proposed MTDPP. Third, according to our analysis, the existing remote palmprint authentication system does not satisfy non-invertibility criterion of secure template protection and is vulnerable to interception. Besides, secret message embedding as a countermeasure for database attacks deteriorates accuracy performance and causes inconvenience in updating authenticator. The proposed protocol uses multi-directional two-dimensional PalmPhasor-fusion, one-time random number encrypted with asymmetric cryptography and encrypted hash codes of MTDPP to address the problems.
