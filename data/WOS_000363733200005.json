Hence, this survey aims to present a detailed overview of bio-inspired approaches pertaining to the advancement of face recognition. Based on a well-classified taxonomy, relevant bio-inspired techniques and their merits and demerits in countering potential problems vital to face recognition are analyzed. A synthesis of various approaches in terms of key governing principles and their associated performance analysis are systematically portrayed. Finally, some intuitive future directions are suggested on how bio-inspired approaches can contribute to the advancement of face biometrics in the years to come.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Bio-Inspired Approaches Toward the Advancement of Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000363733200005"}
