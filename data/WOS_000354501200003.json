In these environments fuzziness and randomness co-exist. To model the hybrid uncertainties, the design range and system range of an evaluation criterion are expressed as a fuzzy variable and a random variable respectively. Calculating the Information Contents for these criteria would involve integrals whose bounds are fuzzy variables. To calculate these integrals, an expected Information Content Model (eICM) is proposed based upon the credibility theory. To reflect the designer's risk appetite accurately, the confidence levels are introduced and a credibility Information Content Model (cICM) based on the chance constrains programming model is constructed. Two algorithms based on fuzzy simulation methods and Genetic Algorithm are developed for these two models. Finally, a case study is illustrated to highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
