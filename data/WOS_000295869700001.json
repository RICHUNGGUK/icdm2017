Furthermore, many studies on interoperability among heterogeneous devices are being conducted. The cyber physical system is closely related to the embedded system and can be applied to game devices, home appliances, medical equipment, and automobiles. It is expected that a global cyber physical system network will be created through the integration of various cyber physical systems in the near future. This paper proposes a cyber physical system-based middleware for interoperability among heterogeneous devices in game environment. This middleware supports local and global communications for interoperability among game devices wherever they are. In addition, the middleware supports IPv6 to control multiple home appliances.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Cyber Physical System-Based Middleware for Interoperability among Heterogeneous Devices in Game Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000295869700001"}
