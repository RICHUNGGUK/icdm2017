Although they produce visually convincing results, all of the methodologies that have been employed are prone to produce spurious decompositions. In previous work, a branch-and-bound algorithm for submovement extraction, capable of global nonlinear minimization, and hence, capable of avoiding spurious decompositions, was presented [Rohrer and Hogan (Biol Cybern 39:190-199, 2003)]. Here, we present a scattershot-type global nonlinear minimization algorithm that requires approximately four orders of magnitude less time to compute. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the scattershot algorithm can reliably detect changes in submovement parameters over time, e.g., over the course of neuromotor recovery.", "paper_title": "Avoiding spurious submovement decompositions II: A scattershot algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000236961200006"}
