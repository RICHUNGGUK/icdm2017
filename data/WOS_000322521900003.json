However, the formal verification of social commitments and their fulfillment is still an active research topic. This paper presents CTLC+ that modifies CTLC, a temporal logic of commitments for agent communication that extends computation tree logic (CTL) logic to allow reasoning about communicating commitments and their fulfillment. The verification technique is based on reducing the problem of model checking CTLC+ into the problem of model checking ARCTL (the combination of CTL with action formulae) and the problem of model checking GCTL(*) (a generalized version of CTL* with action formulae) in order to respectively use the extended NuSMV symbolic model checker and the CWB-NC automata-based model checker as a benchmark. We also prove that the reduction techniques are sound and the complexity of model checking CTLC+ for concurrent programs with respect to the size of the components of these programs and the length of the formula is PSPACE-complete. This matches the complexity of model checking CTL for concurrent programs as shown by Kupferman et al. We finally provide two case studies taken from business domain along with their respective implementations and experimental results to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technique. The first one is about the NetBill protocol and the second one considers the Contract Net protocol.", "paper_title": "Reducing model checking commitments for agent communication to model checking ARCTL and GCTL", "paper_id": "WOS:000322521900003"}
