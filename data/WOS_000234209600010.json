We present a new approach which gives us a second proof of this result and, in the case when p=2, allows us to prove that every ovoid of Q(4, q) either intersects all the three-dimensional elliptic quadrics in 1 mod 4 points or intersects all the three-dimensional elliptic quadrics in 3 mod 4 points. We also prove that every ovoid of Q(4, q), q prime, is an elliptic quadric. This theorem has several applications, one of which is the non-existence of ovoids of Q(6, q), q prime, q > 3. We conclude with a 1 mod p result for ovoids of Q(6, q), q=p(h), p prime.", "paper_title": "On ovoids of parabolic quadrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000234209600010"}
