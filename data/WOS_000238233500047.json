For an appropriate 1-bit ADC process DC offset is exploited and removed via performing analog low pass filter. To improve ranging accuracy in presence of ambiguity, dual overlapped window banks designated as primary and auxiliary windows are utilized. Corresponding to the proposed ranging scheme, its performance is verified by conducting simulations in two types of channel conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed ranging scheme performs well even in condensed multipath environment and low SNR situation.", "paper_title": "A novel ranging method using energy window bank in non-coherent UWB systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500047"}
