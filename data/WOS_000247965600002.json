We call this model spatial random tree grammars (SRTGs). We develop algorithms for the exact computation of likelihood and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates and the exact expectation-maximization (EM) updates for model-parameter estimation. We collectively call these algorithms the center-surround algorithm. We use the center-surround algorithm to automatically estimate the maximum likelihood (ML) parameters of SRTGs and classify images based on their likelihood and based on the MAP estimate of the associated hierarchical structure. We apply our method to the task of classifying natural images and demonstrate that the addition of hierarchical structure significantly improves upon the performance of a baseline model that lacks such structure.", "paper_title": "Spatial random tree grammars for modeling hierarchical structure in images with regions of arbitrary shape", "paper_id": "WOS:000247965600002"}
