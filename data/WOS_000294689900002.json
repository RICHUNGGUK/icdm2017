As a consequence, their prediction has become a stimulating challenge to designers of mathematical models, whether physics based or machine learning based. Because current, state-of-the-art hydrological models have difficulty performing forecasts in the absence of rainfall previsions, new approaches are necessary. In the present paper, we show that an appropriate model selection methodology, applied to neural network models, provides reliable two-hour ahead flood forecasts.", "paper_title": "Rainfall-runoff modeling of flash floods in the absence of rainfall forecasts: the case of \"Cevenol flash floods\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000294689900002"}
