The paper introduces recent developments of Chinese information education as background for two surveys, one targeting 49 employers of information professionals in public institutions and small, medium and large enterprises, and one aiming at 68 employees from the same sectors, all with academic degrees in IS/IM. Central findings demonstrate a mismatch between the perceptions of the employees with IS/IM background and those of the employers concerning central work functions, actual positions, importance to and status in institutions and enterprises. IS/IM staff are primarily employed for their information retrieval skills, but are also used in clerical work; in contrast, the employers perceive market analytic skills and industrial expertise as most central for the information profession. (Dis)advantages of the current curriculum and proposals for specific reforms of the Chinese IS/IM educational objectives, structure and curriculum are discussed.", "paper_title": "Educational perceptions of requirements of the information profession in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000282373900002"}
