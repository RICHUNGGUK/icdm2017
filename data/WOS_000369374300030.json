We propose a method of condition monitoring and fault prediction based on extension theory. The method established a matter element mode to give the formal description of the state of the equipment. It used dependent function to do the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the equipment state. Through the method, we can change the model of maintenance which is always done after fault occurred. We use the method on the example of turbines to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "Study on Fault Prediction of Equipments Based on Extension Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000369374300030"}
