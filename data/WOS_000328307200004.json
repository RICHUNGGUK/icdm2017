Firstly, based on the concept of fuzzy equivalence given by Fodor and Roubens, we propose different methods for the construction of fuzzy equivalencies from biresiduations, automorphisms, fuzzy negations, t-norms and t-conorms. Secondly, we give two manners of generating similarity measures of P.Z. Wang from fuzzy equivalencies. Finally, some properties of the two kinds of similarity measures are discussed and compared.
