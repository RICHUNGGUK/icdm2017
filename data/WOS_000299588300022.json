Our countermeasure is proposed based on the WDDL technique due to its built-in resistance against both the power-based attack and differential fault analysis. At CHES 2010, Li et al. proposed the FSA attack on WDDL-AES. The vulnerability of WDDL-AES in their attack mainly comes from the implementation deficiency rather than the WDDL technique itself. This paper first proposes an improved fault sensitive analysis that can threat a well-implemented WDDL-AES based on the input-data dependency for the critical path delay of WDDL S-box. Then we discuss the possibility of efficient countermeasures by modifying the WDDL circuit with a limited overhead. The countermeasures are discussed based on either modifying the dual-rail to single-rail converter or the introduction of the enable signal.", "paper_title": "Toward Effective Countermeasures against an Improved Fault Sensitivity Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300022"}
