In this article, we study arc consistency, a heavily investigated inference method, and three extensions thereof from the perspective of constraint languages. We conduct a comparison of the studied methods on the basis of which constraint languages they solve, and we present new polynomial-time tractability results for singleton arc consistency, the most powerful method studied.", "paper_title": "Arc consistency and friends", "paper_id": "WOS:000314123100004"}
