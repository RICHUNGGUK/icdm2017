Heterogeneous networks are an attractive solution for operators to expand network capacity, based on deploying different Radio Access Technologies, cell sizes and carrier frequencies in the same environment. As a result, operators gain flexibility to distribute traffic across the different networks (or layers) in order to make a more efficient use of resources and enhance network performance. In this work, a dynamic traffic steering technique in multi-RAT multi-layer wireless networks is proposed. In particular, a fuzzy rule-based reinforcement learning algorithm modifies handover parameters according to a specific policy set by the operator, which typically searches for a trade-off between key performance indicators. Results show that the proposed optimization algorithm provides good flexibility to support different policies by simply adjusting some weighting factors. In addition, the Q-Learning algorithm is shown as an effective solution to adapt the network to context variations, such as those produced in the user spatial distribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
