However, most studies have applied each attribute independently as a constraint to select a web service. Each attribute has a different priority weight that represents the degree of influence on the overall quality and the priority weight can be changed depending on the purpose of the quality evaluation or the subjectivity of the user. Here, we propose a system that calculates the priority weights for each quality attribute according to the QoS preference of a user easily and consistently and reflects the weights in selecting the web service. To calculate the weights, we apply a pairwise comparison matrix and an eigenvector of the matrix. Through the proposed algorithms and system, users can easily perform the process calculating the weights and select the web services according to their QoS preference. We implement the broker-based quality evaluation system and the simulation results show that the weights of the quality attributes and the quality score ranking of the web services are changed according to users' preferences.
