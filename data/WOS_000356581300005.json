So far, no efficient solution has been proposed for the important case where the overall system is underprovisioned, that is, when peers do not have enough upload bandwidth to ensure video distribution at full quality. We design various objective functions for this upload bandwidth allocation problem and show how optimal solutions can be computed using a bipartite flow network. Simulation results show that our solutions improve on existing algorithms in terms of video quality.", "paper_title": "Resource allocation in underprovisioned multioverlay peer-to-peer live video sharing services", "paper_id": "WOS:000356581300005"}
