The second condition has not been studied before. An operating guideline of a service P is an operational characterization of all deadlock-free interacting partners of P. in this paper, we present an extension of the concept of an operating guideline to characterize all correctly interacting partners of a service P. This extension can be used for answering at least the following two questions. First, given a service R, does R interact correctly with P? Second, given a service P', can P be substituted by P', that is, is every correctly interacting partner of P a correctly interacting partner of P', too? (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
