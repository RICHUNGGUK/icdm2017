However, to date most of the research relating to omni-directional cameras has focussed on the design of the camera or the way in which to project the omni-directional image to a panoramic view rather than the processing of such images after capture. Typically images obtained from omni-directional cameras are transformed to sparse panoramic images that are interpolated to obtain a complete panoramic view prior to low level image processing. This interpolation presents a significant computational overhead with respect to real-time vision. We present an efficient design procedure for space variant feature extraction operators that can be applied to a sparse panoramic image and directly processes this sparse image. This paper highlights the reduction of the computational overheads of directly processing images arising from omni-directional cameras through efficient coding and storage, whilst retaining accuracy sufficient for application to real-time robot vision.", "paper_title": "Processing sparse panoramic images via space variant operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000259439300007"}
