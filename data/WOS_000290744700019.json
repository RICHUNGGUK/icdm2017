Unlike the original as-rigid-as-possible method, we avoid the need to construct a consistent tetrahedral mesh, but instead require a consistent triangle surface mesh and from it create a tetrahedron for each surface triangle. Our new approach has several significant advantages. It is much easier to create a consistent triangle mesh than to create a consistent tetrahedral mesh. Secondly, the equations arising from our approach can be solved much more efficiently than the corresponding equations for a tetrahedral mesh. Finally, by incorporating the translation vector in the energy functional controlling interpolation, our new method does not need the user to arbitrarily fix any vertex to obtain a solution, allowing artists automatic control of interpolated mesh positions.", "paper_title": "As-Rigid-As-Possible Surface Morphing", "paper_id": "WOS:000290744700019"}
