This work analyzes the fluctuations in the supply noise that are associated with the pattern-dependent current profile of embedded via-programming ROM on a QFN package with various decoupling capacitances. A pattern-insensitive (PI) technique is developed for via-programming ROM to reduce both fluctuations of peak current and cycle current across various input addresses and accessed code-patterns. The PI technique involves the arranging of the data patterns of a ROM-code and the adjustment of the structures of row decoders and peripheral circuits. Experiments based on the designed test-setup on fabricated 0.25 mu m 256 kb ROM macros demonstrate the fluctuation in peak current of conventional ROM and its reduction by the PI technique. The fluctuations of measured peak and cycle currents of PI-ROM are only 0.7% and 13.1% of those of conventional ROM. The PI-ROM also has a 94.5% lower standby current than conventional ROM.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Reduction of Supply Noise Fluctuations Induced by Embedded Via-Programming ROM", "paper_id": "WOS:000266332000003"}
