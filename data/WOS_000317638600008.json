Both objectives are achieved using a penalized partial likelihood with a group nonconcave penalty. Oracle properties of the estimator are demonstrated, when the dimensionality is allowed to be larger than sample size. To deal with the computational challenges when p > n, an active-set-type algorithm is proposed. Finally, the method is illustrated with simulation examples and a real microarray study.
