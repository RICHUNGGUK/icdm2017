It is difficult to determine which rules are more useful, interesting and important. We introduce a rough set based Rule Importance Measure to select the most important rules. We use ROSETTA software to generate multiple reducts. Apriori association rule algorithm is then applied to generate rule sets for each data set based on each reduct. Some rules are generated more frequently than the others among the total rule sets. We consider such rules as more important. We define rule importance as the frequency of an association rule generated across all the rule sets. Rule importance is different from either rule interestingness measures or rule quality measures because of their application tasks, the processes where the measures are applied and the contents they measure. The experimental results from an artificial data set, UCI machine learning datasets and an actual geriatric care medical data set show that our method reduces the computational cost for rule generation and provides an effective measure of how important is a rule.", "paper_title": "Introducing a rule importance measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000242418100008"}
