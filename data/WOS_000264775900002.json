The new Generalized Correlative Index (GCI) was applied to a large-scale dataset of peptide collision cross sections which were previously measured using Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS). Based on Genetic Algorithm-Multiple Linear Regression (GA-MLR) approach, a linear model relating GCI with peptide collision cross section was constructed and tested using external validation and Monte Carlo cross-validation, the results confirmed that the GCI-based model is robust and predictive.
