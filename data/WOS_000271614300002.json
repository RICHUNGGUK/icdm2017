It is shown that the input and output observations can be represented in a multiscale manner based on a wavelet multiresolution analysis. The system dynamics at some specific scale of interest can then be identified using an orthogonal forward least-squares algorithm. This model can then be converted between different scales to produce predictions of the system outputs at different scales. The method can be applied to both multiscale and conventional spatio-temporal dynamical systems. For multiscale systems, the method can generate a parsimonious and effective model at a coarser scale while considering the effects from finer scales. Additionally, the proposed method can be used to improve the performance of the identification when the measurements are noisy. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed new approach.", "paper_title": "Identification of multiscale spatio-temporal dynamical systems using a wavelet multiresolution analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000271614300002"}
