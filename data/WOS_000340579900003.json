A question of fundamental interest is whether there exist sets of k <= d orthogonal maximally entangled states in C-d circle times C-d that are not perfectly distinguishable by LOCC. A recent result by Yu, Duan, and Ying [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 020506 (2012)] gives an affirmative answer for the case k = d. We give, for the first time, a proof that such sets of states indeed exist even in the case k < d. Our result is constructive and holds for an even wider class of operations known as positive-partial-transpose measurements (PPT). The proof uses the characterization of the PPT-distinguishability problem as a semidefinite program.", "paper_title": "SMALL SETS OF LOCALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE ORTHOGONAL MAXIMALLY ENTANGLED STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579900003"}
