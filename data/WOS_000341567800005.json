This paper presents simulation and experimental investigations for such systems. We investigate the available simulation environments or tools and introduce an appropriate experimental setup to conduct control designs in distributed networked control systems. We establish experimental setups for networked control systems on pilot-scale plants. Our results enhance the need to continue research into experimental distributed control systems.", "paper_title": "Experimental Investigations for Distributed Networked Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000341567800005"}
