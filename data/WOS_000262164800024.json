The proposed method has two stages, functional unit (FU) energy optimization and interconnect energy optimization. In the first stage, active and inactive energies of the FUs are optimized using a multiple supply and threshold voltage scheme. Genetic algorithm (GA) based simultaneous assignment of supply and threshold voltages and module selection is proposed. The proposed GA based searching method can be used in large size problems to find a near-optimal solution in a reasonable time. In the second stage, interconnects are simplified by increasing their sharing. This is done by exploiting similar data transfer patterns among FUs. The proposed method is evaluated for several benchmarks under 90 nm CMOS technology. The experimental results show that more than 40% of energy savings can be achieved by our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Interconnect-Complexity-Aware Low-Power VLSI Design Using Multiple Supply and Threshold Voltages", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800024"}
