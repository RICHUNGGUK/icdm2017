It is shown that time variant dynamic models can be used for the test generation. A test generation algorithm that takes into account the properties of observability and controllability is proposed. The diagnosis procedure is aimed at the detection of faults in data exchanges between program modules of the system. Both synchronous and asynchronous computations are analyzed.", "paper_title": "Time variant dynamic models in diagnosing of real-time computer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000345847900009"}
