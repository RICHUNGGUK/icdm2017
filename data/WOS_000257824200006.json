The quality parameters commonly used to quantify the fidelity of a scanner in sensing the input pattern have been analyzed and a large experimentation has been carried out to understand their effects on fingerprint recognition accuracy. The experimental results show that some parameters have a strong impact, while others appear to be less relevant..", "paper_title": "On the operational quality of fingerprint scanners", "paper_id": "WOS:000257824200006"}
