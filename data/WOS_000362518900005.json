In this community whitepaper, we present a perspective on the changing world of spatial computing, research challenges and opportunities and geoprivacy issues for spatial computing. First, this paper provides an overview of the changing world of spatial computing. Next, promising technologies that resulted from the integration of spatial computing in the everyday lives of people is discussed. This integration results with promising technologies, research challenges and opportunities and geoprivacy issues that must be addressed to achieve the potential of spatial computing.", "paper_title": "From GPS and virtual globes to spatial computing-2020", "paper_id": "WOS:000362518900005"}
