Mammograms are examined using a four-stage detection method including pre-processing, identification of local maxima, seeded region-growing, and false positive (FP) reduction. This method has been applied to the entire Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database of 322 digitized mammograms containing 59 biopsy-proven masses in 56 images. Results of detection show 95% true positive (TP) fraction at 1.9 FPs per image for the 56 images and 1.3 FPs per image for the entire database.", "paper_title": "Computer aided detection of breast masses from digitized mammograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233300024"}
