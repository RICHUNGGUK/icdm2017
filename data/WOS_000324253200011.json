These sites allow users to categorize and browse content using \"tags\" or free-text keyword topics. Since users contribute and tag social media content across a variety of social web platforms, creating new knowledge from distributed tag data has become a matter of performing various tasks, including publishing, aggregating, integrating, and republishing tag data. In this paper, we introduce an object-centered social network based on tagging practices across different sources, and then we show how this network can be built and emerged over time.", "paper_title": "Evolution of Social Networks Based on Tagging Practices", "paper_id": "WOS:000324253200011"}
