The HEVC offers an inter-prediction framework called local intensity compensation which represents a current block by a linear combination of some reference blocks. The proposed method calculates weight coefficients of the linear combination by using sparse representation. Experimental results show that the proposed method increases prediction accuracy in comparison with other methods.", "paper_title": "An Inter-Prediction Method Using Sparse Representation for High Efficiency Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400019"}
