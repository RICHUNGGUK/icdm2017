The latter causes routing tables to grow proportionally to the number of global Anycast groups in the entire Internet and both of the above designs restrict and hinder the application and development of Anycast services. A new kind of Anycast communication scheme is proposed in this paper. This scheme adopts a novel Anycast address structure which can achieve a dynamic Anycast group while allowing Anycast members to freely leave and join the Anycast group without geographical restriction and it effectively solves the expanding explosion of the Anycast routing table. In addition, this scheme can evenly disperse Anycast request messages from clients across the Anycast servers of one Anycast group, thus achieving load balance. This paper analyzes the communication scheme in depth and discusses its feasibility and validity. The experimental data in IPv6 simulation demonstrate that the TRT (Total Response Time) of one Anycast service (e. g., file downloading) acquired through this communication scheme is shorter by 15% than that through the existing Anycast communication scheme.
