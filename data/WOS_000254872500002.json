We show that current evaluation scores are insufficient for diagnosing specific errors in page segmentation and fail to identify some classes of serious segmentation errors altogether. This paper introduces a vectorial score that is sensitive to, and identifies, the most important classes of segmentation errors (over, under, and mis-segmentation) and what page components (lines, blocks, etc.) are affected. Unlike previous schemes, our evaluation method has a canonical representation of ground-truth data and guarantees pixel-accurate evaluation results for arbitrary region shapes. We present the results of evaluating widely used segmentation algorithms (x-y cut, smearing, whitespace analysis, constrained text-line finding, docstrum, and Voronoi) on the UW-III database and demonstrate that the new evaluation scheme permits the identification of several specific flaws in individual segmentation methods.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation and benchmarking of six-page segmentation algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000254872500002"}
