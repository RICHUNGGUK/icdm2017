Up-to-date this applications area is characterised by limited growth, as most of research effort is put on the development of user-to-user communication services, where the market potential is more evident. However, elaboration of mobile services, emerging obvious usability even by inexperienced users in the daily life, could offer the \"killer application\" potential for the data path of the mobile communications technology. In the sequel, the advantages of this architecture, summarised in optimised performance and thin structure suitable to be hosted on reduced functionality, low-cost embedded systems, are illustrated in the deployment of control applications within the home (involving mobile terminals and household appliances), utilising dynamic service discovery mechanisms. The paper concludes by making provisions for the ubiquitous networking of appliances towards realisation of intelligence control applications for the mobile user. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
