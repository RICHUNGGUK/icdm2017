It is shown that a throughput of 1/1.5N symbol per node per channel use can be achieved using binary signaling, which is a 33% increase compared to plain routing. This is accomplished by providing common knowledge to all nodes and exploiting this knowledge to restrain some nodes from transmitting. The error performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated analytically. Results are presented which provide insights into multi-node network coding.", "paper_title": "Improved Throughput Physical-Layer Network Coding in Multi-Way Relay Channels with Binary Signaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696500009"}
