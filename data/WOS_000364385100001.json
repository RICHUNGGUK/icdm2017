To accomplish this, we devise a fuzzy spatiotemporal data model in XML to capture the semantics of fuzzy spatiotemporal features. To allow for better and platform independent sharing of fuzzy spatiotemporal data stored in a relational format, we propose a temporal edge approach to transform fuzzy spatiotemporal XML data into relational databases. The unique feature of our approach is that no schema information is required for transformation of fuzzy spatiotemporal data. Moreover, temporal, spatial, and fuzzy features of fuzzy spatiotemporal data in XML documents are taken into consideration. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the performance advantages of our approach. Such approach of transformation could provide a significant consolidation of the interoperability of fuzzy spatiotemporal data from XML to relational databases.", "paper_title": "Incorporating fuzziness in spatiotemporal XML and transforming fuzzy spatiotemporal data from XML to relational databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000364385100001"}
