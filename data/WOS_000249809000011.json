The performance of the well-known EATS and MSL schemes is noticeably degraded in practical networks with non-uniform destinations and non-negligible transceiver tuning latencies. Under these realistic conditions, it is common that two or more messages with the same destination have to be scheduled consecutively or at close times. In most cases, this brings about some performance penalty, owing to the delayed availability of the destination's receiver for the second (and beyond) of the consecutive messages. As the frequency of such occurrences increases, the performance degradation of the existing schemes becomes more prominent. EMPS is proposed to deal with this problem. It simultaneously considers multiple messages from different transmitting nodes and gives priority to messages intended for the least used destinations each time. By balancing the offered load in this way, EMPS minimizes the probability of having to schedule two or more messages with the same destination consecutively or at close times. Additionally, by incorporating the Minimum Scheduling Latency algorithm for channel selection, the protocol also minimizes the actual performance penalty incurred, when scheduling of consecutive messages with the same destination cannot be avoided. Extensive simulations are carried out in order to study the performance of EMPS and compare it to other efficient schemes under various conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol always brings about a significant performance improvement.", "paper_title": "A high-performance message prioritization and scheduling protocol for WDM star networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249809000011"}
