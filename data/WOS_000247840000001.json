In this paper, we study its performance by proposing a new formulation of the BPP in the CN, and introducing repacking scheme into next fit algorithm in terms of the online constraint. For the realistic applications, the effect of call demand distribution is also exploited by means of simulation. The results show that the repacking efficiency is significant (e.g. the minimal improvement about 13% over uniform distribution), especially in the scenarios where the small call demands dominate the network.", "paper_title": "The repacking efficiency for bandwidth packing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840000001"}
