Nuclear morphometric parameters from cytological smears taken by Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of the breast, have been measured from 193 patients. These parameters undergo an appropriate transformation and then, the classifiers are performed on the raw and on the transformed data. The results show that in terms of the raw data set all classifiers exhibit almost the same performance (overall accuracy = 87%), Thus the linear classifier suffices for the discrimination of the present problem. Also, based on the previous results. one can conjecture that the use of these classifiers combined with image morphometry and statistical techniques for feature transformation, may offer useful information towards the improvement of the diagnostic accuracy of breast FNA.", "paper_title": "Discrimination of benign from malignant breast lesions using statistical classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100062"}
