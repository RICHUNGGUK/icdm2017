MARS uses piece-wise linear segments to describe the non-linear relationships between input and output variables. LSSVM is firmly based on the theory of statistical learning, and uses regression technique. The input parameters of the models are corrected cone resistance (q (t) ), vertical total stress (sigma(v)), hydrostatic pore pressure (u (0)), pore pressure at the cone tip (u (1)), and the pore pressure just above the cone base (u (2)). The developed LSSVM model gives error bar of predicted OCR. Equations have also been developed for prediction of OCR. The performance of MARS and LSSVM models has been compared with the traditional methods for OCR prediction. As the results reveal, the proposed MARS and LSSVM models are robust models for determination of OCR.", "paper_title": "Multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) for OCR prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000306354600004"}
