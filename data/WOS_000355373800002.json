During the admission of users, EBAC evaluates a known route to determine whether it has enough bandwidth to support the new flow. To do this, the incoming node sends probing packets along a route so that the receiving node computes the envelope of the incoming flow, as well as the service envelope that models the service provided by the network. Based on these envelopes, the receiving node decides whether to admit the new flow. Admission control schemes that are decoupled from the routing protocol can work with any routing protocol. However, characteristics such as the way the underlying protocol deals with link failures or the speed of the route discovery process impact the admission control operation. This paper analyzes the performance of the EBAC scheme when used jointly with four different routing protocols: AODV, DSR, OLSR and DYMO. Results show that in both static and mobile scenarios, joint operation with the AODV protocol achieved the best performance of those evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
