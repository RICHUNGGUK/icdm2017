It enables communities to work together, helps prevent vendor lock-in, and in principle enables \"cloud-like\" resource provision by permitting different resources to meet needs from other communities. In this paper, we discuss a practical example of achieving interoperation between storage resources, and the lessons learned. The aim is to meet current use cases for interoperation with no additional software development. Apart from the practical results, experiences from this work will be relevant to other interoperation activities.", "paper_title": "Practical Grid Storage Interoperation Interoperation of SRM and SRB Now", "paper_id": "WOS:000272244900004"}
