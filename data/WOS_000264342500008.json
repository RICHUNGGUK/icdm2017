Due to the geographical correlation between sensed data, location information is commonly used to name the gathered data and address nodes and regions in data dissemination protocols. In general, to estimate its location, a node needs the position information of at least three reference points (neighbors that know their positions). In this work, we propose a different scheme in which only two reference points are required in order to estimate a position. To choose between the two possible solutions of an estimate, we use the known direction of the recursion. This approach leads to a recursive localization system that works with low-density networks (increasing by 40 percent the number of nodes with estimates in some cases), reduces the position error by almost 30 percent, requires 37 percent less processor resources to estimate a position, uses fewer beacon nodes, and also indicates the node position error based on its distance to the recursion origin. No GPS-enabled node is required, since the recursion origin can be used as a relative coordinate system. The algorithm's evaluation is performed by comparing it with a similar localization system; also, experiments are made to evaluate the impact of both systems in geographic algorithms.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Directed Localization Recursion Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000264342500008"}
