Fast screening tools are needed to make epistasis analysis routinely available in GWAS. Results: We present BiForce to support high-throughput analysis of epistasis in GWAS for either quantitative or binary disease (case-control) traits. BiForce achieves great computational efficiency by using memory efficient data structures, Boolean bitwise operations and multithreaded parallelization. It performs a full pair-wise genome scan to detect interactions involving SNPs with or without significant marginal effects using appropriate Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds. We show that BiForce is more powerful and significantly faster than published tools for both binary and quantitative traits in a series of performance tests on simulated and real datasets. We demonstrate BiForce in analysing eight metabolic traits in a GWAS cohort (323 697 SNPs, > 4500 individuals) and two disease traits in another (> 340 000 SNPs, > 1750 cases and 1500 controls) on a 32-node computing cluster. BiForce completed analyses of the eight metabolic traits within 1 day, identified nine epistatic pairs of SNPs in five metabolic traits and 18 SNP pairs in two disease traits. BiForce can make the analysis of epistasis a routine exercise in GWAS and thus improve our understanding of the role of epistasis in the genetic regulation of complex traits.", "paper_title": "High-throughput analysis of epistasis in genome-wide association studies with BiForce", "paper_id": "WOS:000306686400002"}
