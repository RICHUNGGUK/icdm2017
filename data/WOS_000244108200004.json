Strategies and algorithms to improve the memory efficiency as well as the parallel performance of the subgrid-scale model, the factored scheme, and the Poisson solver on shared-memory parallel platforms are proposed and evaluated. A novel combination of one-dimensional red-black/line Gauss-Seidel and two-dimensional red-black/line Gauss-Seidel methods is shown to provide high efficiency and performance for multigrid relaxation of the Poisson equation. Parallel speedups are measured on various shared-distributed memory systems. Validations of the code are performed in large-eddy simulations of turbulent flows through a straight channel and a square duct. Results obtained from the present solver employing a Lagrangian dynamic subgrid-scale model show good agreements with other available data. The capability of the code for more complex flows is assessed by performing a large-eddy simulation of the tip-leakage flow in a linear cascade.
