In an experiment, we demonstrated the dynamic interactions among the robot mechanical system, the oscillator control system, and the environment. The robot produced stable walking on the splitbelt treadmill at various belt speeds without changing the control strategy and parameters, despite a large discrepancy between the belt speeds. This is due to modulation of the locomotor rhythm and its phase through the phase resetting mechanism, which induces the relative phase between leg movements to shift from antiphase, and causes the duty factors to be autonomously modulated depending on the speed discrepancy between the belts. Such shifts of the relative phase and modulations of the duty factors are observed during human splitbelt treadmill walking. Clarifying the mechanisms producing such adaptive splitbelt treadmill walking will lead to a better understanding of the phase resetting mechanism in the generation of adaptive locomotion in biological systems and consequently to a guiding principle for designing control systems for legged robots.", "paper_title": "Adaptive splitbelt treadmill walking of a biped robot using nonlinear oscillators with phase resetting", "paper_id": "WOS:000319452000002"}
