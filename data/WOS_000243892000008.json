In this paper, we introduce implicative fuzzy associative memories (IFAMs), a class of associative neural memories based on fuzzy set theory. An IFAM consists of a network of completely interconnected Pedrycz logic neurons with threshold whose connection weights are determined by the minimum of implications of presynaptic and postsynaptic activations. We present a series of results for autoassociative models including one pass convergence, unlimited storage capacity and tolerance with respect to eroded patterns. Finally, we present some results on fixed points and discuss the relationship between implicative fuzzy associative memories and morphological associative memories.", "paper_title": "Implicative fuzzy associative memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000243892000008"}
