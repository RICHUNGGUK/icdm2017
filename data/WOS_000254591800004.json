Their narrow and winding shape, along with strong surface and counter deep water sea currents hinders the navigation. In this article, a queuing model of maritime traffic in the Bosporus Straits is presented. Physical characteristics of the waterway and applied maritime regulations are integrated into the model. In a number of scenarios, simulation of the traffic, based on a set of historical data, is performed and the corresponding results are presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
