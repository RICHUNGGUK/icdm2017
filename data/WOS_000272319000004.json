Given the co-existence of stochastic and fuzzy uncertainty, real data cannot be characterized by using only the formalism of random variables. In order to address regression problems in the presence of such hybrid uncertain data, fuzzy random variables are introduced in this study to serve as an integral component of regression models. A new class of fuzzy regression models that is based on fuzzy random data is built, and is called the confidence-interval-based fuzzy random regression model (CI-FRRM). First, a general fuzzy regression model for fuzzy random data is introduced. Then, using expectations and variances of fuzzy random variables, sigma-confidence intervals are constructed for fuzzy random input-output data. The CI-FRRM is established based on the sigma-confidence intervals. The proposed regression model gives rise to a nonlinear programming problem that consists of fuzzy numbers or interval numbers. Since sign changes in the fuzzy coefficients modify the entire programming structure of the solution process, the inherent dynamic nonlinearity of this optimization makes it difficult to exploit the techniques of linear programming or classical nonlinear programming. Therefore, we resort to some heuristics. Finally, an illustrative example is provided.", "paper_title": "Building Confidence-Interval-Based Fuzzy Random Regression Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000272319000004"}
