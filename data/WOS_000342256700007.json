First, the audiences' expressions are inferred through a multi-expression recognition model, which consists of an image-driven expression measurement recognition and a Bayesian network representing the co-existence and mutual exclusion relations among multi-expressions. Second, the videos' multi-emotion tags are obtained from the recognized expressions by another Bayesian Network, capturing the relations between expressions and emotions. Results of the experiments conducted on the JAFFE and NVIE databases demonstrate that the performance of expression recognition is improved by considering the relations among multiple expressions. Furthermore, the relations between expressions and emotions help improve emotional tagging, as our approach outperforms the traditional expression-based or image-driven implicit tagging methods.
