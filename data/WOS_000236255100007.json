Design approaches aimed at fixing some of the undesirable effects of nanometric technologies could jeopardize current test approaches. This article describes possible solutions to many of these challenges, including statistical timing and delay test, I-DDQ test under exponentially increasing leakage, and power or thermal management architectures.", "paper_title": "Test consideration for nanometer-scale CMOS circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000236255100007"}
