Selection is the first step in the process of establishing relationships in a CAD model. Because designing is characterized by a process of change and development, establishing and maintaining relationships can contribute significant overhead to a parametric design process. Selection rules can be used to reduce the overhead involved in maintaining relationships and increase the portability of model objects by pushing responsibility for maintaining relations to the computer. We report on two implemented concepts for rule based selection and discuss directions for future research.", "paper_title": "Using rule based selection to support change in parametric CAD models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566000022"}
