Most of the existing localization approaches for WCSNs are essentially interactive, i.e., require the interaction among the nodes throughout the localization process. As a result, they are costly to realize in practice, vulnerable to sniffer attacks, inefficient in energy consumption and computation. In this paper, we propose LISTEN, a noninteractive localization approach. Using LISTEN, every camera sensor node only needs to silently listen to the beacon signals from a mobile beacon node and capture a few images until determining its own location. We design the movement trajectory of the mobile beacon node, which guarantees to locate all the nodes successfully. We have implemented LISTEN and evaluated it through extensive experiments. Both the analytical and experimental results demonstrate that it is accurate, cost-efficient, and especially suitable for WCSNs that consist of low-end camera sensors.", "paper_title": "Noninteractive Localization of Wireless Camera Sensors with Mobile Beacon", "paper_id": "WOS:000312558900011"}
