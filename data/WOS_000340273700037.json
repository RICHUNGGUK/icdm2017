This technique relies on properties of the sensing matrix such as the restricted isometry property. Sensing matrices that satisfy this property with optimal parameters are mainly obtained via probabilistic arguments. Deciding whether a given matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property is a nontrivial computational problem. Indeed, it is shown in this paper that restricted isometry parameters cannot be approximated in polynomial time within any constant factor under the assumption that the hidden clique problem is hard. In addition, on the positive side, an improvement on the brute-force enumeration algorithm for checking the restricted isometry property is proposed.", "paper_title": "Hidden Cliques and the Certification of the Restricted Isometry Property", "paper_id": "WOS:000340273700037"}
