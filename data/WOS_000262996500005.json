Within the MAGDA toolset, supporting programming and execution of mobile agent based distributed applications, we provide a skeleton-based parallel programming environment, based on specialization of Algorithmic Skeleton Java interfaces and classes. Their implementation include mobile agent features for execution Oil heterogeneous systems, such as clusters of WSs and PCs. and support reliability and dynamic work-load balancing. The User can thus develop a parallel, mobile agent based application by simply specialising a given set of classes and methods and Using a set of added functionalities.", "paper_title": "A skeleton based programming paradigm for mobile multi-agents on distributed systems and its realization within the MAGDA Mobile Agents platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000262996500005"}
