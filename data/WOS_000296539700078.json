In order to solve this problem, an improved semi-supervised fuzzy clustering algorithm with pairwise constraints (SCAPC) was proposed based on a redefined objective function. The new penalty cost function in SCAPC theoretically conforms to the methodology of classical fuzzy clustering, which is expressed as the violation cost incurred by the pairs, and has the same magnitude order as the basic objective function. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and images showed that SCAPC can produce more accurate clustering by moderately enhancing or reducing the ambiguous memberships. Research indicates that constraint term of the proposed algorithm can achieve a good agreement and cooperation with the basic objective function. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
