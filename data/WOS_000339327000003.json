We show that as a result, the points produced by these generators have a poor lattice structure, and a poor initialization of the state can have long-lasting impact, because of the limited diffusion capacity of the recurrence.", "paper_title": "On the Lattice Structure of a Special Class of Multiple Recursive Random Number Generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000339327000003"}
