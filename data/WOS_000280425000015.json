In the deterministic case, epsilon-minimal solutions and level-minimal solutions are considered as desired relaxations. We call them approximative solutions and we introduce some possibilities how to combine them with randomness. Relations among random versions of approximative solutions and their consistency are presented in this paper. No measurability is assumed, therefore, treatment convenient for nonmeasurable objects is employed.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATIVE SOLUTIONS OF STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280425000015"}
