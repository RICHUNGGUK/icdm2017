In this paper, a novel energy efficient and high speed error control scheme is introduced that is based on the Redundant Residue Number System (RRNS) allowing real-time application of WSNs. The proposed approach employs a new 3-moduli set {2(2n+1), 2(2n+1) - 1, 2(n) - 1} and an efficient reverse converter which relies on the Mixed Radix Conversion (MRC) algorithm and achieves significant improvements both in terms of conversion delay and hardware design. In order to obtain error controllability, two-redundant-moduli set {2(3n+1) - 1, 2(4n+1) - 1} is also added to the main 3-moduli set. The theoretical results backed by simulation tests confirm that the solution put forward in this paper outperforms popular error control methods for WSNs in terms of error controllability, energy efficiency, and reduction of end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient and High Speed Error Control Scheme for Real Time Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337437800001"}
