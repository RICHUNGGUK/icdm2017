However, in this paper, we postulate that the aforementioned theories do not apply when investigating intentions towards the use of mobile data services (MDS), as the latter encompasses supplementary characteristics, such as fun and enjoyment, which are not taken into account under available models of user acceptance. The incorporation of the affective dimension is proposed by reintroducing the Triandis theory of human behaviour to the MDS domain. A web-based survey (N = 219) was conducted to investigate our research hypotheses and validate our model of MDS usage intention. Results showed that the MDS usage intention can be predicted by cognitive and affective factors under the lens of social influences. Additionally, the main antecedents of MDS actual use are perceived usefulness, perceived value and intention to use MDS.", "paper_title": "Affective and social determinants of mobile data services adoption", "paper_id": "WOS:000300849400002"}
