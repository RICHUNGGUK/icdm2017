We explain the use of importance sampling in approximating the range of these imprecise previsions and we develop an approximation function for the imprecise posterior prevision based on generating a finite number of random variables. We develop a convergence theorem that shows that this approximation converges almost surely to the posterior prevision as we generate more and more random variables. We also develop a useful accuracy bound for the approximation for a large finite number of generated random variables. We test the efficiency of this approximation using a simple example involving the imprecise Dirichlet model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
