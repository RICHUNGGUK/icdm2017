Although many researchers have studied domain testing, automatic domain test data generation for string predicates has seldom been explored. This paper presents a novel approach for the automatic generation of ON-OFF test points for string predicate borders, and describes a corresponding test data generator. Our empirical work is conducted on a set of programs with string predicates, where extensive trials have been done for each string predicate, and the results are analysed using the SPSS tool. Conclusions are drawn that: (i) the approach is promising and effective; (ii) there is a strong linear relationship between the performance of the test generator and the length of target string in the predicate tested; and (iii) initial inputs, no shorter than the target string and with characters generated randomly, may enhance the performance in the test data generation for string predicates.
