The interaction energy and geometric parameters of resultant halogen or pi-hole bonding complexes were estimated and compared. Moreover, the bonding constants were determined by P-31 NMR. Both theory and experiments indicated the C6F6 and C6F5Cl interact with triethylphosphine oxide by pi-hole bonding pattern, while C6F5I by halogen/sigma-hole bonding form. For C6F5Br, two interactions are comparative and should coexist competitively. The calculated interaction energies of sigma-hole bonding complexes, -5.07 kcal mol(-1) for C(6)F(5)Bra <-O=P and -8.25 kcal mol(-1) for C(6)F(5)Ia <-O=P, and pi-hole bonding complexes, -7.29 kcal mol(-1) for C(6)F(6)a <-O=P and -7.24 kcal mol(-1) for C(6)F(5)Cla <-O=P, are consistent with the changing tendency of bonding constants measured by P-31 NMR, 4.37, 19.7, 2.42 and 2.23 M-1, respectively.", "paper_title": "The competition of C-Xa <-O=P halogen bond and pi-holea <-O=P bond between halopentafluorobenzenes C6F5X (X=F, Cl, Br, I) and triethylphosphine oxide", "paper_id": "WOS:000326193200039"}
