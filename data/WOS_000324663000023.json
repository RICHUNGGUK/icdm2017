Environmental conditions will exert an influence on deterioration processes of the components in the system. For each component, the worse the environmental conditions are, the faster its deterioration speed is. We want to determine when to preventively maintain each component under such environmental influence. Our purpose is to minimize its long-run average maintenance cost. We decompose such a multi-component system into mutually influential single-component systems, and formulate the maintenance problem of each component as a Markov decision process (MDP). Under some reasonable assumptions, we prove the existence of the optimal (n(r),N-r) type policy for each component. A policy iteration method is used to calculate its optimal maintenance policy. Based on the method, we develop an iterative approximation algorithm to obtain an acceptable maintenance policy for a multicomponent system. Numerical examples find that environmental conditions and OM pose significant effects on a maintenance policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
