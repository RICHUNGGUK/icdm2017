The stateless autoconfiguration capability is therefore essential to the spontaneity of such community networks. Of several address autoconfiguration schemes, no singular scheme meets the diversity and heterogeneity of MANET environments. In this paper, we present a duplicate address detection mechanism for mobile ad hoc networks, which is distributed and poses no additional cost on the communication. Analytical results are suggestive of mitigation in broadcast storms that swarm the network every time a node assigns itself an IP address.", "paper_title": "Mitigating broadcast storms in stateless address auto-configuring MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100088"}
