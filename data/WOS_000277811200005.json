This algorithm improves a subdivision scheme for nets of curves (BC-algorithm), proposed in a previous paper, which generalizes the well known Chaikin subdivision scheme refining control points. While the BC-algorithm generates continuous surfaces, the BCC-algorithm generates C(1) surfaces. This is achieved by a corner cutting step following each refinement step of the BC-algorithm. The analysis of convergence, smoothness and approximation order of the BCC-algorithm is based on its proximity to the tensor-product Chaikin scheme. A short discussion of boundary rules for the BCC-algorithm is also included. Several numerical examples, illustrating the operation of the BCC-algorithm, with and without boundary rules, are presented. In the examples the advantage of the BCC-algorithm over the tensorproduct Chaikin algorithm is evident. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
