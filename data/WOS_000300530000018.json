The recurrence relations for the method are derived and then an existence-uniqueness theorem is given to establish the R-order of the method to be three and a priori error bounds. Finally, some numerical applications is presented to demonstrate our approach.", "paper_title": "Recurrence relations for the Harmonic mean Newton's method in Banach spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000300530000018"}
