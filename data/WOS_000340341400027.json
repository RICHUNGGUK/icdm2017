In many applications, users only care about specific target species, which are unknown to a detection system until the users register some relevant information like a limited number of target samples. We call this scenario the detection of user-registered dog faces. Due to the great variation between different dog species, no single model can describe all the species well. Meanwhile, it is also impractical to learn individual models for every potential target species that the users may care about, given the large number of dog species. Furthermore, the- registered samples are usually too few to train a robust detector directly. In this context, we propose a novel user-registered object detection framework. This framework can generate an adaptive detector, from only a limited number of user-registered target samples and a couple of off-line trained auxiliary models. In addition, we build an annotated dog face dataset, which contains 10,712 images of 32 species. Experimental results on the dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve superior detection performance to the state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
