The subroutines in the library accept as their argument a full, diagonal, or upper quasitriangular matrix with real or complex entries in one of four precisions. Two different algorithms are implemented, one is the scaling and squaring method, and the other is a modified block Schur-Parlett algorithm. In the latter algorithm, a recursive three-by-three blocking is applied to the argument based on an estimate of the sep-inverse function. The estimation of the sep-inverse function is carried out by Hager-Higham estimator implemented as the subroutine xLACON in LAPACK. Our modifications to the block Schur-Parlett algorithm are described together with the results of numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 894: On a Block Schur-Parlett Algorithm for phi-functions Based on the Sep-Inverse Estimate", "paper_id": "WOS:000268473700005"}
