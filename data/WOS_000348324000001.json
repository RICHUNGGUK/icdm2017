To investigate this, 243 active authors/editors publishing in this field were requested to indicate their preferred category to 83 journal titles listed in JCR 2011 from four options: information science (IS), library science (LS), information systems (ISys) and do not know/undecided. Based on the popularity count, respondents assigned 39 titles to LS, 23 titles to IS and 21 titles to ISys. Twenty-five titles received high \"do-not-know\" counts-these are titles in non-English languages, information management and publishing sub-fields. Only one title in LS was grouped in the highest quartile by impact factor, compared to 8 titles in IS and 11 in ISys. This indicates that LS journals are hardly represented among the top 25 % of the impact factor distribution of JCR's ranked IS-LS journals. Respondents show concern about the \"fit\" of information systems journals in the IS-LS category.", "paper_title": "LIS journals categorization in the Journal Citation Report: a stated preference study", "paper_id": "WOS:000348324000001"}
