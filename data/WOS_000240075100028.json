Most of previous localization schemes estimate current position and pose of a mobile robot by applying various localization algorithms with the information obtained from sensors which are set on the mobile robot, or by recognizing an artificial landmark attached on the wall or objects of the environment as natural landmarks. Several drawbacks about them have been brought up. To compensate the drawbacks, a new localization method that estimates the absolute position of the mobile robot by using a fixed camera on the ceiling in the corridor is proposed. And also, the proposed method can improve the success rate for position estimation, since it calculates the real size of an object. This is not a relative localization scheme which reduces the position error through algorithms with noisy sensor data, but a kind of absolute localization. The effectiveness of the proposed localization scheme is demonstrated through the experiments.", "paper_title": "Image-based absolute positioning system for mobile robot navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100028"}
