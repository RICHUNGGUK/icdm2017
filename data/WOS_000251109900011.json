Our recent success in Coolstreaming system brings promises in this direction; however, it also reveals that there exist many practical engineering problems in real live streaming systems over the Internet. Our focus in this paper is on a nonoptimal real working system, in which we illustrate a set of existing practical problems and how they could be handled. We believe this is essential in providing the basic understanding of P2P streaming systems. This paper uses a set of real traces and attempts to develop some theoretical basis to demonstrate that a random peer partnership selection with a hybrid pull-push scheme has the potentially to scale. Specifically, first, we describe the fundamental system design tradeoffs and key changes in the design of a Coolstreaming system including substreaming, buffer management, scheduling and the adopt of a hybrid pull-push mechanism over the original pull-based content delivery approach; second, we examine the overlay topology and its convergence; third, using a combination of real traces and analysis, we quantitatively provide the insights on how the buffering technique resolves the problems associated with dynamics and heterogeneity; fourth, we show how substream and path diversity can help to alleviate the impact from congestion and churns; fifth, we discuss the system scalability and limitations.", "paper_title": "Coolstreaming: Design, theory, and practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000251109900011"}
