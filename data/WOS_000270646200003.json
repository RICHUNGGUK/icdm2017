In order to compete in the global environment, the ability and effectiveness of acquiring new technology are essential for firms, especially for the traditional machinery industry. In Taiwan, the societal structure is built on the foundation of Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Thus most new technologies need and depend on the technology transfer (TT) from international firms and research institutes. Due to the complicity of influential factors of TT, such as industrial feature (IF), organizational feature (OF), personnel feature (PF) and technological feature (TF), difficulties are encountered in evaluating the effectiveness of TT. This study develops a rule-based decision support mechanism using fuzzy set theory and the method of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate the effectiveness of TT. Also, a statistic analysis (Statistics Package for Social Science. SPSS) is adopted to confirm the results of fuzzy AHP analysis. This study finds that prior successful TT experience, workers' positive attitude, proper authorization, and more codification exist in a novel technology are highly influential. Those factors are important in concern when a firm launching TT. Furthermore, firms' age and personnel educational background are regardless. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
