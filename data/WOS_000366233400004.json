We also propose the concept of optional recycling operations, in which recycling operations are separated from the processing of jobs and recycling operations are exercised only when necessary. An integer program is proposed to formulate the problem and facilitate complexity classification. We propose a pseudo-polynomial time dynamic program, and then classify the complexity status of several restricted cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
