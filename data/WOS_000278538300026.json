However, the platform for chronic disease measurement and management is still lacking, especially for underserved Chinese. To achieve the early diagnosis of hypertension, one BP monitoring system has been designed. The proposed design consists of three main parts: user domain, server domain, and channel domain. All three units and their materialization, validation tests on reliability, and usability are described in this paper, and the conclusion is that the current design concept is feasible and the system can be developed toward sufficient reliability and affordability with further optimization. This idea might also be extended into one platform for other physiological signals, such as blood sugar and ECG.", "paper_title": "A Mobile Monitoring System of Blood Pressure for Underserved in China by Information and Communication Technology Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000278538300026"}
