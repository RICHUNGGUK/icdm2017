A wavelet-based neural network (WNN) is proposed to develop an adaptive backstepping control scheme, called ABC(WNN) for TORA system. To ensure the stability of the controlled system, a compensated controller is designed to enhance the control performance. Based on its universal approximation ability, we use a WNN to estimate the system uncertainty including frictional forces, external disturbance, and parameter variance. According to the estimations of the WNNs, the ABC(WNN) control is developed via a backstepping design procedure such that the system outputs follow the desired trajectories. For system development, the effects of frictional forces are discussed and solved using the estimation of the WNN. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme for TORA system is verified by numerical simulation and experimental results.", "paper_title": "Experimental implementation of nonlinear TORA system and adaptive backstepping controller design", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160200017"}
