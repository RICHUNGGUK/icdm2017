The first objective of our study is to investigate the potential for approximating these distributions with traditional time to failure distribution. We consider a single-component system subject to a Markovian operating environment such that the system's instantaneous deterioration rate depends on the state of the environment. The system fails when its cumulative degradation crosses some random threshold. Using a simulation-based approach, we approximate the time to first failure distribution for this system with a Weibull distribution and assess the quality of this approximation. The second objective of our study is to investigate the cost benefit of applying a condition-based maintenance paradigm (as opposite to a scheduled maintenance paradigm) to the repairable system of interest. Using our simulation model, we assess the cost benefits resulting from condition-based maintenance policy, and also the impact of the random prognostic error in estimating system condition (health) on the cost benefits of the condition-based maintenance policy.
