The efficiency factor due to the component of soil unit weight, is computed with respect to changes in the clear spacing (xi(gamma)) between the footings. It is noted that the failure load for a footing in the group becomes always greater than that of a single isolated footing. The values of xi(gamma) for the smooth footings are found to be always lower than the rough footings. The values of xi(gamma) are found to increase continuously with a decrease in the spacing between footings. As compared to the available theoretical and experimental results reported in literature, the present analysis provides generally a little lower values of xi(gamma). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
