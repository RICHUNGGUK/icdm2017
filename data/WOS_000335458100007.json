An appealing aspect of this approach is that computations are relatively easy. In this paper, we examine the predictive performance of these models with an increasing number of covariates. Even for a moderate number of covariates, we find that the likelihood for x tends to dominate the posterior of the latent random partition, degrading the predictive performance of the model. To overcome this, we suggest using a different nonparametric prior, namely an enriched Dirichlet process. Our proposal maintains a simple allocation rule, so that computations remain relatively simple. Advantages are shown through both predictive equations and examples, including an application to diagnosis Alzheimer's disease.", "paper_title": "Improving Prediction from Dirichlet Process Mixtures via Enrichment", "paper_id": "WOS:000335458100007"}
