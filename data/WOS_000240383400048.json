Considering the actual situation of ship operation, the simulation experiment is made. The results show that the performance stability of this kind of adaptive filter is better than the conventional Kalman filter, and can calculate adaptively the matrix of system noise variance (Q) over bar and measurement noise matrix R, so the estimation precision of the parameters such as attitudes etc. can be improved effectively for marine FOG-SINS/GPS integrated attitude determination system. Statistical performance after filtering for this integrated system is better than the GPS attitude determination system.", "paper_title": "Study on FOG-SINS/GPS integrated attitude determination system using adaptive Kalman filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400048"}
