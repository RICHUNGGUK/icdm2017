The total revenue of all global fabless firms in 2003 was about US$20 billion, with the top 30 firms earning accounting for 96% of the market share. To examine the leaders in the field, this research analyzes the relative performances of those top 30 fabless firms. Fabless firms are often evaluated based on subjective judgments, and an overall scheme to measure the performance involving objective, multi-input and multi-output criteria is yet to be established. There is also a need for identifying and determining suggestions of how specific firms could improve their performance. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method has been employed in this paper to satisfy the above needs. Using the input and output data of 2003, this study used the DEA method to build a model to evaluate the performance of those global top 30 fabless firms. The current research used four efficiency models: CCR, A&P, BCC, and Cross-Efficiency. To offer a comparison of efficiencies and associated discussions, an analysis of the Scale-Return is provided. Finally, the performance of various fabless firms in 2003 is analyzed. According to the CCR and A&P models, the results showed that the top ten Decision Management Units (DMUs) achieved better operation performance among the 30 leading global fabless firms.", "paper_title": "Measuring the relative performance for leading fabless firms by using data envelopment analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000256080900002"}
