A model predictive control algorithm is designed, based on a dynamic model describing the mass transfer between pasta and the surrounding air. The multiple input single output control algorithm minimizes a cost function over a prediction horizon which represents the deviation of the process from a desired reference track, thereby incorporating the working limitations of the oven. The performance of the controller and the influence of the prediction horizon are examined in this paper, showing minimal deviation between process and reference track. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
