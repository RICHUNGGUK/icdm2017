Our proposed methods can employ either optical flow or trajectories as input, and incorporate spatial and temporal information together, which improve upon existing approaches for summarization. To begin, we extract common pathway regions by performing graph-based clustering on similarity matrices describing the relationships between location/orientation states. We then employ the activities along the pathway regions to extract the aggregate behavioral patterns throughout scenes. We show how our summarization methods can be applied to detect anomalies, retrieve video clips of interest, and generate adaptive-speed summary videos. We examine our approaches on multiple complex urban scenes and present experimental results.", "paper_title": "Summarizing high-level scene behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000330314100017"}
