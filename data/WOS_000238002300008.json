The system is characterized by combining two kinds of adaptation: to the caller and to the operator. The aim is to support the user incrementally, improving the global quality of the interaction. In particular, the system combines a first process of automatic and personalized response with a second one of adaptive routing of the call to the operator who best fits the caller's features, according to a user-centered workflow. The results of a preliminary evaluation confirm the validity of the approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
