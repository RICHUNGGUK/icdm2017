The proposed algorithm extends the recent symmetric pairwise boosting (SPB) algorithm by taking feature sequence correlation into account. An information-theoretic analysis of the SPB algorithm is given, showing that each iteration of SPB maximizes a lower bound on the mutual information between matching fingerprint pairs. Based on the analysis, two practical regularizers are proposed to penalize those filters generating highly correlated filter responses. A learning-theoretic analysis of the regularized Adaboost algorithm is given. The proposed algorithm demonstrates significant performance gains over SPB for both audio and video content identification systems.", "paper_title": "Regularized Adaboost Learning for Identification of Time-Varying Content", "paper_id": "WOS:000348129200007"}
