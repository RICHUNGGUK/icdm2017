Recent advances in visual neuroscience have led to a solid model of object and shape recognition in the visual ventral stream which competes with the state-of-the-art computer vision systems on some standard recognition tasks. A modification of this model is also proposed by adding more biologically inspired properties such as sparsification of features, lateral inhibition and feature localization to enhance its performance. In this study, we show that using features proposed by the modified model results in higher handwritten digit recognition rates compared with the original model over English and Farsi handwritten digit datasets. Our analyses also demonstrate higher invariance of the modified model to various image distortions.", "paper_title": "Invariance analysis of modified C2 features: case study-handwritten digit recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000282095900013"}
