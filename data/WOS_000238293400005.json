Survivability is achieved by distributed mesh protection. Over the preplanned primary and backup capacity, optimal routing and wavelength assignment is carried out. In case of a network failure, protection routes and optimum flow values on these protection routes are extracted from a previously trained feed-forward neural network which is distributed over the optical data communications network.", "paper_title": "Distributed restoration in optical networks using feed-forward neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238293400005"}
