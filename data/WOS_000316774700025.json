A novel model is proposed to describe the systems taken into two sides of communication channels in the network environment, which is more general than one side of communication channel. The design procedure of observer-based controller is presented, which, guarantees the asymptotic stability in the mean square of the resulting closed-loop system with an H-infinity performance. Finally, a crane example is utilized to show the effectiveness and potential of the developed techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
