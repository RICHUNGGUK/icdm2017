We develop a method for deployment of wavelength converters in wavelength-routed networks with an overlay model. In these networks, most wavelength converters are deployed on edge nodes to cover the difference in the numbers of wavelengths multiplexed on access and core links. Therefore reduction of wavelength converter cost on edge nodes leads to minimizing the wavelength converter cost in the whole network. We propose an ingress edge node architecture with fixed wavelength converters that have limited wavelength convertibility but are more economical than full wavelength converters. In our architecture, each input access link of ingress edge nodes is equipped with fixed wavelength converters, and input wavelengths from the access links are evenly distributed on the output core link. As a result, competition for a free wavelength on an output core link is avoided. Simulation results show that our edge node architecture offers about 20% cost reduction compared with a node architecture that uses only full wavelength converters where networks are actually under operation and a full wavelength converter cost to fixed wavelength converter cost ratio is 3: 1.
