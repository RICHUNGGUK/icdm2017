This computation is done by coupling a bifurcation indicator proposed recently (Cadou et al., 2006)[1] and a direct method (Jackson, 1987; Jepson, 1981)[2,3] which consists in solving an augmented system whose solutions are Hopf bifurcation points. The bifurcation indicator gives initial critical values (Reynolds number, Strouhal frequency) for the direct method iterations Some classical numerical examples from fluid mechanics, in two dimensions, are studied to demonstrate the efficiency and the reliability of such an algorithm (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "A numerical algorithm coupling a bifurcating indicator and a direct method for the computation of Hopf bifurcation points in fluid mechanics", "paper_id": "WOS:000278664700013"}
