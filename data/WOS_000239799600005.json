Such parsing strategies are seen as constructions of push-down devices from grammars. We show that preservation of probability distribution is possible under two conditions, viz. the correct-prefix property and the property of strong predictiveness. These results generalize existing results in the literature that were obtained by considering parsing strategies in isolation. From our general results, we also derive negative results on so-called generalized LR parsing.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic parsing strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000239799600005"}
