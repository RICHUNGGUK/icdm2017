Direct numerical simulations (DNS) and large eddy simulations (LES) are combined to simulate this complicated process based on a 2-D multiscale model. A Lagrange particle method is used to simulate rain droplets in the LES zone, far away from the cylinder surface. When droplets fall into the DNS zone, i.e., near the cylinder surface, the particles are converted into liquid droplets. The volume-of-fluid (VOF) method is then adopted to capture the morphology of the interface of the liquid-gas system. Rainwater morphology evolution along the circumference of cylinder can be categorized into four patterns over the analysis of the entire evolution process: collision-splashing, accumulation-slipping, formation-breaking, and dynamic equilibrium. The morphological characteristics of rainwater of each pattern are summarized. The circumferentially vibrating upper rivulet across the cylinder surface is observed. The resultant multiscale model is validated by comparison with the previous results from related studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
