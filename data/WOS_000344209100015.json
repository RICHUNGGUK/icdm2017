What's more, current rule languages capable of representing fuzzy and nonmonotonic knowledge have heterogeneity in the aspects of syntaxes and semantics, which results in difficulties of communication among various systems. Therefore, in-depth studies on technologies of fuzzy rule interchange have become an important issue in the Semantic Web. Based on the above, we start with the investigation of general rule interchange format capable of interchanging fuzzy and nonmonotonic knowledge. First we propose f-RIF (fuzzy RIF), visually model f-RIF, and define its concrete syntax and semantics. Secondly, centered on f-RIF metamodel, we construct a fuzzy rule interchange architecture f-RIA (fuzzy Rule Interchange Architecture). The architecture supports fuzzy rule interchange between metamodels of different rule languages, and between abstract syntaxes and concrete syntaxes in the same rule languages. Thirdly, we deeply analyze the issue of information loss which is unavoidable in the process of fuzzy rule interchange, and present corresponding remedial measures to reduce adverse effects. Finally, we implement a prototype system f-RIA 1.0, and give experimental analyses. The constructed interchange architecture and the implemented prototype system can effectively solve the communication issue of current heterogeneous systems and enhance the capabilities of rules and rule systems in the aspects of representing and interchanging fuzzy and nonmonotonic knowledge. The current work lays a solid foundation on fuzzy rule reasoning in the Semantic Web. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
