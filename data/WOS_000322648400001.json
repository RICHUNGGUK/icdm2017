This special issue is devoted to the topics of the latest research and development on green mobile networking and communications. Nowadays, the explosive development of information and communication technology has significantly enlarged both the energy demands and CO2 emissions, and consequently makes the energy crisis and global warming problems worse. To meet the requirements of low-carbon economic development, mobile networking and communications techniques should be green and energy-aware, while maintaining an acceptable quality of service for various applications. This special issue explores the recent research contributions in designing, building and deploying green networks and communications. The selected papers are classified into three categories: green mobile networking, green cloud and data center networking and green wireless communications. A comprehensive overview of the selected papers is given below.", "paper_title": "Green Mobile Networking and Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000322648400001"}
