Gray-scale intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a powerful tomographic modality providing a thorough visualization of coronary arteries. Among the existing methods, virtual histology (VH) is the most popular and clinically available technique for plaque component analysis, it suffers however from a poor longitudinal resolution. In order to surmount this demerit, a new image-based methodology for plaque assessment is suggested here that differentiates tissue components into four classes: calcium, necrotic core, fibrous and fibro-lipid. A rich set of five textural feature families are extracted from IVUS images, computed at different scales. The main contribution of this paper is that tissue classification is accomplished using the principles of multiple classifiers combination approach. At the first stage, an ensemble of base SVM classifiers is constructed from each feature family, separately. The fuzzy outputs of the individual classifiers are then aggregated to provide the final fused results. We investigate four efficient decision fusion schemes of the literature and the SVM fuser. Extensive experimentation is carried out to highlight the merits of the suggested schemes against single SVM classifiers that use reduced feature subsets obtained after feature selection or the entire feature space. The analysis demonstrates that the decision fusion techniques offer improved classification accuracies, compared to single SVM classifiers and existing methods in IVUS imaging. In addition, the method provides accurate assessments of plaque composition in IVUS images.", "paper_title": "Decision Fusion of Multiple Classifiers for Corollary Plaque Characterization from IVUS Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000336744300007"}
