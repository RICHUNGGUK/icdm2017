Multimedia forensics technology has become a new topic in the field of information security. In this paper, a new source video system identification algorithm is proposed based on the features in the video stream; it takes full advantage of the different characteristics in the rate control module and the motion prediction module, which are two open parts in the MPEG-2 video compression standard, and combines a support vector machine classifier to build an intelligent computing system for video source identification. The experiments show this proposed algorithm can effectively identify video streams that come from a number of video coding systems.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL SOURCE MPEG-2 VIDEO IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000285972300007"}
