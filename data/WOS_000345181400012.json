To do this we take into account that weighted means and OWA operators are particular cases of Choquet integral. So, SUOWA operators are Choquet integral-based operators where their capacities are constructed by using semi-uninorms and the values of the capacities associated to the weighted means and the OWA operators. We also show some interesting properties of these new operators and provide examples showing that SUOWA and WOWA operators are different classes of aggregation operators. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
