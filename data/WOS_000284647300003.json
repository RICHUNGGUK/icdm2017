The ESNN possesses a hybrid learning algorithm that consists of a Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) mechanism fused with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The design and implementation direction utilizes the latest advancements in FPGA technology to provide a partitioned hardware/software co-design solution. The approach achieves the maximum FPGA flexibility obtainable for the ESNN paradigm. The algorithm was applied as an embedded intelligent system robotic controller to solve an autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance problem.", "paper_title": "AN FPGA HARDWARE/SOFTWARE CO-DESIGN TOWARDS EVOLVABLE SPIKING NEURAL NETWORKS FOR ROBOTICS APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647300003"}
