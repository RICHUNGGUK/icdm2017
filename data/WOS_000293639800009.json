The dynamic model is formulated in the joint space and three holonomic constraint equations are derived to specify the coupling relationships between the actuated legs and the moving platform. The associated constraint forces are determined to be internal forces and it leads to a novel model where the dynamics of the moving platform can be separated from that of the actuated legs. By utilizing the developed model, the constraint forces can be computed more efficiently as compared to the conventional approach. After compensation of the coupling dynamics, each actuated legs could be considered as a decoupled system. The coupling behavior of the parallel mechanism can then be easily illustrated by the proposed model. To facilitate real-time control implementation, the derived model can be further simplified and a decentralized control scheme integrated with a disturbance observer is proposed. The computational efficiency and tracking performances for the proposed control method are then validated by computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Modeling and Decentralized Control of a 3 PRS Parallel Mechanism Based on Constrained Robotic Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000293639800009"}
