The uncertainty in processing times is represented by means of fuzzy numbers, hence the name fuzzy flexible job-shop scheduling. We propose an effective genetic algorithm hybridised with tabu search and heuristic seeding to minimise the total time needed to complete all jobs, known as makespan. To build a high-quality and diverse set of initial solutions we introduce a heuristic method which benefits from the flexible nature of the problem. This initial population will be the starting point for the genetic algorithm, which then applies tabu search to every generated chromosome. The tabu search algorithm relies on a neighbourhood structure that is proposed and analysed in this paper; in particular, some interesting properties are proved, such as feasibility and connectivity. Additionally, we incorporate a filtering mechanism to reduce the neighbourhood size and a method that allows to speed-up the evaluation of new chromosomes. To assess the performance of the resulting method and compare it with the state-of-the-art, we present an extensive computational study on a benchmark with 205 instances, considering both deterministic and fuzzy instances to enhance the significance of the study. The results of these experiments clearly show that not only does the hybrid algorithm benefit from the synergy among its components but it is also quite competitive with the state-of-the-art when solving both crisp and fuzzy instances, providing new best-known solutions for a number of these test instances.
