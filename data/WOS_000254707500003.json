For nonperiodic sequences we consider normalized measures and study the set of accumulation points for a fixed sequence. We see that set of accumulation points is always a closed subinterval of [0,1]. For binary or ternary FCSRs we see that this interval is of the form [B, 1- B], a result that is an analog of an earlier result by Dai, Jiang, Imamura, and Gong for LFSRs.", "paper_title": "The asymptotic behavior of N-adic complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000254707500003"}
