To exploit parallelism in loops a system of equations representing the dependencies between the loop iterations and a system of non-equations indicating the loop boundary conditions has to be solved. This is a NP-Complete problem. Our major contribution in this paper has been to apply genetic algorithm to solve system of equation and non-equation resulted from loop dependency analysis techniques to find two dependent loop iterations. We use distance vector to find the rest of dependencies.", "paper_title": "A new approach to parallelization of serial nested loops using genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000237562600005"}
