In this paper, the authors outline a new approach for achieving segmented mesh generation. The image is first subjected to centroidal Voronoi tessellation and Delaunay tessellation steered by a density map to create a triangular mesh while maintaining discontinuities between materials. Given an input domain and a number of initial sites, the energy function is minimized automatically by iteratively updating the Voronoi tessellation and relocating sites to produce optimized domain discretization and form the mesh. Thus, the mesh in question is effectively and quickly segmented into different parts via this new graph cut method. The proposed approach is considered more efficient because there are fewer triangles than pixels, which reduces computation time and memory usage.", "paper_title": "Generation of Segmented Triangular Meshes From CT Images Based on Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation and the Graph Cut Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000331145500009"}
