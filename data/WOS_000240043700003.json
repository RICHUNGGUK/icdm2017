The certificate is a piece of evidence that proves that the answer has not been compromised by a bug in the implementation. We give linear-time certifying algorithms for recognition of interval graphs and permutation graphs, and for a few other related problems. Previous algorithms fail to provide supporting evidence when they claim that the input graph is not a member of the class. We show that our certificates of nonmembership can be authenticated in O(vertical bar V vertical bar) time.", "paper_title": "Certifying algorithms for recognizing interval graphs and permutation graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240043700003"}
