Web Service is one of import component of the new paradigm. This paper presents a design and implementation of GIS Web Service for mobile devices. As many mobile devices are equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System), it is required to handle the position information more effectively. We have extended the proxy program in the client device to actively send the context information to the server. Based on the context information the server determines the optimal service mode to a particular client. A working example of location-based GIS Web Service is also presented. By using Web Service standards and XML messages we can achieve the maximal interoperability for heterogeneous mobile devices.", "paper_title": "GIS Web Service using context information in mobile environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900097"}
