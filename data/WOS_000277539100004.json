Design/methodology/approach - Laboratory experiments well documented in quantum mechanics and particle physics are employed as supporting evidence. Findings - A yoyo model explanation for Stern-Gerlach experiment is provided. The yoyo structures of an electron and a positron are established. Other than illustrating how a radioactive element is decayed, the paper provides an argument for why n-quark yoyos can theoretically exist in the physical world, for any natural number n. Originality/value - The paper shows how some properties of the general systemic yoyo model can be established and how some of these very properties can be employed to deepen the understanding of the elementary particles studied in particle physics.", "paper_title": "Particle yoyos and their quark structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100004"}
