The protective composite wall consists of two materials. An insulating material is placed on the outer surface, while, for the inner surface, materials that have good heat storage properties but negligible heat transfer resistance are chosen. The results show that by replacing some of the insulation material with a heat storage material, the temperature of the protected system can be maintained at a considerably lower level. Although the optimal thickness ratio X depends on the Biot number, Fourier number, and on the heat capacity ratio K (C), for a large number of thermal protection cases, the approximation X=0.45 yields practically the minimum progress of the transient. If the Biot number is sufficiently small, it is better to replace all of the insulation material with a good heat storage material.", "paper_title": "Optimal structure for heat and cold protection under transient heat conduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000258547400003"}
