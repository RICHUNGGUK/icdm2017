In its broadest sense, scheduling of scientific applications in distributed Grid and Cloud environments can be regarded as a market-based negotiation between a scheduling service optimizing user-centric objectives (execution time, budget), and a resource manager optimizing provider-centric metrics (resource utilization, income, job throughput). In this paper, we propose a new instantiation of the negotiation protocol between the scheduler and resource manager using a market-based Continuous Double Auction (CDA) model. We analyze different scheduling strategies that can be applied and identify general strategic patterns that can lead to a fast and cheap work ow execution. In the experimental study, we demonstrate that under certain circumstances one can benefit by applying an aggressive scheduling strategy.", "paper_title": "Double Auction-based Scheduling of Scientific Applications in Distributed Grid and Cloud Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000297136800006"}
