We describe a dynamic time window reduction technique to speed up this approach. The time windows are transferred from nodes to arcs in order to take advantage of dual information and to tighten as much as possible the time variable domains. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated through computational experiments on randomly generated instances involving several depots and up to 900 tasks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
