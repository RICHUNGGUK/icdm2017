The target model is updated according to the similarity between the initial and current models, and this makes the tracker more robust. The proposed algorithm has been compared with other trackers using challenging image sequences, and it provides better performance.", "paper_title": "Integrating color and shape-texture features for adaptive real-time object tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000252454800013"}
