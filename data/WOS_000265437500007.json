Our approach is based on shape/color filtering guided by a vector field that describes the flow of salient features in the image. This flow-based filtering significantly improves the abstraction performance in terms of feature enhancement and stylization. Our method is simple, fast, and easy to implement. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing stylistic and feature-enhancing illustrations from photographs.", "paper_title": "Flow-Based Image Abstraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000265437500007"}
