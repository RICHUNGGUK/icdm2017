Patrick Perez and his colleagues generalized that image editing tasks concern either global changes or local changes confined to a selection[1]. Here we focus on local editing of images' color-object-based image recoloring. In this paper, we introduce a framework for recoloring destination region (desired object) with desired color, which integrates alpha matting and compositing and color transformation algorithms to provide an object-based recoloring tool for common users. There are three steps in the framework: matte extraction, color transformation and alpha compositing. We present a fast color histogram specification as a general method for example-based color transformation. In some cases, our framework to the recoloring problem are quite simple but works well. We thus feel that the primary contribution of this paper may lie in the organic integration of algorithms totally.", "paper_title": "Object-based image recoloring using alpha matte and color histogram specification", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900022"}
