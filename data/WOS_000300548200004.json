We present an algorithm for determining the reversibility of this family of cellular automata. We also answer the reversibility question for some special subfamilies. Finally, we present some examples of this family of cellular automata under the reflective boundary condition.", "paper_title": "ON 1D REVERSIBLE CELLULAR AUTOMATA WITH REFLECTIVE BOUNDARY OVER THE PRIME FIELD OF ORDER p", "paper_id": "WOS:000300548200004"}
