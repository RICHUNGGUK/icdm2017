The proposed model is accurate with only a 2-3% difference in peak-to-peak core switching noise as compared to the Ansoft Nexxim4.1 equivalent model. The proposed model is 3-4 times faster than Ansoft Nexxim4.1 and uses two times less memory as compared to the Ansoft Nexxim4.1 equivalent model. In this article we also thoroughly establish design guidelines for almost flat output impedance magnitude at each stage of a vertical chain of power distribution TSV pairs to realize a resonance free scenario over a wide operating frequency range. We also establish decoupling capacitance design guidelines based on the optimum output impedance and critically damped supply voltage for the core logic for each stage of a vertical chain of power distribution TSV pairs.", "paper_title": "Modeling of peak-to-peak core switching noise, output impedance, and decoupling capacitance along a vertical chain of power distribution TSV pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700032"}
