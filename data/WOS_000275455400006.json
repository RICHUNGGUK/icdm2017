Understanding of its mechanism is expected to be used for realizing adaptive locomotion of a humanoid robot as well. In this paper, a jumping robot driven by pneumatic artificial muscles is designed to duplicate human leg structure and function. It has three joints and nine muscles, three of them are biarticular muscles. For controlling such a redundant robot, we take biomechanical findings into account: biarticular muscles mainly contribute to joint coordination whereas monoarticular muscles contribute to provide power. Through experiments, we find (1) the biarticular muscles realize coordinated movement of joints when knee and/or hip is extended, (2) the extension of the ankle does not lead to coordinated movement, and (3) we can superpose extension of the knee with that of the hip without losing the joint coordination. The obtained knowledge can be used not only for robots, but may also contribute to understanding of adaptive human mechanism.", "paper_title": "Pneumatic-driven jumping robot with anthropomorphic muscular skeleton structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000275455400006"}
