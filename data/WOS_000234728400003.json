A novel finite element method which uses discretization along the characteristic line is used for simulation. The solver is coupled to a mesh movement scheme using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation to account for body motion in the flow field. Two cases of cylinder motion have been studied, cross flow and inline oscillation. In both cases, occurrence of lock on is investigated and the bounds of the lock on region are determined. A comparison of the numerical results with the experimental data indicates that 2D simulation is valid up to Re = 300. Beyond that, 3D effects appear. By using flow visualization, effect of a cylinder oscillation on the flow field and wake pattern has been studied. Also, variation of the mean drag coefficient against the oscillation parameters is discussed. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data available in the literature.
