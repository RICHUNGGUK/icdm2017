The supramolecular synthon pattern of O-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonds linking dimers and pi-pi stacking interactions were described within the QTAIM (quantum theory of atoms in molecules) /DFT (density functional theory) formalism. Both proton donor and acceptor sites in O-H center dot center dot center dot N bonds were characterized using H-1-O-17 and H-1-N-14 NQDR spectroscopies and QTAIM. The possibility of the existence of O-H center dot center dot center dot H-O dihydrogen bonds was excluded. The weak intermolecular interactions in the crystals of clioquinol and cloxiquine were detected and examined. The results obtained in this work suggest that considerable differences in the NQR parameters for the planar and twisted supramolecular synthons permit differentiation between specific polymorphic forms, and indicate that the more planar supramolecular synthons are accompanied by a greater number of weaker hydrogen bonds linking them and stronger pi center dot center dot center dot pi stacking interactions.", "paper_title": "Supramolecular synthon pattern in solid clioquinol and cloxiquine (APIs of antibacterial, antifungal, antiaging and antituberculosis drugs) studied by Cl-35 NQR, H-1-O-17 and H-1-N-14 NQDR and DFT/QTAIM", "paper_id": "WOS:000292290600024"}
