We consider two types of decision making policies: (1) a risk-neutral decision-making policy that is based on a cost-minirnization approach and (2) a risk-averse policy wherein, rather than selecting facilities and identifying the pertinent supplier-consumer assignments that minimize the expected cost, the decision-maker uses a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach to measure and quantify risk and to define what comprises a worst-case scenario. The CVaR methodology allows the decision-maker to specify to what extent worst-case scenarios should be avoided and the corresponding costs associated with such a policy. After introducing the underlying optimization models, we present computational analysis and statistical analysis to compare the results of the risk-averse and risk-neutral policies. In addition, we provide several managerial insights. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
