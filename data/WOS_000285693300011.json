These components represent the targets to researches in order to better understand the behavior of the Web, where the owners and the users in this environment exist as out factors. Web page Usage information is the term which describes ways and methods of using the Web. Various factors affect the use of the diversity of the resources in the Web, The non-linear way of its growth, and the evolution in the methods for how we build the Web pages which eventually leads to reflecting the users' interests. Personalizing the results of search engines are created to meet the users need for information on the Web. Generally, the researchers seek user's satisfaction through utilizing these search engines to serve the user. One of the most efficient methods in this domain is the use of semantic measure algorithms to personalize and recognize the outputs of the information resources according to the users' needs. The Web is represented as three aspects: Content, Structure, and Usage. Three components can lead to a personalized Web in order to reinforce the semantic value. This paper will present a model that uses new Web Usage information to see the effects on the semantic values, and how it will help us achieve a robust well personalized and organized Web. It will consider the Usage space as the field of our research as we will simulate this environment in the MAS \"Multi Agents System\" and CAS \"Complex Adaptive System \"paradigm.", "paper_title": "Personalising the Dynamic Information Resources in a Self Organized Web System Using CAS and MAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000285693300011"}
