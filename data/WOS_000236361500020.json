According to the discrete feature of Adalines' input and output, the sensitivity is defined as the probability of an Adaline's erroneous outputs due to weight perturbation with respect to all possible inputs. By means of hypercube model and analytical geometry method, a heuristic algorithm is given to accurately compute the sensitivity. The accuracy of the algorithm is verified by computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Computation of Adalines' sensitivity to weight perturbation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236361500020"}
