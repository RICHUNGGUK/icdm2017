In this paper, we present a MATLAB-based program for processing geochemical data by means of fractal/multifractal modeling. The procedure consists of two functional parts. First, we quantify the spatial distribution characteristics of geochemical patterns using the multifractal spectrum. Second, geochemical anomalies are identified using various fractal/multifractal models. These models include the concentration-area fractal model, spectrum-area multifractal model, and multifractal singularity analysis. The results can be visualized in the MATLAB platform or saved for further analysis, i.e., by geographic information systems software. We demonstrate the applicability of this program by processing a geochemical dataset from soil samples taken in Inner Mongolia, China. We examine the concentrations of Ag in these soil samples, and show that the results obtained by our program are highly correlated with known Ag deposits in the region of interest.", "paper_title": "A MATLAB-based program for processing geochemical data using fractal/multifractal modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000365266900017"}
