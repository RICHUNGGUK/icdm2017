The approach is illustrated through the construction of compound Spherical-Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces. It starts with a subdivision mechanism that can generate a perfect sphere. This mechanism stems from the geometric definition of the sphere shape. Thus, it comes with a trivial proof that the target of the construction is what it is. Furthermore, the similarity of this mechanism to the Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme is exploited to embed spherical surfaces within Catmull-Clark Surfaces, which holds a great potential for many practical applications.", "paper_title": "An approach for embedding regular analytic shapes with subdivision surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600036"}
