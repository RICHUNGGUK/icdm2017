Alarm processing requires meeting two demanding objectives: high accuracy, which ensures zero or very low alarm misses, and high scalability, which requires highly efficient and optimal processing of spatial alarms. In this paper, we propose to use safe period optimizations to minimize the number of unnecessary spatial alarm evaluations, increasing the throughput and scalability of the system. We also develop a suite of alarm grouping techniques, based on spatial locality of the alarms and motion behavior of the mobile users, which reduce the safe period computation costs. Subscriber mobility-based optimizations are introduced to further enhance the performance of the system. An evaluation of our approach using a road network simulator shows that the proposed motion-aware safe period-based approach to spatial alarm processing offers significant performance enhancements.", "paper_title": "A motion-aware safe period-based framework for spatial alarm processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000281919000004"}
