The objective of this letter is to propose a simple method, using piecewise linear fitting, for the calculation of these figures of merit in rain fading channels. Rain fading affecting the signal amplitude is described by log-lognormal distribution. The results are focused on well-accepted DVB-S2 satellite communication system. Finally, a lower bound for the ergodic constrained capacity of log-lognormal channels is given. The numerical results highlight the accuracy of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "On the Calculation of Constrained Capacity and Outage Probability of Broadband Satellite Communication Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681600002"}
