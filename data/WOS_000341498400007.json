Recently, a set of simple and powerful parallel building blocks () has been proposed to support modelling and implementation of parallel frameworks. In this work we demonstrate how that same parallel building block set may be used to model both general purpose parallel programming abstractions, not usually listed in classical skeleton sets, and more specialized domain specific parallel patterns. We show how an implementation of can be realised via the FastFlow framework and present experimental evidence of the feasibility and efficiency of the approach.", "paper_title": "Design patterns percolating to parallel programming framework implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000341498400007"}
