Traditional discretization methods categorize a continuous attribute into a number of bins. Because they are made on crisp discretization, there exists considerable information loss. Fuzzy discretization allows overlapping intervals and reflects linguistic classification. However, the number of intervals, the boundaries of intervals, and the degrees of overlapping are intractable to get optimized and a discretization process increases the total amount of data being transformed. We use a genetic algorithm with feature selection not only to optimize these parameters but also to reduce the amount of transformed data by filtering the unconcerned attributes. Experimental results showed considerable improvement on the classification accuracy over a crisp discretization and a typical fuzzy discretization with feature selection.", "paper_title": "Feature selection in genetic fuzzy discretization for the pattern classification problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840000005"}
