Due to non-smooth nonlinearities from the saturation limits, these values cannot be determined by the conventional tuning methods based on linear analysis. Only ad hoc tuning procedures have been used. A nonlinear least squares method, which is the Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm. is used in this paper. The gradient required in the Gauss-Newton method can be computed by applying trajectory sensitivities from the hybrid system model with the differential-algebraic-impulsive-switched (DAIS) structure. The optimal output limits of the PSS tuned by the proposed method are evaluated by time-domain simulation in a multi-machine power system (MMPS).", "paper_title": "Hybrid system based nonlinear least squares optimization applied to a multi-machine power system control", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100041"}
