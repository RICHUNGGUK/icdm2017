Models of the NMOS transistor, the vertical n-p-n transistor, the diode, and the resistor have been developed, suitable for circuit-level simulation. Large-signal, and small-signal models are provided for transient and alternating current (ac) simulation, respectively. A self-heating model is included for accurate simulation of the device ON-resistance under transient high-current conditions.", "paper_title": "Compact Modeling of on-chip ESD protection devices using verilog-A", "paper_id": "WOS:000237956000008"}
