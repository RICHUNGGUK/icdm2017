We propose a scalable quality management of massive sensor data, which handles less frequent data access through discarding supplementary layers as time elapses for efficient usage of storage space. The efficacy of our scheme is shown by its capability to offer multiple fidelity levels compactly utilizing spatio-temporal correlation, without compromising key features of sensor data. In order to store a huge amount of data from various sensor types efficiently, we also study the optimal storage configuration strategy using analytical models that can capture characteristics of our scheme. This strategy helps storing sensor data blocks while minimizing total distortion under a given total rate budget.", "paper_title": "Scalable management of storage for massive quality-adjustable sensor data", "paper_id": "WOS:000358131600001"}
