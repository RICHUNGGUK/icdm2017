Synchronous and asynchronous distributed discrete state acquisition algorithms are proposed; their convergence is studied and implementation models are given. Distributed part differentiation methods are proposed. A multithreaded Java Smart Surface Simulator (SSS) which runs on multi-core machines is presented. A series of computational results obtained with SSS is given and analyzed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
