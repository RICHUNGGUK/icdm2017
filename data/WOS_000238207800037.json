We propose a novel computational approach to checking consistency, coherence and completeness of procedural security requirements defined by aviation security guidelines. To deal with uncertainty, we use probabilistic modeling techniques, combining abstract state machine modeling with symbolic model checking.", "paper_title": "Computational modeling and experimental validation of aviation security procedures", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800037"}
