By modeling EF traffic flows and the excess of network resources reserved for it, we derive the range of delay values which are required to support these flows at DiffServ nodes. This enables us to develop an end-to-end (e2e) delay budget-partitioning mechanism and traffic-engineering techniques within a framework for supporting new premium QoS levels, which are differentiated based on e2e delay, jitter and loss. This framework enables ingress routers to control EF traffic flow admission and select appropriate routing paths, with the goal of EF traffic balancing, avoiding traffic congestion and getting the most use out of the available network resources through traffic engineering. As a result, this framework should enable Internet service providers to provide three performance levels of EF service class to their customers provided that their network is DiffServ MPLS TE aware.
