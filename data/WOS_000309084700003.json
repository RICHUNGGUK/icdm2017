According to the level of design-related characteristics including design-related communication and design-related nature, we identify four types of supplier manufacturer relationships: sequential mode, passive supplier involvement, active supplier involvement, and strategic development. Differing from qualitative and survey-oriented research, this study proposes a system dynamics model for the quantitative exploration of workload impacts on R&D-system equilibrium under different supplier-manufacturer relationships. We justify experimentally the NPD performances of these supplier manufacturer relationship configurations under workload impacts and provide managerial insights. (C) 2012 IMACS.
