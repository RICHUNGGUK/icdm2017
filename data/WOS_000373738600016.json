A more practical assumption is statistical CSI as the channel statistics are likely to remain unchanged for a longer period. In this letter, we propose a precoder design, using only statistical CSI, to minimize error probability for practical MIMO systems with channel estimation errors. Our proposed precoder design is shown to achieve a significant improvement in error performance when compared with other precoding schemes in literature. For example, for a real 4 x 4 MIMO system with BPSK modulation and at a codeword error rate of 10(-3), coding gains of up to 12 dB can be achieved.", "paper_title": "Statistical Precoding for MIMO Systems With Channel Estimation Errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000373738600016"}
