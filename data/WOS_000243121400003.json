The TBM model is identical to the classical model except all probability functions are replaced by belief functions, which are more flexible for representing uncertainty. It is felt that the tracking phase is well handled by the classical Kalman filter but that the classification phase deserves amelioration. For the tracking phase, we derive a minimal set of assumptions needed in the TBM approach in order to recover the classical relations. For the classification phase, we distinguish between the observed target behaviors and the underlying target classes which are usually not in one-to-one correspondence. We feel the results obtained with the TBM approach are more reasonable than those obtained with the corresponding Bayesian classifiers. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
