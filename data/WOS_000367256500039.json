This knowledge has been used pervasively in quantitative studies of software through practices such as normalization on size metrics. This paper reports size-related super- and sublinear effects that have not been known before. Findings obtained on a very large collection of Java programs - 30,911 projects hosted at Google Code as of Summer 2011 - unveils how certain characteristics of programs vary disproportionately with program size, sometimes even non-monotonically. Many of the specific parameters of nonlinear relations are reported. This result gives further in-sights for the differences of \"programming in the small\" vs. \"programming in the large.\" The reported findings carry important consequences for OO software metrics, and software research in general: metrics that have been known to correlate with size can now be properly normalized so that all the information that is left in them is size-independent.", "paper_title": "How Scale Affects Structure in Java Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000367256500039"}
