PPO nodes must be able to learn about the signal propagation properties of the surrounding optical fibers and make their wavelength-routing decisions based on the collected data. We discuss what are the open challenges that must be overcome to provide optical networking solutions based on cost-effective PPO nodes. Three possible PPO node hardware architectures with trade-offs in complexity, cost, and functionality are presented along with their built-in fiber characterization techniques.
