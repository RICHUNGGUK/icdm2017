Constructive lower bounds better than these existential bounds are derived from geometric codes, either over or or over even degree extensions of In the latter case the approach is concatenation with a good code for the Hamming metric as outer code and a short code for the Lee metric as an inner code. In the former case lower bounds on the minimum Lee distance are derived by algebraic geometric arguments inspired by results of Wu et al.
