We extend this class to mix-weighted congestion games on parallel links, where weights may as well be negative. For the resulting simple class, we study the complexity of deciding the existence of a pure equilibrium, where no player could unilaterally improve her cost by switching to another link. We show that even for a single negative weight, this decision problem is strongly NP-complete when the number of links is part of the input; the problem is NP-complete already for two links. When the number of links is a fixed constant, we show, through a pseudopolynomial, dynamic programming algorithm, that the problem is not strongly NP-complete unless P = NP; the algorithm works for any number of negative weights.
