Using different classification methods this study compares the potential of these two features for identifying abnormal repolarization on the ECG. A group of healthy volunteers and LQT2 carriers were used to train classification algorithms using measures of T-wave morphology and QTc. The ability to correctly classify a third group of test subjects before and after receiving D,L-sotalol was evaluated using classification rules derived from training. As a single electrocardiographic feature, T-wave morphology separates normal from abnormal repolarization better than QTc. It is further indicated that nonlinear boundaries can provide stronger classifiers than a linear boundaries. Whether this is true in general with other ECG markers and other data sets is uncertain because the approach has not been tested in this setting. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
