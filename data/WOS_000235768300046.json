Research highlighted includes relationships between finger contact area, pressure applied and other physical characteristics. With the development of small scale fingerprint readers it is starting to be possible to incorporate these into a wide range of technologies. Analysis of finger pressure and contact area can enhance fingerprint based biometric security systems. The fingertip comprises a range of biological materials which give it complex mechanical properties. These properties govern the way in which a fingertip deforms under load. Anthropometric measurements were taken from 11 males and 5 females along with fingerprint area measurements. Strong correlations were found between fingerprint area and many other measurements, including hand length. Notably there were more strong correlations for the female group than for the male. This pilot study indicates the feasibility of fingerprint area analysis for biometric identification. This work is part of a long term program of human physical characterization.", "paper_title": "The use of fingerprint contact area for biometric identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300046"}
