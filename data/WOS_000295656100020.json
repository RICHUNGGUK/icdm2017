Though a number of bio-crypto algorithms have been proposed, they have limited practical applicability because they lack of cancelability. Since biometrics are immutable, the users whose biometrics are stolen cannot use bio-crypto systems anymore. Cancelable biometric schemes are of cancelability; however, they are difficult to compromise the conflicts between the security and performance. By embedded a novel cancelable palmprint template, namely \"two dimensional (2D) Palmprint Phasor\", the proposed palmprint cryptosystem overcomes the lack of cancelability in existing biometric cryptosysterns. Besides, the authentication performance is enhanced when users have different tokens/keys. Furthermore, we develop a novel dual-key-binding cancelable palmprint cryptosystem to enhance the security and privacy of palmprint biometric. 20 Palmprint Phasor template is scrambled by the scrambling transformation based on the chaotic sequence that is generated by both the user's token/key and strong key extracted from palmprint. Dual-key-binding scrambling not only has more robustness to resist against chosen plain text attack, but also enhances the secure requirement of non-invertibility. 20 Palmprint Phasor algorithm and dual-key-binding scrambling both increase the difficulty of adversary's statistical analysis. The experimental results and security analysis confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
