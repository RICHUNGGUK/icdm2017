The robust loss function is also proposed to solve the shortcoming of epsilon-insensitive loss function during handling hybrid noises. A novel robust wavelet support vector machine (RW v-SVM) is proposed based on wavelet theory and the modified support vector machine. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed to select the optimal parameters of RW v-SVM model in the scope of constraint permission. The results of application in car demand forecasts show that the forecasting approach based on the RW v-SVM model is effective and feasible, the comparison between the method proposed in this paper and other ones is also given which proves this method is better than RW v-SVM and other traditional methods.
