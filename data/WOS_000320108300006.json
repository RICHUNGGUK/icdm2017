Such projects impact diverse groups of stakeholders, each with their legitimate interests and expectations. Levels of stakeholder trust can be expected to vary in large-scale implementations (which can take several years), and cannot be taken for granted. Previous studies have largely focused on the taxonomic deconstruction of the trust construct, through point-in-time variance studies. They have identified the relationship between trust and project outcomes, but largely ignored the dynamics of trust relations. Giddens, as part of his study of modernity, theorises trust dynamics in relation to abstract social systems, though without focusing on information systems. We use Giddens' concepts to investigate evolving trust relationships in a longitudinal case analysis of a large Integrated Hospital System implementation for the Faroe Islands. Trust relationships suffered a serious breakdown, but the project was able to recover and meet its goals. We develop six theoretical propositions theorising the relationship between trust and project outcomes, the maintenance, breakdown and restoration of trust, the role of the information system in restoring trust, and the emergent and reciprocal nature of trust and project outcomes.", "paper_title": "Trust dynamics in a large system implementation: six theoretical propositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000320108300006"}
