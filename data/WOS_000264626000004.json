The hardware circuit has the functions of quadrature encoder decoding, limit switch detecting, pulse width modulation (PWM) generating and CMOS image signal capturing. The software embedded in Nios II micro processor has the functions of using UART to communicate with PC, robotic inverse kinematics calculation, robotic motion control schemes, digital image processing and gobang game AI algorithms. The digital hardware circuits are designed by using Verilog language, and programs in Nios II micro processor are coded with C language. An Altera Statrix II EP2S60F672C5Es FPGA chip is adopted as the main CPU of the development board. A CMOS color image sensor with 356 x292 pixels resolution is selected to catch the environment time-varying change for robotic vision-based servo control. The system performance is evaluated by experimental tests. A gobang game is planned to reveal the visual servo robotic motion control objective in non-autonomous environment. Here, a model-free intelligent self-organizing fuzzy control strategy is employed to design the robotic joint controller. A vision based trajectory planning algorithm is designed to calculate the desired angular positions or trajectory on-line of each robotic joint. The experimental results show that this visual servo control robot has reliable control actions.", "paper_title": "Vision-Based Robotic Motion Control for Non-autonomous Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000264626000004"}
