The SPARSEST t-SPANNER problem asks to find, for a given graph G and an integer t, a t-spanner of G with the minimum number of edges. The problem is known to be NP-hard for all t >= 2, and, even more, it is NP-hard to approximate it with ratio O(log n) for every t >= 2. For t >= 5, the problem remains NP-hard for planar graphs and the approximability status of the problem on planar graphs was open. We resolve this open issue by showing that the SPARSEST t-SPANNER problem admits the efficient polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS) for every t >= 1. Our result holds for a much wider class of graphs, namely, the class of apex-minor-free graphs, which contains the classes of planar and bounded genus graphs. Moreover, it is possible to extend our results to weighted apex-minor free graphs, when the maximum edge weight is bounded by some constant. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
