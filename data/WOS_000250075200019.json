Ergonomics analysis is the important step for product validation in the process, and the virtual human is key to the computer-aided product ergonomics. In this paper, ergonomics simulation system is studied based on some elements of ergonomics analysis and assessment. An ergonomics virtual human is built, which is a unified framework made up of biomechanics/physiology-based model, anthropometrical model, posture and motion model, task model, human reactions and decision-making model and human factor analysis model. The framework is applied to virtual prototyping and virtual product development.
