The non-optimal wheel slip level during braking, causing inability to achieve the desired tire-road friction force strongly influences the braking distance. In addition, steerability and maneuverability of the vehicle could be disturbed. In this paper, an active neuro-fuzzy approach has been developed for improving the wheel slip control in the longitudinal direction of the commercial vehicle. The dynamic neural network has been used for prediction and an adaptive control of the brake actuation pressure, during each braking cycle, according to the identified maximum adhesion coefficient between the wheel and road surface. The brake actuation pressure was dynamically adjusted on the level that provides the optimal level of the longitudinal wheel slip vs. the brake pressure selected by driver, the current vehicle speed, the brake interface temperature, vehicle load conditions, and the current value of longitudinal wheel slip. Thus the dynamic neural network model operates (learn, generalize and predict) on-line during each braking cycle, fuzzy logic has been integrated with the neural model as a support to the neural controller control actions in the case when prediction error of the dynamic neural model reached the predefined value. The hybrid control approach presented here provided intelligent dynamic model - based control of the brake actuation pressure in order to keep the longitudinal wheel slip on the optimum level during a braking cycle.
