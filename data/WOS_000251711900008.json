In each \"cluster\" individuals contact fully. A given individual contact individuals in other \"clusters\" by links. Then we study the dynamical behavior of the epidemiological model in this complex network, and discuss the influence of the intra-cluster infection probability, the extra-cluster infection probability, and infection time before being detected on epidemic dynamics. The results show that extra-cluster infection reduction, early detection and swift isolation are good infection control practices.", "paper_title": "Epidemic spreading in a complex network", "paper_id": "WOS:000251711900008"}
