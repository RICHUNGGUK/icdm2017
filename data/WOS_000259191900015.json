The fuzzy large-scale systems consist of J interconnected discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy subsystems, and the stability analysis is based on Lyapunov functions that are piecewise quadratic. It is shown that the stability of the discrete-time fuzzy large-scale systems can be established if a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function can be constructed, and moreover, the function can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that are numerically feasible. The H. controllers are also designed by solving a set of LMIs based on these powerful piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. It is demonstrated via numerical examples that the stability and controller synthesis results based on the piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions are less conservative than those based on the common quadratic Lyapunov functions.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis and H-infinity controller design of discrete-time fuzzy large-scale systems based on piecewise Lyapunov functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000259191900015"}
