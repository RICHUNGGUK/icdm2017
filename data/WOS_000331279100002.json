Temperature field is tracked through a double distribution function (DDF) model, while the porous media is modeled using Brinkman-Forchheimer assumptions. The method is tested against flows in channels partially filled with porous media and parametric studies are conducted to evaluate the effects of various parameters, highlighting their influence on the thermo-hydrodynamic behavior.", "paper_title": "POROUS SUBSTRATE EFFECTS ON THERMAL FLOWS THROUGH A REV-SCALE FINITE VOLUME LATTICE BOLTZMANN MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000331279100002"}
