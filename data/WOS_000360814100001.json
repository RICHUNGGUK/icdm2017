Besides, arbitrary orientations of texts with multi-scripts add more complexity to the problem. The proposed approach introduces a new idea of convolving Laplacian with wavelet sub-bands at different levels in the frequency domain for enhancing low resolution text pixels. Then, the results obtained from different sub-bands (spectral) are fused for detecting candidate text pixels. We explore maxima stable extreme regions along with stroke width transform for detecting candidate text regions. Text alignment is done based on the distance between the nearest neighbor clusters of candidate text regions. In addition, the approach presents a new symmetry driven nearest neighbor for restoring full text lines. We conduct experiments on our collected video data as well as several benchmark data sets, such as ICDAR 2011, ICDAR 2013, and MSRA-TD500 to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art methods to show its superiority to the existing methods.", "paper_title": "Multi-Spectral Fusion Based Approach for Arbitrarily Oriented Scene Text Detection in Video Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000360814100001"}
