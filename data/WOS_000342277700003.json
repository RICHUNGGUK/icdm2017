Interpretation of these cosmological observations requires large-scale numerical simulation and modeling. Addressing analysis workflow complexity is as important as running the underlying extreme-scale simulations. Here, the authors discuss how the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code framework addresses these challenges.", "paper_title": "Large-Scale Simulations of Sky Surveys", "paper_id": "WOS:000342277700003"}
