To reduce the feature dimensionality of the outputs of the OWP decomposition, the principle components analysis was employed. Then we chose a neural network classifier to discriminate four types of prosthesis movements. The proposed method achieved a mean classification accuracy of 93.75%, which outperformed the method using the energy of wavelet packet coefficients (with mean classification accuracy 86.25%) and the fuzzy wavelet packet method (87.5%).", "paper_title": "Classification of surface EMG signals using optimal wavelet packet method based on Davies-Bouldin criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000241164900004"}
