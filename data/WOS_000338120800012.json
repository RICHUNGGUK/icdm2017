A well-known time-series visualization such as the line graph is good at showing an overall temporal pattern of change; however, it is not so effective in revealing the measurement frequency/interval while likely giving illusory confidence in values between measurements. In contrast, the bar graph is more effective in showing the frequency/interval, but less effective in showing an overall pattern than the line graph. We integrate the line graph and bar graph in a unified visualization model, called a ripple graph, to take the benefits of both of them with enhanced graphical integrity. Based on the ripple graph, we implemented an interactive time-series data visualization tool, called Stroscope, which facilitates multi-scale visualizations by providing users with a graphical widget to interactively control the integrated visualization model. We evaluated the visualization model (i.e., the ripple graph) through a controlled user study and Stroscope through long-term case studies with neurologists exploring large blood pressure measurement data of stroke patients. Results from our evaluations demonstrate that the ripple graph outperforms existing time-series visualizations, and that Stroscope has the efficacy and potential as an effective visual analysis tool for (irregularly) measured time-series data.", "paper_title": "Stroscope: Multi-Scale Visualization of Irregularly Measured Time-Series Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000338120800012"}
