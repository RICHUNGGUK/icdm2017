These data sets describe versatile information related to the different stages of a motion analysis. In studying these data using a 3D visualization approach, interactive exploring is important, especially for supporting spatial analysis. Moreover, as these data contain many various but related elements, numerical analysis of neuromuscular simulations is complicated. Visualization techniques enhance the analysis process, thus improving the effectiveness of the experiments. Our approach allows convenient definitions of relationships between numerical data sets and 3D objects. Scientific simulation data sets appropriate for this style of analysis are present everywhere motion analysis is performed and are predominant in many clinical works. In this paper, we outline the functionalities of the framework as well as applications embedded within the OpenSim simulation platform. These functionalities form an effective approach specifically designed for the investigation of neuromuscular simulations. This claim is supported by evaluation experiments where the framework was used to analyze gaits and crouch motions.", "paper_title": "A visualization framework for the analysis of neuromuscular simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000287449900004"}
