The proposed methods yield simple implementation and low computation costs compared to previous 1-D and 2-D FB combinations or adaptive directional WT methods. Furthermore, they are nonredundant transforms and realize quad-tree like multi resolution representations. In applications on nonlinear approximation, image coding, and denoising. the proposed filter banks show visual quality improvements and have higher PSNR than the conventional separable WT or the contourlet.", "paper_title": "Multiresolution Image Representation Using Combined 2-D and 1-D Directional Filter Banks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262562600005"}
