An initial categorization is based on families of websites, which is then matched with Spanish institutions from diverse sectors represented on the Web, to uncover cognitive structures and related subgroups with common interests and confirm the junction of sectors of the \"triple helix\" model. We may conclude that the clustering method applied to web co-outlink analysis works when fully institutionalized organizations are studied, to make their interconnections manifest.", "paper_title": "Using co-outlinks to mine heterogeneous networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266914500014"}
