Desirable properties of ARI are preserved in the two new measures, and new properties are discussed. These properties include: (i) detection of uncorrelatedness; (ii) computation of ARImp/ARImm in a distributed environment; and (iii) characterization of the degree of uncertainty of a consensus matrix. All of these properties are investigated from both the perspectives of theoretical analysis and experimental validation. We have also performed a number of experiments to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the two proposed measures in practical applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
