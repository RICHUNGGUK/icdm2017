Threshold cryptography [7] allows ad-hoc nodes to authenticate each other by cooperation of nodes. There are many authentication schemes based on threshold cryptography, but these assume pre-key distribution before network configuration. This paper proposes a reliable multistage authentication scheme for clustering based wireless ad-hoc networks. The secured key distribution mechanism is considered in contrast to current schemes. Every node in networks is required to authenticate another before data transmission. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by means of simulations.", "paper_title": "Multistage authentication scheme for mobile ad-hoc network using clustering mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300067"}
