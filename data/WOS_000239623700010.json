From these log files, it can be observed that numerous web robots are active on the site. Most of these robots show a crawling behavior that is radically different from the browsing behavior of human visitors. Because the owners of the e-shop desire information about the paths that human visitors follow through the site, it is of crucial importance to remove these robotic visits from the log files. Several existing methods for web robot discovery are evaluated and compared, none of them leading to satisfying results. Therefore, a new technique is developed that results in a successful and reliable identification of web robots.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of web robot discovery techniques: A benchmarking study", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623700010"}
