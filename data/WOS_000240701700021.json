All of the molecules were optimized from an alpha-helix conformation that was also displayed by the optimized structure. Significant variations of the geometry (especially remarkable for dihedral angles) and atomic properties of the central glycine residue are observed when it is attached to a serine residue whose side chain is involved in a hydrogen bond.", "paper_title": "Do the neighboring residues in a polypeptide affect the electron distribution of an amino acid significantly?
