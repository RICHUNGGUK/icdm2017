In this paper we investigate two techniques for reducing this mutual interference which do not require modification of the narrowband system. We propose to shape the spectrum of the Transmitted Reference (TR)-UWB signal using wavelet based multi-resolution technique to avoid its interference to other wireless systems. The reverse (narrowband) interference is alleviated using a notch filter at UWB receiver that could have much smaller bandwidth in this Gaussian pulse-shaped multi-resolution environment. TR simulations under AWGN and multipath channel conditions show that up to 55 dB reduction of UWB RF energy is possible at the interfering IEEE 802.11 a band using the wavelet spectral shaping technique. The challenge is not to exceed the specified pulse duration while shaping the spectrum. The proposed technique does not reduce the throughput of the UWB system. It is general in the sense. it can be used for the better coexistence of any narrowband wireless system with UWB system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
