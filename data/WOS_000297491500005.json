In a longitudinal experimental study, we examined the effect of the quality of persuasive argument, user training, and first-hand use on user perceptions of the new technology over time. We found that the effect of argument quality on users' perceived ease of use was greater when users had no training. However, we did not find the same effect occurred due to perceived usefulness. We also found that first-hand use changed users' perceived usefulness more over time when users received high quality arguments or when they had no training. While we found that first-hand use changed users' perceived ease of use more when users received high quality arguments, first-hand use did not change users' perceived ease of use differently whether they had or had not received prior training.
