It is expected that the H.264/AVC will take over the digital video market, replacing the use of MPEG-2 in most digital video applications. The complete migration to the new video-coding algorithm will take several years given the wide scale use of MPEG-2 in the market place today. This creates an important need for MPEG-2/H264 transcoding technologies. However, given the significant differences between both encoding algorithms, the transcoding process of such systems is much more complex to other heterogeneous video transcoding processes. In this work, we start by analyzing the methods defined in the H.264 video coding standard for the intra prediction: a central element of every H.264 encoder. We then introduce and evaluate six fast intra mode decision algorithms which should enable the development of MPEG-2 to H.264 transcoders. Having evaluated all the proposed methods, we have come out with a high-efficient method, namely DC-ABS pixel. Our results show that our algorithm considerable reduces the complexity involved in the intra prediction with respect the mode decision algorithms used in H.264 JM reference software, while exhibiting a slight degradation on the RD function.. Finally, we analyze a comparative study with two of the most prominent fast intra prediction methods presented in the literature. The results show that the proposed DC-ABS pixel method achieves the best results for video transcoding applications.", "paper_title": "Simple intra prediction algorithms for heterogeneous MPEG-2/H.264 video transcoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000254405000001"}
