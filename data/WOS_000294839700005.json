Methods of patent bibliometrics, social network analysis and information visualization are employed to analyze patents of Fortune 500 companies indexed in Derwent Innovations Index, the largest patent database in the world. Based on the co-citation networks, several main technology groups are identified, including Chemicals, Petroleum Refining, Motor Vehicles, Pharmaceuticals, Electronics, etc. Relationships among the leading companies and technology groups are also revealed.", "paper_title": "Patent co-citation networks of Fortune 500 companies", "paper_id": "WOS:000294839700005"}
