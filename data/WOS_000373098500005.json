DPWS can power the next generation of IoT applications by connecting millions of networked devices and services on the Web. This paper presents a simulator, called DPWSim, to support the use of this technology. DPWSim featuring secure messaging, dynamic discovery, service description, service invocation, and publish-subscribe eventing can be used to prototype, develop, and test products in terms of DPWS communication protocols. It can also support the collaboration among manufacturers, developers, and designers during the new product development process.", "paper_title": "DPWSim: A Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) Simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098500005"}
