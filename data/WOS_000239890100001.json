The goal of proxy handoff is to allow a mobile host still can receive packets from the corresponding server while its serving proxy is switched from the current one to another one. Once proxy handoff occurs, a proper proxy should be selected based on the load balance concern and the network situation concern. In this paper, a 3-tier Multimedia Mobile Transmission Platform, called MMTP, is proposed to solve the proxy handoff problem in the IPv6-based mobile network. A proxy handoff scheme based on the application-layer anycasting technique is proposed in MMTP. A proper proxy is selected from a number of candidate proxies by using the application-layer anycast. An experimental environment based on MMTP is also built to analyze the performance metrics of MMTP, including load balance among proxies and handoff latency. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
