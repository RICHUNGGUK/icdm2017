The algorithm is based on magnetic charged system search (MCSS) and improved scheme of harmony search algorithm (IHS). In IMCSS some of the most effective parameters in the convergence rate of the HS scheme have been improved to achieve a better convergence, especially in the final iterations and explore better results than previous studies. The IMCSS algorithm is applied for optimal design problem with both continuous and discrete variables. In comparison to the results of the previous studies, the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm in fast convergence and achieving the optimal values for weight of structures, is demonstrated.
