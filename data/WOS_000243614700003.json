In this model, each node updates its local variable with a weighted average of its neighbors' values, and each new value is corrupted by an additive noise with zero mean. The quality of consensus can be measured by the total mean-square deviation of the individual variables from their average, which converges to a steady-state value. We consider the problem of finding the (symmetric) edge weights that result in the least mean-square deviation in steady state. We show that this problem can be cast as a convex optimization problem, so the global solution can be found efficiently. We describe some computational methods for solving this problem, and compare the weights and the mean-square deviations obtained by this method and several other weight design methods.
