Our approach follows a scheme of Crochemore et al. based on minimal forbidden words. We extend this construction to the case of C-infinity-words, i.e., words differentiable arbitrarily many times. We thus obtain an infinite automaton for representing the set of C-infinity-words. We derive a classification of C-infinity-words induced by the structure of the automaton. Then, we introduce a new framework for dealing with C-infinity-words, based on a three letter alphabet. This allows us to define a compacted version of the automaton, that we use to prove that every C-infinity-word admits a repetition whose length is polynomially bounded. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
