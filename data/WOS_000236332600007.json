Special attention was devoted to the modelling of aircraft releases at different heights. Although emissions associated with traffic are smaller than those associated with aircraft, their impact at different locations around the airport, where people are exposed to air Pollution, Was found to be larger. It was also found that only the concentration levels oil timescales of a few hours were relevant in terms of exposure. Integration of this kind of data may prove useful to identify more closely the likely exposure impacts to local populations caused by different pollution sources. In addition, a preliminary comparison of the results of the model with data available at a monitoring station nearby the airport was subsequently performed. Discrepancies between monitoring data and the model are discussed, suggesting that the aircraft contribution is overestimated and the traffic contribution underestimated. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
