Based on the knowledge of memristor and recurrent neural networks, the model of MNNs is established. Then, considering the state-dependent properties of memristor, a fuzzy model of MNNs is employed to provide a new way of analyzing the complicated MNNs with only two subsystems, and update laws for the connection weights of slave systems and controller gain are designed to make the slave systems exponentially lag synchronized with the master systems. Two examples about synchronization problems are presented to show the effectiveness of the obtained results, and an application of the obtained theory is also given in the pseudorandom number generator.", "paper_title": "Exponential Adaptive Lag Synchronization of Memristive Neural Networks via Fuzzy Method and Applications in Pseudorandom Number Generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000345857000025"}
