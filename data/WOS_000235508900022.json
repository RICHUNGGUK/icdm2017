The PNF achieves both fast convergence and high estimation accuracy when the step-size for adaptation is appropriately determined. However, there has been no discussion of how to determine the appropriate step-size. In this paper, we derive the convergence condition on the step-size, and propose an adaptive algorithm with variable step-size so that convergence of the PNF is automatically satisfied. Moreover, we present a new filtering structure of the PNF that increases the convergence speed while keeping the estimation accuracy. We also derive a variable step-size scheme for the new PNF to guarantee the convergence. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An adaptive algorithm with variable step-size for parallel notch filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508900022"}
