These include the review of sensor selection and projection arrangement technique to optimize system performance. Issues on types of algorithm for image reconstruction purposes, which is one of the factors to increase the resolution of the image, will also be elaborated. This review could provide a preliminary decision overview for students or researchers before initiating a research related to optical tomography.", "paper_title": "OPTICAL TOMOGRAPHY: A REVIEW ON SENSOR ARRAY, PROJECTION ARRANGEMENT AND IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626800020"}
