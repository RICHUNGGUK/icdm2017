More specifically, our main result shows that for any given rational numbers 0 <= epsilon < epsilon' <= 1, and uniformly computably enumerable sequence {U-n}(n is an element of omega) of E-1(0)-classes such that (for all n)[mu(U-n) <= epsilon], there exists a Sigma(0,aleph')(1)-class, Y, such that Y superset of lim inf(n) U-n, and mu(Y) <= epsilon'. Moreover, Y can be obtained uniformly from epsilon, epsilon', and a u.c.e. index for {U-n}(n is an element of omega) This answers a recent question of Bienvenu, Muchnik, Shen, and Vereshchagin. We also determine the truth-values of several modifications of our main result, showing that several similar, but stronger, statements are false. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
