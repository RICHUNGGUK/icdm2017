The metric properties of this distance measure are also studied. The new distance measure is compared with the other fuzzy distance measures proposed by Voxman [W. Voxman, Some remarks on distances between fuzzy numbers, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 100 (1998) 353-365] and Chakraborty and Chakraborty [C. Chakraborty, D. Chakraborty, A theoretical development on fuzzy distance measure for fuzzy numbers, Mathematical and Computer Modelling 43 (2006) 254-261] and turned out to be more reasonable. A new similarity measure is also developed with the help of the fuzzy distance measure. Examples are given to compare this similarity measure with the other similarity measure previously proposed. A decision making scheme is proposed using this similarity measure and this scheme is found to be more acceptable than the existing methods due to the fact that it considers the degrees of confidence of the experts' opinion.
