When reviewing the past literatures in the field of TRIZ solving processes, it was found that there were several drawbacks in the TRIZ solving processes which were: (i) the TRIZ depended on the researchers' subjective viewpoints; (ii) the TRIZ lacked a customized contradictory matrix and innovative principles; (iii) and the innovative principle of TRIZ could not provide comprehensive solutions to apply to all service fields. In attempting to understand the reason for the additional above drawbacks, much of the literature was organized to find six cognitive gaps, which might support TRIZ implementation during the TRIZ solving processes for service system design (SSD). The six cognitive gaps which are: (i) identifying the opportunity by mapping the specific features and characteristics; (ii) the ideal contradiction matrix; (iii) evaluating the results especially by checking the KM-based profession-oriented tools; (iv) checking the KM-based context; (v) human factors and teamwork; (vi) innovative supplemental technologies. Finally, the six cognitive gaps were integrated into a conceptual framework of SSD development, which will provide an improved guide for further researchers.
