In this paper, we will present an E-Learning Semantic Grid that integrates these resources provided by both teachers and scientists for life science education. It uses domain ontologies to integrate these heterogeneous life science database and service resources, and supports ontology-based e-learning data-sharing and service-coordination for life science teachers and students in an e-learning virtual organization. Our system provides life science students with semantically superior experience in learning activities, and also extends the function of life science e-science. It has a promising future in the domain of life science education.", "paper_title": "An E-Learning Semantic Grid for life science education", "paper_id": "WOS:000254968800005"}
