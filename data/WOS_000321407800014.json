This calculation is applied not only for an operating point of the machine but also for thousands of operating points during a driving cycle for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) application. The calculation is made taking into account flux-weakening, magnetic material non-linearity and losses at-load. Therefore, we have proposed a design approach using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, version II (NSGA-II). This approach respects two criteria namely the minimization of average losses during the cycle and the minimization of the RMS current at the rated point. The result is represented by a Pareto curve.
