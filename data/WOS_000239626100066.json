Many QoS metrics, not only data packet delay and bandwidth efficiency, but power consumption should be considered in network design. QoS metric levels are greatly affected by network routing. Since the routing solution space grows exponentially with the size of the network, it is necessary to research efficient combinatorial optimization algorithms for routing. After studying intelligent particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a new routing algorithms based on PSO is described, which has the potential to address many QoS metrics together and has an outstanding searching ability. The approach is well founded theoretically as well as detailed algorithmically. Simulations and comparisons to some typical QoS routine methods show that particle swarm optimization based routing algorithm is effective.", "paper_title": "QoS based routing in wireless sensor network with particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100066"}
