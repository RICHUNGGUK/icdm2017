The number of nodes in the hidden layer, the architecture of the lower part of the network, as well as the weights used in them were kept as variables, and a Pareto front was effectively constructed by minimizing the training error along with the network size. A predator-prey algorithm efficiently performed the optimization task and several important trends were observed. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
