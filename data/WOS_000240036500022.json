There are different pathologies affecting this kind of patients. From a functional point of view the residual vision can be classified in three categories: low contrast vision, tunnel vision and peripheral vision. This contribution describes simple real-time image processing schemes that can help this kind of patients. The presented approaches have been implemented in specific hardware (FPGA device) to achieve real-time processing with low cost portable systems. This represents a very valid alternative to optical aids that are widely used in this field.", "paper_title": "Real time image processing on a portable aid device for low vision patients", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500022"}
