In spite of this progress, there is strong demand for higher SAT algorithms efficiency to solve harder and larger problems. Unfortunately, most modern solvers are sequential and fewer are parallel. A number of recent propositions was concerned with dynamic workload balancing for parallel SAT solving. Here, it is a complementary approach that only explores an initial static decomposition for workload repartition. The two computational models of Shared Memory and Message Passing are compared, using OpenMP for Shared Memory and MPI for Message Passing implementations.", "paper_title": "Parallel resolution of the satisfiability problem (SAT) with OpenMP and MPI", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100046"}
