Implementing IFC-based applications allows reducing data duplication, especially in the aspect of building geometry. With appropriate data mapping engines, an existing BPM may be readily used for performance-based simulation which requires significantly less effort compared with the traditional means. As a result, it is possible to make use of many available proprietary tools to provide additional services such as early-stage building design support. SEMPER-II (S2), which is an active, multi-domain, space-based, object-oriented design support tool for integrated building performance computing, was developed before the IFC standard was established. In order to perform building performance simulations based on the IFC compliant data models expressed through the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) based formats, an add-on data mapping engine has been developed as a front-end application in S2. The data mapping engine extracts all necessary information embedded in the XML data files, which is obtained directly from IFC compliant CAD drawings, and converts the data into the internal data format of S2.This process demonstrates a seamless link between an IFC compliant industry building product model (e.g. CAD) and the Shared Object Model (SOM) of S2 to facilitate building performance simulations.
