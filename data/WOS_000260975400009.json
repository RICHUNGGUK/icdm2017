We show that for such matrices, this cost can be reduced to O-similar to(alpha(omega-1)n), where omega is a feasible exponent for matrix multiplication over the base field. The best known estimate for omega is omega < 2.38, resulting in costs of order O-similar to(alpha(1.38) n). We present consequences for Hermite-Pade approximation and bivariate interpolation.
