The image feature descriptor is simply constructed from two DDBTC representative color quantizers and its corresponding bitmap image. The color histogram feature (CHF) derived from two color quantizers represents the color distribution and image contrast, while the bit pattern feature (BPF) constructed from the bitmap image characterizes the image edges and textural information. The similarity between two images can be easily measured from their CHF and BPF values using a specific distance metric computation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed feature descriptor compared to the former existing schemes in image retrieval task under natural and textural images. The DDBTC method compresses an image efficiently, and at the same time, its corresponding compressed data stream can provide an effective feature descriptor for performing image retrieval and classification. Consequently, the proposed scheme can be considered as an effective candidate for real-time image retrieval applications.", "paper_title": "Effective Image Retrieval System Using Dot-Diffused Block Truncation Coding Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000359583000017"}
