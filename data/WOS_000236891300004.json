Unlike the Taylor-Galerkin methods, the present scheme does not contain any new higher-order derivatives which makes it suitable for solving nonlinear problems. Numerical schemes taking advantage of the wavelet bases capabilities to compress the operators and sparse representation of functions which are smooth, except for localized regions, up to any given accuracy are presented. Here numerical experiments deal with advection equation with the spiky solution in one dimension, two dimensions and nonlinear equation with a shock in solution in two dimensions. Numerical results indicate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Time accurate fast three-step wavelet-Galerkin method for partial differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000236891300004"}
