Wireless meshed networks, coupled with low-cost seismometers for monitoring, evaluation, and information about seismic vibrations in space and time are introducing a new generation of warning infrastructures for mega-cities. The use of a cooperative method for signal analysis makes it possible to distinguish earthquakes (with a certain minimal magnitude) from other ground shaking in a city. The paper gives a short overview of our approach for developing decentralized early warning systems and an evaluation based on experiences gained from model investigations, testbeds in Berlin, and prototype installations in Istanbul.
