An essential ingredient of such an enterprise is the information technology infrastructure that enable the coordination and the sharing of information and other resources. Grids have been proposed as the infrastructure for such organizations, however, to date they have been delivering high performance for computation and data while a lot remains to be developed for the grids to be readily useful in day to day enterprising. In particular, for the grid concept to be usefull it must redefine its understanding of a resource. This paper defines the collaborative enterprise identifies the role grids could play in engineering processes taking place in such organizations. It presents a high level architecture for grids based engineering services and tools, reviews it and defines the research and development issues. It is based on the results of an on-going European Union project InteliGrid - Interoperability of Virtual Organizations on a Complex Semantic Grid.", "paper_title": "Grid technology for the collaborative enterprise", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100047"}
