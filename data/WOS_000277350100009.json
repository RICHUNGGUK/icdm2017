By employing the Lyapunov method, stochastic analysis and some inequality techniques, sufficient conditions are acquired for checking the pth(p > 1) and the 1st moment exponential stability of the network. Finally, One example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Exponential stability analysis for delayed stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000277350100009"}
