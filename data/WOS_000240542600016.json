The IPD receives the biometrics context (pulse, facial expression and body temperature, human location in smart home and human motion) from sensor devices. We handled the context's pattern analysis in two steps. The first step selects consumer electronics (TV, DVD, audio, air-conditioner, light, project) from IPD's rules. In the second step, IPD predicts detailed home service (for example, a detailed home service of the TV includes news, sports, and drama), using the supervised algorithm-based pattern analyzer. We used the SVM (support vector machine) for detailed service pattern analysis. We experimented on the intelligent pervasive middleware in two directions, and it was shown to have an effective performance in practical application. We are currently studying the association technique of home service (by using data mining) that can happen when IPD predicts home service by the home service predictor.", "paper_title": "Intelligent pervasive middleware based on biometrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600016"}
