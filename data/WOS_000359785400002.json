This study provides a survey on state-of-the-art multi-output regression methods, that are categorized as problem transformation and algorithm adaptation methods. In addition, we present the mostly used performance evaluation measures, publicly available data sets for multi-output regression real-world problems, as well as open-source software frameworks.
