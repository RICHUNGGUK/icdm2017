The constructed model provides a tool for forecasting short-term trends about the customers' preferences with respect to mobile network operators taking into account both, autonomous decisions due to direct marketing and advertising strategies, and also decisions adopted through interaction via social influence. The model can provide insights to companies for designing strategies in order to gain market share.", "paper_title": "The dynamics over the next few years of the Spanish mobile telecommunications market share: a mathematical modelling approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000340371800003"}
