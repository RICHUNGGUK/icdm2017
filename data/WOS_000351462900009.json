To that end, classical texture-based features such as Gabor filters, local binary patterns (LBP) and local phase quantization (LPQ), as well as two keypoint-based features, the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and the speeded up robust features (SURF), are used to generate a pool of diverse classifiers on the dissimilarity space. A comprehensive set of experiments on a database composed of 2,240 microscopic images from 112 different forest species was used to evaluate the performance of each individual classifier of the generated pool, the combination of all classifiers, and different dynamic selection of classifiers (DSC) methods. The best result (93.03 %) was observed by incorporating probabilistic information in a DSC method based on multiple classifier behavior.", "paper_title": "Forest species recognition based on dynamic classifier selection and dissimilarity feature vector representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351462900009"}
