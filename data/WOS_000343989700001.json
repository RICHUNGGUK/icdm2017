These characteristics are achieved by replacing the quarter-wavelength transmission line in the conventional coupled line Wilkinson power divider with quarter-wavelength side-coupled ring (QSCR). Additional features such as DC blocking between arbitrary two ports, single-layer via-less structure for low-cost fabrication and convenient integration (as only one isolation resistor required) are highlighted. A 2-GHz Wilkinson microstrip power divider with a fractional bandwidth of 4% has been fabricated and experimentally characterized. The consistency between simulated and measured results validates the er effectiveness of our proposed design.", "paper_title": "COMPACT WILKINSON PASS-BAND FILTERING POWER DIVIDER BASED ON QUARTER-WAVELENGTH SIDE-COUPLED RING", "paper_id": "WOS:000343989700001"}
