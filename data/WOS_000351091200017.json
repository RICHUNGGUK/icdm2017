This snag results in a higher average waiting time for the local data processing units (LDPUs) transmitting data packets of higher importance. In this paper, we formulate an algorithm for Priority-based Allocation of Time Slots (PATS) that considers a fitness parameter characterizing the criticality of health data that a packet carries, energy consumption rate for a transmitting LDPU, and other crucial LDPU properties. Based on this fitness parameter, we design the constant model hawk-dove game that ensures prioritizing the LDPUs based on crucial properties. In comparison with the existing works on priority-based wireless transmission, we measure and take into consideration the urgency, seriousness, and criticality associated with an LDPU and, thus, allocate transmission time slots proportionately. We show that the number of transmitting LDPUs in medical emergency situations can be reduced by 25.97%, in comparison with the existing time-division-based techniques.", "paper_title": "Priority-Based Time-Slot Allocation in Wireless Body Area Networks During Medical Emergency Situations: An Evolutionary Game-Theoretic Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000351091200017"}
