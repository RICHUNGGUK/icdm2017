Considering one-round AKE, Cremers and Feltz at ESORICS 2012 defined a security model with perfect forward secrecy. Based on their model, we consider different levels of deniability, and reveal some relationships of the session-key security and the deniability properties. The observations result in a simple method to give a deniable protocol with forward secrecy.", "paper_title": "Deniability and forward secrecy of one-round authenticated key exchange", "paper_id": "WOS:000331981900004"}
