According to this method, compounds in a database are docked to multiple proteins. The compounds among these proteins that are likely bind to the target protein are selected as the members of the candidate-hit compound group. Then, the compounds in the group are sorted into descending order using the docking score: the first (n-th) compound is expected to be the most (n-th) probable hit compound. This method was applied to the analysis of a set of 142 receptors and 142 compounds using a receptor-ligand docking program, Sievgene [Y. Fukunishi, Y. Mikami, H. Nakamura, Similarities among receptor pockets and among compounds: analysis and application to in silico ligand screening, J. Mol. Graphics Modelling, 24 (2005) 34-45], and the results demonstrated that this method achieves a high hit ratio compared to uniform sampling. We prepared two new scores: the Delta G score, designed to reproduce the protein-ligand binding free energy, and the hit-optimized score, designed to maximize the hit ratio of in silico screening. Using the Sievgene docking score, Delta G score and hit-optimized score, the NITS method is more robust than the multiple active-site correction scoring method [G.P.A. Vigers, J.P. Rizzi, Multiple active site corrections for docking and virtual screening, J. Med. Chem., 47 (2004) 80-89]. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
