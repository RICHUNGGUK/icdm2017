A speed-hack helps a cheater to gain unfair advantages by essentially speeding up the actions of the avatar controlled by the cheater, so that the cheater can move, explore and gather items faster than honest players. This paper presents a novel version of a dead-reckoning protocol that is invulnerable to speed-hacks. Existing games based on dead-reckoning can easily be modified to use this hack-proof dead-reckoning protocol and how the protocol works on both client-server architecture and peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture will be demonstrated in this paper.", "paper_title": "Hack-proof synchronization protocol for multi-player online games", "paper_id": "WOS:000261958500007"}
