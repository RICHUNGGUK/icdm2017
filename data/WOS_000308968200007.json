The governing partial differential equations are first transformed into the coupled system of ordinary differential equations and then solved by using the homotopy analysis method. The influence of various involved physical parameters on the dimensionless radial and azimuthal velocities is sketched and analyzed. The variation of skin friction coefficients in radial and azimuthal directions is studied for various values of pertinent parameters.
