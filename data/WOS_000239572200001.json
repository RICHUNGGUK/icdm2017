However, access control is necessary, but not sufficient. Actually, IT systems can manipulate data to provide services to users. The results of a data processing may disclose information concerning the objects used in the data processing itself. Therefore, the control of information flow results fundamental to guarantee data protection. In the last years many information flow control models have been proposed. However, these frameworks mainly focus on the detection and prevention of improper information leaks and do not provide support for the dynamical creation of new objects. In this paper we extend our previous work to automatically support the dynamical creation of objects by verifying the conditions under which objects can be created and automatically associating an access control policy to them. Moreover, our proposal includes mechanisms tailored to control the usage of information once it has been accessed.", "paper_title": "Creating objects in the flexible authorization framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000239572200001"}
