The proposed buffer amplifier is composed of two transconductance amplifiers, two current comparators and a push-pull output stage. Phase compensation technique is also used to improve the phase margin value of the proposed buffer amplifier for different load capacitances. Post-layout simulations of the proposed buffer amplifier are performed using 0.35 mu m AMS CMOS process parameters and 3.3V power supply. The circuit is tested under a 600 pF capacitive load. An average settling time of 0.85 mu s under a full voltage swing is obtained, while only 3 mu A quiescent current is drawn from the power supply. Monte Carlo analysis is also added to show the process variation effects on the circuit.", "paper_title": "HIGH-SLEW RATE LOW-QUIESCENT CURRENT RAIL-TO-RAIL CMOS BUFFER AMPLIFIER FOR FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297938900005"}
