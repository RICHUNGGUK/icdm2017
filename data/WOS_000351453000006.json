In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach for achieving efficient computation offloading for mobile cloud computing. We formulate the decentralized computation offloading decision making problem among mobile device users as a decentralized computation offloading game. We analyze the structural property of the game and show that the game always admits a Nash equilibrium. We then design a decentralized computation offloading mechanism that can achieve a Nash equilibrium of the game and quantify its efficiency ratio over the centralized optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can achieve efficient computation offloading performance and scale well as the system size increases.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Computation Offloading Game for Mobile Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000351453000006"}
