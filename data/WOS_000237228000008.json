The EA variants employed include self-adaptation of mutation rates. Results are compared with the corresponding classical panmictic EA showing that topology together with self-adaptation drastically influences the search.", "paper_title": "Effects of scale-free and small-world topologies on binary coded self-adaptive CEA", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228000008"}
