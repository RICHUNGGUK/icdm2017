We determine the highest minimum weights for such codes of lengths up to 34 for F-5 and up to 28 for F-7, and classify the codes with these minimum weights. In particular, we give a double circulant self-dual [32, 16] code over F-5 which has a higher minimum weight than the previously best known linear code with these parameters. In addition, a self-dual code over F-7 is presented which has a higher minimum weight than the previously best known self-dual code for length 28.", "paper_title": "Double circulant and quasi-twisted self-dual codes over F-5 and F-7", "paper_id": "WOS:000254707400003"}
