T-norm and T-generator were defined on interval [0, 1] in previous work. In the recent relational work, authors put forward fractional logic based on continuous radix [a, b]. This paper studied the T-norm and T-generator on any interval [a, b], discussed the two kinds of generalized T-generators: \"Automorphic increase T-generator\" and \"Infinite decrease T-generator\". Authors found and proved the useful and important theorem: \"generating theorem of generalized T-norm\". Using the integrated clusters of generalized T-norm and T-generator, authors gave the mathematical generating method for \"AND\" operation model of fractional logic based on any interval [a, b]. The operation model is already used to uncertainties reasoning and flexible control now.", "paper_title": "Generalized T-norm and fractional \"AND\" operation model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500085"}
