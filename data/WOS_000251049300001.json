In this paper, cylinder pressure was investigated as a means for the closed-loop SOC control of a common-rail direct injection (CRDI) diesel engine. In order to detect the SOC, the crank angle position where the difference pressure became 10 bar was selected as the pressure variable. Using this pressure variable as a feedback variable, an adaptive feedforward control was proposed. The feedforward controller consisted of the radial basis function network (RBFN) and the feedback error learning method, which was used for the training of the network. The proposed SOC control strategy showed a far better regulation performance than that of the linear feedback controller. A further extension of the strategy based on the individual cylinder pressure feedback, the individual cylinder SOC control strategy, effectively reduced cylinder-by-cylinder SOC variation in steady and transient engine operations.
