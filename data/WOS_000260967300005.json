At the first step, a representative element of the stiffened panel (superstiffener) is optimized using mathematical programming and lamination parameters subjected to combined loading (in-plane and out-of-plane) under strength (laminate or ply failure), buckling and practical design constraints. Ply blocking constraints are imposed at this step to improve convergence towards practical laminates. At the second step, the actual superstiffener's laminates are obtained by using a genetic algorithm. Results, for the case considered, show that the inclusion of transverse shear effects has an associated 2.5% mass penalty and that neglecting its effects might invoke earlier buckling failure. In addition, the influence of designing for failure strength at laminate or ply level is assessed.", "paper_title": "Optimization of anisotropic composite panels with T-shaped stiffeners including transverse shear effects and out-of-plane loading", "paper_id": "WOS:000260967300005"}
