A special and very useful case is the Ring-LPN problem, which typically provides improved efficiency in the constructed cryptographic primitive. We present a new algorithm for solving the Ring-LPN problem in the case when the polynomial used is reducible. It greatly outperforms the previous algorithms for solving this problem. Using the algorithm, we can break the Lapin authentication protocol for the proposed instance using a reducible polynomial, in similar to 2(71) bit operations.", "paper_title": "A New Algorithm for Solving Ring-LPN With a Reducible Polynomial", "paper_id": "WOS:000363256500030"}
