Res. Lett. 34:697-705, [2006]) considered an M/M/1 type queueing system with unreliable server and retrials. In this model it is assumed that if the server fails during service of a customer, the customer leaves the server, joins a retrial group and in random intervals repeats attempts to get service. We suggest an alternative method for analysis of the Markov process, which describes the functioning of the system, and find the joint distribution of the server state, the number of customers in the queue and the number of customers in the retrial group in steady state.", "paper_title": "The M/M/1 retrial queue with retrials due to server failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000255747500001"}
