However, due to the asynchrony among and diversity of sensors, information assimilation - how to combine the information obtained from asynchronous and multifarious sources is an important and challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose a framework for information assimilation that addresses the issues - \"when\", \"what\" and \"how\" to assimilate the information obtained from different media sources in order to detect events in multimedia surveillance systems. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical probabilistic assimilation approach to detect atomic and compound events. To detect an event, our framework uses not only the media streams available at the current instant but it also utilizes their two important properties - first, accumulated past history of whether they have been providing concurring or contradictory evidences, and - second, the system designer's confidence in them. The experimental results show the utility of the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Information assimilation framework for event detection in multimedia surveillance systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242436600007"}
