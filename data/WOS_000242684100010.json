The time reduction is achieved using basic store-and-fetch operations and is irrespective of the image or neighbourhood size. This method has been tested on a variety of greyscale images and neighbourhood sizes with promising results. These results indicate that the relative time requirement reduces with increase in image size. The method's efficiency also improves significantly with increase in neighbourhood size thereby making it increasingly useful when dealing with large images. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
