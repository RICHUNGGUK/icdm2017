The design principles applied for developing the system are aimed to help reduce the problems associated with having a small size screen to interact with. The human-handheld interaction is based only in gestures and freehand writing, avoiding the need of widgets and virtual keyboards. The content of the generated documents are organized as concept maps, which gives more flexibility to reorganize and merge the contributions of the meeting attendees. Our system is based on handhelds interconnected with an ad-hoc wireless network. The system architecture is a peer-to-peer one, avoiding the need of central repositories thus allowing meetings to take place anywhere.", "paper_title": "A gestures and freehand writing interaction based Electronic Meeting Support system with handhelds", "paper_id": "WOS:000243131600040"}
