However, commercial SRAM is susceptible to functional failures when V(DD) is scaled down. Although several published SRAM designs scale V(DD) to 200-300 mV, these designs do not sufficiently consider SRAM robustness, limiting them to small arrays because of yield constraints, and may not correctly target the minimum energy operation point. We examine the effects on area and energy for the differential 6T and 8T bit cells as V(DD) is scaled down, and the bit cells are either sized and doped, or assisted appropriately to maintain the same yield as with full V(DD). SRAM robustness is calculated using importance sampling, resulting in a seven-order run-time improvement over Monte Carlo sampling. Scaling 6T and 8T SRAM V(DD) down to 500 mV and scaling 8T SRAM to 300 mV results in a 50% and 83% dynamic energy reduction, respectively, with no reduction in robustness and low area overhead, but increased leakage per bit. Using this information, we calculate the supply voltage for a minimum total energy operation (V(MIN)) based on activity factor and find that it is significantly higher for SRAM than for logic.", "paper_title": "Yield-Driven Near-Threshold SRAM Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000283548500008"}
