Visual feedback helps in identifying the errors and indicating the achieved progress. The Vowel Game uses a visualization method that symbolizes the vocal tract. This instructs the user on how to adjust e.g. the tongue position during pronunciation. It gives information about the correctness and goodness of the uttered vowel. Preliminary evaluation suggests that continuous real-time feedback can be obtained, but the effect on learning remains to be tested.", "paper_title": "The vowel game: Continuous real-time visualization for pronunciation learning with vowel charts", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400067"}
