In this paper a new low voltage CMOS circuit is presented to implement min-max operators. This circuit has many advantages such as mixed input signal, which increases the flexibility and controllability of FLC, low power consumption, simple and symmetrical circuit and small die area due to a few number of transistors. These advantages are useful in circuits that require both operators in the specific conditions. The proposed circuit has been designed using 90 nm, 1.5 V CMOS standard in Hspice simulator. Simulation results demonstrate that the power consumption of this circuit is only about 40 A mu W, furthermore it has the delay time and error of less than 1 ns and 1.4 % respectively. (98.6 % accuracy).", "paper_title": "A novel low voltage CMOS controllable fuzzy inference circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000357458100001"}
