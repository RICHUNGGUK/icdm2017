A consequence of this goal is that the actual teamwork behavior is determined by the level of intelligence built into the underlying system as well as the semantics of the language. In this paper, we give the design objectives, the syntax, and an operational semantics for MALLET in terms of a transition system. We show how the semantics can be used to reason about the behaviors of team-based agents. The semantics can also be,used to guide the implementation of various MALLET interpreters emulating different forms of team intelligence, as well as formally study the properties of team-based agents specified in MALLET. We have explored various forms of proactive information exchange behavior embodied in human teamwork using the CAST system, which implements a built-in MALLET interpreter.", "paper_title": "MALLET - A Multi-Agent Logic Language for Encoding Teamwork", "paper_id": "WOS:000233938200009"}
