Under this constraint the surface can be extracted far more robustly than by classical stereo applied to an arbitrary surface, since the problem is solved semi-globally, rather than locally for each epipolar line. Here, the restricted correspondence problem is solved for two examples, the first being the extraction of the parameters of an ellipsoid from a calibrated stereo pair. The second example is the estimation of the osculating paraboloid at the frontier points of a convex object.", "paper_title": "Robust Surface Fitting from Two Views using Restricted Correspondence", "paper_id": "WOS:000266497200006"}
