In this paper, we study the fundamental scaling law of the minimum total power (termed as critical total power) required to ensure k-connectivity in wireless networks. Contrary to several previous results that assume all nodes use a (minimum) common power, we allow nodes to choose different levels of transmission power. We show that under the assumption that wireless nodes form a homogeneous Poisson point process with density A in a unit square region [0, 1](2), the critical total power required to maintain k-connectivity is Theta((Gamma(c/2 + k)/(k - 1)!)lambda(1-c/2)) with probability approaching one as A goes to infinity, where c is the path loss exponent. If k also goes to infinity, the expected critical total power is of the order of k(c/2) lambda(1-c/2). Compared with the results that all nodes use a common critical transmission power for maintaining k-connectivity, we show that the critical total power can be reduced by an order of (log lambda)(c/2) by allowing nodes to optimally choose different levels of transmission power. This result is not subject to any specific power/topology control algorithm, but rather a fundamental property of wireless networks.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic critical total power for k-connectivity of wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254869100008"}
