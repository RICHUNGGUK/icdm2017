This media type has been distributed and processed widely on desktop PCs. However, processing 3D models on mobile devices is more difficult, mainly due to their physical constraints. Though the remote rendering framework is able to make up for some deficiencies, previous methods based on this framework suffered from high transmission frequency, which just imposes a high power demand on mobile devices' already limited battery life. In this paper, a new transmission control method, Adaptive Splitting and Error Handling Mechanism, is proposed to be integrated with canonical remote rendering system. Our mechanism is able to reduce transmission frequency by trading transmission with splitting operations. According to relevant research findings, reducing frequency will result in a decline in power consumption. Finally, the effectiveness of our method in terms of frequency reduction is validated by comparison with state of the art method.", "paper_title": "ASEHM: a new transmission control mechanism for remote rendering system", "paper_id": "WOS:000333209300002"}
