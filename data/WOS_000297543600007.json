Our approach considers a block model where block parameters may be integrated out. The result is a posterior defined over the number of clusters in rows and columns and cluster memberships. The number of row and column clusters need not be known in advance as these are sampled along with cluster memberhips using Markov chain Monte Carlo. This differs from existing work on latent block models, where the number of clusters is assumed known or is chosen using some information criteria. We analyze both simulated and real data to validate the technique.", "paper_title": "Block clustering with collapsed latent block models", "paper_id": "WOS:000297543600007"}
