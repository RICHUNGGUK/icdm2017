Broadband wireless channels become extremely frequency selective and cause severe inter symbol interference (ISI). Furthermore the average received signal power changes in a random manner because of the shadowing and distance dependant path losses resulted from the movement of a mobile terminal (MT). Accordingly the transmission performance severely degrades. To overcome the performance degradation two most promising approaches are the frequency domain equalization (FDE) and distributed antenna network (DAN). The former takes advantage of channel frequency selectivity to obtain the frequency diversity gain. In DAN a group of distributed antennas serve each user to mitigate the negative impact of shadowing and path losses. This article will introduce the recent advances in FDE and DAN for the broadband single carrier (SC) transmissions.", "paper_title": "Recent Advances in Single-Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization and Distributed Antenna Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000284448800044"}
