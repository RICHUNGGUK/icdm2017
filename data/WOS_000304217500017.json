The tool, called imageRF, is platform and license independent and uses generic image file formats. It works well with default parameterization, yet all relevant parameters can be defined in intuitive GUIs. This makes it a user-friendly image processing tool, which is implemented as an add-on in the free EnMAP-Box and may be used in the commercial IDL/ENVI software. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
