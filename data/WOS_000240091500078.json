While the iterative equation in the QPSO is educed from exponential distribution, the novel one derives from the distribution function of the sum of two random variables with exponential and normal distribution, respectively. The Revised QPSO also maintains the mean best position of the swarm as in the previous QPSO to make the swarm more efficient in global search. The experiment results on benchmark functions show that Revised QPSO has stronger global search ability than QPSO and PSO.", "paper_title": "Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization with a hybrid probability distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500078"}
