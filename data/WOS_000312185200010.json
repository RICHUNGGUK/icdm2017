They are considered to behave with discrete delays. The class of ITPNs is Turing complete and therefore the reachability of an arbitrary marking in such a net is not decidable. We introduce a time dependent state equation for a firing sequence of ITPNs, which is analogous to the state equation for a firing sequence in standard Petri nets and we prove its correctness using linear algebra. Our result is original and delivers both a necessary condition for reachability and a sufficient condition for non-reachability of an arbitrary marking in an ITPN.", "paper_title": "Algebraical Characterisation of Interval-Timed Petri Nets with Discrete Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000312185200010"}
