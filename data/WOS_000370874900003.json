While the non volatility of PCM is a desirable property in order to save leakage power, it also has the undesirable effect of making PCM main memories susceptible to newer modes of security vulnerabilities, for example, accessibility to sensitive data if a PCM DIMM gets stolen. PCM memories can be made secure by encrypting the data. Unfortunately, such encryption comes with a significant overhead in terms of bits written to PCM memory, causing half of the bits in the line to change on every write, even if the actual number of bits being written to memory is small. Our studies show that a typical wrileback modifies, on average, only 12% of the bits in the cachcline. Thus, encryption causes almost a 4x increase in the number of bits written to PCM memories. Such extraneous bit writes cause significant increase in write power, reduction in write endurance, and reduction in write bandwidth. To provide the benefit of secure memory in a write efficient manner this paper proposes Dual Counter Encryption (DEUCE). DEUCE is based on the observation that a typical writeback only changes a few words, so DEUCE re encrypts only the words that have changed. We show that DEUCE reduces the number of modified bits per writeback for a secure memory from 50% to 24%, which improves performance by 27% and increases lifetime by 2x.", "paper_title": "DEUCE: Write-Efficient Encryption for Non-Volatile Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000370874900003"}
