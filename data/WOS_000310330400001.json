In textile production, the yarn is being withdrawn from cross-wound packages in warping and weft insertion. During unwinding, there appear forces in the yarn that are approximately proportional to the square of the unwinding velocity. The yarn tension is not constant, but it oscillates within some interval. This is especially noticeable in over-end unwinding from a static cross-wound package. Even when the yarn is not strongly stressed, so that the tension never exceeds a few percent of the breaking strength, the yarn can still break sometimes. The production process requires as large warping and weaving speeds as possible; therefore, it is necessary to improve our understanding of the cross-wound package unwinding and to find the necessary modifications of the yarn unwinding process. In addition to empirical tests, it has proved useful to study yarn unwinding by mathematical modelling and computer simulations. We state the equations of motion that describe the yarn unwinding and develop a mathematical model that permits to simulate the process of unwinding.", "paper_title": "Yarn motion during unwinding from packages", "paper_id": "WOS:000310330400001"}
