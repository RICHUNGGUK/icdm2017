In this method, classes are parameterized by an interval prototype based on an appropriate learning process. A similarity measure is defined in order to estimate the similarity between the interval feature value and each class prototype. Then, a similarity margin concept has been introduced. The heuristic search is avoided by optimizing an objective function to evaluate the importance (weight) of each interval feature in a similarity margin framework. The experimental results show that the proposed method selects meaningful features for interval data. In particular, the method we propose yields a significant improvement on classification task of three real-world datasets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
