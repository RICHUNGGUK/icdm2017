These advantages typically include higher speed and acceleration, improved position accuracy and increased stiffness. However, parallel manipulators also suffer from several disadvantages. These drawbacks commonly include a small ratio of the positional workspace relative to the manipulator footprint and a limited rotational capability of the manipulated platform. A few parallel manipulators featuring a large ratio of the positional workspace relative to the footprint have been proposed. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing gearing to extend the range of the end-effector rotation of such mechanisms. The objective is to achieve parallel manipulators where both the positional and rotational workspace are comparable to that of serial manipulators. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
