Although the latter may allow for simultaneous and collaborative interactions, most prototypes were not designed for multiple users and were only evaluated with single-user interactions. In this paper, we investigate the design, usability and user experience of multi-user interactions on dynamic NFC-displays. These interactive surfaces use a grid of NFC-tags for the direct manipulation of projected application user interfaces. In two user studies with three prototypes for multi-user interaction, we evaluated the performance of dynamic NFC-displays, interactions among users and the interplay between mobile devices and large displays.
