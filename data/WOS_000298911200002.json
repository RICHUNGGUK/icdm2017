Based on dictionary learning (DL) techniques, this letter discusses two new algorithms for image decomposing into a linear combination of morphological components. The proposed algorithms can be viewed as the extensions of DL-based image denoising algorithm. Experiments show that the learned dictionaries by the proposed algorithms can describe the different components of image effectively and leads to high quality image decomposition performance.
