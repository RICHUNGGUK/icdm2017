Here, we present a new system, N-SCAN ( a.k.a. TWINSCAN 3.0), for addressing this problem. N-SCAN can model the phylogenetic relationships between the aligned genome sequences, context-dependent substitution rates, and insertions and deletions. An implementation of N-SCAN was created and used to generate predictions for the entire human genome and the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Analyses of the predictions reveal that N-SCAN's accuracy in both human and fly exceeds that of all previously published whole-genome de novo gene predictors.", "paper_title": "Using multiple alignments to improve gene prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000236954700018"}
