While it uses ratings data of all users, as do collaborative recommender systems, it is also able to recommend new items and provide an explanation of its recommendations, as do content-based systems. Our approach is based on the idea that there are communities of users that find the same characteristics important to like or dislike a product. This model is an extension of the probabilistic latent semantic model for collaborative filtering with ideas based on clusterwise linear regression. On a movie data set, we show that the model, at the cost of a very small loss in overall performance, is able to recommend new items and give an explanation of its recommendations to its users.", "paper_title": "Including item characteristics in the probabilistic latent semantic analysis model for collaborative filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000272958500004"}
