At the same time, this paper proposes an adaptive prediction structure which can make different prediction modes to be applied to different groups of picture (GOPs) according to temporal correlations and interview correlations to improve the coding efficiency. Moreover, the most advanced video coding standard H.264 is used conveniently for maximize the coding efficiency in this paper. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by extensive experimental results.", "paper_title": "Compatible Stereo Video Coding with Adaptive Prediction Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619500016"}
