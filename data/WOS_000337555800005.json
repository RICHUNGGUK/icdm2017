The CBO algorithm is inspired by the laws of one-dimensional collision. After collision of two moving bodies, with specified mass and velocity, these bodies are separated and move to new positions with new velocities. Colliding bodies correspond to candidate designs. CBO utilizes a simple formulation and does not require parameter tuning. Test problems demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
