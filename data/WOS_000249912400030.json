Bagging draws bootstrap samples from the training sample, applies the classifier to each bootstrap sample, and then averages over all obtained classification rules. The idea of trimmed bagging is to exclude the bootstrapped classification rules that yield the highest error rates, as estimated by the out-of-bag error rate, and to aggregate over the remaining ones. ln this note we explore the potential benefits of trimmed bagging. On the basis of numerical experiments, we conclude that trimmed bagging performs comparably to standard bagging when applied to unstable classifiers as decision trees, but yields better results when applied to more stable base classifiers, like support vector machines.
