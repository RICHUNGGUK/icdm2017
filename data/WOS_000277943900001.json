We also investigate the algebraic properties concerning anti-autodense languages. The family of anti-autodense languages contains infix codes, comma-free codes, and some subfamilies of new codes which are anti-autodense prefix codes, anti-autodense suffix codes and anti-autodense codes. The relationships among these subfamilies of new codes are investigated. The characterization of L (n) , n a parts per thousand yen 2, which are anti-autodense is studied.", "paper_title": "A note on autodense related languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000277943900001"}
