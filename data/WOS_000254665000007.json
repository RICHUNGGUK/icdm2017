These tools are typically used in concert, often necessitating laborious and error-prone manual data reformatting and transfer. We present an intuitive workflow environment to support scientists with their research. The workflow, GPFlow, wraps legacy tools, presenting a high level, interactive web-based front end to scientists. The workflow backend is realized by a commercial grade workflow engine (Windows Workflow Foundation). The workflow model is inspired by spreadsheets and is novel in its support for an intuitive method of interaction enabling experimentation as required by many scientists, e.g. bioinformaticians. We apply GPFlow to two bioinformatics experiments and demonstrate its flexibility and simplicity.
