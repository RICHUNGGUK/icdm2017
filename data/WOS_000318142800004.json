Computer security experts have lambasted weaknesses in the system since its inception. Recent exploits have brought several problems back into stark focus. The authors describe some proposed technology-based improvements, as well as some legal, economic, and organizational shortcomings of the trust model. They also propose first steps toward fixes and next steps for study.", "paper_title": "Trust Darknet Control and Compromise in the Internet's Certificate Authority Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000318142800004"}
