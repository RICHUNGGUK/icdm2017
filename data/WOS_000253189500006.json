A phase stabilized feedback controller combined with a disturbance observer structure is applied to achieve the rejection of the two disturbances. A high frequency bandpass filter is adopted in the disturbance observer in order to reject the high frequency disturbance, and simultaneously the stability of the feedback control loop is remained when the disturbance observer is added on to the external stabilized controller. The effectiveness of the combined control is investigated through simulation and experiment results, which show that this control scheme can reduce position error significantly and is better than using phase stabilized feedback control only or proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with notch filters.
