The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, non-redundant local binary pattern (NRLBP) is used to describe the local appearance information of food objects. Second, the structural information of food objects is represented by the spatial relationship between interest points and encoded using a shape context descriptor formed from those interest points. Third, we propose two methods of integrating appearance and structural information for the description and classification of food images. We evaluated the proposed methods on two datasets. Experimental results verified that the combination of local appearance and structural features can improve classification performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
