The theoretical foundations of X-codes, employed in an X-tolerant compaction technique called X-compact, are examined. Through the formulation of a combinatorial model of X-compact, novel design techniques are developed for X-codes to detect a specified maximum number of errors in the presence of a specified maximum number of unknown logic values, while requiring only small fan-out. The special class of X-codes that results leads to an avoidance problem for configurations in combinatorial designs. General design methods and nonconstructive existence theorems to estimate the compaction ratio of an optimal X-compactor are also derived.", "paper_title": "A Combinatorial Approach to X-Tolerant Compaction Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000013"}
