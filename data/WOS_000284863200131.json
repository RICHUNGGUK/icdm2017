The design optimization of minimum weight of the laminated composite is evaluated using different failure criteria. The failure criteria considered are maximum stress (MS), Tsai-Wu (TW) and failure mechanism based (FMB) failure criteria. Minimum weight of the laminates are obtained for different failure criteria using VEPSO and GA for different combinations of loading. From the study it is evident that VEPSO and GA predict almost the same minimum weight of the laminate for the given loading. Comparison of minimum weight of the laminates by different failure criteria differ for some loading combinations. The comparison shows that FMBFC provide better results for all combinations of loading. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
