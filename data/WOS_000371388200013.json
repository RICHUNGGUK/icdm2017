Partly due to the advent of compressive sensing, methods that can optimally exploit sparsity in signals have received tremendous attention in recent years. In this paper, we will describe a variety of scenarios in which signal sparsity arises naturally in 5G wireless systems. Signal sparsity and the associated rich collection of tools and algorithms will thus be a viable source for innovation in 5G wireless system design. We will also describe applications of this sparse signal processing paradigm in Multiple Input Multiple Output random access, cloud radio access networks, compressive channel-source network coding, and embedded security. We will also emphasize an important open problem that may arise in 5G system design, for which sparsity will potentially play a key role in their solution.", "paper_title": "Sparse Signal Processing Concepts for Efficient 5G System Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200013"}
