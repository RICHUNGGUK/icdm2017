The new approach yields an efficient quantum algorithm for the bivariate HPGP even when the input consists of several level set superpositions, a more difficult version of the problem than the one where the input is given by an oracle. For constant degree, the algorithm is polylogarithmic in the size of the base field. We also apply the results to give an efficient quantum algorithm for the oracle version of the HPP for an interesting family of bivariate hidden functions. This family includes diagonal quadratic forms and elliptic curves.", "paper_title": "POLYNOMIAL TIME QUANTUM ALGORITHMS FOR CERTAIN BIVARIATE HIDDEN POLYNOMIAL PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579700006"}
