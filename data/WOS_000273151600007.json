Based on 3D modeling and visualization techniques, this water-diversion project simulation and evaluation system builds 3D digital geological models to aid in project development and assessment. Initial results from a project on rivers in China show the system's considerable promise.", "paper_title": "A 3D Geosciences Modeling System for Large-Scale Water-Diversion Projects", "paper_id": "WOS:000273151600007"}
