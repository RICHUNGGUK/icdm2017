Comput. System Sci., 47 (1993), pp. 549-595]. This problem is arguably the most fundamental and extensively studied problem in property testing of Boolean functions. The previously best bounds for REJ(epsilon) were obtained by Bellare et al. [IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 42 (1996), pp. 1781-1795]. They used Fourier analysis to show that REJ(epsilon) >= epsilon for every 0 <= epsilon <= 1/2. They also conjectured that this bound might not be tight for epsilon's which are close to 1/2. In this paper we show that this indeed is the case. Specifically, we improve the lower bound of REJ(epsilon) >= epsilon by an additive constant that depends only on epsilon: REJ(epsilon) >= epsilon + min{1376 epsilon(3)(1-2 epsilon)(12), 1/4 epsilon(1-2 epsilon)(4)}, for every 0 <= epsilon <= 1/2. Our analysis is based on a relationship between REJ(epsilon) and the weight distribution of a coset code of the Hadamard code. We use both Fourier analysis and coding theory tools to estimate this weight distribution.", "paper_title": "BREAKING THE epsilon-SOUNDNESS BOUND OF THE LINEARITY TEST OVER GF(2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000277584700012"}
