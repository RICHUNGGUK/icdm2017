It provides an additional power of protection, achieved by introducing an extra flow matching trial following each successful flow comparison of packets. The maximum number of comparisons permitted for an arrival can be controlled by a parameter called maxcomp. The quality of flow protection improves with maxcomp. Compared to the plain CHOKe (which is just the simplest case of gCHOKe), our analysis and simulations show that the scheme can achieve over 20% improvement in the bounds of both bandwidth and buffer space used by an aggressive flow. In addition, up to 14% of the total link capacity can be saved from the unresponsive flow, allowing responsive or rate-adaptive flows to obtain a better share of resources in the router.
