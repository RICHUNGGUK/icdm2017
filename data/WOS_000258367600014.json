MPC implies solving a quadratic optimisation problem with constraints online. For a practical prototype implementation, it is often necessary to implement the optimisation method yourself. First, the application is presented; then an overview of the most important optimisation methodologies is given. A modified Active Set Method (ASM) is derived. The advantage of this method is its straightforward implementation and good timing behaviour. This method is compared to a commercially implemented Interior Point Method (IPM) on a numerical example and on a real-life implementation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
