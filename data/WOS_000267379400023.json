Service configurations and traffic traces are arbitrary. First, we identify a rich class of throughput-optimal linear controls, which choose the service configuration S maximizing the projection < S, BX > when the backlog is X. The matrix B is arbitrarily fixed in the class of positive-definite, symmetric matrices with negative or zero off-diagonal elements. In contrast, positive off-diagonal elements may drive the system unstable, even for sub-critical loads. The associated rich Euclidian geometry of projective cones is explored (hence the name projective cone scheduling PCS). The maximum-weight-matching (MWM) rule is seen to be a special case, where B is the identity matrix. Second, we extend the class of throughput maximizing controls by identifying a tracking condition which allows applying PCS with any bounded time-lag without compromising throughput. It enables asynchronous or delayed PCS implementations and various examples are discussed.", "paper_title": "Projective Cone, Scheduling (PCS) Algorithms for Packet Switches of Maximal Throughput", "paper_id": "WOS:000267379400023"}
