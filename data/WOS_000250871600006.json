In our work, we describe an architecture for device discovery, device configuration, and the transfer of active sessions between devices. The presented architecture uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as a standardized, widely used signaling protocol for IP-based multimedia services. Our solution includes support of simple existing devices, split of sessions between devices, user-control of location-based behavior, and handling of security and privacy concerns. We present the implementation and show the feasibility of our work with analytical evaluation and measurements.", "paper_title": "Ubiquitous device personalization and use: The next generation of IP multimedia communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000250871600006"}
