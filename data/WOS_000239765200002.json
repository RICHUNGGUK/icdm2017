Adaptive systems could be used in many areas, for example in a user interface construction or e-Learning environments for learning strategy selection. In this paper the adaptation of web-based system user interface is presented. The goal of rough user classification is to select. the most essential attributes and their values that group together users who are very much alike concerning the system logic. In order to group users we exploit their usage data taken from the user model of the adaptive web-based system user interface. We presented three basic problems for attribute selection that generates the following partitions: that is included, that includes and that is the closest to the given partition.", "paper_title": "Determination of user interfaces in adaptive systems using a rough classification-based method", "paper_id": "WOS:000239765200002"}
