The densities and detonation velocities of the cocrystals at different molar ratios were estimated. The intermolecular interaction and bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the N-NO2 bond in the HMX: NQ (1:1) complex were calculated using the B3LYP, MP2(full) and M06-2X methods with the 6-311++ G(d, p) and 6-311++ G(2df, 2p) basis sets. The results indicated that the HMX/NQ cocrystal prefers cocrystalizing in a 1:1 molar ratio, and the cocrystallization is dominated by the (0 2 0) and (1 0 0) facets. The K, G, and E values of the ratio of 1:1 are smaller than those of the other ratios, and the 1:1 cocrystal has the best ductility. The N-NO2 bond becomes stronger upon the formation of the intermolecular H-bonding interaction and the sensitivity of HMX decreases in the cocrystal. This sensitivity change in the HMX/NQ cocrystal originates not only from the formation of the intermolecular interaction but also from the increment of the BDE of N-NO2 bond in comparison with isolated HMX. The HMX/NQ (1:1) cocrystal exhibits good detonation performance. Reduced density gradient (RDG) reveals the nature of cocrystallization. Analysis of the surface electrostatic potential further confirmed that the sensitivity decreases in complex (or cocrystal) in comparison with that in isolated HMX.", "paper_title": "Theoretical insights into the structures and mechanical properties of HMX/NQ cocrystal explosives and their complexes, and the influence of molecular ratios on their bonding energies", "paper_id": "WOS:000360850900026"}
