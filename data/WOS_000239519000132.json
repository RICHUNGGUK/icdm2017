The system uses electromyogram (EMG) signals from facial muscles to produce five distinct cursor actions, namely: left, right, up, down and left-click. The new system is derived from a system previously created by our group. Object selection tests are performed on both systems. We use statistical analysis and Fitts' law analysis of these tests to support our assertion that the new system provides enhanced performance over its predecessor.", "paper_title": "Electromyogram-based cursor control system for users with motor disabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000132"}
