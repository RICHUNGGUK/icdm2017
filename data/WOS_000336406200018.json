It utilizes decomposition of spatial domain into transport and diffusive subregions. This methodology uses the low-order equations of the Second-Moment (SM) method for the first two angular moments of the transport solution. These low-order SM equations are solved globally. The high-order transport solution is computed only in transport subregions. The transport boundary conditions at interfaces with neighbouring diffusion subregions are formulated using asymptotic analysis of SCB. We apply the quasidiffusion (Eddington) tensor to evaluate transport effects in the problem domain and determine spatial ranges of diffusive subregions. Numerical results are presented. They demonstrate the accuracy of the developed methodology for the SCB scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
