However, when the dictionary is large and the representation is sparse, only a small proportion of the elements contributes to the l(1)-minimization. Under this observation, several approaches have been developed to carry out an efficient element selection procedure before SRC. In this paper, we employ a metric learning approach which helps find the active elements correctly by taking into account the interclass/intraclass relationship and manifold structure of face images. After the metric has been learned, a neighborhood graph is constructed in the projected space. A fast marching algorithm is used to rapidly select the subset from the graph, and SRC is implemented for classification. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance and significant efficiency enhancement.", "paper_title": "Face recognition based on subset selection via metric learning on manifold", "paper_id": "WOS:000367881600004"}
