Since we provide both a planar and a spherical version of the algorithm, it is suitable for simulating trajectories ranging from the local scale up to the (inter-)continental scale, as exemplified by the movement of migrating birds. The algorithm accounts for physical limitations, including maximum speed and maximum movement time, and provides the user with either single or multiple trajectories as a result. Single trajectories generated by the RTG algorithm can be used as a null model to test hypotheses about movement stimuli, while the multiple trajectories can be used to create a probability density surface akin to Brownian bridges.", "paper_title": "From A to B, randomly: a point-to-point random trajectory generator for animal movement", "paper_id": "WOS:000357018400002"}
