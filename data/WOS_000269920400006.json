Medication administration is the most common activity performed by clinical professionals in healthcare settings. A standardized information model and structured hospital information system are necessary to achieve evidence-based clinical activities. A virtual scenario is used to demonstrate the proposed method of administering medication. We used the Health Level 7 Development Framework and other tools to create the clinical document architecture, which allowed us to illustrate each step of the Health Level 7 Development Framework in the administration of medication. We generated an information model of the medication administration process as one clinical activity. It should become a fundamental conceptual model for understanding international-standard methodology by healthcare professionals and nursing practitioners with the objective of modeling healthcare information systems.", "paper_title": "Health Level 7 Development Framework for Medication Administration", "paper_id": "WOS:000269920400006"}
