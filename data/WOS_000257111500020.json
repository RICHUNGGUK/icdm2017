In this paper, it is shown that the cross-correlation function between s(t) and s(dt + l), 0 <= l < (p(2k) + 1)/2, takes the values in {-1, -1 - root p(n), -1 + root p(n), -1 + 2 root p(n)} and their cross-correlation distribution is also derived.", "paper_title": "Cross-correlation distribution of p-ary m-sequence of period p(4k)-1 and its decimated sequences by (p(2k)+1/2)(2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000257111500020"}
