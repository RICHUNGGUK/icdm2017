Various soil compaction sensor systems have been deployed to obtain georeferenced maps of certain state and behavioral properties (e.g., soil strength, water content, air permeability) related to compaction. This publication classifies different prototype sensors, and reviews alternative measurement concepts from the viewpoint of soil mechanics. The majority of discussion is dedicated to a diversified family of soil strength sensors developed around the world. Through the follow-up analysis, a concept of sensor fusion has been emphasized as an option capable of improving future applicability of soil compaction sensor systems, while implementing site-specific control of localized compaction occurrences.
