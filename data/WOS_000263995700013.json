Some mobile multicast schemes have been proposed, but most of them introduce new entities and study construction algorithms of the dynamic multicast delivery structure which is heavyweight for wireless devices. in this paper, we propose a light-weight mobile multicast (LMM) scheme for Fast Mobile IPv6 which reduces the redundant operational overhead by simplifying multicast listener discovery (MLD) proxying. The LMM scheme implements simplified MILD proxying function on home agent to reduce the complicated multicast routing protocol and modifies MLD host part function on mobile node to reduce the multicast membership messages interaction. In order to solve the tunnel convergence problem, LMM also introduces a multicast tunnel combination and reconstruction algorithm. We set up a test-bed to evaluate the performance of LMM, and compare it with other mobile multicast schemes. The experimental results show that LMM reduces the multicast disruption time at handover. Based on the experimental results, we analyze the cost of LMM, and the results show that it has lower protocol cost than other schemes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
