In particular, we present a reliable and efficient uncertainty-modeling tool, which enables dynamic capturing of interval-valued clusters representations sets and functions using well-known pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms. We mainly deal with imprecise learning parameters in identifying uncertainty intervals of membership value distributions and imprecise functions. In the experiments, we use the proposed system as a decision support tool for a production line process. Simulation results indicate that in comparison to benchmark methods such as well-known type-1 and type-2 system modeling tools, and statistical machine-learning algorithms, proposed interval-valued imprecise system modeling tool is more robust with less error.
