The proposed method aims to enhance schedulability of a target network by better utilizing transmission medium, while avoiding inter-cluster collisions at the same time. To achieve this goal, the proposed scheduling method partially allows beacon overlaps, if appropriate. In particular, this paper answers for the following questions: 1) on which condition clusters can send overlapped beacons, 2) how to select clusters to overlap with minimizing utilization, and 3) how to adjust beacon parameters for grouped clusters. Also, we quantitatively evaluate the proposed method compared to previous works-i.e., non-beacon scheduling and a serialized beacon scheduling algorithm-from several aspects including total duty cycles, packet drop rate, and end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "Utilization-Aware Hybrid Beacon Scheduling in Cluster-Tree ZigBee Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422200006"}
