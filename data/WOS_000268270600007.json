The developed algorithm learns user interest by means of rules which add comprehensibility and clarity to the discovered models and increase the quality of the recommendations. This new model, called G3P-MI algorithm, is evaluated and compared with other available algorithms. Computational experiments show that our methodology achieves competitive results and provide high-quality user models which improve the accuracy of recommendations. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
