We highlight some of the factors we have encountered in our own work and observed in published papers and propose solutions that could both increase the productivity of researchers and the quality of their output.", "paper_title": "R-3 - Repeatability, Reproducibility and Rigor", "paper_id": "WOS:000209339400013"}
