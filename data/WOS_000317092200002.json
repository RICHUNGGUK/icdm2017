The epsilon-ISVR is first formulated as a convex non-smooth programming problem, and then a generalize recurrent neural network with lower model complexity is designed for training the support vector machine. Furthermore, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed neural network. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
