Propensity score matching and the recursive bivariate probit model are employed to deal with endogeneity and the missing data problem, which are often ignored in existing literature. Findings show that effects of campaign web sites vary across individual engagements and generally support reinforcement theory rather than mobilization theory.", "paper_title": "Do campaign web sites really matter in electoral civic engagement?
