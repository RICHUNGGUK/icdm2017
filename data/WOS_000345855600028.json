We assume that the foreground subject has already been extracted, and focus on the challenging task of generating a video with a new background, such that the new background motion appears compatible with the original one. Failure to match the motion results in disturbing slippage or moonwalk artifacts, where the subject's feet appear to slide or slip over the ground. While matching the motion across the entire frame is impossible for scenes with differing geometry, we aim to match the local motion of the ground in the vicinity of the subject. This is achieved by re-ordering and warping the available target background frames in a manner that optimizes a suitably designed objective function.", "paper_title": "Slippage-free Background Replacement for Hand-held Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000345855600028"}
