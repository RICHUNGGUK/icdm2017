Two new crossover methods, namely consecutive binomial crossover and non-consecutive exponential crossover, are designed. The probability distribution and expectation of crossover length for binomial and exponential crossover used in this paper are derived. Various differential evolution algorithms with different crossover methods including mutation-only differential evolution are comprehensively compared at system level instead of parameter level. Based on the theoretical analysis and simulation results, the effect of crossover on the reliability and efficiency of differential evolution algorithms is discussed. Some insights are revealed.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of crossover in differential evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000297197900003"}
