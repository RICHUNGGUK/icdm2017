Geometric structure embedded in equations is exploited and incorporated into the analysis to elucidate the underlying dynamics. Criteria derived from different geometric configurations lead to disparate numbers of equilibria. A new approach named sequential contracting is applied to conclude the global convergence to multiple equilibrium points of the system. The formulation accommodates both smooth sigmoidal and piecewise-linear activation functions. Several numerical examples illustrate the present analytic theory.", "paper_title": "Multistability for Delayed Neural Networks via Sequential Contracting", "paper_id": "WOS:000365312800012"}
