Among these guidelines, an efficient Hw/Sw partitioning procedure is presented. This Hw/Sw partitioning is performed taking into account both the control requirements (bandwidth and stability margin) and the architectural constraints (e. g., available area, memory, and hardware multipliers). A nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to solve the corresponding multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed Hw/Sw partitioning approach is then validated on a sensorless control algorithm for a synchronous motor based on an extended Kalman filter. Among the nondominated implementation solutions supplied by the NSGA-II, those that are considered as the most interesting are synthesized. Their time/area performances after synthesis are compared with success to their predictions. In addition, one of these optimal solutions is also tested on an experimental setup.", "paper_title": "Hardware/Software Codesign Guidelines for System on Chip FPGA-Based Sensorless AC Drive Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700035"}
