In this study, we characterized gene essentiality from a new perspective of protein domains, the independent structural or functional units of a polypeptide chain. Results: To identify such essential domains, we have developed an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm-based Essential Domain Prediction (EDP) Model. With simulated datasets, the model provided convergent results given different initial values and offered accurate predictions even with noise. We then applied the EDP model to six microbial species and predicted 1879 domains to be essential in at least one species, ranging 10-23% in each species. The predicted essential domains were more conserved than either non-essential domains or essential genes. Comparing essential domains in prokaryotes and eukaryotes revealed an evolutionary distance consistent with that inferred fromribosomal RNA. When utilizing these essential domains to reproduce the annotation of essential genes, we received accurate results that suggest protein domains are more basic units for the essentiality of genes. Furthermore, we presented several examples to illustrate how the combination of essential and non-essential domains can lead to genes with divergent essentiality. In summary, we have described the first systematic analysis on gene essentiality on the level of domains.", "paper_title": "A novel essential domain perspective for exploring gene essentiality", "paper_id": "WOS:000361757500001"}
