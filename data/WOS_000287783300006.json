We propose obtaining this CSI by using semi-blind techniques, which combine both supervised and unsupervised (blind) methods. The key idea consists in introducing a decision criterion to determine when the channel suffered a significant change. In such a case, transmission of pilot symbols is required. The use of this criterion also allows us to determine the time instants in which CSI has to be sent to the transmitter from the receiver through a low-cost feedback channel.", "paper_title": "DASBE: DECISION-AIDED SEMI-BLIND EQUALIZATION FOR MIMO SYSTEMS WITH LINEAR PRECODING", "paper_id": "WOS:000287783300006"}
