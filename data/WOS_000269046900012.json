It combines a spatially explicit hydrodynamic model with a water-quality and biotic model of ecological interactions. The software, which is freely available for research purposes, has a graphical user-friendly interface and a flexible design that allows the user to vary the complexity of the model. It also has built-in analysis tools such as Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, a genetic algorithm for calibration, and plotting tools. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
