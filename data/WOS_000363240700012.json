To avoid such a last-minute loss during a multi-chip integration process, built-in self-repair (BISR) is highly valuable. Even though there have been many BISR schemes in the literature, the proposed method offers a number of distinct features. First, it can target not only catastrophic faults, but also timing faults. Second, it can be applied to general multi-pin interconnects and it can be applied to repair an interposer with multiple faulty interconnects. Third, it can perform the test-and-then-repair flow on-the-fly, and thereby eliminating the overhead of extra repair storage incurred in previous methods.", "paper_title": "General Timing-Aware Built-In Self-Repair for Die-to-Die Interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000363240700012"}
