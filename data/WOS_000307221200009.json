In a degree of the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), teaching of this subject has been redesigned using a project-based learning approach. Along the course, the students make a complete project of a highway using professional software and procedures. The highway design software chosen includes a simulator that makes a virtual journey along the highway from the point of view of a driver traveling on it. A detailed description of the course program and the software used is provided. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
