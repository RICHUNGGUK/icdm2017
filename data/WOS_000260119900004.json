Using a specialized set of basis functions that respect the monotonic property of the system nonlinearities with respect to control input, a state predictor is defined for derivation of the adaptive laws. The adaptive dynamic inversion controller is defined as a solution of a fast dynamical equation, which achieves time-scale separation between the state predictor and the controller dynamics. Lyapunov-based adaptive laws ensure that the predictor tracks the state of the nonlinear system with bounded errors. As a result, the system state tracks the desired reference model with bounded errors. Benefits of the proposed design method are demonstrated using Van der Pol dynamics with nonlinear control input.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Dynamic Inversion via Time-Scale Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260119900004"}
