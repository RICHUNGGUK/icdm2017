The numerical solutions obtained by the discretization schemes are compared for five cases of the functional formfor the variable diffusivity: (I) constant diffusivity, (II) temporally dependent diffusivity, (III) spatially dependent diffusivity, (IV) concentration-dependent diffusivity, and (V) implicitly defined, temporallyand spatially dependent diffusivity. Although the schemes have similar agreement to known analyticalor semi-analytical solutions in the first four cases, in the fifth case for the variable diffusivity, one scheme produces a stable, physically reasonable solution, while the other diverges. We recommend the adoption of the more accurate and stable of these finite difference discretization schemes to numerically approximate the spatial derivatives of the diffusion equation in spherical coordinates for any functional form of variable diffusivity, especially cases where the diffusivity is a function of position.
