Different micro-motions may lead to similar change of incident directions, consequently inducing similar m-D characteristics. To tackle this problem, rather than distinguish warhead and decoy directly from m-D characteristics, the frequency components of m-D frequency curves are used as a new characteristic for recognition in this paper. To get high precision of frequency components estimation, model-based parameter estimation (MBPE) is utilized to extract the m-D frequency curves from TFR. To obtain high accurate simulation results, the backscattered signal simulation is conducted by full-wave numerical method. The simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and the high performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Precise recognition of warhead and decoy based on components of micro-Doppler frequency curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000301568200012"}
