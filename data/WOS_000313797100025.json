X. Goemans, S. Iwata, and R. Zenklusen's paper that proposes a flow model based on polylinking systems. Their flow model is a series (or tandem) connection of polylinking systems. We can consider an apparently more general model of a polylinking flow network which consists of an ordinary arc-capacitated network endowed with polylinking systems on the vertex set, one for each vertex of the network. This is a natural, apparent generalization of polymatroidal flow model of E. L. Lawler and C. U. Martel and of generalized-polymatroidal flow model of R. Hassin. We give a max-flow min-cut formula for the polylinking network flow problem and discuss some acyclic flow property of polylinking flows.", "paper_title": "A note on polylinking flow networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000313797100025"}
