The discovery and delivery of the most relevant and suitable services in a spontaneous network is a problem of great importance. In this paper we present an architecture that can support context-aware service discovery and delivery for resource-constrained mobile devices. At the heart of the architecture is the mu Jini proxy which mediates the discovery and delivery processes. Its discovery subsystem exploits relevant context information for the highest quality instance discovery. Its delivery subsystem provides thin-client based adaptation for fat service delivery not supported by thin client devices. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we developed a proof-of-concept prototype for Java mobile service environments.", "paper_title": "Impromptu Service Discovery and Delivery in Mobile Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000261206300008"}
