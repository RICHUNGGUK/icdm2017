The specific objectives are to teach basic suturing and knotting techniques for simple skin or soft tissue wound closure. The pre-wound suturing target, skin, or deformable tissue is modeled as a modified mass-spring system. The suturing material is designed as a mechanics-based deformable linear object. Tools involved in a typical suturing procedures are also simulated. Collision management modules between the soft tissue and the needle, the soft tissue and the suture are analyzed. In addition to modeling the interactive environment of a typical suturing procedure, basics of the modeling approaches on the evaluation of a stitch formed by the user are also discussed. For example, if needle insertion points are too close from each other or to the edge of the wound, when the suture is pulled, the suture will tear the soft tissue instead of suturing the incision together. Experiment results show that our simulator can run on a standard personal computer and allow users to perform different suturing patterns with smooth graphics and haptic feedback.", "paper_title": "Interactive multi-modal suturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000296279800003"}
