These response models are used to study feedback stabilization of resistive wall modes for fusion plasmas. Three approaches are discussed and compared. A direct full-model computation offers the most accurate response, unfortunately without producing analytical expressions for the response model. The pole-residue expansion methods yield analytical and asymptotically rigorous response models. A low-order Pade approximation serves as a model reduction technique that simplifies the controller design, while keeping a reasonable accuracy for the response models. From the computational viewpoint, the most efficient approaches are the pole-residue expansion based on eigenfunction projection, and the low-order Pade approximation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
