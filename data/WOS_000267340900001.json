Topological and shape derivatives are combined in order to derive an algorithm for image segmentation with fully automatized initialization. Segmentation of 2D and 3D data is presented. Further, a generalized Mumford-Shah functional is proposed and numerically investigated for the segmentation of images modulated due to, e.g., coil sensitivities.", "paper_title": "Multiphase Image Segmentation and Modulation Recovery Based on Shape and Topological Sensitivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000267340900001"}
