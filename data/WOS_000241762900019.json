For image segmentation, conventional chaotic sequence is not very effective to three-dimension gray histogram. In order to solve this problem, a three-dimension chaotic sequence generating method is presented. Simulation results show that the generated sequence is pseudorandom and its distribution is approximately inside a sphere whose centre is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). Based on this work, we use the proposed chaotic sequence to optimize three-dimension maximum between-variance image segmentation method. Experiments results show that our method has better segmentation effect and lower computation time than that of the original three-dimension maximum between-variance image segmentation method for mixed noise disturbed image.", "paper_title": "Three-dimension maximum between-cluster variance image segmentation method based on chaotic optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900019"}
