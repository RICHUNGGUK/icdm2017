This proves that BCTL* is decidable. It is also moderately useful to have a tableau available for a reasonably expressive branching-time temporal logic. However, the main interest in this should be that it leads us closer to being able to devise a tableau-based technique for theorem-proving in the important full computational tree logic CTL*.", "paper_title": "A tableau for bundled CTL", "paper_id": "WOS:000244531700007"}
