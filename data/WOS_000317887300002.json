We propose a solution, called DIBS, which is suitable for networks of any size with or without geographic location information, supports a wide range of applications, and allows any number of these applications to be deployed at any time without the need to reprogram the network. The design of DIBS consists of two key components: the design for a content-based routing substrate for sensor networks, and the design for a suite of subscription, publication, and notification protocols running on top of this substrate. Our theoretical findings are complemented by a simulation-based evaluation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
