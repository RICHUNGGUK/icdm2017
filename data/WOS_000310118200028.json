First, a new criterion for the avoidance of sliding motion on the boundaries is presented. Then, the piecewise affine controller is constructed in a way such that the resulting closed-loop system satisfies the proposed criterion and a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function can be used to establish the asymptotical stability. In this way, the control design problem is formulated as a numerical optimization problem under Linear Matrix Inequality constraints. The results are illustrated by application to control an aerobatic helicopter and balance an inverted pendulum on a cart, respectively, which demonstrates the efficacy and advantage of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED STATE FEEDBACK CONTROLLER SYNTHESIS FOR PIECEWISE-LINEAR SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118200028"}
