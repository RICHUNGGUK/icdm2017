With a new insight into fundamental properties of quantum hardcores, we present three new quantum hardcore functions for any (strong) quantum one-way function. We also give a \"quantum\" solution to Damgard's question [Advances in Cryptology, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 403, Springer, Berlin, 1990, pp. 163-172] on a classical hardcore property of his pseudorandom generator by proving its quantum hardcore property. Our major technical tool is the new notion of quantum list-decoding of \"classical\" error-correcting codes (rather than \"quantum\" error-correcting codes), which is defined on the platform of computational complexity theory and computational cryptography (rather than information theory). In particular, we give a simple but powerful criterion that makes a polynomial-time computable classical block code (seen as a function) a quantum hardcore for all quantum one-way functions. On their own interest, we construct efficient quantum list-decoding algorithms for classical block codes whose associated quantum states (called codeword states) form a nearly phase-orthogonal basis.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM HARDCORE FUNCTIONS BY COMPLEXITY-THEORETICAL QUANTUM LIST DECODING", "paper_id": "WOS:000280847900009"}
