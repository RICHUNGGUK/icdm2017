In this problem, a new pair of vertices and their incident edges are added to a weighted bipartite graph whose maximum-weighted matching is already known, and the maximum-weighted matching of the extended graph is sought. We propose an O(vertical bar V vertical bar(2)) algorithm for the problem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
