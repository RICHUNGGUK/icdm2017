The clocking scheme used to enable dual-edge triggering in the proposed SAFF reduces short circuit power by allowing the precharging transistors to be switched on only for a portion of the clock period. The extracted circuit layout of the proposed DE- SAFF has been simulated in STMicroelectronics 90 nm technology with a resonant clock signal at a frequency of 500 MHz. Simulation results show correct functionality of the flip-flip under process, voltage and temperature variations. Two low-power clocking techniques, the dual-edge triggering method and the emerging resonant (sinusoidal) clocking technique, have been combined to enable further power reduction in the CDN. Modelling the resonant clock distribution system with the proposed flip-flop illustrates that dual-edge triggering can achieve up to 58% reduction in the power consumption of resonant clock networks.", "paper_title": "Dual-edge triggered sense amplifier flip-flop for resonant clock distribution networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283750700005"}
