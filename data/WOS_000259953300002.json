Dramatic changes in technology, markets, and computer applications create a quite unique and challenging arena for computer architecture instructors and students. The goal is to provide learning environments that will offer hands-on experience and nurture rapid learning?, yet he intuitive and interesting to students. In this paper we discuss the challenges in teaching such courses and present a very flexible educational environment for teaching and learning of computer architecture and organization (CAL(2)) the CAL(2) encompasses a number of software tools that are used both in laboratory settings and at home during self-study. The CAL(2) allows students to write and execute their own assembly language programs, 'experience program execution through graphic simulation and animation, inspect implementation details clown to the register transfer level display timing diagrams, and test their knowledge. In addition the CAL(2) offers number of features that help instructors define, configure, manage, and administer the laboratory exercises. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
