However, by simply matching filler IDs with hole IDs, associating all the correlated fragments to complete the query path would result in blocking. Taking advantage of region-based coding scheme, this paper models the query expression into query tree and proposes a set of techniques to optimize the query plan. It then proposes XFPR (XML Fragment Processor with Region code) to speed up query processing by skipping correlating adjacent fragments. We illustrate the effectiveness of the techniques developed with a detailed set of experiments.", "paper_title": "Region-based coding for queries over streamed XML fragments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200047"}
