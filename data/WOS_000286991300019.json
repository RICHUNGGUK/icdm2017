Current fast and memory-saving short-read mappers could give us a quick view of the transcriptome. However, they are neither designed for reads that span across splice junctions nor for repetitive reads, which can be mapped to multiple locations in the genome (multi-reads). Here, we describe a new software package: ABMapper, which is specifically designed for exploring all putative locations of reads that are mapped to splice junctions or repetitive in nature.", "paper_title": "ABMapper: a suffix array-based tool for multi-location searching and splice-junction mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000286991300019"}
