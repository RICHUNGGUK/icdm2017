We first show that for every convolutional code there exists at least one optimal generator matrix with respect to UEP. The UEP optimality of convolutional encoders is then combined with several algebraic properties, e.g., systematic, basic, canonical, and minimal, to establish the fundamentals of convolutional codes for UEP. In addition, a generic lower bound on the length of a UEP convolutional code is proposed. Good UEP codes with their lengths equal to the derived lower bound are obtained by computer search.", "paper_title": "On Unequal Error Protection of Convolutional Codes From an Algebraic Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000273134100022"}
