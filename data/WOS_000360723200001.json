The proposed system is called LMN4DISABLED. Smartphone devices are used as interfaces for disabled people to communicate with the surrounding environments. This paper studies two types of disabilities (1) blind people and (2) people on wheelchairs with no mental deficiencies. Experiments are performed on a three-floor university building. Sensor nodes and cameras are distributed in all rooms and hallways. Dijkstra routing algorithm is used to select the appropriate route for each profile. New localization algorithm is used in the experiments. Experiments show that LMN4DISABLED outperforms reference experiments that are not using LMN4DISABLED by about 50.8% for different types of disabilities. When separating the performance of the blind disabled people from the performance of the people on wheelchairs, experiments show that the blind performance improved by 55% while wheelchair users improved by 47% when using the LMN4DISABLED system compared to basic reference experiments for the same people that did not use the LMN4DISABLED.", "paper_title": "Towards Independency Using LMN4DISABLED System for Disabled", "paper_id": "WOS:000360723200001"}
