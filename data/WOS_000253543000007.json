Policy Mapper is an administrative tool that helps define access control at conceptual and logical levels to carry out constraint specification and enforcement. The tool also provides an Interface Definition Language that couples the two levels. Policy Mapper bridges a critical gap between the expressiveness and enforcement of spatial constraints in location-based access-control policies.", "paper_title": "Policy Mapper: Administering location-based access-control policies", "paper_id": "WOS:000253543000007"}
