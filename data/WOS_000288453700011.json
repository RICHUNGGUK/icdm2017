F-f results from a systematic design based on a new algebraic framework focusing on the security and privacy of RFID authentication protocols. F-f offers user-adjustable, strong authentication, and privacy against known algebraic attacks and recently popular SAT-solving attacks. In contrast to related work, F-f achieves these security properties without requiring an expensive cryptographic hash function. F-f is designed for a challenge-response protocol, where the tag sends random nonces and the results of HMAC-like computations of one of the nonces together with its secret key back to the reader. In this paper, the authentication and privacy of F-f is evaluated using analytical and experimental methods.", "paper_title": "The F-f-Family of Protocols for RFID-Privacy and Authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000288453700011"}
