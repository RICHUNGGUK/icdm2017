Special cases of pseudo-splines include uniform odd-degree B-splines and the interpolatory 2n-point subdivision schemes, and the other pseudo-splines fill the gap between these two families. In this paper we show how the refinement step of a pseudo-spline subdivision scheme can be implemented efficiently using repeated local operations, which require only the data in the direct neighbourhood of each vertex, and how to generalize this concept to quadrilateral meshes with arbitrary topology. The resulting pseudo-spline surfaces can be arbitrarily smooth in regular mesh regions and C-1 at extraordinary vertices as our numerical analysis reveals.", "paper_title": "Pseudo-Spline Subdivision Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000341128900023"}
