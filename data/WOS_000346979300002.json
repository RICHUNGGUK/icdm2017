However, current virtualization architecture lacks support for high-performance I/O virtualization over persistent storage, which results in sub-optimal I/O performance for guest virtual machines (VMs) on SSD. Further, current software-based I/O virtualization violates the \"don't hide power\" principle due to inefficient support for some advanced SSD commands (e.g., TRIM) and constrained parallelism, leading to sub-optimal performance and life cycle. This paper observes that the massive internal parallelism and the block emulation in the flash translation layer (FTL) make flash-based SSD an ideal candidate to support high-performance I/O virtualization for persistent storage. Based on this observation, we propose VFlash, the first storage I/O virtualization architecture that extends existing SSDs with trivial hardware changes to directly expose multiple virtual SSDs to guest VMs. Performance evaluation using a modified FlashSim with two FTL schemes (i.e., DFTL and FAST) shows that VFlash incurs only small performance overhead over native SSDs and can efficiently exploit parallelism.", "paper_title": "Architecting Flash-based Solid-State Drive for High-performance I/O Virtualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000346979300002"}
