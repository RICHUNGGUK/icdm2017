A common problem of these kernel-based methods is to calculate inverses of kernel matrices generated by a kernel function and a set of points. Due to the denseness of these matrices, finding their inverses is computationally costly. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce in this paper an approximation of the kernel matrices by appropriate multilevel circulant matrices so that the fast Fourier transform can be applied to reduce the computational cost. Convergence analysis for the proposed approximation is established based on certain decay properties of the kernels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
