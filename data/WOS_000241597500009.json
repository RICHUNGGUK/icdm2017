Three important antenna-layout dimensions are used to capture critical input/output relationships in the ANN model. Once fully developed, the ANN model has been shown to be as accurate as an EM simulator and much more efficient computationally in antenna design optimization. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
