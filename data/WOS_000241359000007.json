We used a surface-syntactic parser in order to extract new indexing terms. These terms are considered syntactic dependencies. Our goal was to evaluate their relevance for an information retrieval task. We used them in different forms in different information retrieval models, in particular in a language model. For the bilingual task, we tried two simple tests of Spanish and German to French retrieval; for the translation we used a lemmatizer and a dictionary.", "paper_title": "Using the X-IOTA system in mono- and bilingual experiments at CLEF 2005", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000007"}
