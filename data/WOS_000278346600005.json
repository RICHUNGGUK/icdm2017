A functional topology of the system is generated from the given transfer function model of the modulator. Mathematical transformation technique is applied iteratively over the initial topology to generate a functional topology which is optimized for modulator sensitivity, hardware complexity and relative power consumption. This is then implemented using behavioral models of operational transconductance amplifiers and capacitors. The generated high-level topology is ensured to work with reasonable accuracy under non-ideal conditions. The entire procedure has been implemented in Matlab/Simulink environment. Numerical results have been provided to demonstrate the procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
