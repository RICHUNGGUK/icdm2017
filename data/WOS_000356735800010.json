One of the purposes is to analyze the problem of periodic orbits. To do so, we introduce new tools including inequality techniques and Kakutani's fixed point theorem of set-valued maps to derive the existence of periodic solution. Another purpose is to design a switching state-feedback control for realizing global exponential synchronization of the drive-response network system with periodic coefficients. Unlike the previous works on periodic synchronization of neural network, both the neuron activations and controllers in this paper are allowed to be discontinuous. Moreover, owing to the occurrence of delays in neuron signal, the neural network model is described by the functional differential equation. So we introduce extended Filippov-framework to deal with the basic issues of solutions for discontinuous DNNs. Finally, two examples and simulation experiments are given to illustrate the proposed method and main results which have an important instructional significance in the design of periodic synchronized DNNs circuits involving discontinuous or switching factors.
