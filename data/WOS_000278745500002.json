We focus on the solution of unsteady systems, in which the temporal terms are discretized by the backward Euler method using finite difference. To save computational cost, an adaptive time stepping is used to minimize the number of time steps. The developed program can be applied to solve any nonlinear equations, provided the users could supply the discrete form of the equations. In particular, the nonlinear solver is implemented to solve unsteady reacting flows.", "paper_title": "Newton Method for Nonlinear Dynamic Systems with Adaptive Time Stepping", "paper_id": "WOS:000278745500002"}
