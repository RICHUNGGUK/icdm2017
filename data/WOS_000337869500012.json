Since most surveys focus on estimation, herein we derive sample size formulas for estimation of prevalence and a difference between two prevalences in this design. In contrast to the conventional approach to sample size estimation, we explicitly incorporate into the formulas an assurance probability of achieving the pre-specified precision. Exact evaluation results demonstrate that these formulas perform well. The methods are illustrated using data from a real study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
