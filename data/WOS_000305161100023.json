Currently, a process model was usually included in a lengthy process containing many process components, which makes them difficult for managers and other users to learn. This study proposes an approach for transforming an Event Process Chain (EPC)-based process model into a hierarchical functional model. The proposed approach identifies structural errors in the process model and then converts it to a structured process model. A blocking approach is then used to form a hierarchical model by grouping sets of process elements into several sub-function units and to construct a hierarchical model.", "paper_title": "TRANSFER AN EPC BASED PROCESS MODEL INTO A HIERARCHICAL FUNCTIONAL MODEL TO SUPPORT VALUE CHAIN DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161100023"}
