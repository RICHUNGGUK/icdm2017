Let S(2) be the star of order 2 (or K(2)) and Q be the graph obtained from S(2) by attaching two pendent edges, to each of the end vertices of S(2). Majstorovic et al. conjectured that S(2), Q and the complete bipartite graphs K(2,2) and K(3,3) are the only connected graphs with maximum degree Delta <= 3 whose energies are equal to the number of vertices. This paper is devoted to giving a confirmative proof to this conjecture.", "paper_title": "All Connected Graphs with Maximum Degree at Most 3 whose Energies are Equal to the Number of Vertices", "paper_id": "WOS:000281508800002"}
