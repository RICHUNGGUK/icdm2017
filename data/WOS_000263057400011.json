We propose the use of a graph summarization (GS) technique, based on graph compression, to cluster protein interaction graphs into biologically relevant modules. The method is motivated by defining a biological module as a set of proteins that have similar sets of interaction partners. We show this definition, put into practice by a GS algorithm, reveals modules that are more biologically enriched than those found by other methods. We also apply GS to predict complex memberships, biological processes, and co-complexed pairs and show that in most settings GS is preferable over existing methods of protein interaction graph clustering.", "paper_title": "Revealing Biological Modules via Graph Summarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000263057400011"}
