The method employs step size controls that enable applications to problems where certain set-valued mappings do not always map to empty set. The algorithm also adopts the recently introduced (H, eta)-monotone concept which unifies many known monotonicities. Thus generalized many existing results.", "paper_title": "An iterative method for quasi-variational-like inclusions with fuzzy mappings", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500050"}
