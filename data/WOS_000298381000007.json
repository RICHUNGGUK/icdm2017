We propose a novel distance measure of time series, Spatial Assembling Distance (SpADe), that is able to handle noisy, shifting, and scaling in both temporal and amplitude dimensions. We further apply the SpADe to the application of streaming pattern detection, which is very useful in trend-related analysis, sensor networks, and video surveillance. Our experimental results on real time series data sets show that SpADe is an effective distance measure of time series. Moreover, high accuracy and efficiency are achieved by SpADe for continuous pattern detection in streaming time series.", "paper_title": "Effective and Efficient Shape-Based Pattern Detection over Streaming Time Series", "paper_id": "WOS:000298381000007"}
