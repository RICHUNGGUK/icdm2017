Power consumption can be reduced by avoiding unnecessary processing whereas data rate is greatly decreased by sending spike time-stamps along with spike features as opposed to raw digitized data. Dynamic range in NRS can vary with time due to change in electrode-neuron distance or background noise, which demands adaptability. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is one of the most important blocks in a NRS. This paper presents an 8-bit SAR ADC in 0.13-mu m CMOS technology along with input and reference buffer. A novel energy efficient digital-to-analog converter switching scheme is proposed, which consumes 37% less energy than the present state-of-the-art. The use of a ping-pong input sampling scheme is emphasized for multichannel input to alleviate the bandwidth requirement of the input buffer. To reduce the data rate, the A/D process is only enabled through the in-built background noise rejection logic to ensure that the noise is not processed. The ADC resolution can be adjusted from 8 to 1 bit in 1-bit step based on the input dynamic range. The ADC consumes 8.8 mu W from 1 V supply at 1 MS/s speed. It achieves effective number of bits of 7.7 bits and FoM of 42.3 fJ/conversion-step.", "paper_title": "An 8-to-1 bit 1-MS/s SAR ADC With VGA and Integrated Data Compression for Neural Recording", "paper_id": "WOS:000325227200007"}
