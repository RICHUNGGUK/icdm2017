On the one hand, relational preferences should be represented into statements which are natural for human users to express. On the other hand, relational preference models should be endowed with a structure that supports tractable forms of reasoning and learning. Based on these criteria, this paper introduces the framework of relational conditional preference networks (RCP-nets), that maintains the spirit of the popular \"CP-nets\" by expressing relational preferences in a natural way using the ceteris paribus semantics. We show that acyclic RCP-nets support tractable inference for optimization and ranking tasks. In addition, we show that in the online learning model, tree-structured RCP-nets (with bipartite orderings) are efficiently learnable from both optimization tasks and ranking tasks, using linear loss functions. Our results are corroborated by experiments on a large-scale movie recommendation dataset.", "paper_title": "Relational networks of conditional preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000308442200003"}
