Since a general case is quite hard to solve, we consider special but biologically important subclasses of BNs. For finding an attractor of period 2 of n BN consisting of n OR functions of positive literals, we present a polynomial time algorithm. For finding an attractor of period 2 of n BN consisting of n AND/OR functions of literals, we present an O(1.985(n)) time algorithm. For finding an attractor of a fixed period of n BN consisting of n nested canalyzing functions and having constant treewidth w, we present an O(n(2p(w+1))poly(n)) time algorithm.", "paper_title": "Finding a Periodic Attractor of a Boolean Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000307299200016"}
