While fairly good results have been obtained for inferring the user state under highly controlled conditions, a considerable amount of work remains to be done for learning high-quality estimates of subjective evaluations of the state in more natural conditions. In this work, we discuss how two recent machine learning concepts, multi-view learning and multi-task learning, can be adapted for user state recognition, and demonstrate them on two data collections of varying quality. Multi-view learning enables combining multiple measurement sensors in a justified way while automatically learning the importance of each sensor. Multi-task learning, in turn, tells how multiple learning tasks can be learned together to improve the accuracy. We demonstrate the use of two types of multi-task learning: learning both multiple state indicators and models for multiple users together. We also illustrate how the benefits of multi-task learning and multi-view learning can be effectively combined in a unified model by introducing a novel algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
