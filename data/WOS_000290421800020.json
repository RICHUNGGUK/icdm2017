Highlights include File format Reading of TTrees has been improved dramatically with respect to CPU time (30%) and notably with respect to disk space. Histograms A new TEfficiency class has been provided to handle the calculation of efficiencies and their uncertainties, TH2Poly for polygon-shaped bins (e.g. maps), TKDE for kernel density estimation, and TSVDUnfold for singular value decomposition. Graphics Kerning is now supported in TLatex, PostScript and PDF; a table of contents can be added to PDF files. A new font provides italic symbols. A TPad containing GL can be stored in a binary (i.e. non-vector) image file; add support for full-scene anti-aliasing. Usability enhancements to EVE. Math New interfaces for generating random number according to a given distribution, goodness of fit tests of unbinned data, binning multidimensional data, and several advanced statistical functions were added. RooFit Introduction of HistFactory; major additions to RooStats. TMVA Updated to version 4.1.0, adding e.g. the support for simultaneous classification of multiple output classes for several multivariate methods. PROOF Many new features, adding to PROOF's usability, plus improvements and fixes. PyROOT Support of Python 3 has been added. Tutorials Several new tutorials were provided for above new features (notably RooStats). A detailed list of all the changes is available at http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/examples/V5.
