This paper proposes a protocol to track a mobile object in a sensor network dynamically. The previous researches almost focus on how to track object accurately and they do not consider the query for mobile sources. Additionally, they need not report the tracking information to user. The work is concentrated on mobile user how to query target tracks and obtain the target position effectively. The mobile user can obtain the tracking object position without broadcast query. The user is moving and approaching the target when he/she knows the target's position. Wireless sensor networks can assist user to detect target as well as keep the movement information of the target. Sensor nodes establish face structure to track the designated target and keep target tracks. The source follows the tracks to approaching target. To chase the object quick and maintain an accurate tracking route, the sensors cooperate together to shorten the route between target and source dynamically. A source can quickly approach a target along a shortened route. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with three flooding-based query methods. By the simulation results, the proposed protocol has better performance than that of flooding-based query methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
