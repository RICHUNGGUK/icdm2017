The proposed distance functions include specialized weighted versions of the Kendall tau distance and the Cayley distance, and are suitable for comparing rankings in a number of applications, including information retrieval and rank aggregation. In addition to proposing the distance measures and providing the theoretical underpinnings for their applications, we also analyze algorithmic and computational aspects of weighted distance-based rank aggregation. We present an aggregation method based on approximating weighted distance measures by a generalized version of Spearman's footrule distance as well as a Markov chain method inspired by PageRank, where transition probabilities of the Markov chain reflect the chosen weighted distances.", "paper_title": "An Axiomatic Approach to Constructing Distances for Rank Comparison and Aggregation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900036"}
