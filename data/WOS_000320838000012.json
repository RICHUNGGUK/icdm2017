The SVMs (base classifiers of the ensemble system) are trained on different informative gene pairs. These gene pairs are selected by the top scoring pair (TSP) criterion. Each of these pairs projects the original microarray expression onto a 2-D space. Extensive permutation of gene pairs may reveal more useful information and potentially lead to an ensemble classifier with satisfactory accuracy and interpretability. GA is further applied to select an optimized combination of base classifiers. The effectiveness of the GA-ESP classifier is evaluated on both binary-class and multi-class datasets.
