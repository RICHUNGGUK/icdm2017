We address the noise issue of spatial recognition with a biologically inspired chemotactic model that is capable of handling noisy data. The model is based on bacterial chemotaxis, a process that allows bacteria to survive by changing motile behaviour in relation to environmental dynamics. Using chemotactic principles, we propose the chemotactic model and evaluate its classification performance in a smart house environment. The model exhibits high classification accuracy (99%) with a diverse 10 class activity dataset and outperforms the discrete hidden Markov model (HMM). High accuracy ( > 89%) is also maintained across small training sets and through incorporation of varying degrees of artificial noise into testing sequences. Importantly, unlike other bottom-up spatial activity recognition models, we show that the chemotactic model is capable of recognising simple interwoven activities.", "paper_title": "A chemotactic-based model for spatial activity recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241361700009"}
