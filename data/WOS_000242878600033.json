However, conventional reconfigurable devices suffer from memory-bit upset caused by charged particles in space which results in fatal system problems. In this paper, we propose an architecture of a fault-tolerant reconfigurable device. The proposed device is divided into \"autonomous-repair cells\" with embedded control circuits. The autonomous-repair cell proposed in this paper is based on error detection and correction (EDAC) and uses hardware and time redundancy. From evaluation, it is shown that the proposed architecture achieves sufficient reliability against configuration memory upset. Trade-offs between performance and cost are also analyzed.", "paper_title": "Fault tolerant dynamic reconfigurable device based on EDAC with rollback", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600033"}
