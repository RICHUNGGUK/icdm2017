A Simple Wavelet Compression (SWC) processing of image coding is proposed to maximize compression and minimize energy cost in WSN. For low activity in WSN, we employ a Low-complexity Change Detection Algorithm (LCDA) to mark active blocks and we only encode these active regions to save energy. In particular, a position estimation and compensation method is presented to exploit the inherent correlations that exist between sensor readings based on distributed lifting scheme. The impact of this scheme on image signal quality is presented in the final. The simulation results showed that these approaches achieved significant energy savings without sacrificing the quality of the image reconstruction.", "paper_title": "A distributed wavelet-based image coding for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400011"}
