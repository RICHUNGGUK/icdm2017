This problem is a nonconvex program which possesses many local optima. Its solution often falls into these traps. In this paper, we propose a new noising method based clustering algorithm called Improved Noising Method based Clustering (INMC). In the INMC algorithm, local iteration methods are integrated to improve the solution obtained during the iteration process. In addition, a mergence and partition mode is designed to establish the neighboring solution. Experimental results on artificial and real-life data sets are given to illustrate the superiority of the INMC algorithm over some known clustering methods.", "paper_title": "Using noising method for clustering analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000256710400021"}
