While the mechanisms governing early and late G1 progression are well understood, very little is known about the G0-G1 transition. Human CDK3 is closely related to cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Since there is no crystallographic structure of human CDK3, this work describes for the first time a molecular model of human CDK3 complexed with several inhibitors. Comparison of the binary complexes with different inhibitors strongly indicates that those inhibitors should inhibit CDK3 as well as CDK2. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
