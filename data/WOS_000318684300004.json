In this paper, we study the problem of optimal power allocation, taking into account the estimation of the total signal-to-noise ratio at the fusion centre (FC). We consider that nodes transmit their data to the fusion centre over quasistatic Rayleigh fading channels. In order to analyse our approach, we first investigate the orthogonal channel case and then the non-orthogonal one introducing a virtual MISO framework communication scheme. We consider in both cases that the nodes have channel state information. Simulations show that the new algorithm introduced provides a network extension lifetime of more than 80% in comparison with other traditional methods.", "paper_title": "Increasing network lifetime in an energy-constrained wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000318684300004"}
