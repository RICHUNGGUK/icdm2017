Studies have found that users who routinely use online services either consciously develop loyalty or automatically develop a habit. But many studies now mix the elements of conscious and automatic use despite the great differences in these phenomena. This study proposes a new theoretical framework of how the conscious and automatic mechanisms simultaneously, but differentially, regulate postadoption phenomena in the context of online information services. An empirical test confirms that these two mechanisms have highly discernible patterns that researchers and managers alike must heed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
