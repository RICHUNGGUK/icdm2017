They are highly visible and influential realizations of user-oriented technology supporting numerous human pursuits realized across the e-service. In this paper, we focus on web-based e-service systems for the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) remote control. These systems can provide web services for updating factors and the fuzzy law of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy, when the PMSM devices are required. This paper designs the controller of the PMSM with uncertain inertia and friction factors working under load noise in Web-based e-service systems. This controller is based on rotor field-oriented control (RFOC) structures, internal model control (IMC), and improved direct adaptive fuzzy (IDAF). In order to enhance the transient quality for the case of uncertain inertia and friction factors, we use the IDAF algorithm for the outer loop (speed loop). The IDAF is designed based on the direct adaptive fuzzy algorithm combined with the G-Fuzzy system for adjusting online updating adaption factors. The essence of IDAF is a self-learning and self-adaption system with enhanced adaptive ability through the G-Fuzzy system. For the inner loop (current loop), an improved IMC (IIMC) structure is proposed to reduce the effect of load noise. The IIMC combines the tradition IMC and a speed feedback loop to enhance the antiload noise ability of the system. The difference between our control structure and the traditional control structure is that the system could automatically realize antiload noise in the inner loop before adjusting the speed in the outer loop. This will create really high performances for PMSM control systems. We also demonstrate the effect of this control algorithm on PMSM-RFOC system control. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that the current response satisfies the condition of ability and settling time. Especially, the antiload noise ability and transient quality of the system are controlled independently. Thus, it is a solid foundation upon which to develop a high-quality PMSM electric drive in the e-service.", "paper_title": "An Improved Direct Adaptive Fuzzy Controller of an Uncertain PMSM for Web-Based E-Service Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000349418100006"}
