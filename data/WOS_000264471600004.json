However, their performance suffers from inappropriate choices of features, neighborhood sizes and training patches. To address the issues. we propose an extended Neighbor embedding based super-resolution through edge detection and Feature Selection (henceforth Need FS). Three major contributions Of Need FS are: (1) A new combination of features are proposed, which preserve edges and smoothen color regions better; (2) the training patches are learned discriminately with different neighborhood sizes based on edge detection; (3) only those edge training patches are bootstrapped to provide extra useful information with least redundancy. Experiments show that Need FS performs better in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Need FS is also robust even with a very limited training set and thus is promising for real applications. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
