The topology of the phylogeny structure in this case is an acyclic graph, which is often a tree, is easy to comprehend and is somewhat easy to infer. However, recombination is an undeniable genetic fact for most part of the genome. Driven by the need for a more complete analysis, we address the problem of estimating the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) from a collection of extant sequences. We exploit the coherence that is observed in the human haplotypes as patterns and present a network model of patterns to reconstruct the ARG. We test our model on simulations that closely mimic the observed haplotypes and observe promising results.", "paper_title": "Estimating the Ancestral Recombinations Graph (ARG) as Compatible Networks of SNP Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000260958500001"}
