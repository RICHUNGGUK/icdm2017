We propose a novel Bayesian formulation, including priors for spatial and temporal smoothness, and preferred shapes and position. The shape model takes into account both endocardium, atrial region and apex. The likelihood is built using a statistical signal model, which attempts to closely model a censored signal. In addition, the use of a censored Gamma mixture model with unknown censoring point, to handle artefacts resulting from left-censoring of the in US clinical B-mode, is to our knowledge novel. The posterior density is sampled by the Gibbs method to estimate the expected latent variable representation of the endocardium, which we call the Bayesian Probability Map; the map describes the probability of pixels being classified as being within the endocardium. The regularization parameters of the model are estimated by cross-validation, and the results are compared against the two-chamber apical model of Chen et al. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
