An effective differential evolution with level comparison (DELC) is proposed, which applies differential evolution for global searching and employs level comparison for constraint handling. The DELC is general and can be easily and directly applied to many kinds of reduced-order/fixed-structure controller synthesis problems without any conservative assumption about the objective function. Numerical simulations are carried out based on some typical problems, and the comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed DELC algorithm.", "paper_title": "Fixed-Structure H-infinity Controller Synthesis Based on Differential Evolution with Level Comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000287671500007"}
