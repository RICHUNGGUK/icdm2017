Design of such systems is challenging and requires suitable, scalable analysis tools to check properties of proposed system designs before they are put into operation. We present a novel scalable, on-the-fly approximated model-checking procedure to verify bounded PCTL properties of selected individuals in the context of very large systems of independent interacting objects. The proposed procedure combines on-the-fly model-checking techniques with deterministic mean-field approximation in discrete time. The asymptotic correctness of the procedure is proven and a prototype implementation of the model-checker is presented. The potential of the verification approach is illustrated by its application on self-organising collective systems and an overview of remaining open issues and future extensions is provided.
