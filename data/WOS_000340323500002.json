It is known that WSN P systems are universal by simulating register machines. However, in these universal systems, no bound is considered on the number of neurons and rules. In this work, a restricted variant of WSN P systems is considered, called simple WSN P systems, where each neuron has only one rule. The complexity parameter, the number of neurons, to construct a universal simple WSN P system is investigated. It is proved that there is a universal simple WSN P system with 48 neurons for computing functions; as generator of sets of numbers, there is an almost simple (that is, each neuron has only one rule except that one neuron has two rules) and universal WSN P system with 45 neurons.", "paper_title": "Small universal simple spiking neural P systems with weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000340323500002"}
