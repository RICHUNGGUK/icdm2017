The main contributions presented here are (a) generation of a database of handwritten basic characters of Bangla and (b) development of a handwritten character recognition scheme suitable for scripts like Bangla consisting of many similar shaped characters for the benchmark results. The present database is a pioneering development in the context of recognition of off-line handwritten characters of this script. It has 37,858 handwritten samples and accommodates a large spectrum of handwriting style by Bangla speaking population. This database will be made available (http://www.isical.ac.in/*ujjwal/download/Banglabasiccharacter.html) free of cost to researchers for further studies. Also, we identified two major factors affecting high recognition accuracies for the present character samples, namely, (a) erratic nature of the presence of headline (shapes of Bangla characters usually contain a horizontal line in its upper part) and (b) existence of several pairs of similar shaped characters. The proposed recognition approach takes care of the above factors. It identifies any confusion in the first stage classification between a pair of similar shaped character classes and resolves the same in the second stage classification by extracting a feature vector based on a non-uniform grid.", "paper_title": "Offline recognition of handwritten Bangla characters: an efficient two-stage approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000310089900007"}
