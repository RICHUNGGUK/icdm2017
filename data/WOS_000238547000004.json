Comparisons with analytical solutions for near-limit waves confirms the susceptibility of the boundary integral method to poor precision at near-boundary locations. Additionally, these comparisons identify a domain-wide precision challenge that is associated with the relatively rapid changes in water surface geometry and kinematics that are typical of extreme waves. A numerical evaluation of Green's integral around the boundary addresses these precision issues through formulation of the integration as a simultaneous system of ordinary differential equations at a cubic level of approximation. Careful attention is given to consistent interpolation of all contributions to the Green's integral.
