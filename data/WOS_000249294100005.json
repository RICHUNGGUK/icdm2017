The upper bounds are obtained from the analysis of the performance of a randomized greedy algorithm to find bisections of d-regular graphs. We provide bounds for 5 <= d <= 12. We also give empirical values of the size of the bisection found by the algorithm for some small values of d and compare them with numerical approximations of our theoretical bounds. Our analysis also gives asymptotic lower bounds for the size of the maximum bisection.
