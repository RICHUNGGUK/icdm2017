In order to defend against future worms, it is important to first understand how worms propagate and how different scanning strategies affect worm propagation dynamics. In this paper, we systematically model and analyze worm propagation under various scanning strategies, such as uniform scan, routing scan, hit-list scan, cooperative scan, local preference scan, sequential scan, divide-and-conquer scan, target scan, etc. We also provide an analytical model to accurately model Witty worm's destructive behavior. By using the same modeling framework, we reveal the underlying similarity and relationship between different worm scanning strategies. In addition, based on our simulation and analysis of Blaster worm propagation and monitoring, we provide a guideline for building a better worm monitoring infrastructure. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
