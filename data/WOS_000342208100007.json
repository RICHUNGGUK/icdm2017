In contrast to previous approaches, the material properties do not have a discontinuous change across the interface that is often represented by a sharp geometric boundary between material regions. Instead, finite material interfaces with monotonic and non-monotonic property variations over a physically motivated interface zone are investigated. Numerical results are provided for several 2D problems including compliance and displacement minimization of structures composed of two and three materials. The results highlight the design performance changes attributed to the presence of the continuously graded material interface properties.", "paper_title": "Material interface effects on the topology optimizationof multi-phase structures using a level set method", "paper_id": "WOS:000342208100007"}
