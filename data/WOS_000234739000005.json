It can support bilateral/multilateral multimedia transmission for high volume audio, video, image and text data. The multimedia communication FOM/SOM is designed and a multimedia communication prototype system is constructed. Experiments show that the scheme can meet the requirements for real-time transmission and high communication efficiency. Multimedia communication has already been applied in an HLA-compliant complex distributed simulation system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
