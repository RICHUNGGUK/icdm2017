Many theories or languages such as probability theory, fuzzy set theory, possibility theory or the theory of evidence, handle these imperfections using different representation formalisms and processing modes. A review of main theories is presented emphasizing their conditions of use, some useful properties and relationships between these theories. These relationships are exploited to build an approach with high-level guidelines to assist the choice of information imperfection representation language in a decision aiding process.", "paper_title": "A Synthesis of Information Imperfection Representations for Decision Aid", "paper_id": "WOS:000371048800002"}
