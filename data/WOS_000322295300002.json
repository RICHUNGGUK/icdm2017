A coloring K is a function A* -> N satisfying for all(alpha is an element of A omega) lim inf K(alpha(sic)(n)) < infinity. n -> infinity Every coloring defines a subset of A(omega) by the standard parity condition [K] = {alpha is an element of A(omega): lim inf K(alpha(sic)(n)) equivalent to 0 mod 2 }. n -> infinity We show that sets defined by colorings are exactly all Delta(0)(3) sets in the standard product topology on A(omega). Furthermore, when considering natural subfamilies of all colorings, we obtain families BC(Sigma(0)(2)), Delta(0)(2), and BC(Sigma(0)(1)). Therefore, colorings can be seen as a characterisation of all these classes with a uniform acceptance condition. Additionally, we analyse a similar definition of colorings where the lim sup condition is used instead of lim inf. it turns out that such colorings have smaller expressive power - they cannot define all A(3)(0) sets.
