This letter follows those studies and develops a recursive finite Newton algorithm (IHLF-SVR-RFN) for training nonlinear support vector regression. The insensitive Huber loss function and the computation of the Newton step are discussed in detail. Comparisons with LIBSVM 2.82 show that the proposed algorithm gives promising results.", "paper_title": "Recursive finite Newton algorithm for support vector regression in the primal", "paper_id": "WOS:000245244200010"}
