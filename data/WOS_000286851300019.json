In a domain where new concepts and techniques are constantly being introduced, it is of interest to analyze recent trends in this literature. Although some attempts have been made in the past to review this stream of research, there has been no attempt to assess the contributions to this literature by individuals and institutions. This study assesses the contributions of individual researchers and institutions from 2004 to 2008, based on their publications in SCI- or SSCI-indexed journals. The findings of this study offer researchers a unique view of this field and some directions for future research. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.
