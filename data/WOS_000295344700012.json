The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by solving the one-dimensional shock wave structure problem and the two-dimensional low Mach number driven cavity flow. Computational results show that it is possible to cut down the computing time of the sequential codes of two order of magnitude. The algorithm can be easily extended to more general collision models.
