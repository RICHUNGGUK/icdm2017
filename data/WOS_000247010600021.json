This type of expansion guarantees that the values of the risk neutral density will be always positive and it can account for strong deviations of the stock price distributions from the Gaussian. In a set of numerical and empirical applications, the paper shows the accuracy and versatility of the method for recovering the true risk neutral density. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
