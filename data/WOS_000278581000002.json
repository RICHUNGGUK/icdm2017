While previous studies found that campaign web sites did not realise two-way communication ideals, the current study aims to investigate potential differences in communication patterns between campaign blogs and web sites during Taiwan's 2008 general election, with the aim of exploring whether the blogging phenomenon can improve the process of online political communication. Design/methodology/approach - The study used a content analysis approach, the web style analysis method, which was designed specifically for analysing web content, and applied it to an online campaign context in a different political culture, using Taiwan's general election as a case study. Findings - Results indicated that the themes of both campaign blogs and web sites focused on \"attacking opponents\" rather than focusing on political policies or information on particular issues. However, campaign blogs and web sites significantly differed in all other dimensions, including structural features, functions, interactivity and appeal strategies. Overall, in terms of the online democratic ideal, campaign blogs appeared to allow more democratic, broader, deeper and easier two-way communication models between candidates and voters or among voters. Research limitations/implications - The current study focused on candidates' blogs and web sites and did not explore the other vast parts of the online political sphere, particularly independent or citizen-based blogs, which play significant roles in the decentralised and participant-networked public spheres. Originality/value - The study illuminates the role of hyperlinks on campaign blogs. By providing a greater abundance of external links than campaign web sites, campaign blogs allowed more voters, especially younger ones, to share political information in a manner that is quite different from the traditional one-way communication model. The paper also argues that interactivity measures should be incorporated into the web style analysis method.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of campaign blogs and web sites The case of Taiwan's 2008 general election", "paper_id": "WOS:000278581000002"}
