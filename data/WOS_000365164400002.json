The proposed solution incorporates the mechanisms of active learning strategy to eliminate redundant instances and more properly estimate misclassification costs for each of the base SVMs in the committee. To evaluate our approach, we make comprehensive experimental studies on the set of benchmark datasets with various types of imbalance ratio. In addition, we present application of our method to the real-life decision problem related to the short-term loans repayment prediction.", "paper_title": "Boosted SVM with active learning strategy for imbalanced data", "paper_id": "WOS:000365164400002"}
