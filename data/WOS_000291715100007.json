In order to meet the requirement of safety, an advanced safety communication protocol is proposed to improve the protocol in EURORADIO. Among the improved protocol, the following two elements are added: (1) advanced scheme of establishment of safety connection. (2) double serial number replaces time stamp. The performance analysis related to safety of the advanced protocol and protocol in EURORADIO is given by Colored Petri Net (CPN) model through simulation. The analysis results verify that the advanced protocol has superior performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
