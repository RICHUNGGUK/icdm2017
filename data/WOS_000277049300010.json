The technique can efficiently trade off image quality and computation energy. Based on sensitivity differences of 64 DCT coefficients, separate operand bit-widths are used for different frequency components to reduce computation energy. To select the appropriate operand bit-widths that achieve significant reduction of power consumption with minimum image quality degradation, we also propose a bit-width selection algorithm. The proposed variable bit precision DCT algorithm can be efficiently implemented using carry save adder trees. The reconfigurable DCT architecture can achieve power savings ranging from 36% to 75% compared to normal operation at the expense of minor image quality degradation.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Bit-Width Adaptation in DCT: An Approach to Trade Off Image Quality and Computation Energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000277049300010"}
