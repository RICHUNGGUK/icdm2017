This bank is also used to research an origin to DNA fragments from metagenomics studies. Results: Different services are provided like the possibility of inferring a phylogenetic tree with sequence signatures or comparing two genomes and displaying the rearrangements that happened since their separation.", "paper_title": "GOHTAM: a website for 'Genomic Origin of Horizontal Transfers, Alignment and Metagenomics'", "paper_id": "WOS:000303338200011"}
