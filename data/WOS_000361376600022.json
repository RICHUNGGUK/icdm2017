In this paper, we propose an authentication method based on zero-knowledge proof and the mind of key escrow. With the method, authentication will not only satisfy the requirement anonymity and security but also can recover the real identity information in special circumstances with the cooperation of multiple parties. We will show that this proposed method is more suitable for promotion through analysis and comparison with an existing scheme.", "paper_title": "A Cross-domain Authentication Method for Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000361376600022"}
