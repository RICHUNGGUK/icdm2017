The method is based on discrete convolution by using convolution masks and point anchoring in the pixel. The use of ordinary convolution distorts the curve shape and gives large errors in length calculation. The advantage of anchoring is that it limits the point shifting into the pixel during the calculation of the curve length. The method is applied to an analytical arc and various calculations are performed. In addition different methods from the literature were compared and a real sample was tested. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
