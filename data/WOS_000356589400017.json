It may be desirable for such users to select a \"longcut route\" from their current location to his/her destination that has longer travel time than the shortest route, but provides a better mobile wireless environment. In this paper, we formulate the above situation as the optimization problem of \"optimal longcut route selection\", which requires us to find the best route concerning the wireless environment subject to a travel time constraint. For this new problem, we show NP-hardness, propose two pseudo-polynomial time algorithms, and experimental evaluation of the algorithms.", "paper_title": "Pseudo Polynomial Time Algorithms for Optimal Longcut Route Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589400017"}
