However, current web filtering techniques can not retrieve filtering results which accurately represent the user interest. This paper investigates different web filtering tasks and corresponding user's interest, and proposes the notion of user's interest focusing degree(UIFD) to measure the user's interest. We put forward the definition of UIFD based on the distribution of positives and negatives in the training set and import this parameter into current machine learning approaches. Based on UIFD, Biased Support Vector Machine(BSVM) is proposed as an example to illustrate the effect of UIFD. Experiments show that BSVM has a better filtering performance than SVM and UIFD can help web filers understand the user interest more accurately.", "paper_title": "Novel approach for web filtering based on user interest focusing degree", "paper_id": "WOS:000256710400007"}
