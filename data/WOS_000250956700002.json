Several such specialized grid environments are now available for users in the commercial and research sectors. One such effort for research is the TeraGrid, consisting of a collection of geographically distributed heterogeneous supercomputer resources including data storage resources. Parallel implementations for these environments are inherently multilevel and obtaining efficient mapping of work to processors can be extremely challenging. This paper extends an existing MPI application to the grid via the use of grid-enabled MPI libraries. The application uses a simulation-optimization framework involving coarse-grained parallelism in the optimizer and fine-grained parallelism in the finite-element-based simulator. Using parallelism at both these levels is essential for problems involving computationally intensive simulation steps. A hierarchical grid architecture consisting of a collection of supercomputers is ideally suited for these types of problems as a good application-to-architecture mapping can be obtained with a proper implementation. This paper presents the performance results of our implementation on the TeraGrid network consisting of three geographically distributed supercomputers.", "paper_title": "GRID-enabled solution of groundwater inverse problems on the TeraGrid network", "paper_id": "WOS:000250956700002"}
