In particular, accurate mobility models are essential for the evaluation of the system design alternatives and network implementation cost issues. In this paper, we propose a mobility model that is appropriate for practical analysis of the mobile systems' design issues. Our model provides different levels of details for the user mobility behavior and can be adapted to any environmental topology. This model considers direction and velocity of the user mobility. The motion direction is modeled based on real street patterns and is described by discrete state Gauss-Markov technique whose parameters are calculated by combining the information derived by the topological map and wireless network performance report (WNPR) of the simulation area. In the proposed method, the user velocity is assumed to be the average velocity that is found based on traffic condition and type of the street. The computational complexity of our model is to the extent that can be used not only in mobility management test procedures but also in order to calculate some useful parameters of these procedures. In this paper, we apply real data to validate the proposed model by simulation which is used to confirm the accuracy of the proposed model and its analytical analysis.
