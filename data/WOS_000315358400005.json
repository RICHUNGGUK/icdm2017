This paper is an attempt to design a hybridized Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm with fuzzy logic called Fuzzy Preference-Based Multi-Objective Optimization Method (FPMOM). FPMOM as an integrated components of Multiobjective Optimization Technique, Evolutionary Algorithm and Fuzzy Inference System able to search and filter the pareto-optimal and provide a good trade-off solution for the multiobjective problem using fuzzy inference method to choose the user intuitive based specific trade-off requirement. This paper will provide a new insight into the behaviourism of interactive Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm optimization problems using fuzzy inference method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy preference-based multi-objective optimization method", "paper_id": "WOS:000315358400005"}
