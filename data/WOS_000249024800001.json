However, since the slave teleoperator is in contact with a rigid environment, the slave controller requires a free of chattering control strategy, thus making first order sliding mode telleoperation control unsuitable. As an alternative, chatter free, higher-order sliding mode teleoperator control is proposed in this paper to guarantee robust tracking under unknown constant time delay. Moreover, complete order observers are proposed to avoid measurement of velocity and acceleration, along with a formal closed-loop stability proof of the observer-based controller. Experimental results are presented and discussed, which reveals the effectiveness of the proposed teleoperation scheme. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
