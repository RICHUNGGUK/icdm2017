Gender classification is one such application of classification which has gained a great deal of attention recently. However, the techniques presented so far in literature dealing with gender classification present a significant room for improvement. The paper presents an efficient feature based gender classification technique. In this technique, a face detection mechanism has been used, which excludes unwanted area from the image. This significantly reduces image size, thus enabling to classify more efficiently. Classifier ensemble has been proven to be an effective technique which considerably enhances the performance of classifiers. The proposed technique uses Genetic algorithm based optimized ensemble classification which provides a more accurate classification as compare to the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of various quantitative measures. The proposed method is tested on the standard facial images database and results have been compiled. The experimental results on this database have been compared with results achieved by using existing methods. The comparison indicates that the proposed technique gives superior performance to the other competitive methods based on well known quantitative measures.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT GENDER CLASSIFICATION USING OPTIMIZATION OF HYBRID CLASSIFIERS USING GENETIC ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500029"}
