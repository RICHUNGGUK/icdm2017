In this paper, the forestry industry is studied. Based on the establishing of the connection between forest ecology and the forestry industry, an analysis for this relationship in terms of a systems perspective is done by using quantitative methods. Furthermore, the model of forestry industry economic evaluation is established based on the construction of the evaluation index system of forestry industry economic benefits, which is performed by data envelopment analysis (DEA). Finally, we analyze more than a dozen instances in Yichun Forest. Through this case-study analysis, the extent of coupling between systems of forest ecology and forestry industry is examined, and the economic benefit of the forestry industry is evaluated.
