Assuming that the system has reached a steady-state condition in a symmetric channel, we select arbitrarily one representative user, called tagged user, and analyze its behavior in the presence of interference from other contending users. The packet service time distribution of this user is found using a state flow graph. This information is then used for the queueing analysis of the tagged user and thus different performance measures, like throughput and packet transmission delay are easily obtained. This approach decouples the channel contention from queueing behavior and greatly simplifies the problem. As shown in the paper, the approach is also transparent to channel model and spatial distribution of users. The analytical results are also verified by comparing with simulation values using a number of examples.
