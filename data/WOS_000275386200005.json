Constructing a spanning tree on the given network, assigning directions to the network channels, creating deadlock-free zones, and specifying a logical sequence of the produced deadlock-free zones are the four fundamental steps that the proposed methodology takes to generate deadlock-free and connected routing algorithms. By applying the proposed methodology with two known labeling methods we have generated six irregular routing algorithms: three of them are novel routing algorithms and three of them (the Up/Down, Left/Right, and L-turn routing algorithms) have already been proposed in the literature. Extensive simulation experiments have been performed considering various network topologies, different network sizes (considering different network nodes and network channels), various message lengths, a variety of spanning tree roots, and a wide range of message (traffic) generation rates. Simulation results show that the six routing algorithms can be divided into three pairs. Routing members of each pair show similar behavior in terms of message latencies and saturation generation rates. However, it is worth noting that for a given topology the performance of the six routing algorithms may be totally different and it mainly depends on the network topology.
