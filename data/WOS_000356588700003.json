The density of a path is the sum of the weights of the edges in the path divided by the number of edges in the path. We present an O(n) time algorithm for the problem. The previously known algorithms run in O(nL) or O(n log n) time.", "paper_title": "Algorithm for the Length-Constrained Maximum-Density Path Problem in a Tree with Uniform Edge Lengths", "paper_id": "WOS:000356588700003"}
