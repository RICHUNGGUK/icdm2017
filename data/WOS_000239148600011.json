Both camera actions and image processing methods are represented as concepts of a semantic network. Image processing methods comprise depth computation to find a table, generation of object hypotheses in an over-view image, and object verification in a close-up view. Camera actions are pan, tilt, zoom, and motion on a linear sledge. System actions, either image processing or camera actions, are initialized by a graph search based control algorithm which tries to compute the best scoring instance of a goal concept. The sequence of actions for computing an instance is determined by precedences which are either adjusted manually or computed from reinforcement-learning. Results are presented comparing the two approaches.", "paper_title": "Learning an analysis strategy for knowledge-based exploration of scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239148600011"}
