Each of grid task agent's diverse requirements is modeled as a quality of service (QoS) dimension, associated with each QoS dimension is a utility function that defines the benefit that is perceived by a user with respect to QoS choices in that dimension. The objective of multiple QoS based grid resource scheduling is to maximize the global utility of the scheduling system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
