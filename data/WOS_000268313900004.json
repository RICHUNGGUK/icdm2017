Novel display technologies strongly influence and inspire new forms of computer use and interaction. We are particularly interested in the interplay of novel displays and interaction for ubiquitous computing or ambient media environments, as emerging display technologies may become game-changers in how we define and use computers, possibly changing the context of computing fundamentally. We present some of our experiments and lessons learnt with a new category of displays, the \"immaterial\" FogScreen. It can be described as a novel media platform, exhibiting some fundamental differences to and advantages over other displays. It also enables novel kinds of user interfaces and experiences. In this paper we give insights about the special properties and strengths of the FogScreen by looking at a set of successfully demonstrated interfaces and applications. We also discuss its future potential for user interface design.", "paper_title": "Mid-air display experiments to create novel user interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000268313900004"}
