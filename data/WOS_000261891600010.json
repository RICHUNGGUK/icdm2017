On the other hand, we show via a simple reduction from a result of H astad and Venkatesh [ Random Structures Algorithms, 25 ( 2004), pp. 117 - 149] that under the assumption NP not subset of. DTIME(n((log n)O(1))), for every is an element of > 0 there is no algorithm that approximates max(x is an element of{-1,1})(n) Sigma(n)(i, j, k=1) a(ijk)x(i)x(j)x(k) within a factor of 2(log n)(1-is an element of) in time 2(log n)(O(1)). Our algorithm is based on a reduction to the problem of computing the diameter of a convex body in R-n with respect to the L-1 norm. We show that it is possible to do so up to a multiplicative error of O(root n/log n), while no randomized polynomial time algorithm can achieve accuracy o(root n/log n). This resolves a question posed by Brieden et al. in [Mathematika, 48 (2001), pp. 63 - 105]. We apply our new algorithm to improve the algorithm of H astad and Venkatesh for the Max-E3-Lin-2 problem. Given an overdetermined system epsilon of N linear equations modulo 2 in n <= N Boolean variables such that in each equation only three distinct variables appear, the goal is to approximate in polynomial time the maximum number of satisfiable equations in epsilon minus N/2 (i.e., we subtract the expected number of satisfied equations in a random assignment). H astad and Venkatesh obtained an algorithm which approximates this value up to a factor of O(root N). We obtain an O(root n/log n) approximation algorithm. By relating this problem to the refutation problem for random 3 - CNF formulas, we give evidence that obtaining a significant improvement over this approximation factor is likely to be difficult.", "paper_title": "LINEAR EQUATIONS MODULO 2 AND THE L-1 DIAMETER OF CONVEX BODIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000261891600010"}
