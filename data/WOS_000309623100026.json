Specifically, the paper describes four energy aware network design problems, with the related mathematical models, for reducing the power consumption of the current and future Internet. Each problem is based on a different characterization and power awareness of the network devices, leading to either Mixed Integer Linear Programming or Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming models. We have assessed the effectiveness of the proposed approaches under different real core network topology scenarios by evaluating the impact of several network parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that deeply investigates the behavior of a pool of diverse Network Power Management approaches, including the first Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming model for the Power Aware Network Design with Bundled Links.
