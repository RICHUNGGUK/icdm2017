We introduce a new metric, named the 3D Normalized Probabilistic Rand Index (3D-NPRI), which outperforms the others in terms of properties and discriminative power. This comparative study includes a subjective experiment with human observers and is based on a corpus of manually segmented models. This corpus is an improved version of our previous one (Benhabiles et al. in IEEE International Conference on Shape Modeling and Application (SMI), 2009). It is composed of a set of 3D-mesh models grouped in different classes associated with several manual ground-truth segmentations. Finally the 3D-NPRI is applied to evaluate six recent segmentation algorithms using our corpus and the Chen et al.'s (ACM Trans. Graph. (SIGGRAPH), 28(3), 2009) corpus.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of existing metrics for 3D-mesh segmentation evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000284112400003"}
