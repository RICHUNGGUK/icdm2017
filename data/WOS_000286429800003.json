The proposed ADC contains a new high-accuracy and power-encient switched-current S/H circuit and a speed-improved current comparator. Designed and simulated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process, this 8-bit ADC achieves 46.23 dB SNDR at 1.23 MS/s consuming 73: 19 mu W under 1.2 V voltage supply, resulting in an ENOB of 7.38-bit and an FOM of 0.357 pJ/Conv.-step.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL SWITCHED-CURRENT SUCCESSIVE APPROXIMATION ADC", "paper_id": "WOS:000286429800003"}
