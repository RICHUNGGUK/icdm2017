This paper introduces the research work about augmented video services (AVS) of CGAG (ChinaGrid Access Grid) based on the AG framework. It shows up a reasonable way on providing augmented video services in an advanced Access Grid environment, and also a new approach to share grid resources in Grid applications. At the end of this paper, a typical sample is given to demonstrate the capabilities of this AVS, and the result proves that it yields superior quality compared to the traditional webpage of grid portal and usual interaction modals of AG.", "paper_title": "Augmented video services and its applications in an advanced access grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600105"}
