The cities and the languages are treated differently (and as connected; for example, the languages split in terms of splitting the cities, etc.) and thus two distributions are obtained in the same computation at the same time. Evolutions of lifetimes and families for the cities and the languages are also studied. We suggest that the regularities may be evolving out of randomness, in terms of the relevant processes.", "paper_title": "Physics of randomness and regularities for cities, languages, and their lifetimes and family trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000251712000011"}
