Our objective is to provide a set of computational tools capable of finding landforms contained in the datasets that match human-friendly descriptions such as \"In this model there is a mountain having a maximum altitude of 302 m, located between coordinates (19.09383 degrees N, 99.85541 degrees W) and (19.09393 degrees N, 99.85554 degrees W)\". The proposed methodology is composed of three main stages: in the first stage (conceptualization), the knowledge domain is represented by means of ontologies. In the second stage (synthesis) a novel semantic decomposition algorithm is used to identify and extract relevant spatial objects from the spatial dataset. In the last stage (description), the geographic objects extracted in the second stage are mapped to concepts (objects of the knowledge domain) generated in the first stage. The final result is a set of metadata that describes the geomorphologic objects contained in the raster dataset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
