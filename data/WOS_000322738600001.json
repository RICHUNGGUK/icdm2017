Furthermore, a multi-standard turbo decoder chip is fabricated in a core area of 3.38 mm(2) by 90 nm CMOS process. This chip is maximally measured at 152 MHz with 186.1 Mbps for LTE-A standard and 179.3 Mbps for WiMAX-2 standard.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable Parallel Turbo Decoder Design for Multiple High-Mobility 4G Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000322738600001"}
