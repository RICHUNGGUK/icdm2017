We first develop theoretical lower bounds on the number of necessary transmission packets over error-free broadcast channels for repair. Then we discuss the impact of the distribution of the lost packets among caching nodes. Finally, we study the construction of repair codes and propose the optimal exact repair for some special scenarios.", "paper_title": "Partial Repair for Wireless Caching Networks With Broadcast Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000373740000009"}
