Although in principle this task may seem straightforward, the details, especially corpus preparation and final text presentation, involve many difficult aspects that are often glossed over in the literature. On top of the classic Statistical Machine Translation evaluation metric results, four manual evaluations have been performed to assess and improve translation quality. We also show the usefulness of the integration of out-of-domain information sources in a Statistical Machine Translation system to produce high quality translated text.", "paper_title": "Designing a machine translation system for Canadian weather warnings: A case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000337686800004"}
