The problem of efficiently monitoring the network flow can be regarded as finding the minimum weight weak vertex cover for a given graph. In this paper, we present a (2 - 2/v(G))-approximation algorithm solving for this problem, which improves previous results, where v(G) is the cyclomatic number of G. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
