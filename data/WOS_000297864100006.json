The FFTT family includes eight types of cosine transforms and eight types of sine transforms, which are developed from concepts related to the finite field trigonometry. New lemmas are presented and some properties of the FFTT are discussed.", "paper_title": "Finite field trigonometric transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000297864100006"}
