The work presented in this paper concerns the implementation of a two step optimization strategy which consists in optimizing first an empirical model (metamodel), then the full model. In the framework of multilevel model optimization, the computation costs are related, on the one hand, to the construction of global approximations and, on the other hand, to the optimization of the full model. Thus, many numerical simulations are required in order to perform a multilevel optimization. In this context, the objective of associating a multiparametric strategy based on the nonincremental LATIN method with the two step optimization process is to reduce these computation costs. The performance gains thus achieved will be illustrated through the optimization of structural assemblies involving contact with friction. The results obtained will show that the savings associated with the multiparametric procedure can reach a factor of 30.", "paper_title": "A multiparametric strategy for the two step optimization of structural assemblies", "paper_id": "WOS:000316638300005"}
