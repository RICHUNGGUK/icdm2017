Their high damping factor makes many existing algorithms less efficient, while MIRAM could be promising. Also, we apply this method in an epidemic application. We describe in this paper a stochastic model based on PageRank to simulate the epidemic spread, where a PageRank-like infection vector is calculated by MIRAM to help establish efficient vaccination strategy. MIRAM is implemented within the framework of Trilinos, targeting big data and sparse matrices representing scale-free networks, also known as power law networks. Hypergraph partitioning approach is employed to minimize the communication overhead. The algorithm is tested on a nation wide cluster of clusters Grid5000. Experiments on very large networks such as twitter and yahoo with over 1 billion nodes are conducted. With our parallel implementation, a speedup of is met compared to the sequential solver.", "paper_title": "PageRank Computation Using a Multiple Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method for Modeling Epidemic Spread", "paper_id": "WOS:000361837300005"}
