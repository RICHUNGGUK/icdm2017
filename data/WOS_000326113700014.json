When operating in a regime of high corrector gain, such converters can display a variety of new dynamic phenomena associated with the appearance of additional oscillatorymodes. Starting in a state where four pairs of stable and unstable period-6 cycles coexist with the basic period-1 cycle, the paper describes a sequence of smooth and non-smooth bifurcations through which the cycles and their basins of attraction transform as the output voltage is increased. The paper also describes the birth of a multilayered resonance torus through a transverse pitchfork bifurcation of the saddle cycle on an ordinary resonance torus.", "paper_title": "Multistability and Torus Reconstruction in a DC-DC Converter With Multilevel Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700014"}
