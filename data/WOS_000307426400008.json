Cognitive radio technology can provide enough channels for the multi-channel MAC protocol in distributed networks by adding the sense process. The focus of this problem is therefore how to make full use of the available licensed channels while taking a limited negotiation phase. Many clustering methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but the transmitting node pair impact on network performance was not considered. This paper proposes a clustering negotiation policy. All available licensed channels are scattered uniformly into each cluster, with one of them selected as the common control channel. At the same time the unconnected transmitting node pairs also are picked up for allocation into each cluster during the report phase. The unconnected clustering negotiation policy improves frequency efficiency by avoiding interaction between clusters and reducing invalid negotiation. The probability statistics method is used to characterize the unconnected clustering negotiation algorithm performance. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results verify that our policy can make full use of spectrum efficiency to obtain better throughput under sufficient number of licensed channels and saturated network conditions.", "paper_title": "An Unconnected Clustering Negotiation Policy for a Distribution Cognitive Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000307426400008"}
