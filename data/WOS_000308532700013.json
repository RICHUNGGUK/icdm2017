In the proposed method, the distribution information of samples is first characterized using fuzzy set theory, and the corresponding fuzzy scatter matrices are then redefined. Image discriminant features which have embedded the fuzzy information are finally extracted by selecting 2D principal components and 2D inverse Fisher discriminant vectors. Experimental results on FERET face database and FKP database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Feature extraction using 2DIFDA with fuzzy membership", "paper_id": "WOS:000308532700013"}
