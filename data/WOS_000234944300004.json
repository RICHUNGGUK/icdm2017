Threshold is the Peak Absolute Error (PAE) allowed in the reconstructed image. It has been shown that lossless edges with near-lossless/ lossless filled area give a high fidelity images. Results are compared with Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Tree (SPIHT) [A. Said, W.A. Pearlman, A new, fast, and efficient image codec based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees, IEEE Trans. Circ. Syst. Video Technol. 12 (1996) 243-250] method. Experimented results show that the proposed method provides high fidelity images, and it has been shown that these images are visually better than images reconstructed using SPIHT algorithm for the same compression ratio. The execution time of the algorithm is almost half compared to that of the SPIHT algorithm which requires wavelet transform of an image. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.
