The temporal structure of the system model is addressed by using periodic timeslots in order to make more efficient use of the spectrum. In our proposed temporal structure, a bandwidth broker in such centralized CR networks (CCRNs) is selected as a central counterpart to synchronize with secondary users (SUs) and assign spectral resources to them. We develop an analytical model for SUs for the Call Admission Control (CAC) of voice traffic using the quality of service (QoS) requirements of delay bound and delay bound violation probability. Ours is an approach that provides reliable data transmission and reduces packet delay and packet delay jitter. In addition to the aforementioned packet-level performance metrics, we calculated a call-level performance metric, that is, the number of acceptable SUs, satisfying QoS requirements.", "paper_title": "MAC Protocol for Quality-Aware Real-Time Voice Delivery in Cognitive Radio-Enabled WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000363158100001"}
