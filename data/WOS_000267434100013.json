Information retrieval techniques such as Topic Detection and Tracking are able to organize news stories as events, in a flat hierarchical structure, within a topic. However, they are incapable of presenting the complex evolution relationships between the events. We are interested to learn not only what the major events are but also how they develop within the topic. It is beneficial to identify the seminal events, the intermediary and ending events, and the evolution of these events. In this paper, we propose to utilize the event timestamp, event content similarity, temporal proximity, and document distributional proximity to model the event evolution relationships between events in an incident. An event evolution graph is constructed to present the underlying structure of events for efficient browsing and extracting of information. Case study and experiments are presented to illustrate and show the performance of our proposed technique. It is found that our proposed technique outperforms the baseline technique and other comparable techniques in previous work.", "paper_title": "Discovering Event Evolution Graphs From News Corpora", "paper_id": "WOS:000267434100013"}
