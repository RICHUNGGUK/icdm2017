Simulation employs fine grid-search over both STR parameters to find accurate staring values, as well as constrained optimization. In addition, two new parsimonious models are introduced. Finally, an application of the test to the log of Real per capita GNP of USA is provided. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
