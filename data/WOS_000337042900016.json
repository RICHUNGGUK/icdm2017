Since nodes may fail due to an accidental damage or energy depletion, it is desirable that the virtual backbone is fault tolerant. A node set is an m-fold connected dominating set (m-fold CDS) of graph if every node in has at least neighbors in and the subgraph of induced by is connected. In this paper, we will present a greedy algorithm to compute an -fold CDS in a general graph, which has size at most 2 + ln (Delta + m - 2) times that of a minimum m-fold CDS, where Delta is the maximum degree of the graph. This result improves on the previous best known performance ratio of 2H (Delta + m - 1) for this problem, where H (.) is the Harmonic number.", "paper_title": "A greedy algorithm for the fault-tolerant connected dominating set in a general graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000337042900016"}
