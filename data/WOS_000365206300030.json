As mobile platforms increasingly demand power, more and more mobile platforms adopt multibattery- or multicell-based power systems to extend battery runtime. This paper addresses energy management for the purpose of extending the lifetime of battery-powered reconfigurable computing platforms. Considering the nonlinear characteristics of batteries and working mechanism of the CGRA, a multiobjective optimization model with respect to the battery state and energy consumption is built for extending battery lifetime. Meanwhile, based on this optimization model, a joint task-mapping and battery-scheduling method is proposed to achieve a practical and efficient solution. The physical experiments show that this paper achieves higher improvement on battery runtime when compared with state-of-the-art works.", "paper_title": "Energy Management on Battery-Powered Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300030"}
