As a practical example of the method presented here, the well-known Bell states are modeled as conditional combination of two q-bits. Analogous approach can be applied in modeling conditional combinations of two and more quantum system sequences.", "paper_title": "CONDITIONAL COMBINATIONS OF QUANTUM SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288643100006"}
