In this article, a Hypo-Steiner light-tree algorithm (HSLT) is proposed to construct a HSLT light-tree to include as many destinations as possible. The upper bound cost of the light-trees built by HSLT is given as N(N - 1)/2, where N is the number of nodes in the network. The analytical model proves that, under the same condition, more destinations could be held in a HSLT than a Member-Only (Zhang et al., J. Lightware Technol, 18(12), 1917-1927 2000.) light-tree. Extensive simulations not only validate the proof but also show that the proposed heuristic outperforms the existing multicast routing algorithms by a large margin in terms of link stress, throughput, and efficiency of wavelength usage.", "paper_title": "Hypo-Steiner heuristic for multicast routing in all-optical WDM mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279840000005"}
