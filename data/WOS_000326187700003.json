Starting from the design of transport protocols for streaming video, research interests have later shifted to the peer-to-peer paradigm of designing streaming protocols at the application layer. More recent research has focused on building more practical and scalable systems, using Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP. In this article, we provide a retrospective view of the research results over the past two decades, with a focus on peer-to-peer streaming protocols and the effects of cloud computing and social media.", "paper_title": "Two Decades of Internet Video Streaming: A Retrospective View", "paper_id": "WOS:000326187700003"}
