Notable examples are the MIS and -coloring algorithms by Barenboim and Elkin (Distrib Comput 22(5-6):363-379, 2010), by Kuhn (2009), and by Panconesi and Srinivasan (J Algorithms 20(2):356-374, 1996), as well as the -coloring algorithm by Linial (J Comput 21:193, 1992). Unfortunately, most known local algorithms (including, in particular, the aforementioned algorithms) are non-uniform, that is, local algorithms generally use good estimations of one or more global parameters of the network, e.g., the maximum degree or the number of nodes . This paper provides a method for transforming a non-uniform local algorithm into a uniform one. Furthermore, the resulting algorithm enjoys the same asymptotic running time as the original non-uniform algorithm. Our method applies to a wide family of both deterministic and randomized algorithms. Specifically, it applies to almost all state of the art non-uniform algorithms for MIS and Maximal Matching, as well as to many results concerning the coloring problem (In particular, it applies to all aforementioned algorithms). To obtain our transformations we introduce a new distributed tool called pruning algorithms, which we believe may be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "Toward more localized local algorithms: removing assumptions concerning global knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000325816000003"}
