Lin, M. Hwang, C. Chang, Security enhancement for anonymous secure e-voting over a network, Comput. Stand. Interfaces 25 (2) (2003) 131-139.]. We found that Lin-Hwang-Chang's scheme and a recent modification of it by Hwang-Wen-Hwang [S. Hwang, H. Wen, T. Hwang, On the security enhancement for anonymous secure e-voting over computer network, Comput. Stand. Interfaces 27 (2) (2005) 163-168.] have an important weakness. Moreover, the scheme proposed by Yang-Lin-Yang [C. Yang, C. Lin, H. Yang, Improved anonymous secure e-voting over a network, Information and Security 15 (2) (2004) 185-191.] also suffers from this same problem. We describe in detail our findings and propose a new scheme to overcome the weakness we found in these schemes effectively. Finally, we describe the implementation details of our protocol and present its preliminary performance evaluation. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
