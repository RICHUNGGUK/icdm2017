A particular example, the practically tested medical expert system Disco, is investigated from this point of view. The system is described in the fuzzy relation-based framework and compared with CADIAG-II-like systems that are a \"pattern\" for computer-assisted diagnosis systems based on a fuzzy technology. Similarities and discrepancies in - representation of knowledge, patient's information, inference mechanism and interpretation of results (diagnoses) - of the systems are established. This work can be considered as another step towards a general framework for computer-assisted medical diagnosis.", "paper_title": "A theoretical comparison of disco and CADIAG-II-like systems for medical diagnoses", "paper_id": "WOS:000244953000007"}
