In particular, there has been substantial recent interest in 2-stage stochastic combinatorial optimization problems. Two objectives have been considered in recent work: one sought to minimize the expected cost, and the other sought to minimize the worst-case cost. These two objectives represent two extremes in handling risk-the first trusts the average, and the second is obsessed with the worst case. In this paper, we interpolate between these two extremes by introducing an one-parameter family of functionals. These functionals arise naturally from a change of the underlying probability measure and incorporate an intuitive notion of risk. Although such a family has been used in the mathematical finance [11] and stochastic programming [13] literature before, its use in the context of approximation algorithms seems new. We show that under standard assumptions, our risk-adjusted objective can be efficiently treated by the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method [9]. In particular, our result generalizes a recent sampling theorem by Charikar et al. [2], and it shows that it is possible to incorporate some degree of robustness even when the underlying probability distribution can only be accessed in a black-box fashion. We also show that when combined with known techniques (e.g. [4,14]), our result yields new approximation algorithms for many 2-stage stochastic combinatorial optimization problems under the risk-adjusted setting.", "paper_title": "Stochastic combinatorial optimization with controllable risk aversion level - (Extended abstract)", "paper_id": "WOS:000240348600020"}
