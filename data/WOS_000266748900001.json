These models yield formally identical descriptions of one-step spin crossover systems, however, they assign different meaning to formal parameters. The fundamental difference of between the analysed models reveals itself in the description of two-step spin crossover systems. The molecular statistical model explicitly takes into account molecular interactions and ordering whereas the Ising-like Hamiltonian model considers HS-LS transitions,of independent molecules occurring in interacting sublattices.", "paper_title": "Comparative analysis of the Ising-like Hamiltonian and molecular statistical models of spin crossover", "paper_id": "WOS:000266748900001"}
