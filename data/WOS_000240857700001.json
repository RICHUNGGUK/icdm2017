More specifically, we focus on privacy violations via data inferences that occur when domain knowledge is combined with non-private data. We propose a formal model, called Privacy Information Flow Model, to represent the information flow and the privacy requirements. These privacy requirements are enforced by the Privacy Mediator. Privacy Mediator guarantees that users are not be able to logically entail information that violates the privacy requirements. We present an inference algorithm that is sound and complete. The inference algorithm is developed for a tree-like, semistructured data model, selection-projection queries, and domain knowledge, represented as Horn-clause constraints. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
