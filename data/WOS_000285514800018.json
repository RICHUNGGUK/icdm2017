Recently, offline object detectors have shown a tremendous success. However, one major drawback of offline techniques is that a complete set of training data has to be collected beforehand. In addition, once learned, an offline detector cannot make use of newly arriving data. To alleviate these drawbacks, online learning has been adopted with the following objectives: 1) the technique should be computationally and storage efficient; 2) the updated classifier must maintain its high classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient framework for learning an adaptive online greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis model. Unlike many existing online boosting detectors, which usually apply exponential or logistic loss, our online algorithm makes use of linear discriminant analysis' learning criterion that not only aims to maximize the class-separation criterion but also incorporates the asymmetrical property of training data distributions. We provide a better alternative for online boosting algorithms in the context of training a visual object detector. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our methods on handwritten digit and face data sets. Our results confirm that object detection tasks benefit significantly when trained in an online manner.", "paper_title": "Incremental Training of a Detector Using Online Sparse Eigendecomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000285514800018"}
