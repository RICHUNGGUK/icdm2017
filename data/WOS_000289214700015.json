Nevertheless, usually, a multimedia is provided as an unicum, made by synchronized media items. Sound tracks, video sequences, captions, cannot be customized \"on-the-fly\" by users. Managing multimedia in a deep way would meet the expectations of nowadays Web prosumers (i.e. producers and consumers), and it would widen the audience. Describing and synchronizing each medium, as well as specifying different alternative contents for it, are the keystones of multimedia customization and of audience widening. This paper presents a multimedia collaborative system, which provides support to the arrangement of medium into a multi-views composed multimedia. Each prosumer can add medium by juxtaposition or by defining it as an alternative (audio, video, textual) version of an existing one. The implementation of such a system is based on SMIL 3.0 specification but implements a new and compact syntax to let users manipulate the original multimedia synchronization and their alternatives. The proposed approach has been put to test in two different scenarios.", "paper_title": "The Directors' cut: a solution to collaborative multimedia management", "paper_id": "WOS:000289214700015"}
