We consider the following objective functions: the makespan, the sum of the delta th (delta >= 0) power of job completion times, the total weighted completion time and the maximum lateness. We show that the makespan minimization problem, the sum of the delta th power of job completion times minimization problem can be solved by the smallest (normal) processing time first (SPT) rule, respectively. We also show that the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain conditions.
