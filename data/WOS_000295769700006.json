The new methods inherit the framework of two-step hybrid methods and are adapted to the special feature of the true flows in both the internal stages and the updates. Based on the EN-trees theory [H.L. Yang, X.Y. Wu, X. You, Y.L. Fang, Extended RKN-type methods for numerical integration of perturbed oscillators, Comput. Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 1777-1794], order conditions for the new methods are derived via the B(BT)-series defined on the set BT of branches and the B(BWT)-series defined on the subset BWT of BT. The stability and phase properties are analyzed. Numerical experiments show the applicability and efficiency of our new methods in comparison with the well-known high quality methods proposed in the scientific literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
