In addition, it gives ability to quantify the ambiguous nature of subjective judgments in an easy way. In this paper, by extending the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), it is proposed a useful method based on generalized interval valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (GITrFNs) for solving multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problems. In view of complexity in handling sophisticated data of GITrFNs, this paper employs the concept of signed distances to establish a simple and effective MCDA method based on the main structure of TOPSIS. An algorithm based on TOPSIS method is established to determine the priority order of given alternatives by using properties of signed distances. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated by a practical example of supplier selection.", "paper_title": "SIGNED DISTANCED-BASED TOPSIS METHOD FOR MULTIPLE CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS BASED ON GENERALIZED INTERVAL-VALUED FUZZY NUMBERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297479700008"}
