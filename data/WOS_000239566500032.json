The proposed technique combines low-level descriptors and defines suitable metrics. It aims at representing and measuring similarity between semantically meaningful objects within the defined multi-feature space. The approach finds the best linear combination of predefined visual descriptor metrics using a Multi-Objective Optimization technique. The obtained metric is then used to fuse multiple non-linear descriptors is be achieved and applied in image classification.", "paper_title": "A multi-feature optimization approach to object-based-image classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500032"}
