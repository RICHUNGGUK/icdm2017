The data from 428 subjects fit the model satisfactorily and support all of its suggested hypotheses. Cognitive style shows significant direct effects on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and subjective norms. Both perceived usefulness and subjective norms affect actual technology usage significantly. People with innovative cognitive styles are more likely to perceive a new technology as useful and easy to use than are those with adaptive cognitive styles. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
