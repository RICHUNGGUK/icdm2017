It is shown that the productivity of the Chinese research (in terms of numbers of publications) is growing rapidly; however, this growth has not, to date, been accompanied by an analogous growth in impact (in terms of citations to the published work). A citation analysis of national and international collaboration patterns shows that collaborative research does not invariably result in a larger number of citations; in part, at least, this is shown to be due to the dominant role played by the publications of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.", "paper_title": "Bibliometric Analysis of Chinese Research on Cyclization, MALDI-TOF, and Antibiotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000273794500002"}
