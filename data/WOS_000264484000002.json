In this paper, we prove the bound 2n/3 is optimal by showing that every plane triangulation G with n-vertices admits an st-orientation with the length of its longest directed paths bounded by 2n/3 + O(1). In addition, this st-orientation is constructible in linear time. A by-product of this result is that every plane graph G with n vertices admits a visibility representation with height <= 2n/3 + O(1), constructible in linear time, which is also optimal.", "paper_title": "Optimal st-orientations for plane triangulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000264484000002"}
