The EFOP method was a novel system identification method for Black-box models that combines time-domain estimation and frequency-domain estimation. It has improved anti-disturbance performance, and could precisely identify models with fewer sample numbers. The two-stage EFOP method based on the boot-strap technique was generally suitable for Black-box models, but it was an iterative method and takes too much computation work so that it did not work well online. A recursive algorithm was proposed for disturbed stochastic systems. Some simulation examples are included to demonstrate the validity of the new method.", "paper_title": "Recursive algorithm for the two-stage EFOP estimation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000252470500004"}
