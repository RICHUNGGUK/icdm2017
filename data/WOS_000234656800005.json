This heuristic generates optimal broadcast time for ring, tree and grid graphs when the originator is a corner vertex. In practice, the new heuristic outperforms the best known broadcast algorithms for three different network models. The time complexity of one round of the heuristic is O(vertical bar E vertical bar), where vertical bar E vertical bar stand for the number of edges of the network. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
