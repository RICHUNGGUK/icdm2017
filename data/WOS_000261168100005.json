With new bosonic operators, the interaction Hamiltonian between the fiber and the cavities can be diagonalized (Pellizzari's model(1)). In the strong coupling regime (cavity field-fiber), the interaction between atoms and the non-resonant normal modes can be eliminated, simplifying our system to that of one atom interacting with a single-mode cavity. For this interaction, we have analyzed the entanglement between distant atoms. We present two simple procedures to generate two atoms in a maximally entangled state, interacting (i) successively and (ii) simultaneously with the coupled cavities system.", "paper_title": "GENERATION OF AN EPR PAIR OF ATOMS IN COUPLED CAVITIES SYSTEM VIA AN OPTICAL FIBER", "paper_id": "WOS:000261168100005"}
