The goal is to find a connected subset of vertices with maximum total profit, whose total cost does not exceed a given budget. The best result known prior to this work guaranteed a (2, O(log n)) bicriteria approximation, that is, the solution's profit is at least a fraction of 1/O(logn) of an optimum solution respecting the budget, while its cost is at most twice the given budget. We improve these results and present a bicriteria tradeoff that, given any epsilon is an element of (0, 1], guarantees a (1 + epsilon, O(1/epsilon log n))-approximation.", "paper_title": "Bicriteria Approximation Tradeoff for the Node-Cost Budget Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000265882400005"}
