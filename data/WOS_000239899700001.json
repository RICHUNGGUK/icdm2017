To assist efforts in determining and exploring the functional properties of a protein, it is desirable to automatically identify regions that are prone to undergo conformational changes. It was recently shown that a probabilistic predictor of continuum secondary structure is more accurate than categorical predictors for structurally ambivalent sequence regions, suggesting that such models are suited to characterize protein flexibility. Results: We develop a computational method for identifying regions that are prone to conformational change directly from the amino acid sequence. The method uses the entropy of the probabilistic output of an 8-class continuum secondary structure predictor. Results for 171 unique amino acid sequences with well-characterized variable structure (identified in the 'Macromolecular movements database') indicate that the method is highly sensitive at identifying flexible protein regions, but false positives remain a problem. The method can be used to explore conformational flexibility of proteins (including hypothetical or synthetic ones) whose structure is yet to be determined experimentally.", "paper_title": "Identifying sequence regions undergoing conformational change via predicted continuum secondary structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000239899700001"}
