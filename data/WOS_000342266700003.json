In the proposed approach, singularities typically encountered in this kind of methods are avoided. A formulation of the TT-based control problem with a virtual target resulting from the vertical translation of the real target allows us to design a single controller, able to regulate the robot pose towards the desired configuration, without local minima. In this context, we introduce a super-twisting control scheme guaranteeing continuous control inputs, while exhibiting strong robustness properties. Our approach is valid for perspective cameras as well as catadioptric systems obeying the central camera model. All these contributions are supported by convincing numerical simulations and experiments under a popular dynamic robot simulator. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
