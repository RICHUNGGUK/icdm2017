We assume that there are some manually classified databases, i.e., training databases, in every node of the topic hierarchy. Each training database is probed using queries constructed from the node titles of the topic hierarchy and the query result counts reported by the database are used to represent the content of the database. Hence, when adding a new database it can be probed by the same set of queries and classified to a node whose training databases are most similar to the new one. Specifically, a support vector machine classifier is trained on each internal node of the topic hierarchy with these training databases and the new database can be classified into the hierarchy top-down level by level. A feature extension method is proposed to create discriminant features. Experiments run on real structured Web databases collected from the Internet show that this classification method is quite accurate.", "paper_title": "Automatic hierarchical classification of structured deep Web databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200020"}
