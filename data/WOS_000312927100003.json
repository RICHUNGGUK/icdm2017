However, most existing recommender systems in mobile tourism fail to exploit information, evaluations or ratings provided by other tourists of similar interests. In this research, we propose to facilitate attraction recommendation task by exploring other tourists' ratings on their visited attractions. The proposed approach employs mobile peer-to-peer communications for exchanging ratings via their mobile devices. A cost-effective travel recommender system iTravel thus is developed to provide tourists with on-tour attraction recommendation. We propose three data exchange methods that allow users to effectively exchange their ratings toward visited attractions. Simulated experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed data exchange methods and a user study is conducted to validate the usability of the proposed iTravel system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
