A new approach is proposed to facilitate such an analysis for several shape parameters on random symmetric digital search trees. Our approach starts from a more careful normalization at the level of Poisson generating functions, which then provides an asymptotically equivalent approximation to the variance in question. Several new ingredients are also introduced such as a combined use of the Laplace and Mellin transforms and a simple, mechanical technique for justifying the analytic de-Poissonization procedures involved. The methodology we develop can be easily adapted to many other problems with an underlying binomial distribution. In particular, the less expected and somewhat surprising n (logn)(2)-variance for certain notions of total path-length is also clarified.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic variance of random symmetric digital search trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000276310200006"}
