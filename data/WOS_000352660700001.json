A hardware prototype is constructed on FPGA with MicroBlaze processors and JPEG hardware accelerators. Experimental results on this case study demonstrate that the Hill and Marty's findings reinforces the hardware/software task partitioning for hybrid MPSoC architectures and also provide creditable new insights to scalable homogeneous and heterogeneous FPGA based MPSoC domains.
