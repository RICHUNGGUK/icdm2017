Different types of 3D representations have been studied: A weak 3D visualisation that provides static monocular depth cues and a strong 3D visualisation that uses stereoscopic and kinetic depth cues. Two controlled experiments were conducted to test hypotheses regarding subjects' efficiency in visually identifying the shortest distance among a set of market locations in a map. As a general result, we found that participants were able to correctly identify shortest distances when the difference to potential alternatives was sufficiently large, but performance decreased systematically when this difference decreased. Noticeable differences emerged for the investigated visualisation conditions. Participants in this study were equally efficient when using a weak 3D representation and a 2D representation. When the strong 3D visualisation was employed, they reported visual discomfort and tasks solved were significantly less correct. Presentations of intrinsic 2D content (maps) in 3D context did not, in this study, benefit from cues provided by a strong 3D visualisation and are adequately implemented using a weak 3D visualisation.", "paper_title": "Evaluating 2D and 3D geovisualisations for basic spatial assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000324361500009"}
