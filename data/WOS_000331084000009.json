This platform was developed in the framework of the Agent-DYSL, IST project, and facilitates dyslexic children in learning to read fluently. Unlike previously presented approaches, the aim of the system is not only to enable access to the reading materials within an inclusive learning system but to promote the development of reading skills by adjusting and adapting in the light of feedback to the system. The idea is to improve speech recognition performance so that gradually increase the reading capabilities of the user, gradually diminish the assistance provided, till he is able to read as a non-dyslexic reader. The evaluation results show that both learners' reading pace and learners' reading accuracy were increased.", "paper_title": "Making assistive reading tools user friendly: a new platform for Greek dyslexic students empowered by automatic speech recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000331084000009"}
