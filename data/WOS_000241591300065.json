Current interconnect standards provide mechanisms to overcome the limitations of the best-effort model, but they do not suffice to satisfy the strict requirements of video transmissions. This problem has been extensively addressed at the general networking community. Several solutions have arisen, but they are too complex to be applied to high speed-interconnects. In this paper, we propose a network architecture that is at the same time compatible with the requirements of high-speed interconnects and provides video traffic with the QoS it demands.", "paper_title": "QoS support for video transmission in high-speed interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300065"}
