(3) Chemical tenets framed via photonic-base-states incorporating and defining multi-partite basis sets. (4) Entanglement provides a quantum-physical view connectable to a chemical bond concept. Amplitude modulations of physical quantum states realize (express) chemical change; Feshbach resonance states as a royal path to handle an equivalent to bond breaking/forming by coupling continuum-to-discrete base states. We observe that, for driving chemical processes within photonic framework, microwaves enter not only as heating sources but can act naturally in a quantum physical manner as causes for catalytic activity.", "paper_title": "Quantum photonic base states: concept and molecular modeling.
