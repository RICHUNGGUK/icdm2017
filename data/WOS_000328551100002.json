In this paper, we propose a technique that allows us to capture the object's motion and geometry alongside the actor's movements and optionally the local environment, using a magnetic motion capture system and an RGB-D sensor. This not only gives greater information when placing a character in a scene but enables us to digitally recreate the scene in motion without significant animator work after capture. The use of magnetic sensors prevents occlusion or marker confusion that is common in optical techniques when dealing with close interactions, as the magnetic sensors do not require direct line of sight to a camera. The geometry reconstruction ensures that the proportions of objects and surfaces the character interacts with are accurate and alleviates the need for an artist to model the object. We perform validation of the results by comparison with an optical system and show a variety of motions, such as using a screwdriver or removing a cap to drink from a bottle, that can be captured using our technique.
