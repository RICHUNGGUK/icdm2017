We propose a network planning model that allows lightpaths to slide within their desired timing windows with no penalty on the optimization objective and to slide beyond their desired timing windows with a decreasing tolerance level. Our model quantitatively measures the timing satisfactions or violations. We apply the Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods to the formulated optimization problem, with which great computational efficiency is demonstrated when compared with other existing algorithms. Our simulation results show how timing flexibility improves network resource utilization and reduces rejections.", "paper_title": "Lightpath Scheduling and Routing for Traffic Adaptation in WDM Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285515300003"}
