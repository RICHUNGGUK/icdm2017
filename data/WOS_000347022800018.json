This is however a difficult matter to address as time is limited and vulnerabilities are frequent. Objective: This paper presents a Bayesian network based model that can be used by enterprise decision makers to estimate the likelihood that a professional penetration tester is able to obtain knowledge of critical vulnerabilities and exploits for these vulnerabilities for software under different circumstances. Method: Data on the activities in the model are gathered from previous empirical studies, vulnerability databases and a survey with 58 individuals who all have been credited for the discovery of critical software vulnerabilities. Results: The proposed model describes 13 states related by 17 activities, and a total of 33 different datasets. Conclusion: Estimates by the model can be used to support decisions regarding what software to acquire, or what measures to invest in during software development projects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
