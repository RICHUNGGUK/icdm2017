The algorithm is designed based on an elegant concept-shrinking of a spherical rubber balloon surrounding the set of objects in 3-D. Logically, a set of neurons is orderly placed on a spherical mesh i.e., on a rubber balloon surrounding the objects. Each neuron has a parameter vector associated with its current position. The resultant force of attraction, between a neuron and each of the given points/objects, determines the direction of a movement of the neuron lying on the rubber balloon. As the network evolves, the neurons (parameter vectors) approximate the convex hull more and more accurately.", "paper_title": "Neurocomputing model for computation of an approximate convex hull of a set of points and spheres", "paper_id": "WOS:000244970900024"}
