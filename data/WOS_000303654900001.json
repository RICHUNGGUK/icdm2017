To combat such shortcomings, a new method for calculating exact high-order sensitivities using multicomplex numbers is presented. Inspired by the recent complex step method that is only valid for first-order sensitivities, the new multicomplex approach is valid to arbitrary order. The mathematical theory behind this approach is revealed, and an efficient procedure for the automatic implementation of the method is described. Several applications are presented to validate and demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results are compared to conventional approaches such as finite differencing, the complex step method, and two separate automatic differentiation tools. The multicomplex method performs favorably in the preliminary comparisons and is therefore expected to be useful for a variety of algorithms that exploit higher order derivatives.", "paper_title": "Using Multicomplex Variables for Automatic Computation of High-Order Derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000303654900001"}
