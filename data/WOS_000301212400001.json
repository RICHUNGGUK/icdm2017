To obtain great discriminative power between classes, all the data points in each class are expected to be regressed to a single vector, and the basic task is to find a transformation matrix such that the squared regression error is minimized. To this end, two least squares discriminant analysis methods are developed under the orthogonal or the uncorrelated constraint. We show that the orthogonal least squares discriminant analysis is an extension to the null space linear discriminant analysis, and the uncorrelated least squares discriminant analysis is exactly equivalent to the traditional linear discriminant analysis. Comparative experiments show that the orthogonal one is more preferable for real world applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
