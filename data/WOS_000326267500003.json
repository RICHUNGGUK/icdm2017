Due to such complexity, there is a clear need for a decision support tool. This paper presents a model for solving this problem based on a new multi-agent auction protocol. The developed model is used to solve a real scenario of the Brazilian oil supply chain in a multi-level topological approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
