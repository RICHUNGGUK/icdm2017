It is shown that short assembly times are ideally suitable for sources with small congestion windows, allowing for a speedup in their transmission. In addition, large assembly times do not yield any throughput gain, despite the large number of segments per burst transmitted, but result in a low throughput variation, and thus a higher notion of fairness among the individual flows. To this end we propose a new burst assembly scheme that dynamically assigns flows to different assembly queues with different assembly timers, based on their instant window size. Results show that the proposed scheme with different timers provides a higher average throughput together with a smaller variance, which is a good compromise for bandwidth dimensioning.
