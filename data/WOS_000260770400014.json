However, it is based on the expense of an increase in the complexity. A reduced maximum likelihood (RML) algorithm is proposed in this paper, which derives from the combination of the ML and ZF algorithms. It is shown that the complexity of RML is far lower than that of ML, while in the same performance condition by both theoretic analyses and simulation.", "paper_title": "Analysis of a reduced-ML algorithm in BLAST", "paper_id": "WOS:000260770400014"}
