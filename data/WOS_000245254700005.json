However, most of the conventional system assumes static traffic and lacks the flexibility to unexpected change of traffic demand. Hence, the enhancement for dynamic traffic must be provided on the network design. In this paper, we propose a coupled-layer waveband routed network architecture to accommodate dynamic traffic changes. Assuming an environment without a wavelength converter, our coupled-layer waveband path design method is applied to several network topologies to enable an evaluation of its performance. The effectiveness and feasibility of this method were confirmed in terms of the number of required wavelengths and the blocking probability. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
