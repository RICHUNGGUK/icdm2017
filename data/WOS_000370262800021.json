Providing products, processes, data and information as a service has emerged into the huge stream of Everything as a Service(XaaS). However there lacks a unified view of XaaS which hinders the systemic application of XaaS in the Web Service Ecosystem. The unified view of XaaS can aid the classification of services for service registration, discovery and composition. Based on a throughout literature survey, we propose a taxonomy on service types covering traditional service, telecommunication service, SOA and Cloud service.", "paper_title": "Exploring the Categories and Models of Everything as a Service (XaaS)", "paper_id": "WOS:000370262800021"}
