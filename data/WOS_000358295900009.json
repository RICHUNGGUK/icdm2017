The antenna consists of two radiating loops and two truncated parasitic patches. A microstrip-to-stripline transition is used as a balun to feed the two radiating loops. A square cavity works as a reflector to realise a unidirectional radiation. This antenna has a total size of 0.56(L) x 0.56(L) x 0.15(L) ((L): free space wavelength at lowest operating frequency). The measured results show that a broad operating bandwidth of 103.8% (2.67-8.44 GHz) for return loss being higher than 10 dB is achieved. Meanwhile, measured stable unidirectional radiation patterns with a gain (6.9-11.3 dBi) in +z direction, a front-to-back ratio better than 14.5 dB and low cross-polarization level (<-17 dB) are also obtained over the whole band.
