The BOVW (bag of visual words) scheme can cluster local features to form the visual vocabulary which includes an amount of words, where each word is the center of one clustering feature. The vocabulary is used to recognize the image semantic. In this paper, a new scheme to construct semantic-binding hierarchical visual vocabulary is proposed. Some attributes and relationship of the semantic nodes in the model are discussed. The hierarchical semantic model is used to organize the multi-scale semantic into a level-by-level structure. Experiments are performed based on the LabelMe dataset, the performance of our scheme is evaluated and compared with the traditional BOVW scheme, experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of our scheme.", "paper_title": "Multi-Scale Image Semantic Recognition with Hierarchical Visual Vocabulary", "paper_id": "WOS:000295127500021"}
