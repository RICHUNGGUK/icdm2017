Emerging computational tools could help clinicians analyze clinical data and make these decisions. AngioLab is a single graphical user interface, developed on top of the open source framework GIMIAS, that integrates some of the latest image analysis and computational modeling tools for intracranial aneurysms. Two workflows are available: Advanced Morphological Analysis (AMA) and Endovascular Treatment Planning (ETP). AngioLab has been evaluated by a total of 62 clinicians, who considered the information provided by AngioLab relevant and meaningful. They acknowledged the emerging need of these type of tools and the potential impact they might have on the clinical decision-making process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
