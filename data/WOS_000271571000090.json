First, we present the arithmetic operations between interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Then, we present a fuzzy ranking method to calculate the ranking values of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. We also make a comparison of the ranking values of the proposed method with the existing methods. Based on the proposed fuzzy ranking method and the proposed arithmetic operations between interval type-2 fuzzy sets, we present a new method to handle fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making problems. The proposed method provides us with a useful way to handle fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making problems in a more flexible and more intelligent manner due to the fact that it uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets rather than traditional type-1 fuzzy sets to represent the evaluating values and the weights of attributes.
