Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is utilized for parameter estimation of the Poincare map. Bifurcation analyses of the iterated map reveal that as the neuronal activity progresses from preictal state toward the ictal event, the parameter values of the Poincare map move toward the bifurcation points. However, following the seizure occurrence and in the postictal period, these parameter values move away from the bifurcation points. Both flip and fold bifurcations are analyzed and it is demonstrated that in some cases the flip bifurcation and in other cases the fold bifurcation are the dynamical regime underlying epileptiform events. This information can offer insights into the dynamical nature and variability of the brain signals and consequently could help to predict and control seizure events. (C) 2011 IMACS.
