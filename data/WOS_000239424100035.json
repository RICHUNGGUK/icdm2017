We introduce the class of (hyper)graph polynomials definable in second order logic, and outline a research program for their classification in terms of definability and complexity considerations, and various notions of reducibilities.", "paper_title": "From a zoo to a zoology: Descriptive complexity for graph polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100035"}
