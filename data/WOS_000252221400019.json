Given the increasing relevance of semantic interoperability in this context, this work presents the specification and development of a Web Ontology Service (WOS), based on the OGC Web Service Architecture specification, whose purpose is to facilitate the management and use of lexical ontologies. Additionally, this work shows how to integrate this service with Spatial Data Infrastructure discovery components in order to obtain a better classification of resources and an improvement in information retrieval performance.
