This paper presents an approach of back propagation neural network with rough set (RSBP) for complicated STLF with dynamic and non-linear factors in order to develop the accuracy of predictions. Through attribution reduction based on variable precision with rough set, the influence of noise data and weak interdependency data to BP is avoided so the time taken for training is decreased. Using load time series from a practical system, we tested the accuracy of forecasting in specific days with comparison.", "paper_title": "Short term load forecasting using neural network with rough set", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000183"}
