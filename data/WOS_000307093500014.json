The discrete ordinate method is firstly applied to discretize the velocity space resulting in a set of hyperbolic equations with source terms which are to be carried out using conservation element/solution element scheme. The method is tested on one-dimensional shock tube problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
