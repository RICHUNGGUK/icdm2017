We treat the shape as a composition of parts; blending is performed by recombining parts from different shapes according to constraints deduced by shape analysis. The analysis involves shape segmentation, contact analysis, and symmetry detection. The system can be used to rapidly instantiate new models that have similar symmetry and adjacency structure to the database shapes, yet vary in appearance.", "paper_title": "Exploring Shape Variations by 3D-Model Decomposition and Part-based Recombination", "paper_id": "WOS:000306181700012"}
