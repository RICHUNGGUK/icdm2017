However, this model may give misleading results when data contain outliers. The outliers in linear regression can be resolved in two stages: by using the Mean Shift Outlier Model (MSOM) and by providing a new solution for this model. First, we construct a Tikhonov regularization problem for the MSOM. Then, we treat this problem using convex optimization techniques, specifically conic quadratic programming, permitting the use of interior point methods. We present numerical examples, which reveal very good results, and we conclude with an outlook to future studies.", "paper_title": "An approach to the mean shift outlier model by Tikhonov regularization and conic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000329498200006"}
