Semantic visual information about humans, more specifically face occurrences in video frames, along with a generative probabilistic model, namely the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are used for this purpose. The latent variables, namely the video topics are modeled as a mixture of distributions of faces in each video. The method also involves a clustering approach based on Scale Invariant Features Transform (SIFT) for clustering the detected faces and adapts the bag-of-words concept into a bag-of-faces one, in order to ensure exchangeability between topics distributions. Experimental results, on three different data sets, provide low misclassification rates of the order of 2% and false rejection rates of 0%. These rates provide evidence that the proposed method performs very efficiently for video fingerprinting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
