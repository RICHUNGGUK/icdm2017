However, ERP projects have often been found to be complex and risky to implement in business enterprises. The organizational relevance and risk of ERP projects make it important for organizations to focus on ways to make ERP implementation successful. We collected and analyzed a number of key articles discussing and analyzing ERP implementation. The different approaches taken in the literature were compared from a risk management point of view to highlight the key risk factors and their impact on project success. Literature was further classified in order to address and analyze each risk factor and its relevance during the stages of the ERP project life cycle. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
