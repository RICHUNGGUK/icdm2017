In this paper, a robust method based on Bag-of-Words (BoW) is developed for finger vein verification. Firstly, some robust and discriminative visual words are learned from local base features such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Mean Curvature and Webber Local Descriptor (WLD). We name these visual words as Finger Vein Textons (FVTs). Secondly, each image is mapped into a FVTs matrix. Finally, spatial pyramid matching (SPM) method is applied to maintain spatial layout information by representing each image as pyramid histogram which is performed for matching by histogram intersection function. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance both on our database and the open PolyU database. In addition, our method also has strong robustness and high accuracy on the self-built rotation and illumination databases.", "paper_title": "Finger Vein Verification with Vein Textons", "paper_id": "WOS:000354824900009"}
