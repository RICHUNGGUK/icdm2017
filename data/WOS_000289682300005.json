A body area network that operates in conjunction with ECG biometric recognition is explored for mobile monitoring of patients, rescuers, pilots, soldiers, or field agents in general. Among the major challenges of this technology is the stability of the signals over the monitoring duration. Time dependency is responsible for ECG destabilization, which becomes a significant issue for reliable monitoring. We propose a novel framework that addresses this inadequacy, by updating a gallery template when feature matching is compromised. In addition, strategies for tackling privacy issues in medical data management are proposed. A protocol level solution is discussed, to deal with the ethical issues of this technology. An automatic way of aggregating and managing personal information is presented, designated to operate on the basis of anonymity. The experimental performance measured over long-ECG recordings demonstrates promising results.
