Market segmentation is a general method for successful CRM. This paper focuses on approaches that provide a human manager with a visualized decision making tool for market segmentation. We propose a novel market segmentation approach, namely the hierarchical self-organizing segmentation model (HSOS), for dealing with a real-world data set for market segmentation of multimedia on demand in Taiwan. HSOS is able to give a human manager a general idea of market segmentation step by step, which can be considered as a potential alternative approach to other hierarchical cluster approaches for market segmentation.
