The semantic content of an image can be illustrated with music or conversely images can be associated with a piece of music. The theoretical basis of the bridge is synaesthesia, a property of human perception. A prototype cross-media retrieval system is built, using principles established in the neuroscientific study of synaesthesia. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
