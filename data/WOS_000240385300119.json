We use a melodic transcription system which extracts a set of acoustic features from the recordings producing a melodic representation of the expressive performance played by the musician. We apply a machine learning techniques to this representation in order to induce a model of expressive performance. We use the model for both understanding and generating expressive music performances.", "paper_title": "Modeling expressive music performance in bassoon audio recordings", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300119"}
