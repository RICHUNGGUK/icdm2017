To solve this research problem, this paper presents an infrastructure of multiple data centers (MDC) for managing and processing massive remote sensing images. The proposed system is built on both groups of distributed DCs/clusters, which are equipped with DC or cluster resource manager. Access security and information service are introduced to support this architecture of MDC. We collaboratively organized the algorithm, and data belonged to the MDC in the manner of workflow. In practice, we succeeded in working out the concrete problems regarding procedures in processing applications collaboratively and transfer the massive remote sensing dataset fast and with stable cross-MDC. On the basis of the previously mentioned research work, we will investigate the platform integration of MDC.
