Leflunomide and brequinar are two well-known DHODH inhibitors, which bind to the enzyme in the same pocket with different binding modes. We have recently realized a series of new inhibitors based on the 4-hydroxy-1,2,5-oxadiazole ring, whose activity profile was found to be closely dependent on the degree of fluorine substitution at the phenyl ring adjacent to the oxadiazole moiety; a positive influence of fluorine on the DHODH inhibitory potency was observed previously [Baumgartner et al. (2006) J Med Chem 49:1239-1247]. Potential energy surface scans showed that fluorine plays an important role in stabilizing the bioactive conformations; additionally, fluorine influences the balance between leflunomide-like and brequinar-like binding modes. These findings may serve as a guide to design more potent DHODH inhibitors.", "paper_title": "The role of fluorine in stabilizing the bioactive conformation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000315349800014"}
