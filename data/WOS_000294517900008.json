The governing equations, turbulence modelling and numerical methods are presented in full. The new numerical method is validated against direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for a lean premixed methane slot burner. Although the modelling approaches are based on non-premixed flames and hence not expected to be valid for a wide range of premixed flames, the predicted flame is just 10% longer than that in the DNS and excellent agreement of mean mass fractions, conditional mass fractions and temperature is demonstrated. This new numerical method provides a very useful framework for future application of CMC to premixed as well as non-premixed combustion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
