The manufactured circuit recovers distorted incoming signals attenuated from 0 to 44 dB (max.), occupies an area of 1.2 x 1.8 nun in a CMOS 0.35 pro process, and typically requires 120 mW of power at 3.3 V. The unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable models are stored in a local random access memory (RAM) and can be easily reprogrammed. This circuit is the first commercial, single-channel, 3.3 V-power supply, short/long-haul T1/E1/J1 device.", "paper_title": "Adaptive equalizer in CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000246290800004"}
