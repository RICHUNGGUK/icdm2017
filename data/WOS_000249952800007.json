These services persist in time, and are characterized by multiple transmissions of data by the service provider, as a result of a single request from the user. Adapting these services to the current context requires the continuous monitoring of context data, and a real-time adjustment of the adaptation parameters upon the detection of a relevant context change. The proposed solution is based on asynchronous context change notifications, and specific techniques have been designed to minimize the number of unnecessary updates and the re-evaluation of policies. The paper also provides experimental results obtained by developing an adaptive video streaming system and running it on top of the proposed middleware.", "paper_title": "Distributed context monitoring for the adaptation of continuous services", "paper_id": "WOS:000249952800007"}
