Detected volatile signals were integrated to a fuzzy logic algorithm to determine the drying temperature. A phase controller was used to automatically and continuously adjust the microwave power. A data acquisition unit with developed program was employed to integrate the entire control. Carrot samples were used in system tests. The results showed that the designed system could successfully achieve the desired temperature, power. and volatiles control and lead to acceptable product's quality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
