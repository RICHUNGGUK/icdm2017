Proteins are responsible for the execution of different functions in the cell: catalysis in chemical reactions, transport and storage, regulation and recognition control. Computational Protein Design (CPD) investigates the relationship between 3-D structures of proteins and amino acid sequences and looks for all sequences that will fold into such 3-D structure. Many computational methods and algorithms have been proposed over the last years, but the problem still remains a challenge for Mathematicians, Computer Scientists, Bioinformaticians and Structural Biologists. In this article we present a new method for the protein design problem. Clustering techniques and a Dead-End-Elimination algorithm are combined with a SAT problem representation of the CPD problem in order to design the amino acid sequences. The obtained results illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method, suggesting that integrated Artificial Intelligence techniques are useful tools to solve such an intricate problem.
