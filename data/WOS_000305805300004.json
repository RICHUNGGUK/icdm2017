Combined with the proposed JND model, a previous differential energy watermarking (DEW) algorithm is modified for better imperceptibility. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) and spread spectrum are used to enhance robustness of the watermark. The watermarked video has good robustness against common video attacks such as re-compression, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), salt-and-pepper noise, Gauss filtering, circular averaging filtering and frame averaging. The watermarked video also has good visual quality due to the introduced JND model.", "paper_title": "Perceptual differential energy watermarking for H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000305805300004"}
