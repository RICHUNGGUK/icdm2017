Most current studies on multi-path routing mechanism are based on experiments or simulations. The results are usually specific application scenarios oriented heuristic algorithms, lacking universal significance. In this paper, a theoretic analysis is performed on the relationship between the multi-path routing policy, the network efficiency and its survivability. Starting with point-to-point communication network, an impact-oriented analysis is made on the network interference under multi-path routing mechanism. Based on the analysis, the upper-limit of network performance under interference impact is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Study of network survivability based on multi-path routing mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000260122000018"}
