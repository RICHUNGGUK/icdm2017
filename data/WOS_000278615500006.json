By leveraging new structural properties and sophisticated data structures, we show how to solve this problem in O(mlog n) time on a bipartite instance with n vertices and m edges, improving the best known running time of O(mn). Building on this algorithm, we provide an algorithm for the non-bipartite stable allocation problem running in O(mlog n) time with high probability. Finally, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the \"optimal\" variant of the bipartite stable allocation problem, as well as a 2-approximation algorithm for the NP-hard \"optimal\" variant of the non-bipartite stable allocation problem.", "paper_title": "Faster Algorithms for Stable Allocation Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278615500006"}
