This paper demonstrates that a spectrally efficient (4 bits/s/Hz) single-channel 100 Gb/s system can be designed based on 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM) and directly detected O-OFDM (DDO-OFDM) with an effective OFDM signal bandwidth of 24 GHz. Such a system can not only offer error-free (at bit error ratio of 10(-3) without forward error correction) transmissions over the targeted maximum distance of 40 km of SMF but also achieves a power margin of 16 dB without any inline amplifier or dispersion compensation. This confirms that the proposed system has the potential to offer 100 Gb/s Ethernet for both point-to-point short communication links and 1: 32 split passive optical networks (PONs). The bit rate of the system is then increased to 1 Tb/s employing WDM, and it is found to have equal potential for point-to-point short communication links and 1: 16 split PON. Finally the reach limits of both of the proposed systems are quantified.", "paper_title": "Single-Channel Directly Detected Optical-OFDM Towards Higher Spectral Efficiency and Simplicity in 100 Gb/s Ethernet and Beyond", "paper_id": "WOS:000291439600005"}
