In the latter case, we show that, relative to some oracle, every set can be weakly coded in the (n-1)st jump of some structure in K. In the former case, we show that there is a countable set of infinitary Pi(n) relations that captures all of the Pi(n) information about the structures in K. In most cases, where there are countably many n-back-and-forth equivalence classes, there is a computable description of them. We will show how to use this computable description to get a complete set of computably infinitary Pi(n) formulas. This will allow us to completely characterize the relatively intrinsically Sigma(0)(n+1) relations in the computable structures of K, and to prove that no Turing degree can be coded by the (n-1) st jump of any structure in K unless that degree is already below 0((n-1)).", "paper_title": "Counting the back-and-forth types", "paper_id": "WOS:000306970200015"}
