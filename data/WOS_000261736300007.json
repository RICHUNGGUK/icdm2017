In this paper, an algorithm designed to efficiently detect the top n outlier samples in MTS dataset, based on Solving Set, is proposed. An extended Frobenius Norm is used to compute the distance between MTS samples. The outlier score of MTS sample is the sum of the distances from its k nearest neighbors. The time complexity of the algorithm is subquadratic. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, stock market dataset and BCI (Brain Computer Interface) dataset. The experiment results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
