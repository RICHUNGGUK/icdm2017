The random functions are given either (i) explicitly in terms of a wavelet expansion or (ii) as the solution of a Poisson equation with a right-hand side in terms of a wavelet expansion. In the case (ii) we derive an adaptive wavelet algorithm that achieves the nonlinear approximation rate at a computational cost that is proportional to the degrees of freedom. These results are matched by computational experiments.", "paper_title": "Adaptive wavelet methods for the stochastic Poisson equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308234600005"}
