Combinatory logic is a variant of the lambda-calculus that maintains irreversibility. Recently, reversible computational models have been studied mainly in the context of quantum computation, as (without measurements) quantum physics is inherently reversible. However, reversibility also fundamentally changes the semantical framework in which classical computation has to be investigated. We describe an implementation of classical combinatory logic in a reversible calculus for which we present an algebraic model based on a generalisation of the notion of a group.", "paper_title": "Reversible combinatory logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000239940300005"}
