First, we propose a multi-resolution string representation scheme based on the tree-structured vector quantization (TSVQ) to transform the time-series of human poses into codeword sequences. Then, we take the temporal variations of human poses into account via codeword sequence matching. Furthermore, we develop a family of pose-histogram-based classifiers to examine the spatial distribution of human poses. We analyze the performance of the temporal and spatial classifiers separately. To achieve a higher classification rate, we merge their decisions and soft scores using novel fusion methods. The proposed fusion solutions are tested on a wide variety of sequences from the CMU mocap database using five-fold cross validation, and a correct classification rate of 99.6% is achieved.", "paper_title": "Automatic Human Mocap Data Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000345571300010"}
