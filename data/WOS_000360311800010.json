This paper introduced the IFC standard for building information modeling, compared the representations and features of architectural and structural models, researched on the method of IFC structural model transformation. A case study was implemented to illustrate the method of structural model transformation, the fluency and stability of the software was tested. The results show that the software can extract the information of IFC structural model and form a corresponding structural model, it also be used to information exchange from structural model of the software to IFC-format structural model.", "paper_title": "Research of the IFC-based Transformation Methods of Geometry Information for Structural Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000360311800010"}
