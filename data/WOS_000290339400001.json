Consequently, the lifetime of a network is significantly shortened. We propose a cross-sensor coding technique using On-Off keying which exploits (a) the tradeoff between delay and energy consumption and (b) the network topology in order to alleviate the problem of unequal energy consumption. We formulate our coding problem as an integer linear programming problem and show how to construct a number of codes based on different criteria. We show that the proposed technique can extend the lifetime of a small sensor network.", "paper_title": "On Reducing Communication Energy Using Cross-Sensor Coding Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000290339400001"}
