The inner relation between the input and the output PLS score vectors is modeled by a quadratic TSK fuzzy inference system. The performance of the proposed QFPLS method is tested and compared against four other well-known partial least squares methods (Linear PLS (LPLS), Quadratic PLS (QPLS), Linear Fuzzy PLS (LFPLS), and Neural Network PLS (NNPLS)) on various different types of randomly generated test data. QFPLS outperformed competitors based on two comparison measures: the output variables cumulative per cent variance captured by the PLS latent variables and the root mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP).
