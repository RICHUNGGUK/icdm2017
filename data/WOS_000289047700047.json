The considered process parameters include traverse speed, waterjet pressure, standoff distance, abrasive grit size and abrasive flow rate. The quality of the cutting of machined-material is assessed by looking to the roughness average value (R(a)). The optimal values of the process parameters are targeted for giving a minimum value of R(a). It was evidence that integrated ANN-SA is capable of giving much lower value of R(a) at the recommended optimal process parameters compared to the result of experimental and ANN single-based modeling. The number of iterations for the optimal solutions is also decreased compared to the result of SA single-based optimization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
