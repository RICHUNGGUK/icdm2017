Such interaction paradigms and communication protocols belong to what can be called the IoT application layer, on which this paper focuses. This paper presents app execution platform (AEP), a platform that supports the design, deployment, execution, and management of IoT applications in the domain of smart home, smart car, and smart city. AEP was designed to coherently fulfill a set of requirements covered only partially or in a fragmented way by other IoT application platforms. AEP focuses on SO virtualization and on composite application (CA) orchestration and supports dynamic object availability.", "paper_title": "A Platform for Smart Object Virtualization and Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098800015"}
