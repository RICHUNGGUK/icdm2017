The material is a two-phase composite whose first constituent is isotropic and viscoelastic while the other is an orthotropic material with negative stiffness but stable. A concept for this material based on a lumped parameter model is used. The performance of the topology optimization approach in this context is illustrated using three examples.", "paper_title": "Viscoelastic material design with negative stiffness components using topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000266255500004"}
