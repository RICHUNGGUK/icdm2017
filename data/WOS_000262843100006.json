In practice. due to the large number of blocks and precedence constraints linking them, blocks are typically aggregated to form larger scheduling units. We aim to solve the OPMPSP, formulated as a mixed integer programme (MIP), so that aggregates are used to schedule the mining process, while individual blocks are used for processing decisions. We propose an iterative disaggregation method that refines the aggregates (with respect to processing) up to the point where the refined aggregates defined for processing produce the same optima I solution for the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the MIP as the optimal solution of the LP relaxation with individual block processing. We propose several strategies of creating refined aggregates for the MIP processing, using duality results and exploiting the problem structure. These refined aggregates allow the solution of very large problems in reasonable time with very high solution quality in terms of NPV. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
