At each time instant, in addition to the camera motion, a different view of the action is observed. In this paper, we propose a novel method to perform action recognition in presence of camera motion. Proposed method is based on the epipolar geometry between any two views. However, instead of relating two static views using the standard fundamental matrix, we model the motions of independently moving cameras in the equations governing the epipolar geometry and derive a new relation which is referred to as the \"temporal fundamental matrix.\" Using the temporal fundamental matrix, a matching score between two actions is computed by evaluating the quality of the recovered geometry. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed approach for action recognition in a number of challenging sequences. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
