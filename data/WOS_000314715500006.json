However, true object tracking and extraction are difficult and computationally expensive. In this paper, an arbitrarily shaped virtual-object compression method is developed. The method is similar to the object based compression methods in that it separates the changing portion of the video from the stationary portion, and encodes them independently. The changing portion of the video is grouped as a 3D arbitrarily shaped virtual-object whereas the unchanged portion of the video is grouped as background. The arbitrarily shaped virtual object is coded using 3D wavelet compression whereas stationary background is coded as a single frame using 2D wavelet compression. Experimental results demonstrate that the newly developed method has comparable performance with the state-of-the-art compression methods and significantly outperforms rectangular virtual-object compression.", "paper_title": "Arbitrarily shaped virtual-object based video compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000314715500006"}
