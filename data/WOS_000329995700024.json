This problem has received much attention starting with the work of Grossglauser and Tse (2002), and it has been shown that there is a significant tradeoff between the end-to-end delays and the total achievable rate. We develop algorithms to compute such tradeoffs with provable performance guarantees for arbitrary instances, with general interference models. Given a target delay-bound Delta(c) for each session c, our algorithm gives a stable flow vector with a total throughput within a factor of O(log Delta(m)/ log log Delta(m)) of the maximum, so that the per-session (end-to-end) delay is, O(((log Delta(m)/ log log Delta(m))Delta(c))(2)) where Delta(m) = max(c){Delta(c)}; note that these bounds depend only on the delays, and not on the network size, and this is the first such result, to our knowledge.", "paper_title": "Approximation Algorithms for Throughput Maximization in Wireless Networks With Delay Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000329995700024"}
