Because the proposed MILS algorithm uses p innovations (not only the current innovation but also past innovations) at each iteration (with the integer p > 1 being an innovation length), the accuracy of parameter estimation is improved, compared with that of the RLS algorithm. Performance analysis and simulation results show that the proposed MILS algorithm is consistently convergent. Moreover, a new interval-varying MILS algorithm is proposed, for which the key is to dynamically change the interval in order to deal with cases where some measurement data are missing. Furthermore, an auxiliary-model-based MILS algorithm is derived for pseudolinear models corresponding to output error moving average systems with colored noises. Finally, the proposed algorithms are applied to model an experimental water level control system.", "paper_title": "Multiinnovation Least-Squares Identification for System Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000277774700020"}
