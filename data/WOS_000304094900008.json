The Superiority and Inferiority Ranking (SIR) is a generation of the well-known outranking approach-PROMETHEE, which is an efficient approach for MCDM. As the traditional MCDM approach, however, it faces the obstacle in handling uncertainties of real world. We are concerned about the issue on how to extend the traditional MCDM approach for applications in uncertain environments. This paper proposes a new Intuitionistic Fuzzy SIR (IF-SIR for short) approach and focuses on its application to supplier selection which is the important activity in supply chain management. Toward practical applications, two factors are considered here: (1) multiple decision makers and (2) decision information in the form of linguistic terms. We firstly identify these terms via Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) which is proven to be a powerful mathematical tool in modeling uncertain information. Then, we provide the IF-SIR approach for group aggregation and decision analysis. Hereinto, a rule-based method is developed for ranking and selection of suppliers. Finally, an illustrative example is used for illustration of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A NEW RULE-BASED SIR APPROACH TO SUPPLIER SELECTION UNDER INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000304094900008"}
