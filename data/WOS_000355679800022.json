Alternatives to many security protocols originally employing traditional mathematical cryptography involve novel hardware security primitives, such as Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In this article, we propose a novel hybrid memristor-CMOS PUF circuit and demonstrate its suitability through extensive simulations of environmental and process variation effects. The proposed PUF circuit has substantially less hardware overhead than previously proposed memristor-based PUF circuits while being inherently resistant to machine learning-based modeling attacks because of challenge-dependent delays of the memristor stages. The proposed PUF can be conveniently used in many security applications and protocols based on hardware-intrinsic security.", "paper_title": "A Novel Memristor-Based Hardware Security Primitive", "paper_id": "WOS:000355679800022"}
