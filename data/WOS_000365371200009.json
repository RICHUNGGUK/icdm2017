The class of almost equitable uninorms appears when the contradictory information is aggregated. It is proved that among various uninorms of which either underlying t-norm or t-conorm is continuous, only the representable uninorms belong to the class of almost equitable uninorms. As a byproduct, a characterization for the class of representable uninorms is obtained.", "paper_title": "ON ALMOST EQUITABLE UNINORMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000365371200009"}
