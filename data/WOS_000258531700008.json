Finding the broadcast time of a vertex in an arbitrary graph is NP-complete. The polynomial time solvability is shown only for trees. In this paper we present a linear algorithm that determines the broadcast time of any originator in an arbitrary unicyclic graph. As a byproduct, we find a broadcast center of the unicyclic graph. We also present an O(|V|+k(2)) algorithm to find the broadcast time of an arbitrary unicyclic graph, where k is the length of the cycle. In the last section we give tight lower and upper bounds on broadcast time of a spanning tree based on the broadcast time of the unicyclic graph.", "paper_title": "On broadcasting in unicyclic graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000258531700008"}
