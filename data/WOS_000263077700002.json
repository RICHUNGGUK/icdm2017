The focus is on providing an infrastructure for evaluating the credibility of raters in a reputation-based framework that would enable trust-based Web services interactions. The techniques we develop aid a service consumer in assigning an appropriate weight to the testimonies of different raters regarding a prospective service provider. The experimental analysis show that the proposed techniques successfully dilute the effects of malicious ratings, thereby facilitating accurate and fair assessment of the providers' reputations.", "paper_title": "Rater Credibility Assessment in Web Services Interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000263077700002"}
