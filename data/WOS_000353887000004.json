The cryptoGPS protocol based on PKC proposed by Mcloone and Robshaw suits low-cost RFID system well, but it just achieves one-way authentication, and the authentication times are very limited, which makes it vulnerable to coupons-exhausted DoS attacks. To solve these problems, cryptoGPS protocol is greatly improved to realize the mutual authentication between RFID reader and the tag. In the improved protocol, a readers' public key distribution scheme is proposed to support the mutual authentication and a coupons updating algorithm is presented to resist the aforementioned DoS attack. Moreover, a modified Rabin encryption algorithm and a parameter generation method based on Low Hamming Weight technology are proposed to optimize the implementation of the proposed authentication protocol. And a feasible hardware structure of the protocol is also given. The protocol's simulation results show that the scheme just needs 3232 equivalent gates, and the maximum time of single step is 3.3ms (500k clock). The scheme is suitable for the low-cost tags.
