The available spinning reserve might not always be enough to provide the required frequency support. Control of non-critical loads is able to provide the required primary and secondary frequency support. The use of Intelligent Load Management Controllers (ILMC) installed at consumer nodes is investigated. The ILMC units use fuzzy logic to determine the shedding and the restoration frequencies for non-critical loads based on the current power measurement and the history of disconnection. The fuzzy rules were chosen to achieve high reliability and equity between consumers.", "paper_title": "INTELLIGENT LOAD CONTROL FOR FREQUENCY REGULATION IN MICROGRIDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272111300013"}
