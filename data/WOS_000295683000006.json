Different morphological operators are used to extract relevant structures of the functions (considered as sets through their subgraph representations). These operators can be considered as preprocessing tools whose outputs are also functional data. We explore some dissimilarity measures and clustering methods for the classification of the transformed data. Our approach is illustrated through a detailed analysis of two data sets. These techniques, which have mainly been used in image processing, provide a flexible and robust toolbox for improving the results in unsupervised functional data classification.", "paper_title": "Using mathematical morphology for unsupervised classification of functional data", "paper_id": "WOS:000295683000006"}
