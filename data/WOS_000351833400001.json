In addition, we describe numerical experiments which illustrate several implications of this fact. For example, that many special functions of great interest - such as the Bessel functions J(nu) and Y-nu - can be evaluated accurately using a number of operations which is O(1) in the order nu. The present paper is devoted to the development of an analytical apparatus. Numerical aspects of this work will be reported at a later date. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
