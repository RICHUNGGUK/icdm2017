A single-faceted approach to modelling trust can suit some, or many, individuals but we believe that such a single-faceted approach cannot capture the wide and varied range of subjective views of trust found across a large and broad population. In response, we have designed, developed and evaluated a rich, semantic, human-centric model of trust that can handle the myriad of terms and intertwined meanings of trust. This multi-faceted model of trust can be Personalised on a per user basis and specialized on per domain basis. In this paper we briefly present an overview of this model and explain how it can be Personalised and specialized. However, the primary focus of this paper is on the experimental evaluation that has been carried out to evaluate the accuracy of recommendations based on this multi-faceted, Personalised model of trust for internet environments.", "paper_title": "An analysis of accuracy experiments carried out over of a multi-faceted model of trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000263524300003"}
