The element based patches are defined and the patch least square fitting process is introduced. A classical shear band simulation is then conducted to test the new technique with various unstructured meshes with mixed quadratic quadrilateral and triangular C-0 elements. The result shows that a direct recovery from the patch least square fitting process is more reliable than that from the nodal averaging process usually necessary for the super-convergent second derivative recovery methods. The proposed technique is proven to be effective for recovering both first and second order strain derivatives and has the potential for even higher order derivative recovery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
