The algorithm generates optimal topology based on priority-based metrics and parameters from the network, transport, and application layers. As application-level (XML) machines are of modest throughput, message processing must be distributed within a topology that attends to network, transport, and application layer metrics. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm delivers flexibility, scalability, and delay minimization while algorithm simplicity reduces processing requirements.
