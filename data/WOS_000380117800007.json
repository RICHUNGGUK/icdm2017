Typically, gadget constructions involve terms with large interaction strengths of order poly(epsilon(-1)). Here we present a 2-body gadget construction and prove that it approximates a Hamiltonian of interaction strength gamma = O(1) up to absolute error epsilon << gamma using interactions of strength O(epsilon) instead of the usual inverse polynomial in. A key component in our proof is a new condition for the convergence of the perturbation series, allowing our gadget construction to be applied in parallel on multiple many-body terms. We also discuss how to apply this gadget construction for approximating 3- and k-local Hamiltonians. The price we pay for using much weaker interactions is a large overhead in the number of ancillary qubits, and the number of interaction terms per particle, both of which scale as O(poly(epsilon(-1))). Our strong-from-weak gadgets have their primary application in complexity theory (QMA hardness of restricted Hamiltonians, a generalized area law counterexample, gap amplification), but could also motivate practical implementations with several weak interactions simulating a much stronger quantum many-body interaction.", "paper_title": "PERTURBATIVE GADGETS WITHOUT STRONG INTERACTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000380117800007"}
