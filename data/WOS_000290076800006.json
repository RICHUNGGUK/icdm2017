Cerebral white matter segmentation in brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data becomes a challenging problem due to a combination of several factors like low contrast, presence of noise and imaging artifacts, partial volume effects, intrinsic tissue variation due to neurodevelopment and neuropathologies, and the highly convoluted geometry of the cortex. In this paper, we propose a new set of edge weights for the traditional graph cut algorithm (Boykov and Jolly, 2001) to correctly segment the cerebral white matter from T1-weighted MRI sequence. In this algorithm, the edge weights of Boykov and Jolly (2001) are modified by comparing the probabilities of an individual voxel and its neighboring voxels to belong to different segmentation classes. A shape prior in form of a series of ellipses is used next to model the contours of the human skull in various 2D slices in the sequence. This shape constraint is imposed to prune the original graph constructed from the input to form a subgraph consisting of voxels within the skull contours. Our graph cut algorithm with new set of edge weights is applied to the above subgraph, thereby increasing the segmentation accuracy as well as decreasing the computation time. Average segmentation errors for the proposed algorithm, the graph cut algorithm (Boykov and Jolly, 2001), and the Expectation Maximization Segmentation (EMS) algorithm Van Leemput et al., 2001 in terms of Dice coefficients are found to be (3.72 +/- 1.12)%, (14.88 +/- 1.69)%, and (11.95 +/- 5.2)%, respectively.
