In this paper, we study the (1 : q) Maker Breaker game, played on the edges of G, in which Maker's goal is to build a graph that satisfies the property P. It is clear that in order for Maker to have a chance of winning. G itself must satisfy P. We prove that if G satisfies P in some strong sense, that is, if one has to delete sufficiently many edges from C in order to obtain a graph that does not satisfy P. then Maker has a winning strategy for this game. We also consider a different notion of satisfying some property in a strong sense, which is motivated by a problem of Duffus, Luczak and Rodl [6].", "paper_title": "Playing to Retain the Advantage", "paper_id": "WOS:000279038700001"}
