It does not require the involvement of the mobile node (MN) in mobility management. However, MN between the mobile access gateway (MAG) and the local mobility anchor (LMA) in a message to the signalling delivery process can cause high overhead. Moreover, even LMA between PMIPv6 domains could cause high signalling overhead. In this paper, we propose a dynamic-paging authorisation, authentication and accounting (AAA) mobility management scheme (DP-AAA) to apply dynamic paging to reduce signalling overhead and to support global mobility in PMIPv6 domains. The dynamic paging scheme does not provide binding updates to MNs that are in a dormant state. According to traffic patterns and mobility, the MN's domain can be determined dynamically in the paging area. Performance analyses indicate that the proposed scheme performs better than static paging and PMIPv6.", "paper_title": "Design and performance analysis of a dynamic-paging AAA mobility management scheme for PMIPv6-based wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345237100002"}
