The advantage of this new gait is that the head link remains in the forward direction during motion. This feature significantly improves snake robot potential applications. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find FHS gait parameters. Relationship between FHS gait parameters and friction coefficients of the ground are developed. Next, robot speed is considered in the optimization. A fitness function covering robot speed and head link angular changes is defined. A general sinusoidal wave form is applied for each joint. GA is used to find gait parameters resulting in maximum speed while head link angular changes remain in an acceptable range. Optimal gait parameters are also calculated for different friction coefficients and relationships between them are developed. Experiments are also performed using a 5-link snake robot. It is shown that experimental and theoretical results closely agree.", "paper_title": "Ground adaptive and optimized locomotion of snake robot moving with a novel gait", "paper_id": "WOS:000276203800005"}
