This method is based on known anatomical constraints on the relative locations of retina structures, and mathematical morphology. The detection of this anatomical feature is a prerequisite for the computer aided diagnosis of several retinal diseases, such as Diabetic Macular Edema. The proposed method is adaptive to local illumination changes, and it is robust to local disturbances introduced by pathologies in digital color eye fundus images (e.g. exudates). Our experimental results using the DRIVE image database indicate that our method is able to detect the fovea center in 37 out of 37 images (i.e. with a success rate of 100%). Using the DIARETDB1 database, our method was able to detect the fovea center in 92.13% of all tested cases (i.e. in 82 out of 89 images). These results indicate that our approach potentially can achieve a better performance than comparable methods proposed in the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
