This study investigates the diffusion of IP telephony in Denmark by focusing on vendors' commercialisation strategies. The theory of disruptive innovation is introduced to investigate vendors' perceptions about IP telephony and explore their strategies that affect the diffusion process in the residential market. The analysis is based on interview data collected from the key market players. The study's findings suggest that IP telephony is treated as a sustaining innovation that goes beyond the typical voice transmission and enables provision of advanced services such as video telephony.", "paper_title": "The diffusion of IP telephony and vendors' commercialisation strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000264422800003"}
