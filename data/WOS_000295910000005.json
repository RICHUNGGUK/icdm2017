Mobile client devices potentially migrate, usually passing through very light access control policies, between numerous and heterogeneous wireless environments, bringing with them software vulnerabilities as well as possibly malicious code. To cope with these new security threats the paper proposes a new active third party authentication, authorization and security assessment strategy in which, once a device enters a new Wi-Fi environment, it is subjected to analysis by the infrastructure, and if it is found to be dangerously insecure, it is immediately taken out from the network and denied further access until its vulnerabilities have been fixed. The security assessment module, that is the fundamental component of the aforementioned strategy, takes advantage from a reliable knowledge base containing semantically-rich information about the mobile node under examination, dynamically provided by network mapping and configuration assessment facilities. It implements a fully automatic security analysis framework, based on AHP, which has been conceived to be flexible and customizable, to provide automated support for real-time-execution of complex security/risk evaluation tasks which depends on the results obtained from different kind of analysis tools and methodologies. Encouraging results have been achieved utilizing a proof-of-concept model based on current technology and standard open-source networking tools.", "paper_title": "Automatic security assessment for next generation wireless mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000295910000005"}
