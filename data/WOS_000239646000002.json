In the normal mode of operation, each connection uses a primary path to deliver packets from the source to the destination. To ensure continuous operation in the event of an edge failure, each connection uses a set of backup bridges, each bridge protecting a portion of the primary path. To meet the bandwidth requirement of the connection, a certain amount of bandwidth must be allocated the edges of the primary path, as well as on the backup edges. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the amount of required backup allocation by sharing backup bandwidth among different connections. We consider efficient sharing schemes that require only partial information about the current state of the network. Specifically, the only information available for each edge is the total amount of primary allocation and the cost of allocating backup bandwidth on this edge. We consider the problem of finding a minimum cost backup allocation together with a set of bridges for a given primary path. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and present an approximation algorithm whose performance is within O (log n) of the optimum, where n is the number of edges in the primary path. We also consider the problem of finding both a primary path and backup allocation of minimal total cost.", "paper_title": "Efficient algorithms for shared backup allocation in networks with partial information", "paper_id": "WOS:000239646000002"}
