In this paper, we investigate use of RapidIO, a new high-performance embedded systems interconnect, in addressing issues associated with the high network bandwidth requirements of real-time ground moving target indicator (GMTI), and synthetic aperture Radar (SAR) applications in satellite systems. Using validated simulation, we study several critical issues related to the RapidIO network and algorithms under study. The results show that RapidIO is a promising platform for space-based radar using emerging technology, providing network bandwidth to enable parallel computation previously unattainable in an embedded satellite system.", "paper_title": "RapidIO for radar processing in advanced space systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256880700001"}
