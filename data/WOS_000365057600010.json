Additive noises and measurement errors will affect the accuracy of target localization when the visual nodes are equipped with low-resolution cameras. In the goal of improving the accuracy of target localization without prior knowledge of the target, each node extracts multiple feature points from images to represent the target at the sensor node level. A statistical method is presented to match the most correlated feature point pair for merging the position information of different sensor nodes at the base station. Besides, in the case that more than one target exists in the field of interest, a scheme for locating multiple targets is provided. Simulation results show that, our proposed method has desirable performance in improving the accuracy of locating single target or multiple targets. Results also show that the proposed method has a better trade-off between camera node usage and localization accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
