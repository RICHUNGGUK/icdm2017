A thermodynamic analysis was performed in order to find the most stable complex. The calculated bonding parameters showed that the most stable H-bonded complex is formed between serotonin and hydrogen peroxide by means of the intermolecular H-bond -H2N center dot center dot center dot H-OOH.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of the hydrogen-bonded complexes serotonin-water/hydrogen peroxide", "paper_id": "WOS:000235756300003"}
