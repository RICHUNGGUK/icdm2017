Service discovery is an essential mechanism to achieve this goal. As an enhancement to our previous work for service discovery, that is, model-based service discovery (MBSD), this paper proposes a location-based service advertisement (SA) algorithm named as MBSD-sa. MBSD-sa advocates the importance of service location to the service availability and integrates the service location information together with the service semantic information into service information for advertisement. MBSD-sa utilizes prediction to estimate the service location so as to reduce the number of SA messages (SAMs). Two complementary types of SA mechanisms (Types I and 2) are employed by MBSD-sa to strike the balance between the SAM overhead and the accuracy of service information. The performance of MBSD-sa is analyzed both numerically and using simulations.
