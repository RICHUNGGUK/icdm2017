Such problems are believed to be difficult to solve, even with a quantum computer, but have the property that if a purported solution to the problem is given, a quantum computer would easily be able to verify whether it is correct. An attempt has been made to make this paper as self-contained as possible so that it can be accessible to computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians, and quantum chemists. Problems of interest to all of these professions can be found here.", "paper_title": "QMA-COMPLETE PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000333068300001"}
