The suggested improvements aim to make the system perform better while still maintaining the simple nature of the basic algorithm. We also examine the system's behavior with many different kinds of tests, measurements and visualizations. We compare the ETree's performance against classical data analysis methods and very similar modern systems. We find that the ETree is a suitable method for unsupervised analysis of huge data sets.", "paper_title": "The evolving tree - Analysis and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000237521300005"}
