However, the user perception usually considers the query specification and responses in a given context. In this scenario, re-ranking methods have been proposed to exploit the contextual information and, hence, improve the effectiveness of CBIR systems. Besides the effectiveness, the usefulness of those systems in real-world applications also depends on the efficiency and scalability of the retrieval process, imposing a great challenge to the re-ranking approaches, once they usually require the computation of distances among all the images of a given collection. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the re-ranking problem. It relies on the similarity of top-k lists produced by efficient indexing structures, instead of using distance information from the entire collection. Extensive experiments were conducted on a large image collection, using several indexing structures. Results from a rigorous experimental protocol show that the proposed method can obtain significant effectiveness gains (up to 12.19% better) and, at the same time, improve considerably the efficiency (up to 73.11% faster). In addition, our technique scales up very well, which makes it suitable for large collections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
