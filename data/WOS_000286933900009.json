The primary and secondary self-inductances and the mutual inductance can be controlled independently. Being constructed with integrator and transconductor blocks, the circuit offers excellent sensitivity, stability and high frequency performances. The current-conveyor-based implementation is also presented to avail comparison with previous counterparts. Via measurements and simulations, theoretical predictions are verified and the comparisons are performed. As an RF application example, a tuned amplifier is built and simulated.", "paper_title": "Design of a high performance mutually coupled circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000286933900009"}
