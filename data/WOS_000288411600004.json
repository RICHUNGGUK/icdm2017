However, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a significant amount of sensitive information, and allowing data to be accessible at many different sources increases concerns related to patient privacy and data theft. Access control solutions must guarantee that only authorized users have access to such critical records for legitimate purposes, and access control policies from distributed EHR sources must be accurately reflected and enforced accordingly in the integrated EHRs. In this paper, we propose a unified access control scheme that supports patient-centric selective sharing of virtual composite EHRs using different levels of granularity, accommodating data aggregation and privacy protection requirements. We also articulate and address issues and mechanisms on policy anomalies that occur in the composition of discrete access control policies from different data sources. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
