Owing to the huge amount of data and computational complexity, FCM is difficult to cluster big sensor data in real time. The paper proposes three distributed FCM algorithms, namely distributed FCM algorithm based on MapReduce (DFCM), distributed online FCM algorithm based on sampled affinity propagation (AP) clustering (DOFCM) and distributed kernel FCM algorithm based on MapReduce (DKFCM). The proposed algorithms use cloud computing technology to improve the efficiency for clustering big sensor data. Experiments prove the superiority of the proposed methods through the clustering accuracy and clustering speed.", "paper_title": "Distributed fuzzy c-means algorithms for big sensor data based on cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358693700004"}
