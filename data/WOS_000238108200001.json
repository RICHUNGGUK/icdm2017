It is capable of capturing complex material behavior, using stress and strain sets from experiments. This paper presents a rate-dependent NN constitutive model formulation and its implementation in finite element analysis. The proposed NN model is verified for a standard solid viscoelasticity model. The model is then applied to analysis of time-dependent behavior of concrete. The proposed model has potential of capturing any rate-dependent material models, provided enough data sets are given. The issue of what constitutes a sufficient data set to train a neural network constitutive model must be addressed in future research. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
