In this study, considering the limit of the prior technologies, a source security method of the keyboard input information, regardless of the type of the hacking tool, was developed. The method makes use of a newly developed keyboard security driver at the Kernel level departing from the Pattern Matching Heuristic Method which requires technologies corresponding to various hacking tools case by case basis. In order to verify the technology developed in this research, tests were carried out in comparison with the prior arts with collected hacking tool, which have contributed to the development of the suggested technology.", "paper_title": "The design and development of a secure keystroke system for u business", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800027"}
