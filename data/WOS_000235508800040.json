In this paper we will discuss the control mechanisms for several representative protection schemes, analyze their adaptation and application, and propose the corresponding signaling model and control protocol for a novel dynamic group protection strategy. The simulation results show that the control overhead of our proposed method outperforms the segmented protection and has the benefit on resource utilization and failure restoration speed.", "paper_title": "Signaling overhead analysis of distributed control for partition-based protection in WDM mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508800040"}
