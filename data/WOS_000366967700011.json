It increasingly relies on multiple service providers to fulfill a given complex business goal. Despite significant progress, most approaches of service composition are still impractical and almost unusable, because the current methods of service composition lack consideration of interaction among service providers. With the increasement of providers and services, it becomes difficult to find the required services in the distributed computing environment. This work addresses such issue and suggests metrics to discover the relationships of service providers by accounting of recent service interactions. In this way, a social network of service providers is constructed, and modeled as a social graph. Service clients can navigate the network and understand the structure and the metrics of social graph by employing social network analysis. Most importantly, through the constructing social networks, the efficiently service composition approach is therefore presented to discover a group of collaboration service providers for satisfying the business requirements. In addition, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the socially aware composition approach in details.", "paper_title": "Socially Aware Discovery Approach Supporting Service Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000366967700011"}
