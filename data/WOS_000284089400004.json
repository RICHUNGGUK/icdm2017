We define a set of anomaly detection models for the individual parameters of the call. We then describe a clustering process that helps to better fit models to system call arguments and creates interrelations among different arguments of a system call. Finally, we add a behavioral Markov model in order to capture time correlations and abnormal behaviors. The whole system needs no prior knowledge input; it has a good signal-to-noise ratio, and it is also able to correctly contextualize alarms, giving the user more information to understand whether a true or false positive happened, and to detect global variations over the entire execution flow, as opposed to punctual ones over individual instances.", "paper_title": "Detecting Intrusions through System Call Sequence and Argument Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000284089400004"}
