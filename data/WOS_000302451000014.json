This model-based approach combines the spectral analysis of real signatures with the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements in order to generate totally synthetic specimens. Two different algorithms are also described in order to produce duplicated samples from the synthetic master signatures, so that the generation scheme as a whole is able to produce in a complete automatic fashion huge synthetic databases. Typical examples of synthetic specimens are presented to highlight their human-like appearance. The validation protocol and the test results are presented and discussed in a companion paper.
