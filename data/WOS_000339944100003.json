A probability based high-cycle fatigue analysis is combined with principal stress calculations in order to find the topology with minimum mass that can withstand prescribed variable-amplitude loading conditions for a specific life time. This allows us to generate optimal conceptual designs of structural components where fatigue life is the dimensioning factor. We describe the fatigue analysis and present ideas that make it possible to separate the fatigue analysis from the topology optimization. The number of constraints is kept low as they are applied to stress clusters, which are created such that they give adequate representations of the local stresses. Optimized designs constrained by fatigue and static stresses are shown and a comparison is also made between stress constraints based on the von Mises criterion and the highest tensile principal stresses. The paper is written with focus on structural parts in the avionic industry, but the method applies to any load carrying structure, made of linear elastic isotropic material, subjected to repeated loading conditions.", "paper_title": "Fatigue constrained topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000339944100003"}
