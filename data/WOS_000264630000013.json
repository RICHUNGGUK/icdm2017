Various optimizations are employed to increase the clock speed. A row permutation scheme is proposed to significantly simplify the implementation of the shuffle network in LDPC decoder. An approximate layered decoding approach is explored to reduce the critical path of the layered LDPC decoder. The computation core is further optimized to reduce the computation delay. It is estimated that 4.7 Gb/s decoding throughput can be achieved at 15 iterations using the current technology.", "paper_title": "High-Throughput Layered LDPC Decoding Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000264630000013"}
