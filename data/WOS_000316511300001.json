The interlocked interaction of novel advances in these areas provide promising solutions improving the static and dynamic performances such as sensitivity, accuracy, compactness, economic efficiency, stiffness, and resonant frequency of F/T sensors. A detailed overview on the current selected solutions for significant developments of measurement principles, EE structures, manufacturing technologies, signal processing and decoupling methods characterizing recently F/T sensors. In addition, several predominantly development trends in the future are presented. (C)2012 Elsevier Ltd.
