This method separates the circuit ground for the Sustain pulse generator from the system ground during the sustain period, so it is named the floating single sustain method. The problems observed in previous single sustain methods are solved by separating the ground systems. A drive waveform and circuit for the floating single Sustain method are proposed, and a cost-effective method of connecting the drive circuit to the electrodes of a PDP is presented. Experimental results on a 42-in. WVGA single-scan PDP show that the proposed waveform and circuit are well suited for driving the PDP: all problems observed in the previous single sustain method are solved and the power Consumption due to the sustain power leakage to the data drive circuit is eliminated.
