This method utilized less features than traditional MPCA algorithm without downgrading the performance in recognition accuracy. The experiment results show that the proposed method is more suitable for large dataset, obtaining better computational efficiency. Moreover, when support vector machine is employed as the classification method, the superiority of the proposed algorithm reflects significantly. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
