We analyse the flaws of the latter and argue that e-government is not feasible for sustainable governance due to permanently changing regulation; instead we propose a model in which people can govern themselves in a self-service manner by relying on constellations of data stored in a network of governmental databases to which citizens and government agents have read- and write access under conditions defined by then-valid regulation.", "paper_title": "Towards Self-Service Government - A Study on the Computability of Legal Eligibilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375200005"}
