Considering that moving targets are sparsely distributed in the observed scene, their positions and velocities can be reconstructed by using the compressed sensing (CS) technique. In this paper, the range-walk correction are implemented by the Keystone transform and the sparse range-walk correction (SRWC), then the CS technique is proposed to reconstruct motion parameters by processing the azimuth signals of the moving targets. Experiments using the simulated and real data are performed, and the results confirm the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Parameter estimation of moving targets in the SAR system with a low PRF sampling rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000299517500009"}
