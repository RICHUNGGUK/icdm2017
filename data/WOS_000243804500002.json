It relies on the solution of an advection equation for the interface between the two phases by a streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) scheme combined with an adaptive mesh refinement procedure and a littering technique. This method is illustrated in the case of a Rayleigh-Taylor two-phase How problem governed by the Stokes equations.
