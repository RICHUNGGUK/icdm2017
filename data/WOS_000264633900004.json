We consider two weakened forms of this Cauchy equation: the reciprocity equation and the n-divisibility equation. Although the solution sets of both functional equations are quite large, requiring that an automorphism is both reciprocal and n-divisible, drastically increases the set of obligatory fixed points. However, increasing n also enlarges the domain on which the automorphism can be chosen freely. We also describe the solution sets of two functional equations that arise by composing the reciprocity and n-divisibility property.", "paper_title": "DIVISIBLE, RECIPROCAL AUTOMORPHISMS OF THE UNIT INTERVAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000264633900004"}
