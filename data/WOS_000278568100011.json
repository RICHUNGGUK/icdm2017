Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Six-Sigma approaches use the assumptions of statistical independence and normally distributed data to create quality process control guidelines which are predominantly used in industry. Multivariate statistical techniques such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) have been more recently applied to automotive body assembly analysis in order to capture the surface co-linearity present in the dimensional variation of stampings and assemblies. This paper combines the Point Distribution Model, which is based on PCA, and Kernel Density Estimation to provide a statistical shape model (the KDE-PDM) that can deal with high dimensional data sets, represent correlated variation modes, and provide accurate estimates of the underlying shape distribution. Examples from FE simulation and production case studies are presented to highlight the advantages of the KDE-PDM over two other statistical shape models: the univariate shape model, and the original PDM. The KDE-PDM's capabilities make it particularly suited to variation monitoring and diagnosis of high dimensional measurement data sets made available by optical measurement devices, and some suggestions for its implementation are also presented.
