Relationships between virality and retention parameters as measurable metrics are calculated and discussed using real examples. Virality and monetization can be both competing and complementary mechanisms for the system growth. The K-growth factor, which combines both virality and retention, is proposed as the metrics of the overall freemium system performance in terms of the user base growth. This approach can be tested using a small number of users to assess the system potential performance. If the K-growth factor is less than one, the product needs further development. If the K-growth factor is greater than one, the system retains existing and attracts new users, thus a large scale market launch can be successful. User attraction and retention mechanics are discussed based on the peer-to-peer online language training platform, which utilizes freemium business model. Key system metrics are derived to assess the future commercial potential and making decisions to either fund an advertising campaign, or continue with project technical improvements. The paper can be of interest to venture capitalists as a method to assess freemium projects.", "paper_title": "Gamification, Virality and Retention in Educational Online Platform Measurable Indicators and Market Entry Strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000357580000002"}
