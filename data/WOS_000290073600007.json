Many software organizations use FPs to estimate the effort required for software development. However, it is essential that the definition of 1 FP be based on the software development experience of the organization. In the present study, we propose a method by which to automatically extract data and transaction functions from Web applications under several conditions using static analysis. The proposed method is based on the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG) method and has been developed as an FP measurement tool. We applied the proposed method to several Web applications and examined the difference between FP counts obtained by the tool and those obtained by a certified FP specialist (CFPS). The results reveal that the numbers of data and transaction functions extracted by the tool is approximately the same as the numbers of data and transaction functions extracted by the specialist.
