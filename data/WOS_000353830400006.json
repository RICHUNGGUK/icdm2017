Such places are often located indoors and in urban canyons, where GPS is unreliable. Consequently, mapping a user's stay point to a Place of Interest (POI) using only GPS data is particularly challenging. Our novel algorithm employs both spatio-temporaldensity estimation and line count inference to predict and rank a user's POI(s) at building level accuracy from noisy time-annotated GPS data points. An experimental study demonstrates the superiority of our algorithm against several baseline approaches with a recall of 96.5% for the top 5 retrieved locations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
