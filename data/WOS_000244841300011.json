The analysis is based on EDQNM closure theory, and is applied to the LES of decaying isotropic turbulence. First, the effects of finite-differencing truncation error, aliasing error and the dynamic Smagorinsky model are independently considered. The time-evolution of kinetic energy and spectra predicted by the analysis are compared to actual LES using the Navier-Stokes equations, and good agreement is obtained. The analysis is then extended to simultaneously consider all sources of error in a second-order discretely energy conserving, central-difference LES solver. Good agreement between the analysis and actual LES is obtained. The analysis is used to compare the contribution of the subgrid model to that of numerical errors, and it is shown that the contribution of the subgrid scale model is much higher than the numerical errors. The proposed one-dimensional EDQNM-LES model shows potential as a more general tool for the analysis of numerical error, and SGS model in simulations of turbulent flow. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
