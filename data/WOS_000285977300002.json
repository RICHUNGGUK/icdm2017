The difficulty of mining large database launched the research of designing parallel and distributed algorithms to solve the problem. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining algorithm, named Cloud-based Association Rule Mining (CARM), abbreviated as CARM, which is able to efficiently utilise the nodes to discover frequent patterns in cloud computing environments with data privacy preserved. Through empirical evaluations on various simulation conditions, the proposed CARM delivers excellent performance in terms of scalability and execution time.", "paper_title": "A novel parallel algorithm for frequent pattern mining with privacy preserved in cloud computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000285977300002"}
