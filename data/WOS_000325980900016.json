Such networks arise in the context of visuo-motor control loops and may, therefore, be used to mimic their complex behavior. In this brief, we adopt the Lur'e-Postnikov systems approach to analyze the induced L-infinity gain of generalized Hopfield networks. A state-feedback control is then designed to accomplish the L-infinity-type performance for Hopfield networks. The results are illustrated through numerical examples.", "paper_title": "L-infinity Analysis and State-Feedback Control of Hopfield Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325980900016"}
