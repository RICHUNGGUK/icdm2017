Initially, the case of Daubechies wavelets is taken and the procedure is explained for both collocation and Galerkin approaches. For each case a Matlab routine is provided to compute the differentiation matrix and the derivative of the function f((d)) = D-(d) f. Moreover, the convergence of the derivative is shown graphically as a function of different parameters (the wavelet genus, D and the scale, J) for two test functions. We then consider the use of spline wavelets.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 929: A Suite on Wavelet Differentiation Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000322130900006"}
