The aim of this paper is to develop some new aggregation operators to fuse hesitant fuzzy information. The hesitant fuzzy hybrid arithmetical averaging (HFHAA) operator, the hesitant fuzzy hybrid arithmetical geometric (HFHAG) operator, the quasi HFHAA operator and the quasi HFHAG operator are proposed and their properties are investigated. On the basis of these proposed operators, some algorithms are introduced to aid multi-criteria single person decision making and multi-criteria group decision making respectively. Some examples are provided to illustrate the practicality and validity of our proposed procedures.", "paper_title": "Some new hybrid weighted aggregation operators under hesitant fuzzy multi-criteria decision making environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000332245500002"}
