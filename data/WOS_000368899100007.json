We show that our extension ATL(sc) is very expressive, but that its decision problems are quite hard: model checking is k-EXPTIME-complete when the formula has k nested strategy quantifiers; satisfiability is undecidable, but we prove that it is decidable when restricting to turn-based games. Our algorithms are obtained through a very convenient translation to QCTL (the computation-tree logic CTL extended with atomic quantification), which we show also applies to Strategy Logic, as well as when strategy quantification ranges over memoryless strategies.
