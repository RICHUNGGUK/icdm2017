The paper outlines two methods of system identification of beam-like reinforced concrete structures representing bridges, through static measurements, in a distributed damage scenario. The first one is similar to the stiffness method, re-cast and the second one to flexibility method. A least square error (LSE) based solution method is used for the estimation of flexural rigidities and damages of simply supported, cantilever and propped cantilever beam from the measured deformation values. The performance of both methods in the presence of measurement errors is demonstrated. An experiment on an un-symmetrically damaged simply supported reinforced concrete beam is used to validate the developed method. A method for damage prognosis is demonstrated using a generalized, indeterminate, propped cantilever beam.", "paper_title": "Identification of reinforced concrete beam-like structures subjected to distributed damage from experimental static measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000253517600003"}
