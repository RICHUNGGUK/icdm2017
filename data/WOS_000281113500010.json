Existing sensor debugging tools like sympathy or EmStar rely heavily on an add-in protocol that generates and reports a large amount of status information from individual sensor nodes, introducing network overhead to the resource constrained and usually traffic-sensitive sensor network. We report our initial attempt at providing a lightweight network diagnosis mechanism for sensor networks. We further propose PAD, a probabilistic diagnosis approach for inferring the root causes of abnormal phenomena. PAD employs a packet marking scheme for efficiently constructing and dynamically maintaining the inference model. Our approach does not incur additional traffic overhead for collecting desired information. Instead, we introduce a probabilistic inference model that encodes internal dependencies among different network elements for online diagnosis of an operational sensor network system. Such a model is capable of additively reasoning root causes based on passively observed symptoms. We implement the PAD prototype in our sea monitoring sensor network test-bed. We also examine the efficiency and scalability of this design through extensive trace-driven simulations.", "paper_title": "Passive Diagnosis for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000281113500010"}
