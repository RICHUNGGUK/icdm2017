Our proposed method offer a substantial simplification in terms of required components to built optical label processing units with enhanced flexibility to accommodate for wavelength tuneability and a large number of labels. We present a performance analysis, comparison with conventional spectral codes recognition methods, based on computer simulation results. We consider a payload bit rate of 40 Gb/s.", "paper_title": "Recognition of spectral amplitude codes by frequency swept coherent detection for flexible optical label switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000281986700004"}
