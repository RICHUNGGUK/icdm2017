We present a method for processing GkNN queries on the broadcast stream. In particular, we propose a novel R-tree variant index structure, called the bit-vector R-tree (bR-tree), which stores additional bit-vector information to describe non-spatial attribute values of the data objects. In addition, each node in the bR-tree stores only one pointer to its children, which makes the bR-tree compact. We generate the broadcast stream by multiplexing the bR-tree and the data objects in the broadcasting channel. The corresponding search algorithm for the broadcast stream is also described. Through a series of comprehensive simulation experiments, we prove the efficiency of the proposed method with regard to energy consumption, latency, and memory requirement, which are the major performance concerns in a wireless broadcasting system. Furthermore, we test the practicality of the proposed method in a real prototype system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
