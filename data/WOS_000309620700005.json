It is known that deciding if a graph is (k, l)-cocolorable is NP-complete. A graph is extended P-4-laden if every induced subgraph with at most six vertices that contains more than two induced P-4's is [2K(2), C-4]-free. Extended P-4-laden graphs generalize cographs, P-4-sparse and P-4-tidy graphs. In this paper, we obtain a linear time algorithm to decide if, given k, l >= 0, an extended P-4-laden graph is (k, l)-cocolorable. Consequently, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to determine the cochromatic number and the split chromatic number of an extended P-4-laden graph. Finally, we present a polynomial time algorithm to find a maximum induced (k, l)-cocolorable subgraph of an extended P-4-laden graph, generalizing the main results of Bravo et al.
