A definition of the solution of semi-linear control systems involving Sobolev space W-T(1,2) is proposed and new existence and uniqueness results of this kind of dynamic systems on time scales are presented under a weaker assumption. According to L-T(2) strong-weak lower semi-continuity of integral functionals, we establish the existence of optimal controls. In particular, the existence for calculus of variations on time scales is derived.", "paper_title": "EXISTENCE FOR CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS AND OPTIMAL CONTROL PROBLEMS ON TIME SCALES", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200027"}
