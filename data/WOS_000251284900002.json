Formation control is an important research within the research field of MRS. Since many researchers use different ways in approaching formation control, we try to give a taxonomy in order to help researchers design formation systems in a systematical way. We can analyze formation structures in two categories: control abstraction and robot distinguishability. The control abstraction can be divided into three layers: formation shape, reference type, and robotic control. Furthermore, robots can be classified as anonymous robots or identification robots depending on whether robots are distinguishable according to their inner states. We use this taxonomy to analyze some ground-based formation systems and to state current challenges of formation control. Such information becomes the design know-how in developing a formation system, and a case study of designing a multi-team formation system is introduced to demonstrate the usefulness of the taxonomy.", "paper_title": "Applying a taxonomy of formation control in developing a robotic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000251284900002"}
