This problem has a variety of applications within data analysis, computational geometry and graph algorithms. In this paper, we abstract a set of steps for building an a\"\" (0)-sampler, based on sampling, recovery and selection. We analyze the implementation of an a\"\" (0)-sampler within this framework, and show how prior constructions of a\"\" (0)-samplers can all be expressed in terms of these steps. Our experimental contribution is to provide a first detailed study of the accuracy and computational cost of a\"\" (0)-samplers.", "paper_title": "A unifying framework for l(0)-sampling algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000336975900002"}
