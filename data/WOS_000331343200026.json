Unlike the conventional marker codings which select marker-bit values deterministically, the AMC adaptively reverses the first and last bits of each marker as well as bits surrounding the marker. Decoding is based on a forward-backward algorithm which takes into account the dependency of bit-values around the marker. Evaluation shows that, for a channel with insertion/deletion error probability 1.8 x 10(-2), the decoded BER of existing marker coding of rate 9/16 is 4.25 x 10(-3), while that of the proposed coding with the same code rate is 1.73 x 10(-3).", "paper_title": "Adaptive Marker Coding for Insertion/Deletion/Substitution Error Correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200026"}
