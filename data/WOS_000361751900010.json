In contrast to the classification-based approaches, we directly formulate the keypoint recognition as an image patch retrieval problem, which enjoys the merit of finding the matched keypoint and its pose simultaneously. To effectively extract the binary features from each patch surrounding the keypoint, we make use of treelets transform that can group the highly correlated data together and reduce the noise through the local analysis. Treelets is a multiresolution analysis tool, which provides an orthogonal basis to reflect the geometry of the noise-free data. To facilitate the real-world applications, we have proposed two novel approaches. One is the convolutional treelets that capture the image patch information locally and globally while reducing the computational cost. The other is the higher-order treelets that reflect the relationship between the rows and columns within image patch. An efficient sub-signature-based locality sensitive hashing scheme is employed for fast approximate nearest neighbor search in patch retrieval. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic data and the real-world Oxford dataset have shown that our proposed treelets binary feature retrieval methods outperform the state-of-the-art feature descriptors and classification-based approaches.", "paper_title": "Treelets Binary Feature Retrieval for Fast Keypoint Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751900010"}
