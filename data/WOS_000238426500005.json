Then, we study the dynamics and convergence of such general FCNs. We prove that any general FCN with constant weight matrix converges to a limit cycle or a static state, or the trajectory of the FCN is not repetitive. We also prove that under certain conditions a discrete state general FCN converges to its limit cycle or static state in O(n) steps, where n is the number of vertices of the FCN. This is in striking contrast with the exponential running time 2(n), which is accepted widely for classic FCNs.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy causal networks: General model, inference, and convergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000238426500005"}
