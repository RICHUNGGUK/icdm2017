Through the observation of real humans, We have identified two patterns of angular momentum that make the transition of such motions efficient. Based on these observations, we propose a new method to concatenate two full-body motions in a natural manner. Our method is useful for applications Where dynamic, full-body motions are required, such as 3D computer games and animations.
