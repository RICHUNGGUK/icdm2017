This study proposes a hyper ellipse method based on mixed integer nonlinear program for classifying datasets. A linearization technique with a number of piecewise line segments is used to treat nonlinear constraints, which aims to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
