With the aim of enabling efficient and effective development of product configuration rns by reusing configuration knowledge, ail ontology-based approach to modeling product configuration knowledge is presented in this paper. The ontology-based product configuration models are hierarchically organized. At the lower level, a configuration meta-model is defined. Based on this meta-model, domain-specific configuration knowledge can be derived by reusing or inheriting the classes or relations in the meta-model. Configuration models are formalized using OWL (Ontology Web Language), an ontology representation language developed by W3C. As a result, configuration models have well-defined semantics due to the logic semantics of OWL, making it possible to automatically detect inconsistencies of configuration knowledge bases. Furthermore, configuration constraints are represented in SWRL, a rule language based on OWL. Finally, actual configuration processes are carried Out using JESS, a rule engine for the Java platform, by mapping OWL-based configuration facts and SWRL-based configuration constraints into JESS facts and JESS rules, respectively. The proposed methodology is illustrated with an example for configuring the ranger drilling machine. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
