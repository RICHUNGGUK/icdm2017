However, it is still a difficult task to capture that perfect shot with your own camera when visiting these places, especially when your camera itself has limitations, such as a limited field of view. In this paper, we propose a framework to overcome the imperfections of personal photographs of tourist sites using the rich information provided by large-scale Internet photo collections. Our method deploys state-of-the-art techniques for constructing initial 3D models from photo collections. The same techniques are then used to register personal photographs to these models, allowing us to augment personal 2D images with 3D information. This strong available scene prior allows us to address a number of traditionally challenging image enhancement techniques and achieve high-quality results using simple and robust algorithms. Specifically, we demonstrate automatic foreground segmentation, mono-to-stereo conversion, field-of-view expansion, photometric enhancement, and additionally automatic annotation with geolocation and tags. Our method clearly demonstrates some possible benefits of employing the rich information contained in online photo databases to efficiently enhance and augment one's own personal photographs.", "paper_title": "Personal Photograph Enhancement Using Internet Photo Collections", "paper_id": "WOS:000333459600009"}
