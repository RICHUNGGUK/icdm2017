With the explicit maintenance of goals, the agent performs reinforcement learning with the awareness of its objectives instead of relying on external reinforcement signals. More importantly, the intention module equips the hybrid architecture with deliberative planning capabilities, enabling the agent to purposefully maintain an agenda of actions to perform and reducing the need of constantly sensing the environment. Through reinforcement learning, plans can also be learned and evaluated without the rigidity of user-defined plans as used in traditional BDI systems. For intention and reinforcement learning to work cooperatively, two strategies are presented for combining the intention module and the reactive learning module for decision making in a real time environment. Our case study based on a minefield navigation domain investigates how the desire and intention modules may cooperatively enhance the capability of a pure reinforcement learner. The empirical results show that the hybrid architecture is able to learn plans efficiently and tap both intentional and reactive action execution to yield a robust performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
