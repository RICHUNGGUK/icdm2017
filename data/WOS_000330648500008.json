The proposed variant of HS algorithm, with complete dynamic harmony memory (named here as DyHS algorithm), is utilized to design two self-adaptive fuzzy controllers, for -direction and -direction movements of a mobile robot. These fuzzy controllers are optimized, both in their structures and free parameters, such that they can guarantee desired stability and simultaneously they can provide satisfactory tracking performance for the vision-based navigation of mobile robots. In addition, the concurrent and preferential combinations of global-search capability, utilizing DyHS algorithm, and Lyapunov theory-based local search method, are employed simultaneously to provide a high degree of automation in the controller design process. The proposed schemes have been implemented in both simulation and real-life experiments. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed design strategy and shows overall comparable performances, when compared with two other competing stochastic optimization algorithms, namely, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization.", "paper_title": "Harmony search-based hybrid stable adaptive fuzzy tracking controllers for vision-based mobile robot navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330648500008"}
