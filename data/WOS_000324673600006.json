For the nominal model without uncertainties, we propose a backstepping-based synchronisation design for heterogenous Lagrangian systems on directed graphs with a spanning tree. We relax earlier constraints on the feedback gain for the distributed synchronisation control law, which encompasses the existing double integrator consensus problem as a special case. We then extend the proposed design to the case without relative velocity measurement. For the uncertain Lagrangian model, we develop a distributed adaptive redesign so that asymptotic synchronisation convergence is achieved in the presence of linearly parameterised model uncertainties. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Backstepping-based synchronisation of uncertain networked Lagrangian systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324673600006"}
