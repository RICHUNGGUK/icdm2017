Our results show that for small number of processors the Multi-Color ILU(0) gives the best performance, while for large number of processors the Multi-Color Block SOR does.", "paper_title": "A comparison of parallel preconditioners for the sparse generalized eigenvalue problems by Rayleigh-quotient minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200039"}
