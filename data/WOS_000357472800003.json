Otherwise, this s-subset of codewords is said to be s (L) -good in X. A binary code X is said to be a list-decoding disjunctive code of strength s and list size L (an s (L) -LD code) if it does not contain s (L) -bad subsets of codewords. We consider a probabilistic generalization of s (L) -LD codes; namely, we say that a code X is an almost disjunctive s (L) -LD code if the fraction of s (L) -good subsets of codewords in X is close to 1. Using the random coding method on the ensemble of binary constant-weight codes, we establish lower bounds on the capacity and error exponent of almost disjunctive s (L) -LD codes. For this ensemble, the obtained lower bounds are tight and show that the capacity of almost disjunctive s (L) -LD codes is greater than the zero-error capacity of disjunctive s (L) -LD codes.", "paper_title": "Almost disjunctive list-decoding codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000357472800003"}
