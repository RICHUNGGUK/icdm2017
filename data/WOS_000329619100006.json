We provide efficient algorithms to solve this problem in two models. In the first model, the input consists of the arrangement of G (1) (resp., G (2)) with a fixed graph cellularly embedded on S; our algorithm is linear in the input complexity, and thus, optimal. In the second model, G (1) and G (2) are piecewise-linear embeddings in the plane, minus a finite set of points; our algorithm runs in O(n (3/2)logn) time, where n is the complexity of the input. The graph isotopy problem is a natural variation of the homotopy problem for closed curves on surfaces and on the punctured plane, for which algorithms have been given by various authors; we use some of these algorithms as a subroutine. As a by-product, we reprove the following mathematical characterization, first observed by Ladegaillerie (Topology 23:303-311, 1984): Two graph embeddings are isotopic if and only if they are homotopic and congruent by an oriented homeomorphism.", "paper_title": "Testing Graph Isotopy on Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000329619100006"}
