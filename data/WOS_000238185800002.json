In this multi-layer MANET, we first propose a password-based authenticated group key exchange scheme with members' different passwords. The proposed scheme only requires constant-round to generate a group session key under the dynamic scenario, hence it is scalable, i.e., the overhead of key generation is independent of the size of a total group. We support the proposed scheme with formal security proof. Namely, our proposed scheme is the first constant-round password-based group key exchange with different passwords for the dynamic setting of MANET.", "paper_title": "Constant-round password-based group key generation for multi-layer ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238185800002"}
