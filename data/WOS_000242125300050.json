To this end, we evolved tail controllers that were combined with two closed-loop wing-beat controllers previously generated, and able to secure straight flight at constant altitude and speed. The corresponding results demonstrate that a wing-beat strategy that consists in continuously adapting the twist of the external wing panel leads to better manoeuvring capabilities than another strategy that adapts the beating amplitude. Such differences suggest that further improvements in flying control should better rely on some sort of automatic incremental evolution procedure than on any hand-designed decomposition of the problem.", "paper_title": "Incremental evolution of target-following neuro-controllers for flapping-wing animats", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125300050"}
