Different from previous back-stepping design, the scheme is on transforming the dynamics into the \"prediction function\". The controller is constructed with high gain observer, while the effect of fault and saturation is compensated by neural networks. For the input saturation, the auxiliary dynamics is included to design the adaptive learning law. The neural weights and filtered tracking error are guaranteed to be bounded via Lyapunov approach. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation of winged-cone model.", "paper_title": "Neural control of hypersonic flight dynamics with actuator fault and constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000358136300007"}
