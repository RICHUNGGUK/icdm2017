The WSNs dynamically access the licensed spectrum owned by the macrocells to provide pervasive sensing services. We formulate the channel assignment problem as a potential game which has at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE). To achieve the NE, we propose a stochastic learning-based algorithm which does not require the information of other players' actions and the time-varying channel. Cluster heads as players in the game act as self-organized learning automata and adjust assignment strategies based on their own action-reward history. The convergence property of the proposed algorithm toward pure strategy NE points is shown theoretically and verified numerically. Simulation results demonstrate that the learning algorithm yields a 26% sensor node capacity improvement as compared to the random selection, and incurs less than 10% capacity loss compared to the exhaustive search.", "paper_title": "Self-Organized Cognitive Sensor Networks: Distributed Channel Assignment for Pervasive Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000333584800001"}
