The parallelized algorithm is characterized by an enhanced scalability that results from a formulation enabling an intermediate analytical solution for the entire row (column) of control volumes. General strategies of applying single- or multigrid approach depending on flow characteristics are discussed. Performance of the parallelized algorithm is studied for up to 2048 processors. The developed approach is applied to analysis of a time-dependent three-dimensional incompressible lid-driven cavity flow. The steady state results of benchmark quality are reported for Re = 10(3), 1.5 x 10(3) and 1.9 x 10(3). A new benchmark case of a fully 3D flow in a cubic cavity driven by the lid moving at 45 relatively to its lateral boundaries is proposed and the corresponding data is reported.
