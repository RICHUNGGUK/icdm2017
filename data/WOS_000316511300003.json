Measurements are based on the use of five custom designed magnetic tooling balls fixed to the periphery of a detachable working plate. Three of these tooling balls define the world reference frame of the robot, and the positions of the centers of all balls are measured on a CMM. A special magnetic cup end-effector is used. Measurements are taken by manually positioning the end-effector over each of the tooling balls, with each of the maximum of four possible robot configurations. Each of these measurements is repeatable to within +/- 0.015 mm. The robot calibration model includes all 12 kinematic parameters, and the calibration method used is based on the linearization of the direct kinematics model in each calibration configuration. The optimal number and location of the tooling balls is obtained by studying the observability index. Finally, an experimental validation at 14 additional tooling balls shows that the maximum position error with respect to the world frame is reduced to 0.080 mm within the entire robot's workspace of 600 mm x 600 mm.
