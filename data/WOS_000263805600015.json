We unite both properties in a single functional equation. The solutions of this functional equation are discussed. Special attention goes to the geometrical construction of these solutions and their characterization in terms of contour lines. Furthermore, it is shown how 'rotating' the arguments of F allows to convert the results into properties for [0,1](2) -> [0,1] functions having monotone partial functions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
