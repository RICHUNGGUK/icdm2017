However, reliable recovery of targets and their trajectories in an uncontrolled environment is affected by a wide range of conditions exhibited by the environment such as sudden illumination changes and clutter. This work addresses the problem of (i) combining information from a set of cues in order to obtain reasonably accurate estimates of multiple targets in uncontrolled environments and (ii) a collection of data association methods for cues containing less information for robust tracking through persistent clutter. Specifically, we introduce a novel geometric template constrained data association method for robust tracking of point features, while using the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) method for blob cue measurements. Extensive experimental validation of the tracking and the data association framework is presented in the work for several real-world outdoor traffic intersection image sequences.
