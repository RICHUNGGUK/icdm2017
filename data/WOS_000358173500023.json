Results: We have developed iTagPlot to compute tag density across functional features in parallel using multicores and a grid engine and to interactively explore it in a graphical user interface. It allows us to stratify features by defining groups based on biological function and measurement, summary statistics and unsupervised clustering.", "paper_title": "iTagPlot: an accurate computation and interactive drawing tool for tag density plot", "paper_id": "WOS:000358173500023"}
