However, it was considered as a method of saving time with more storage spaces. It is suggested in this paper that all frequent item sets of several minimal supports can be stored in a table with a little additional storage, and a representation model is given. Based on this model, the paper systematically discusses the problem of incremental maintenance based on discovered association rules of several minimal supports. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that the approach makes full use of the previous results and reduces the complexity of incremental maintenance algorithms.", "paper_title": "Incremental maintenance of association rules based on multiple previously mined results", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200007"}
