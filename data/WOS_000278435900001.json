By replacing the operational amplifier with a CVM in the feedback loop, current consumption is much reduced. An SM buffer stage that is capable of driving a resistive load with minor degradation in temperature coefficient (TC) and line regulation is also presented. The technique is extended to design a sub-1-V BGR with a TC-cancellation output buffer. All circuits are designed using a 0.35-mu m CMOS process, and experimental results are presented, confirming the analysis.", "paper_title": "CMOS Bandgap References With Self-Biased Symmetrically Matched Current-Voltage Mirror and Extension of Sub-1-V Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000278435900001"}
