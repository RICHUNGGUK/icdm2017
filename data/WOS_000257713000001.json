Yet, despite all the sophistication of the ensuing numerical models, the initial discretization has been for the most part simplistic. Whenever the heterogeneity of the concrete is to be accounted for, a mesh is often manually crafted through the arbitrary inclusion of the particles (aggregates and/or voids) in an ad-hoc manner. This paper develops a mathematical strategy to precisely address this limitation. Algorithms for the random generation and placement of elliptical (2D) or ellipsoid (3D) inclusions, with possibly radiating cracks, in a virtual concrete model are presented. Collision detection algorithms are extensively used.", "paper_title": "Numerical modeling of heterogeneous material", "paper_id": "WOS:000257713000001"}
