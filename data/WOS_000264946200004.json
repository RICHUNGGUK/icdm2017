This family provides a natural and \"continuous\" hybridization of the traditional linear and Leontief utilities and might be useful ill understanding the complexity of computing approximating market equilibria, although Computing an equilibrium in a market with this family of utility functions, this is PPAD-hard in general. In this paper, we present an algorithm for finding an approximate Arrow-Debreu equilibrium when the Leontief components of the market are grouped, finite and well-conditioned. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
