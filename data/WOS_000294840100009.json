In this contribution, we first discuss the way of translating those characterizations to the framework of fuzzy relations. Those new properties depend on t-norms. We focus on two important families of t-norms, namely those that do not admit zero divisors and those that are rotation invariant. For these families, we study whether or not the properties shown for fuzzy relations lead to characterizations of complete fuzzy preorders. Special attention is paid to the minimum operator, which shows the best behaviour in preserving most of the characterizations known for crisp relations.", "paper_title": "On complete fuzzy preorders and their characterizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000294840100009"}
