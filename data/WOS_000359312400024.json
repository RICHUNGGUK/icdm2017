Because of the next generation sequencing revolution, datasets used for conducting phylogenetic analyses grow at an unprecedented pace. We present ExaML version 3, a dedicated production-level code for inferring phylogenies on whole-transcriptome and whole-genome alignments using supercomputers. Results: We introduce several improvements and extensions to ExaML: Extensions of substitution models and supported data types, the integration of a novel load balance algorithm as well as a parallel I/O optimization that significantly improve parallel efficiency, and a production-level implementation for Intel MIC-based hardware platforms.", "paper_title": "ExaML version 3: a tool for phylogenomic analyses on supercomputers", "paper_id": "WOS:000359312400024"}
