As part of a joint project, researchers at Sheffield have recently started generating rigorous machine-verified versions of the Hungarian proofs, so as to demonstrate the soundness of their work. In this paper, we explain the background to the project and demonstrate a first-order proof in Isabelle/HOL of the theorem \"no inertial observer can travel faster than light\". This approach to physical theories and physical computability has several pay-offs, because the precision with which physical theories need to be formalised within automated proof systems forces us to recognise subtly hidden assumptions.", "paper_title": "Using Isabelle/HOL to Verify First-Order Relativity Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000333060100001"}
