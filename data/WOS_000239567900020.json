Our approach is based on a discrete version of Gaussian-Bonnet theorem on piecewise planar manifold meshes and vertex angle deflections that determines local geometric behavior. Based on discrete Gaussian-Bonnet theorem, summation of angle deflections of all vertices is independent of mesh structure and it depends on only the topology of the mesh surface. Based on this result, it can be possible to improve organization of mesh structure of a shape according to its intended geometric structure.", "paper_title": "Insight for practical subdivision modeling with discrete Gauss-Bonnet theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900020"}
