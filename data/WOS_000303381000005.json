There are algorithms for this purpose, but in their current forms, they are not suited for biological neural networks because they rely on a type of communication that is not available in the brain, namely, weight transport-transmitting the strengths, or \"weights,\" of individual synapses to other synapses and neurons. Here we show how optimal control can be learned without weight transport. Our method involves a set of simple mechanisms that can compensate for the absence of weight transport in the brain and so may be useful for neural computation generally.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Optimal Control Without Weight Transport", "paper_id": "WOS:000303381000005"}
