Popular wireless link-layer protocols, such as retransmission (ARQ) based 802.11 and hybrid ARQ methods provide some level of reliability while largely ignoring the latency issue which is critical for real-time applications. Therefore, they suffer from low throughput (under high-error rates) and large waiting-times leading to serious degradation of video playback quality. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for video communication which captures the behavior of real-time video traffic at the wireless link-layer while taking into consideration both reliability and latency conditions. Using this framework, we introduce a delay constraint packet embedded error control (DC-PEEC) protocol for wireless link-layer. DC-PEEC ensures reliable and rapid delivery of video packets by employing various channel codes to minimize fluctuations in throughput and provide timely arrival of video. In addition to theoretically analyzing DC-PEEC, the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed by simulating real-time video communication over \"real\" channel traces collected on 802.11b WLANs using H.264/AVC JM14.0 video codec. The experimental results demonstrate performance gains of 5-10 dB for different real-time video scenarios.", "paper_title": "Delay Constraint Error Control Protocol for Real-Time Video Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000266330900015"}
