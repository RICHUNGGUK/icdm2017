In this paper, a three-dimensional dynamic finite element model is built to evaluate the effects of pulley misalignment. The model consists of a pulley and a segment of V-ribbed belt in contact with the pulley. A material model of belt, including rubber compound and reinforcing cord is developed. Multiple rubber layers are each considered hyperelastic with distinct material characterization parameters. A novel neural-network-based hyperelastic material model is implemented to represent properties of nonlinear elastic belt-rib compound. The models are implemented in the commercial code ABAQUS/Explicit to simulate the misalignment of the belt-pulley system. The developed model is first validated by experimental measurements of pulley lateral force due to misalignment. Also, three common types of misalignment in the belt-pulley system are analyzed and results are presented.", "paper_title": "Finite element analysis of V-ribbed belt/pulley system with pulley misalignment using a neural-network-based material model", "paper_id": "WOS:000270649100008"}
