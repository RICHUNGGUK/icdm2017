The proposed LAQ framework ensures that the computing resources are used in an efficient manner and are not over-or under-utilized by the consumer applications. Service provisioning can only be guaranteed by continuously monitoring the resource and quantifying various QoS metrics, so that services can be delivered in an on-demand basis with certain levels of guarantee. The proposed framework helps in ensuring guarantees with these metrics in order to provide QoS-enabled cloud services. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated with and without LA, and it is shown that the LA-based solution improves the performance of the system in terms of response time and speed up.", "paper_title": "Learning Automata-Based QoS Framework for Cloud IaaS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209724300003"}
