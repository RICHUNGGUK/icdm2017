The features used for speech recognition include pitch, stress, formant frequencies, the Mel frequency coefficient, log frequency coefficient, and the intensity and duration of vowels spoken. This paper presents our study using the Matlab Speech Analysis Toolbox, and highlights how data processing can be automated and results visualised. The proposed algorithm achieved an average success rate of 57.3% in identifying vowels spoken in a speech by the four non-native English speaker groups.", "paper_title": "Speech Feature Extraction and Data Visualisation Vowel recognition and phonology analysis of four Asian ESL accents", "paper_id": "WOS:000365355000003"}
