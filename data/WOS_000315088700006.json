In the inviscid case, one can develop nonlinear Residual Distribution schemes that are nonoscillatory, even in the case of very strong discontinuities, while having the most possible compact stencil, on hybrid unstructured meshes. This paper proposes and compare extensions of these schemes for the convectiondiffusion problem. This methodology, in particular in terms of accuracy, is evaluated on problem with exact solutions. Its nonoscillatory behavior is tested against the Smith and Hutton problem.
