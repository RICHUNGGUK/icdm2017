We derive new bounds on the maximum cardinality of a grain-error-correcting code and propose constructions of codes that correct grain-errors. We demonstrate that a permutation of the classical group codes (e.g., Constantin-Rao codes) can correct a single grain-error. In many cases of interest, our results improve upon the currently best known bounds and constructions. Some of the approaches adopted in the context of grain-errors may have application to related channel models.", "paper_title": "Correcting Grain-Errors in Magnetic Media", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700004"}
