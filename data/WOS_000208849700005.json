It is 3-5 times faster than RC4. In this paper, we show that the NGG stream can be distinguished, with success probability approximate to 97%, from a random stream using only the first keystream word. We also show that the first few kilobytes of the keystream may leak information about the secret key which allows the cryptanalyst to recover the secret key in a very efficient way.", "paper_title": "A new distinguishing and key recovery attack on NGG stream cipher", "paper_id": "WOS:000208849700005"}
