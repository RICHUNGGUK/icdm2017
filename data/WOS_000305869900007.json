Taking into consideration different check-in services required by departing passengers, adjustments to allocations are made according to the maximum allowable wait time and the lowest service counter utilization rate allowed for the initial allocation condition. The developed model was validated for its feasibility and applied at the Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan. The application results showed that dynamic allocation of check-in facilities can both reduce waiting times and increase service counter utilization rates. Such benefits can be further enhanced by dynamic assignment of passengers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
