Version 2.0 is a fundamental re-write of most of the JaxoDraw core and some functionalities, in particular importing graphs, are not backward-compatible with the 1.x branch. The most prominent new features include: drawing of Bezier curves for all particle modes, on-the-fly update of edited objects, multiple undo/redo functionality, the addition of a plugin infrastructure, and a general improved memory performance. A new LaTeX style file is presented that has been written specifically on top of the original axodraw. sty to meet the needs of this new version.

Phys. Comm. 161 (2004) 76 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Existing methods for drawing Feynman diagrams usually require some hard-coding in one or the other programming or scripting language. It is not very convenient and often time consuming, to generate relatively simple diagrams. Solution method: A program is provided that allows for the interactive drawing of Feynman diagrams with a graphical user interface. The program is easy to learn and use, produces high quality output in several formats and runs on any operating system where a Java Runtime Environment is available. Reasons for new version: A variety of new features and bug fixes. Summary of revisions: Major revisions since the last published user guide were versions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 with several minor bug-fix releases in between. Restrictions: To make use of the latex export/preview functionality, a latex style file has to be installed separately. Certain operations (like internal latex compilation, Postscript preview) require the execution of external commands that might not work on untested operating systems. Running time: As an interactive program, the running time depends on the complexity of the diagram to be drawn. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
