Such procedures are applicable to a situation where each of n independent sensors broadcasts the message to be used to estimate the count. A mathematically brilliant solution to this problem, due to Flajolet and Martin (1985) [1], is unfortunately affected by substantial bias and error. In this note we outline an alternative approach, which uses the Flajolet-Martin technique as a preparatory step and substantially reduces both error and bias. Specifically, the standard deviation of the count estimate drops from similar to 110% to similar to 20% of the estimated value. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
