Numerous existing indoor navigation systems have been proposed in order to solve such problems. However, these papers do not adequately examine the effectiveness of the systems in real time trials and are faced with a variety of technical and usability problems. In our paper we present a unique and elegant architecture of an indoor navigation system as an integrated and tested system in real time. This solution enables the localization of the user, as well as the navigation considering scenarios that the user might follow and suggests guidelines for self- navigation. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed architecture we carried out experimental scenarios to prove that the system proposed is suitable enough to guide elderly people through an unknown built environment.
