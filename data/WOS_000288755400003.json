We first develop a novel isotonic routing metric, (RIM)-M-3, considering the influence of interflow and intraflow interference. The isotonicity of the routing metric is proved using virtual network decomposition. Second, in order to ensure QoS, an interference-aware max-min fair bandwidth allocation algorithm, LMX: (MF)-F-3, is proposed where multiple paths (determined by using the routing metric) coexist for each user to the base station. In order to solve the algorithm, we develop an optimization formulation that is modeled as a multicommodity flow problem where the lexicographically largest bandwidth allocation vector is found among all optimal allocation vectors while considering constraints of interference on the flows. We compare our (RIM)-M-3 routing metric and LMX:(MF)-F-3 bandwidth allocation algorithm with various interference-based routing metrics and interference-aware bandwidth allocation algorithms established in the literature. We show that (RIM)-M-3 and LMX: (MF)-F-3 succeed in improving network performance in terms of delay, packet loss ratio, and bandwidth usage.", "paper_title": "Multipath Routing and Max-Min Fair QoS Provisioning under Interference Constraints in Wireless Multihop Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000288755400003"}
