To utilize the limited resources efficiently, a novel event-based mechanism is proposed for the sensor node, such that only selected valuable data are broadcasted to its neighboring sensors via the wireless channel according to whether specific events happen. By resorting to graph theory and utilizing stochastic analysis methods, the filter parameters and the event triggering rules are designed, such that the filtering error converges at an exponential rate in the mean square sense. An adaptive algorithm for determining the triggering threshold is developed, which allows the intelligent sensors to tune the boundary of a local event domain in an online manner, so as to keep the average transmission rate level off a desired value. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.", "paper_title": "Event-Based Distributed Filtering With Stochastic Measurement Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000366141100038"}
