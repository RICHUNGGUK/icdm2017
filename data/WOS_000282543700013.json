To overcome such a limitation for higher TDF coverage, a novel improved launch delay test technique that combines the pros of launch-on-shift and launch-on-capture tests is introduced in this paper. The proposed method can achieve near perfect TDF coverage with fewer test patterns without the need for a global fast scan enable signal. Experimental results on ISCAS89 and ITC99 benchmark circuits are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Improved Launch for Higher TDF Coverage With Fewer Test Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000282543700013"}
