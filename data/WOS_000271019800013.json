Although X-filling techniques are available to reduce the launch cycle switching activity, their performance may not be satisfactory in the linear-decompressor-based test compression environment. This paper solves this problem by proposing a novel integrated automatic test pattern generation scheme that efficiently and effectively performs compressible low-capture-power X-filling. Related theoretical principles are established, based on which the problem size is substantially reduced. The proposed scheme is validated by benchmark circuits, as well as an industry design in the embedded deterministic test environment.", "paper_title": "Power Supply Noise Reduction for At-Speed Scan Testing in Linear-Decompression Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019800013"}
