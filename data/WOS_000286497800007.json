Based on Chinese Remainder Theorem, a new residue-to-binary converter using arbitrary moduli set is proposed. The new converter uses the difference-correction algorithm for the conversion output and eliminates the modulo M operation, where M is the dynamic range of the residue number system. The sizes of the multipliers and modular multipliers in the new converter are small, thereby reducing the area and delay of the proposed converter. Simulation and synthesis results indicate that the new converter is more area-time efficient than the published converters based on Chinese Remainder Theorem.", "paper_title": "Efficient CRT-based residue-to-binary converter for the arbitrary moduli set", "paper_id": "WOS:000286497800007"}
