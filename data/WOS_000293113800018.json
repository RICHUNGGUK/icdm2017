In this paper, an improvement is made to difference expansion technology to make it suitable for two-dimensional (2D) computer-aided design (CAD) engineering graphics. Based on improved difference expansion (IDE), a reversible watermarking scheme for 2D CAD engineering graphics is proposed. First, all vertices of the 2D CAD engineering graphics are extracted, and then the relative coordinates of these vertices are calculated. Finally, the encrypted watermark is embedded into the scale factor of the relative coordinates by using IDE technology. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has a large capacity, good imperceptibility, and is robust against operations such as transformation, rotation, and equal scaling.
