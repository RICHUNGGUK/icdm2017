First, both the data packet dropouts and network-induced delays are taken into account in the synchronization controller design. A Markovian jump process is induced to describe the packet dropouts. The network-induced delays are interval time varying and depend on the Markovian jump modes. A new closed-loop coupled dynamic error system (CDES) with Markovian jump parameters and interval time-varying delays is constructed. Second, using the Kronecker product technique and the stochastic Lyapunov method, a delay-dependent sufficient criterion of stochastic stability is obtained for the closed-loop CDES, which also guarantees that the CDNs are stochastically synchronized. Finally, a simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed result.", "paper_title": "Networked Synchronization Control of Coupled Dynamic Networks With Time-Varying Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000284364400005"}
