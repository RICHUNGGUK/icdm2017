This drug delivery system allows the release of an encapsulated cytotoxic cocktail in a controlled manner under pulsed radio frequency (RF) irradiation. Our effort is focused on the computational aided design of a high affinity bispecific anti-HER2 antibody and an opening mechanism of the carbon nanotube (CNT) based cytotoxic carrier for controlling multiple drug release. We study the main interactions between the antibody and the antigen by a computational scanning mutagenesis approach of trastuzumab and pertuzumab fragment antigen binding (Fab) structures in order to enhance their binding affinity. Then, each Fab fragments is joined by a polypeptide linker which should be stable enough to avoid the \"open form\" of antibody. On the other hand, we also conjugate the engineered antibody to functionalized CNTs (f-CNTs), which encapsulate the inhibitors of the HER2/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. We take advantage of the fact that f-CNT converts the RF radiation absorption into heat release. A pulsed laser at 13.45 MHz increments the temperature around 40 A degrees C for triggering the nano-caps destabilization, which allows the switching of the opening mechanism of the drug carrier. Nano-caps will be a dual pH/temperature responsive in order to take advantage of lysosome characteristic (acidic pH) and heat release from the carrier. Nano-caps are functionalized with organic amide moieties, which hydrolyze quickly at an acidic pH into primary amines, and protonated amines generate repulsion interactions with other charged species, which trigger the cytotoxics release.", "paper_title": "Computational design of a CNT carrier for a high affinity bispecific anti-HER2 antibody based on trastuzumab and pertuzumab Fabs", "paper_id": "WOS:000320954600014"}
