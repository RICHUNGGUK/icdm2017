In this paper, we study uninorms with nilpotent underlying t-norm and t-conorm. We prove that such a uninorm belongs to U-min or U-max. Moreover, some construction methods of uninorms from given t-norm and t-conorm are discussed.", "paper_title": "Single-Point Characterization of Uninorms with Nilpotent Underlying T-Norm and T-Conorm", "paper_id": "WOS:000341300200006"}
