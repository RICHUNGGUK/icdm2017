We recently designed a nitrite reductase (NiR) based on sperm whale Mb by introducing an additional distal histidine (Leu29 to His29 mutation) and generating a distal tyrosine (Phe43 to Tyr43 mutation) in the heme pocket, namely L29H/F43Y Mb, to mimic the active site of cytochrome cd (1) NiR from Ps. aeruginosa that contains two distal histidines and one distal tyrosine. The molecular modeling and dynamics simulation study herein revealed that L29H/F43Y Mb has the necessary structural features of native cytochrome cd (1) NiR and can provide comparable interactions with nitrite as in native NiRs, which provides rationality for the protein design and guides the protein engineering. Additionally, the present study provides an insight into the relatively low NiR activity of Mb in biological systems.", "paper_title": "Rational design of a nitrite reductase based on myoglobin: a molecular modeling and dynamics simulation study", "paper_id": "WOS:000308114000040"}
