The relationship between two-dimensional values induced by these concept classes is studied, one of which is the VC-dimension of the concept class C-N; denoted as VCdim(N), and other is the smallest dimensional of Euclidean spaces into which C-N can be embedded, denoted as Edim(N). As a main result, we show that the two-dimensional values are equal for the Bayesian networks with n <= 4 variables, called the VE-dimension for that Bayesian networks.", "paper_title": "VE dimension induced by Bayesian networks over the boolean domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000344065800009"}
