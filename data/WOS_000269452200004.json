The difference equations describing the cycloconverters' transient and steady-state operating regimes are derived. Theoretical predictions were validated by a computer program which calculated the load current of different cycloconverter topologies using the proposed methodology. The calculated and experimental results are compared and found to be in good agreement.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF GENERIC CYCLOCONVERTER OPERATION WITH INSTANTANEOUS COMMUTATION UNDER TRANSIENT AND STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269452200004"}
