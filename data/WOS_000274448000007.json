An innovative approach which combines high-order schemes and a dual domain decomposition method is presented in this paper and is applied to DNS of multiscale-generated turbulent flows by a fractal grid. These DNS illustrate the applicability of our approach to the simulation of complex turbulent flows and provide results which are compared with recent laboratory experiments thus providing new insights for the interpretation of the experimental measurements.
