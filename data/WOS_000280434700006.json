The newly proposed scheme can be considered as a combination of the hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) and the identity-based multi-recipient encryption scheme (ID-based MRES). However, the purpose and structure of the proposed IHDD scheme are different from those of the HIBE and the ID-based MRES. The proposed IHDD scheme has low computation complexity, in which the decryption operation needs only one bilinear pairing computation, and constant length private keys wherein the length of users' private keys is independent of the hierarchy depth. The security of the proposed scheme is based on the decision bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion assumption without using random oracles.", "paper_title": "Identity-based Hierarchical Designated Decryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000280434700006"}
