In particular, Ladner showed that the satisfiability problem for all logics between K and S4 is PSPACE-hard, while for S5 it is NP-complete. We show that it is negative introspection, the axiom -K-p double right arrow K-K-p, that causes the gap: if we add this axiom to any modal logic between K and S4, then the satisfiability problem becomes NP-complete. Indeed, the satisfiability problem is NP-complete for any modal logic that includes the negative introspection axiom.", "paper_title": "Characterizing the NP-PSPACE gap in the satisfiability problem for modal logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000250086700008"}
