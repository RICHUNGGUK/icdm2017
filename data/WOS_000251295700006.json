Wavelet-based motion-compensated temporal filtering provides the most powerful scheme for scalable video coding and provides high-compression efficiency that competes with the current state of art codecs. However, the delay introduced by the temporal filtering schemes is sometimes very high, which makes them unsuitable for many real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a new temporal filter set to minimize delay in 3-D wavelet-based video coding. The new filter set gives a performance at par with existing longer filters. The length of the filter can vary from two to any number of frames depending on delay requirements. If the frames are processed as separate groups of frames (GOFs), the proposed filter set will not have any boundary effects at the GOF. Experimental results are presented and conclusions are drawn.", "paper_title": "New temporal filtering scheme to reduce delay in wavelet-based video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000251295700006"}
