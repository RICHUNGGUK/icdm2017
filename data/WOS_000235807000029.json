In this paper, we suggest clarifications to use case semantics so that use case modeling can be applied to relate automated systems to business processes and process specifications, particularly in situations where we need to integrate multiple systems in support of a business process. We discuss the original intentions of Ivar Jacobson and UML and we find out that use case specifications, whether written in natural language or as interaction diagrams, are misleading as to what is a use case (instance). We consider then a more natural modeling technique, and establish a relation between a use case, a joint action, and a role.", "paper_title": "Use cases, actions, and roles", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807000029"}
