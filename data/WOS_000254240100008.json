A neural network (NN) is a set of interconnected neurons, in which each neuron is capable of making autonomous arithmetic and geometric calculations. Moreover, each neuron is affected by its surrounding neurons through the structure of the network. This work proposes a new approach that utilizes growing neural gas neural network (GNG NN) techniques to reconstruct a triangular manifold mesh. This method has the advantage of reconstructing the surface of an n-genus freeform object without a priori knowledge regarding the original object, its topology or its shape. The resulting mesh can be improved by extending the MGNG into an adaptive algorithm. The proposed method was also extended for micro-structure modeling. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated on several examples of freeform objects with complex topologies.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional surface reconstruction using meshing growing neural gas (MGNG)", "paper_id": "WOS:000254240100008"}
