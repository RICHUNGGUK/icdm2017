The parallel interface, PyPnetCDF, manages netCDF properties in a similar way to the serial version from ScientificPython, but hiding parallelism to the user. Implementations details and capabilities of the developed interfaces are given. Numerical experiments that show the friendly use of the interfaces and their behaviour compared with the native routines, are presented. (C) 2009 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
