Elderly individuals often live independently because their families cannot look after them. Therefore, computer-assisted nursing has received increasing attention in modern society, explaining why intelligent systems with physiology signal monitoring for e-health care is an emerging area of development, owing to the urgent needs of homecare for elderly people suffering chronic or sudden diseases at home. Importantly, a physiology signal monitoring system can help medical staff to monitor and analyze physiology signal effectively, such that they can not only monitor the patients' physiology states immediately, but also reduce medical cost and avoid having to visit doctors in hospital. Therefore, this study adopts system on chip (SOC) techniques to develop an embedded human pulse monitoring system with intelligent data analysis mechanism for disease detection and long-term health care. The proposed system can be applied to monitor and analyze pulse signal in daily life. The proposed system also has a friendly web-based interface for medical staff to observe immediate pulse signals for remote treatment. Hence, I he proposed system provides aids long-distance medical treatment, exploring trends of potential chronic diseases, and urgent situations informing for sudden diseases. Moreover, this study also presents an intelligent data analysis scheme based on the modified cosine similarity measure to diagnose abnormal pulses for exploring potential chronic diseases.
