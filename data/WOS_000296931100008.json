In this issue of EJIS. Hwang and Schmidt critique Sharma and Yetton's meta-analysis protocol, arguing that a random-effects model should have been employed, rather than the fixed-effect model they used. Further, Hwang and Schmidt claim that the moderating effect hypothesized by Sharma and Yetton is not supported when a random-effects model is employed. We re-analyze Sharma and Yetton's data by employing a dedicated, commercially available package for conducting random-effects meta-analysis. Our analysis finds no support for Hwang and Schmidt's claim. The random-effects meta-analysis supports Sharma and Yetton's original findings: task interdependence moderates the effect of management support on implementation success.
