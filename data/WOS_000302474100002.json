Firstly, the C-IFOWA operator and C-IFOWG operator are developed to aggregate all the values in the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Some of their desirable properties are also studied. Secondly, in order to aggregate a set of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, some new aggregation operators are proposed based on the C-IFOWA operator and C-IFOWG operator. Thirdly, two methods for multiple attribute decision making, in which the attribute values are given in the forms of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are presented. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the practicality and validity of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "SOME CONTINUOUS AGGREGATION OPERATORS WITH INTERVAL-VALUED INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY INFORMATION AND THEIR APPLICATION TO DECISION MAKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000302474100002"}
