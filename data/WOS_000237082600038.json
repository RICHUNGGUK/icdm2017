A weak formulation of hybrid boundary conditions is needed for the problem to be well posed. The boundary conditions are represented by a hybrid automaton with switches between the modes determined by the direction of characteristics of the system at the boundary. The existence of the solution results from the convergence of a Godunov scheme derived in this article. This weak formulation is written explicitly in the context of a strictly concave flux function (relevant for highway traffic). The numerical scheme is then applied to a highway scenario with data from the 1210 highway obtained from the California PeMS system. Finally, the existence of a minimizer of travel time is obtained, with the corresponding optimal boundary control.", "paper_title": "Mixed initial-boundary value problems for scalar conservation laws: Application to the modeling of transportation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082600038"}
