New STEP-NC standard aims at performing high level intelligent NC programming adapted to modern machining issues. The integration of manufacturing level in the numerical chain CAD-CAM-Simulation-CNC allows the implementation of a unique file gathering of all the needed information of a part that is directly machined without post-processing. In this paper, the authors show the new possibilities in terms of the following criteria: integrating simulation and optimization of the machining parameters, providing feedback to CNC controller, allowing modifications of the geometry and machining parameters on the CNC, computing new algorithms for tool-paths generation, adaptation to machine structure and characteristics, etc. A STEP-NC interface has been developed for CNC machine tools. It enables parts machining from a STEP-NC file and integrates several new possibilities and opens the way of intelligent high level programming including the machine model and an adaptation to machining real conditions.
