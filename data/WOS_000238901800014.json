In the presence of variable packet length, it has been found that an originally conformant packet may become non-conformant even transmitted at a constant speed. This non-intuitive phenomenon is referred to as conformance deterioration. After illustrating how conformance deterioration happens, the paper analyzes the probability of conformance deterioration for the single-hop case, both in general and for a special case. The analytical results are enriched by discussions and examples. To further understand the phenomenon, a set of simulations is carried out based on a generic multi-hop network model, for both individual and aggregated traffic flows. Finally, measures to eliminate conformance deterioration are also studied and compared in the paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
