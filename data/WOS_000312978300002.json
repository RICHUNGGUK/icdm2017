With iATA, mobile users can access their valuable data through the network from anywhere and at anytime as if the storage device is attached locally. In the iATA architecture. iATA servers and iATA clients exchange necessary protocol messages over IP networks. This paper proposes an analytical queuing model based on quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) processes to evaluate the performability of an iATA server in a network environment. An exact solution method is developed and presented, however it has state space explosion problem. Therefore, we present a novel computational algorithm to approximate the performance measures. Comparison with numerical results obtained by the exact solution shows that the proposed algorithm is both accurate and fast. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
