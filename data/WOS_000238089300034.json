It is difficult, however, to implement the interactions among the students or/and between the students and the teacher because of the huge volume of multimedia data. This paper presents a framework of the interactive multimedia system for distance learning of higher education with several novel characteristics. First, a hierarchical structure for multimedia system has been proposed to support personalized learning and teaching styles. Second, several feature selection algorithms have been used to support fast video classification and retrieval. Third, a novel asynchronous model has been provided to address the challenges issues of interaction in distance education. We analyze the performance of the system based on a real application of the self-study multimedia web page for the final exam of one university course.", "paper_title": "Interactive multimedia system for distance learning of higher education", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300034"}
