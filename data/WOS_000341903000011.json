Although their functions were subjected to extensive studies in recent years, their evolutionary process remains largely unknown. Here we systematically investigated the homologous genes of the mir-181 family by a sequence similarity search. Representative sequences of the mir-181 gene family were used to reconstruct their evolutionary history. Our results indicated that this family could have derived from multiple duplications, which include two rounds of whole genome duplications and one round of segmental replication. Functional annotation of the target genes of the mir-181 family suggested that this family could participate in some important biological processes including transcriptional and translational regulation, signaling transduction etc. This analysis presented a complex evolutionary dynamics for the origination of a miRNA gene family.
