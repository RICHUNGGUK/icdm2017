In each sequentially designed experiment the approach selects new materials and formulation ratios through an optimization based on mixture-property partial least square WLS) models that account for similarities among the properties of different materials (Muteki et al. [1,2]). The approach is useful for the case where one has existing experiments some of which may not be too far from those required for the desired new product. The sequential DOE methodology is demonstrated on an industrial polymer blending problem.
