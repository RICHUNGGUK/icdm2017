One of the new ideas to cope with this problem is to use the multilayer multistage interconnection networks (MLMINs). On the other hand, another critical parameter to prove the performance of most systems is reliability. Therefore, in this paper, our focus is to formulate the reliability equations on MLMINs to achieve two objectives: First, development of analytical methods using reliability equations to present an exact solution for computing the reliability of MLMINs, second, preparing a basis for calculating the optimal values for topological parameters of MLMINs (, and ) in terms of reliability.", "paper_title": "Formulating broadcast reliability equations on multilayer multistage interconnection networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000363723100003"}
