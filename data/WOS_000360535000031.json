However, these emerging SSD arrays are facing enormous challenges, which are not observed in disk-based arrays. Specif cally, we observe that the performance of SSD arrays can signif cantly degrade due to various array-level resource contentions. In addition, their maintenance costs exponentially increase over time, which renders them diff cult to deploy widely in HPC systems. To address these challenges, we propose Triple-A, a non-SSD based Autonomic All-Flash Array, which is a self-optimizing, from-scratch NAND f ash cluster. Triple-A can detect two different types of resource contentions and autonomically alleviate them by reshaping the physical data-layout on its f ash array network. Our experimental evaluation using both real workloads and a micro-benchmark show that Triple-A can offer a 53% higher sustained throughput and a 80% lower I/O latency than non-autonomic SSD arrays.", "paper_title": "Triple-A: A Non-SSD Based Autonomic All-Flash Array for High Performance Storage Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000360535000031"}
