Observing a one-to-one correspondence between an OOSPC and a certain combinatorial subject, called a packing design, we present a construction of optimal OOSPCs with weight 4 and maximum collision parameter 2, which generalizes a well-known Kohler construction of optimal optical orthogonal codes (OOC) with weight 4 and maximum collision parameter 2. Using this new construction enables one to obtain infinitely many optimal OOSPCs, whose existence was previously unknown. We prove that for a multiple n of 4, there exists no optimal OOSPC of size G x n with weight 4 and maximum collision parameter 2, together with a report which shows a gap between optimal OOCs and optimal OOSPCs G when n and are not coprime. We also present a recursive construction of OOSPCs which are asymptotically optimal with respect to the Johnson bound. As a by-product, we obtain an asymptotically optimal (m, n, 4, 2)-OOSPC for all positive integers m and n.", "paper_title": "Optical Orthogonal Signature Pattern Codes With Maximum Collision Parameter 2 and Weight 4", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000046"}
