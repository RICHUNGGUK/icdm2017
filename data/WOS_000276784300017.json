We use the slenderness of the layer to develop a fast and accurate 'hybrid' numerical method that incorporates a separate, singular perturbation analysis of the dynamics in the transition layer into a full numerical solution of the interfacial free boundary problem The accuracy and efficiency of the method is assessed by comparison with a more 'traditional' numerical approach that uses finite differences on a curvilinear coordinate system exterior to the bubble, without the separate transition layer reduction The traditional method implemented here features a novel fast calculation of fluid velocity off the interface (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved", "paper_title": "A hybrid numerical method for interfacial fluid flow with soluble surfactant", "paper_id": "WOS:000276784300017"}
