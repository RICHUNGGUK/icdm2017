The CSB topology can reduce the resonator loss caused by MOSFET resistance. Meanwhile, it can maintain the benefits of conventional switched biasing technique. The source-body resistors are utilized to reduce the noise contribution of the substrate related to the cross coupled MOSFETs. The proposed QVCO has been implemented in standard 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. With the two methods mentioned above, it consumes 4.9 mW under 1 V voltage supply and achieves a phase noise of -120.3 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset from the carrier of 4.56 GHz. The figure of merit is 186.5 dBc/Hz and the tuning range is from 4.2 G to 5 GHz (17.3 %). When the QVCO operates at 0.8 V voltage supply, the power consumption is 2.88 mW and the phase noise is -115.7 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset from the carrier of 4.58 GHz.", "paper_title": "A 4.6 GHz cascade switched biasing LC-QVCO using source-body resistor", "paper_id": "WOS:000327321000021"}
