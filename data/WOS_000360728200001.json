Intermittent connectivity has become a thorny problem in VANETs, which causes unreliable vehicle to vehicle (V2V) connection due to high vehicle mobility. In this paper, we have studied the network connectivity using a stochastic analysis model and then we prove average intervehicle distance influences VANET connectivity greatly. Based on our analysis, we propose a connectivity-sensed routing protocol (CSR) for VANETs in urban scenario. CSR utilizes vehicle distribution information collected by intersection infrastructure to help vehicles select a road not only with progress to destination but also with better network connectivity. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that the CSR protocol achieves much lower end-to-end delay, higher delivery rate, and higher throughput than traditional routing protocols.", "paper_title": "Connectivity-Sensed Routing Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks: Analysis and Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000360728200001"}
