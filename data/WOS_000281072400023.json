The framework including syntax, architecture and security model is presented. Randomness reusing and cipher text aggregation are used to reduce the computation and transmission overheads on the sender node. A parallel multi-recipient scheme called ParaSC-GDH is proposed also, which is semantic secure. When n messages are processed with ParaSC-GDH on the N cores (threads) system, the theoretic speedup is up to N and the communication overheads is (4n+3)/7n of traditional ways. An experiment result shows that, the improvement of CPU time and cipher text size are 48.6% and 42.8% when it processes 1,000 distinct messages. As the number of recipients growing, the improvements increase also.", "paper_title": "PARALLEL MULTI-RECIPIENT SIGNCRYPTION FOR IMBALANCED WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400023"}
