We use the maximum likelihood method to obtain the point estimation of the parameter of failure time distribution. We provide an approach to establish reliability sampling plans which minimize the total cost of life testing under given consumer's and producer's risks. Some numerical studies are investigated to illustrate the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Reliability sampling plans under progressive type-I interval censoring using cost functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258996200004"}
