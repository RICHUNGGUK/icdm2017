The proposed algorithm is based on a reference-free formulation, using both rectangular and polar coordinates for branch current phasor measurements, and alleviates any numerical problems encountered during initialization stage of the state estimation algorithm. Analytical equations are provided for the conventional and the phasor measurements and their corresponding partial derivatives with respect to state variables. The proposed algorithm is tested with a seven bus system and is compared with the traditional state estimator. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves the precision greatly and gets better behavior as compared with the traditional state estimator. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
