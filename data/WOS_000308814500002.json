Due to the multi signal character, this scheme combines the chaotic signal transmission with the MIMO channel technique in a wireless environment, which is different from the traditional chaotic communication frameworks. From a practical perspective, an outline of modulation, channel model, demodulation and non-coherent detection is investigated. Furthermore, system performance is evaluated by simulations, and improvements on this scheme are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A new scheme of digital communication using chaotic signals in MIMO channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000308814500002"}
