The extension is established by introducing piecewise or multiple discretization parameters in GBT. Several simulation examples are given to show effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "AN EXTENSION OF GENERALIZED BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION FOR DIGITAL REDESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161100014"}
