The approach combines an enhanced version of the Gradient Network 2, with common region-growing approaches used as pre-segmentation steps. The GNM2 is an post-segmentation procedure based on graph analysis of global color and luminosity gradients in conjunction with a segmentation algorithm to produce a reliable segmentation result. The approach was automatically evaluated using a close/open world approach. Two different region-growing segmentation methods, CSC and Mumford and Shah with and without the GNM post-processing were compared against ground truth images using segmentation evaluation indices Rand and Bipartite Graph Matching. These results were also confronted with other well established segmentation methods (RHSEG, Watershed, EDISON, JSEG and Blobworld). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
