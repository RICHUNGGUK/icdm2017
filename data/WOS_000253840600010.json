However, the huge datasets involved makes this approach impractical on traditional computer architectures leading to prohibitively long runtimes. In this paper, we present a new computational grid architecture based on a hybrid computing model to significantly accelerate comparative genomics applications. The hybrid computing model consists of two types of parallelism: coarse grained and fine grained. The coarse-grained parallelism uses a volunteer computing infrastructure for job distribution, while the fine-grained parallelism uses commodity computer graphics hardware for fast sequence alignment. We present the deployment and evaluation of this approach on our grid test bed for the all-against-all comparison of micro-bial genomes. The results of this comparison are then used by phenotype-genotype explorer (PheGee). PheGee is a new tool that nominates candidate genes responsible for a given phenotype.", "paper_title": "A hybrid computational grid architecture for comparative genomics", "paper_id": "WOS:000253840600010"}
