The proposed algorithm learns patterns from known genetic interactions, such as RT-PCR confirmed gene pairs, and tunes the parameters using particle swarm optimization algorithm. This work also incorporates a score function to separate significant predictions from non-significant ones. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method applied to data sets in Spellman et al. (1998) is as high as 91%, and true-positive rate and false-negative rate are about 61% and 1%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed algorithm may be useful for inferring genetic interactions.", "paper_title": "A hybrid algorithm to infer genetic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100118"}
