However, these kinds of platforms have limitations to adapt themselves to new and unknown devices. In this work we analyze the challenge of component or bundle communication by using the Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) technology and we propose three mechanisms with the aim of contributing to flexible component communication: Common Service, Specific Service and WSIF Web Service Invocation. We provide these solutions with some architectural models and validate them through different example services. Finally we compare them regarding performance, flexibility and application complexity.", "paper_title": "Flexible Service Composition Based on Bundle Communication in OSGi", "paper_id": "WOS:000300519400007"}
