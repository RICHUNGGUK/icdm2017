Instead, styles could be studied in terms of modal relationships between the features to provide a basis for definitions of structure in generative models. Modal relationships are more flexible and robust under the dynamic conditions of the artist's creative process. This article illustrates through the examples of Seljuk and Celtic patterns how these modal relationships emerge, why they are essential to detailed descriptions of style, and how they might be identified.", "paper_title": "Modal relationships as stylistic features: Examples from Seljuk and Celtic patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000239672100014"}
