The goal of a streaming application is to enable the successful decoding of each video object before its displaying deadline is violated. Hence, we define the main performance metric of a streaming system as the probability of un-interrupted video presentation, or jitter-free probability. Previous literature has described solutions to estimate the jitter-free probability by assuming either independence in the encoded data process or simplistic channel models. In this work, we present a novel analytical framework, which requires only some basic statistical information of an arbitrary VBR channel, to bound the probability of jitter-free playout under the constraint of initial playout delay and receiver buffer size. Both the infinite and finite buffer cases are considered. This technique is then applied to investigate streaming over a wireless system modeled by an extended Gilbert channel with ARQ transmission control. Experimental results with MPEG-4 VBR encoded video demonstrates that the proposed analysis derives close bounds to the actual system performance. Finally, we show that the proposed analysis provides a theoretical foundation to quantify the tradeoffs between the initial playout delay, the receiver buffer size, and the jitter-free probability for a general class of VBR streaming over random VBR channels.", "paper_title": "Effect of Delay and Buffering on Jitter-Free Streaming Over Random VBR Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000260862600016"}
