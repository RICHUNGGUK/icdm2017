Methods from statistical physics suggest that the problem is easy if c < e. This work starts with a rigorous explanation for this claim based on the refined analysis of the Karp-Sipser algorithm by Aronson et al. (1998) [1]. Subsequently, theoretical supplements are given to experimental studies of search heuristics on random graphs. For c < 1, an iterated local search heuristic finds an optimal cover in polynomial time with a probability arbitrarily close to 1. This behavior relies on the absence of a giant component. As an additional insight into the randomized search, it is shown that the heuristic fails badly also on graphs consisting of a single tree component of maximum degree 3. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
