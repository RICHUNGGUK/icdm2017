We express error bounds for imperfect l(1)-recovery in terms of the characteristics underlying these conditions. These characteristics, although difficult to evaluate, lead to verifiable sufficient conditions for exact sparse l(1)-recovery and thus efficiently computable upper bounds on those s for which a given sensing matrix is s-semigood. We examine the properties of proposed verifiable sufficient conditions, describe their limits of performance and provide numerical examples comparing them with other verifiable conditions from the literature.", "paper_title": "Verifiable conditions of l(1)-recovery for sparse signals with sign restrictions", "paper_id": "WOS:000288371400005"}
