Recently, the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic computing has been proposed as a methodology to aggregate fuzzy opinions (Herrera & Martinez, 2000a, 2000b), for example, in the evaluation of new product development performance (Wang, 2009) and in customer satisfactory level survey analysis (Lin & Lee, 2009). The 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach has the advantage of avoiding information loss that can potentially occur when combining opinions of experts. Given the fuzzy ratings of the evaluators, the computation procedure used in both Wang (2009) and Lin and Lee (2009) returned a single crisp value as an output, representing the average judgment of those evaluators. In this article, we take an alternative view that the result of aggregating fuzzy ratings should be fuzzy itself, and therefore we further develop the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic methodology so that its output is a fuzzy number describing the aggregation of opinions. We demonstrate the utility of the extended fuzzy linguistic computing methodology by applying it to two data sets: (i) the evaluation of a new product idea in a Taiwanese electronics manufacturing firm and (ii) the evaluation of the investment benefit of a proposed facility site.
