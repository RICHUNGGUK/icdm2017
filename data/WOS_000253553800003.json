The proposed method considers both packet importance as well as delay constraints. One of the advantages of a fuzzy controller is the fact that, regardless of the design complexity, it can be implemented as a simple look-up table. This makes it ideal for high-speed optical switches. We have used two fuzzy controllers: one to select a packet to be forwarded to an output port and another to decide which packet(s) should be buffered or dropped. In a simulation example, video traffic with three priority classes is considered. The results show up to 3 dBs of improvement in the quality of the received video, resulting from the packet loss differentiation achieved by employing the proposed fuzzy packet scheduling approach.
