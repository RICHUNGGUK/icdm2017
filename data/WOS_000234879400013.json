In a classifier system, the bucket brigade algorithm is used to solve the problem of credit assignment, which is a critical problem in the field of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a new approach to fuzzy classifier systems and a neuro-fuzzy system referred to as ACSNFIS to implement the proposed fuzzy classifier system. The proposed system is tested by the balancing problem of a cart pole and the back-driving problem of a truck to demonstrate its performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
