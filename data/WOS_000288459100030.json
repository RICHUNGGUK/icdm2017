A single-letter achievable rate-region is derived; it enlarges the best known rate-region for multiple descriptions without feed-forward. The proof of the result uses a block-Markov superposition source coding strategy. In point-to-point source coding, feed-forward does not decrease the rate-distortion function of an i.i.d. source. In contrast, an example is provided to show that the derived region can be strictly larger than the optimal multiple description rate-distortion region without feed-forward.", "paper_title": "Achievable Rates for Multiple Descriptions With Feed-Forward", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459100030"}
