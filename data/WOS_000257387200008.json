The algorithm is based on using the Discrete Wavelet Transform domain to embed digital data into images. In order to increase the algorithm robustness and ensure the authentication of the data extracted, error detection/correction coding techniques are used to encode the embedded data. The proposed algorithm is blind, i.e., the embedded data are extracted and authenticated without any reference to the original image or data. Experimental results demonstrate the low perceptibility of distortions caused by the data embedding and the high algorithm robustness against several common image-processing operations.", "paper_title": "A wavelet-based blind image data embedding algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000257387200008"}
