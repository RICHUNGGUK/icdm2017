The three models include: Expectation-Confirmation Model in IT Domain (ECM-IT), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and a hybrid model integrating TAM and ECM-IT (extended ECM-IT). Based on a survey of 1826 mobile Internet users, the LISREL analysis shows that all three models meet the various goodness-of-fit criteria. When compared using special indices for differentiating among alternative good models, TAM has the best fit to the data followed by ECM-IT, and the extended ECM-IT. In terms of variance explained for intention to continue IT usage, the extended ECM-IT has the highest R-2 (67%) followed by TAM (63%), and ECM-IT (50%). We conclude that TAM is the most parsimonious and generic model that can be used to study both initial and continued IT adoption; the extended ECM-IT explains continued IT usage behavior as well as TAM; and both the ECM-IT and extended ECM-IT models provide additional information to increase our understanding of continued IT usage.
