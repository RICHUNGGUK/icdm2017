The statistic is an unweighted sum of squares (USS) of the kernel smoothed model residuals. We develop expressions for the moments of this statistic and create a standardized statistic with hypothesized asymptotic standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis that the model is correctly specified. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory adherence to Type I error rates of the Kernel smoothed USS statistic in a variety of likely data settings. Finally, we discuss issues of bandwidth selection for using our proposed statistic in practice and illustrate its use in an example. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
