It imposes the requirement that the dependency between non-deterministic events needs to be known for nodes. The dependency information is disseminated through messages. A central problem in traditional causal message logging is that if the message logging progress of nodes cannot be effectively tracked, some redundant dependency information will be piggybacked on the messages. In this paper, a dependency mining based approach is proposed. It tries to detect the message logging progress of nodes only from the dependency between non-deterministic events, without needing to piggyback an additional dependency vector or dependency matrix on each message.
