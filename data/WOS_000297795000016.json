In this paper, we propose a novel biometric image hiding approach based on the content correlation analysis to protect the network-based transmitted image. By using principal component analysis (PCA), the content correlation between the biometric image and the cover image is firstly analyzed. Then based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, some regions of the cover image are selected to represent the biometric image, in which the cover image can carry partial content of the biometric image. As a result of the correlation analysis, the unrepresented part of the biometric image is embedded into the cover image by using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Combined with human visual system (HVS) model, this approach makes the hiding result perceptually invisible. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hiding approach is robust against some common frequency and geometric attacks; it also provides an effective protection for the secure biometric verification.", "paper_title": "Content-based Image Hiding Method for Secure Network Biometric Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000297795000016"}
