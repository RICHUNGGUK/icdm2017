A new switching local evolutionary PSO (SLEPSO) is developed and analyzed. The velocity updating equation jumps from one mode to another based on the non-homogeneous Markov chain, where the probability transition matrix is updated by calculating the diversity and current optimal solution. Furthermore, DE mutation and crossover operations are implemented to improve local best particles searching in PSO. Compared with some well-known PSO algorithms, the experiments results show the superiority of proposed SLEPSO. Finally, the new SLEPSO is successfully exploited to quantification analysis of the LFIA system, which is essentially nonlinear and dynamic. Therefore, this can provide a new method for the area of quantitative interpretation of LFIA system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
