In this paper, a generalized Dijkstra algorithm is proposed to handle SPP in an uncertain environment. Two key issues need to be addressed in SPP with fuzzy parameters. One is how to determine the addition of two edges. The other is how to compare the distance between two different paths with their edge lengths represented by fuzzy numbers. To solve these problems, the graded mean integration representation of fuzzy numbers is adopted to improve the classical Dijkstra algorithm. A numerical example of a transportation network is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
