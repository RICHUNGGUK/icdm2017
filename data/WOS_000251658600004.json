Each method has advantages and shortcomings of its own and is best applied in specific situations. Hybrid approaches use elements of both methods to improve performance and overcome shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach based on content-based and collaborative filtering, implemented in MoRe, a movie recommendation system. We also provide empirical comparison of the hybrid approach to the base methods of collaborative and content-based filtering and draw useful conclusions upon their performance.", "paper_title": "A hybrid approach for movie recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000251658600004"}
