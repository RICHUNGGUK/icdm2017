The basic idea of the model is to reduce the poor estimations of the gas velocity and droplets/gas relative velocity obtained with the standard 3D-CFD Eulerian-Lagrangian spray model, when coarse meshes are used. The coupling has been achieved in the calculation of the momentum source interaction term. General considerations, descriptions and implementation of the model in a commercial CFD code are outlined. Diesel spray simulations performed using the proposed approach have been compared with those obtained with the standard 3D-CFD, 1D models and experimental data. Encouraging results were found in terms of spray evolution when changing meshes and ambient conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
