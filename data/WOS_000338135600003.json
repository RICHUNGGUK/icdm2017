Akin to the fact that a register file is accessed more frequently than any other architectural component, register file protection is imperative to obstruct errors from propagating throughout a computing system. Furthermore, negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) has emerged as a major concern due to its negative impact on the lifetime of pMOS devices. Indeed, many of the pMOS transistors most affected by NBTI are in the register files as they are implemented as SRAM, which are particularly vulnerable due to their small structure size. Based on our observation that some register bits are not continuously used to represent a value stored in a register, we present a technique that exploits unused bits to improve the register file immunity against soft errors and mitigate NBTI effects. We show that our technique can reduce, on average, the register file vulnerability against multiple bit upsets by 97% (up to 100%), resulting in a high system fault coverage under various scenarios, while consuming less power and still occupying a similar area footprint compared to protecting the register file against single bit upsets (SBUs) only. The achieved result is 63% better compared to the state-of-the-art in register file protection. To compare and quantify the effect of our technique, we observe its impact on the processor's temperature using an infrared thermal camera and show that, due to consuming less power per area, our technique also operates at a lower temperature compared to protecting the register file against SBUs only. Finally, we investigate how our technique additionally moderates the stress induced by NBTI in register file SRAM cells.", "paper_title": "RESI: Register-Embedded Self-Immunity for Reliability Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000338135600003"}
