However, hardware constraints have limited their application, and real deployments have demonstrated that WSNs have difficulties in coping with complex communication tasks such as mobility in addition to application-related tasks. Mobility support in WSNs is crucial for a very high percentage of application scenarios and, most notably, for the Internet of Things. It is, thus, important to know the existing solutions for mobility in WSNs, identifying their main characteristics and limitations. With this in mind, we firstly present a survey of models for mobility support in WSNs. We then present the Network of Proxies (NoP) assisted mobility proposal, which relieves resource-constrained WSN nodes from the heavy procedures inherent to mobility management. The presented proposal was implemented and evaluated in a real platform, demonstrating not only its advantages over conventional solutions, but also its very good performance in the simultaneous handling of several mobile nodes, leading to high handoff success rate and low handoff time.
