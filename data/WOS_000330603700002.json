Also, we presented the following double inequality 1/2 + 5/12n(1+1/5/n+1/50/n(2)) / n + 1 < H-n - ln n - gamma < 1/2 + 5/12n(1+1/5/n) / n + 1; n = 1, 2, 3, ... , which improved some known inequalities of the sequence H-n - ln n - gamma.", "paper_title": "On quicker convergence towards Ruler's constant", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603700002"}
