In contrast, the model is also supposed to actualize high predictive quality in order to confirm the process safety and attractive working framework allowing the user to grasp how the particular task is settled. A holistic concept of a fully data-driven modeling tool namely Generic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (GENEFIS) is proposed in this paper. The major spotlight of GENEFIS is in delivering a sensible tradeoff between high predictive accuracy and parsimonious rule base while reckoning tractable rule semantics. The viability of GENEFIS is numerically validated via a series of experimentations using real world and artificial datasets and is compared against state of the art of the evolving neuro-fuzzy systems (ENFSs), where GENEFIS not only showcases higher predictive accuracies but also lands on more frugal structures than other algorithms.", "paper_title": "GENEFIS: Toward an Effective Localist Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000337128900007"}
