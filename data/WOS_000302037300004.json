The vehicle model used here allows for three-dimensional movement and represents a wide range of vehicles. The algorithm works in conjunction with any desired controller to guarantee all vehicles remain free of collisions while attempting to follow their desired control. This algorithm is reactive and distributed, making it well suited for real time applications, and explicitly accounts for actuation limits. A robustness analysis is presented which provides a means to account for delays and unmodeled dynamics. Robustness to an adversarial vehicle is also presented. Results are demonstrated in simulation.", "paper_title": "Distributed reactive collision avoidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000302037300004"}
