This advantage also makes it harder to maintain good yield. Diagnostics and redundancy repair methodologies thus are getting more and more important for memories, including embedded ones that are popular in system chips. In this paper, we propose an efficient memory diagnosis and repair scheme based on fail-pattern identification. The proposed diagnosis scheme can distinguish among row, column, and word faults, and subsequently apply the Huffman compression method for fault syndrome compression. This approach reduces the amount of data that need to be transmitted from the chip under test to the automatic test equipment (ATE) without losing fault information. It also simplifies the analysis that has to be performed on the ATE. The proposed redundancy repair scheme is assisted by fail-pattern identification approach and a flexible redundancy structure. The area overhead for our built-in self-repair (BISR) design is reasonable. Our repair scheme uses less redundancy than other redundancy schemes under the same repair rate requirement. Experimental results show that the area overhead of the BISR design is only 4.1% for an 8 K x 64 memory and is in inverse proportion to the memory size.", "paper_title": "A Built-in Self-Diagnosis and Repair Design With Fail Pattern Identification for Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000296459300005"}
