It is well known that the standard backstepping design may suffer from '' explosion of terms ''. To overcome this problem, the recently developed dynamic surface control technique which employs a first- order low- pass filter at each step of the backstepping design procedure is generalized to the nonlinear system under study. Our attention is paid to achieve guaranteed transient performance of the adaptive controller. At each step of design, a feedback controller strengthened by nonlinear damping terms to counteract nonlinear uncertainties is designed to guarantee input- to- state practical stability of the corresponding subsystem, and then parameter adaptations are introduced to reduce the ultimate error bound. Furthermore, for the output trajectory tracking problem, it is recommended to adopt the partial adaptation policy to reduce the computational burden due to '' curse of dimension '' of the RBF networks. Finally, numerical examples are included to verify the results of theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Dynamic surface control approach to adaptive robust control of nonlinear systems in semi-strict feedback form", "paper_id": "WOS:000249695500003"}
