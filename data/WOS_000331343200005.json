But, in embedded systems, an amount of resources are limited and the reduction of resource utilization of the control task is an important issue. Recently, much attention has been paid to a self-triggered controller, which updates control inputs aperiodically. A control task by which the self-triggered controller is implemented skips the release of jobs if the degradation of control performances by the skipping can be allowed. Each job computes not only the updated control inputs but also the next update instant and the control task is in the sleep state until the instant. Thus the resource utilization is reduced. In this paper, we consider self-triggered predictive control (stPC) of mixed logical dynamical (MLD) systems. We introduce a binary variable which determines whether the control inputs are updated or not. Then, we formulate an stPC problem of mixed logical dynamical systems, where activation costs are time-dependent to represent the preference of activations of the control task. Both the control inputs and the next update instant are computed by solving a mixed integer programming problem. The proposed stPC can reduce the number of updates with guaranteeing stability of the controlled system.", "paper_title": "Self-Triggered Predictive Control with Time-Dependent Activation Costs of Mixed Logical Dynamical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200005"}
