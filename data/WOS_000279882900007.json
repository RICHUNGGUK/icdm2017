An orthogonal set of discriminant vectors is more powerful than the classical discriminant vectors. In this paper, we present a new orthogonal linear discriminant analysis (OLDA) model based on least-squares approximation called LS-OLDA for pattern classification, which aims to find an orthogonal transformation W and a diagonal matrix D such that the difference between S(w)(-1)S(b) and WDW(T) is minimized in the least-squares sense, and the trace of D is maximized simultaneously. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed model coincides with classical OLDA criterion. The experimental results on different standard data sets compared with related methods show that LS-OLDA achieves or approximates closely to the best accuracy, and has lower computational cost.", "paper_title": "A LEAST-SQUARES MODEL TO ORTHOGONAL LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279882900007"}
