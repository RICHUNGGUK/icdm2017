It is shown that the resulting filtering error system is globally stable with guaranteed H-infinity or generalized H-2 performance and the filter gains can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Two simulation examples are also given to illustrate the performance of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Approaches to robust filtering design of discrete time fuzzy dynamic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500006"}
