The formulation is based on the Hellinger-Reissner principle with independent descriptions of the stress and displacement fields. The kinematics is constituted by a rigid section motion and non uniform out-of-plane warpings related to shear and torsion. The stress field is built on the basis of the Saint-Venant (SV) solution and with a new part to describe the variable warping. The formulation of a finite element with exact shape functions made possible to validate the beam model avoiding discretization errors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
