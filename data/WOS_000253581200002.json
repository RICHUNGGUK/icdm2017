In the causal equations of events, peace is a \"trivial solution\" that becomes lost, like a needle in a haystack, among war-bound \"general solutions.\" To find peace, we propose two routes. The first and perhaps preferred option is to leave the Darwinian universe of conflict and attempt to lay out our problems in a different setting in which the ruling principle is concord rather than conflict. The second path is to salvage peace from its triviality by compromising its purity and moving into a universe that redefines concord and conflict in a fuzzy way. We will show that the first approach (that we call transcendental) and the second track (that we call pragmatic) can overlap to define a realistic \"Pathway to Peace.\" The transcendental approach provides boundary conditions without which the generation of pragmatic rules becomes too complex and confusing. We have used the universal laws of thermodynamics as a framework to understand the nature of conflict and to bridge between the hard and soft sciences. To this framework, we have added some fuzzy rules to pave the passage where transcendental and pragmatic realms of peace-making overlap. Though unity and equal relationships are underlying moral themes in conflict resolution, we show that peace cannot and should not be achieved by compromising diversity.", "paper_title": "War, peace, and fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000253581200002"}
