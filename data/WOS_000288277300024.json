Here, we introduce a new web-tool Phylopro (http://compsysbio.org/phylopro/), which uses the 120 available eukaryotic genome sequences to visualize the evolutionary trajectories of user-defined subsets of model organism genes. Applied to pathways or complexes, PhyloPro allows the user to rapidly identify core conserved elements of biological processes together with those that may represent lineage-specific innovations. PhyloPro thus provides a valuable resource for the evolutionary and comparative studies of biological systems.
