Independently of the image spatial dimension (one-dimensional signal, image, volume of images, etc.), we reformulate these filters as integral operators defined in a one-dimensional space corresponding to the level sets measures. We prove the equivalence between the usual pixel-based version and the rearranged version of the filter. When restricted to the discrete setting, our reformulation of bilateral filters extends previous results for the so-called fast bilateral filtering. We, in addition, prove that the solution of the discrete setting, understood as constant-wise interpolators, converges to the solution of the continuous setting. Finally, we numerically illustrate computational aspects concerning quality approximation and execution time provided by the rearranged formulation.", "paper_title": "On a Fast Bilateral Filtering Formulation Using Functional Rearrangements", "paper_id": "WOS:000361490000007"}
