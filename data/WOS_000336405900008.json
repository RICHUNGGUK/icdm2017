It is widely used within computational linguistics and natural language processing, but surprisingly little in other areas. TBL is a simple yet flexible paradigm, which achieves competitive or even state-of-the-art performance in several areas and does not overtrain easily. It is especially successful at catching local, fixed-distance dependencies and seamlessly exploits information from heterogeneous discrete feature types. The learned representation-an ordered list of transformation rules-is compact and efficient, with clear semantics. Individual rules are interpretable and often meaningful to humans. The present article offers a survey of the most important theoretical work on TBL, addressing a perceived gap in the literature. Because the method should be useful also outside the world of computational linguistics and natural language processing, a chief aim is to provide an informal but relatively comprehensive introduction, readable also by people coming from other specialities.", "paper_title": "When Errors Become the Rule: Twenty Years with Transformation-Based Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000336405900008"}
