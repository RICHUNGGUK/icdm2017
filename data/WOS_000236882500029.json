Especially MS Internet Explorer which is used for internet access is a module to execute local files and to install softwares that are activated by install shield. Also Explorer is the same as Shell. Analyzing \"index.dat\" log which is the history of executing files and accessing web sites makes security audit effective. In this paper, by analyzing Windows \"index.dat\" and Mozilla Firefox cache files with time analysis, we suggest a method to perform auditing of cyher crimes such as information leakage and hard disk vulnerability.", "paper_title": "Designing security auditing protocol with Web browsers", "paper_id": "WOS:000236882500029"}
