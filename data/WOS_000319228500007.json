The scheme is efficient and flexible because MCP-ABE allows a content provider to specify an access policy and encrypt multiple messages within one ciphertext such that only the users whose attributes satisfy the access policy can decrypt the ciphertext. Moreover, the paper shows how to support resource-limited mobile devices by offloading computational intensive operations to cloud servers while without compromising data privacy.", "paper_title": "Attribute-Based Access to Scalable Media in Cloud-Assisted Content Sharing Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319228500007"}
