An improved iterative algorithm is put forward to maximize the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) under the constant modulus constraint. During iterations, the optimization of unimodular waveforms with filters fixed is a nonconvex fractional quadratically constrained quadratic program problem, which is NP-hard and not able to be solved in polynomial time. An algorithm based on semidefinite programming relaxation combined with bisection and Gaussian randomization is introduced to provide the high-quality suboptimal solutions with a polynomial time computational complexity. The analysis on the approximation bound is given to prove the tightness of the semidefinite programming relaxation and so the correctness of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the improved method is efficient in designing unimodular waveforms for MIMO radar to achieve a better SCNR performance.", "paper_title": "Improved design of unimodular waveforms for MIMO radar", "paper_id": "WOS:000316871800004"}
