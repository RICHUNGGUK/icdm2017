It combines a total variational filter (ROF filter) with a fourth-order PDE filter (LLT filter). The combined algorithm takes the advantage of both filters since it is able to preserve edges while avoiding the staircase effect in smooth regions. The existence and uniqueness of a solution to the minimization problem is established. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the model in image restoration. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
