When simulating a reservoir, one must account for the physical and chemical processes taking place in the subsurface. Rock and fluid properties are crucial when describing the flow in porous media. In this paper, the authors are concerned with estimating the permeability field of a reservoir. The problem of estimating model parameters such as permeability is often referred to as a history-matching problem in reservoir engineering. Currently, one of the most widely used methodologies which address the history-matching problem is the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). EnKF is a Monte Carlo implementation of the Bayesian update problem. Nevertheless, the EnKF methodology has certain limitations that encourage the search for an alternative method.For this reason, a new approach based on graphical models is proposed and studied. In particular, the graphical model chosen for this purpose is a dynamic non-parametric Bayesian network (NPBN). This is the first attempt to approach a history-matching problem in reservoir simulation using a NPBN-based method. A two-phase, two-dimensional flow model was implemented for a synthetic reservoir simulation exercise, and initial results are shown. The methods' performances are evaluated and compared. This paper features a completely novel approach to history matching and constitutes only the first part (part I) of a more detailed investigation. For these reasons (novelty and incompleteness), many questions are left open and a number of recommendations are formulated, to be investigated in part II of the same paper.", "paper_title": "Non-parametric Bayesian networks for parameter estimation in reservoir simulation: a graphical take on the ensemble Kalman filter (part I)", "paper_id": "WOS:000328319900005"}
