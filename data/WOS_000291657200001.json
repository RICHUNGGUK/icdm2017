The system targets the transmission of force data from a distributed sensor system for on-body application. A prototype force transducer patch is presented whose parasitic capacitance is exploited as coupling capacitance for body-channel transmission. The transceiver is implemented in 0.35 mu m CMOS technology and occupies an area of 0.0178 mm(2). It consumes 360 mu A of current at a supply voltage of 3 V. Measured results further confirm a transmission rate of 54 kb/s making the design suitable for use in a distributed pressure sensing network.", "paper_title": "An OOK Body-Channel Transceiver Front-End ASIC for Distributed Force Measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000291657200001"}
