We provide a background on the Voice Interactive Classroom, a service-oriented architecture that enables cross-platform multichannel access to Internet-based learning. Strategies and practices for designing, developing, documenting and evaluating service-oriented applications are also presented, which allow aural access to existing e-learning platforms. In addition, we summarise the development of four voice-enabled learning services and report the findings obtained from evaluating their usability and didactic effectiveness. This research is intended to facilitate students and practitioners with planning, implementing and evaluating their own solutions.
