It is qualitative rather than quantitative. Privacy preserving mainly relies on policy based rules of the system, and users cannot adjust their privacy disclosure rules dynamically based on their wishes. To make users understand and control their privacy measurement, we present a scheme to quantize the personal privacy. We aim to configure the person's privacy based on the numerical privacy level which can be dynamically adjusted. Instead of using the traditional simple rule engine, we implement this scheme in a complex way. In addition, we design the scenario to explain the implementation of our scheme. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to assess personal privacy numerically to achieve precision privacy computing. The privacy measurement and disclosure model will be refined in the future work.", "paper_title": "Quantizing Personal Privacy in Ubiquitous Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000296499700009"}
