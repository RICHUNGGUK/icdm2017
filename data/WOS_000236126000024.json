As the adversary is unbounded, any encryption scheme must leak information about m; in particular, the mutual information between m and its ciphertext cannot be zero. Despite this, a family of encryption schemes is presented that guarantee that for any message space in {0, 1}(n) with minimum entropy n - l and for any Boolean function h : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1}, no adversary can predict h(m) from the ciphertext of m with more than 1/n(w(1)) advantage; this is achieved with keys of length l + w(log n). In general, keys of length l + s yield a bound of 2(-Theta(s)) on the advantage. These encryption schemes rely on no unproven assumptions and can be implemented efficiently. Applications of this to cryptosystems based on complexity-theoretic assumptions are discussed and, in addition, a simplified proof of a fundamental \"elision lemma\" of Goldwasser and Micali is provided.", "paper_title": "How to fool an unbounded adversary with a short key", "paper_id": "WOS:000236126000024"}
