A theoretical bound on the least number of required smart meters is studied by an entropy-based approach, which qualifies the impact of meter deployment strategies to the state tracking accuracy. It motivates a meter deployment optimization algorithm (MDOP) to minimize the number of meters while satisfying given requirements to state tracking accuracy. To accurately decode the real-time ON/OFF states of appliances by the readings of meters, a fast state decoding (FSD) algorithm based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) is presented to track the state sequence of each appliance for better accuracy. Although traditional HMM needs O(t2(2N)) time complexity to conduct online sequence decoding, FSD improves the complexity to O(tn(U+1)), where n < N and U is an upper bound of the simultaneous switching events. Both MDOP and FSD are verified extensively using simulations and real PowerNet data. The results show that the meter deployment cost can be saved by more than 80% while still getting over 90% state tracking accuracy.", "paper_title": "Monitoring Massive Appliances by a Minimal Number of Smart Meters", "paper_id": "WOS:000330905800001"}
