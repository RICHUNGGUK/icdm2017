The WIBS so constructed may include as special cases a quite general class of the numerical methods in computational fluid dynamics, such as finite-volume method, finite difference method, discontinuous Galerkin scheme, spectral volume method, spectral difference method, finite element method, and PnPm scheme recently designed by Dumbser et al [Journal of Computational Physics 227 (2008) 8209-8253]. etc In this paper the property of WIBS and WENO-WIBS on one-dimensional hyperbolic conservation-law systems is systematically explored In addition to the high stability and order of accuracy for smooth region, the WENO-WIBS exhibits high resolution and non-oscillatory property in capturing the discontinuity. The numerical experiments of WIBS and WENO-WIBS on various benchmark problems are favorably compared with the results obtained by other high-order methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
