However, most of the research focuses on deriving feasible/optimal solutions or examining the computational complexity of the intractable cases in a single machine. Often a number of operations have to be done on every job in many manufacturing and assembly facilities (Pinedo, 2002 [1]). In this paper, we consider a two-machine flowshop problem where the objective is to minimize the total completion time of the first agent with no tardy jobs for the second agent. We develop a branch-and-bound algorithm and simulated annealing heuristic algorithms to search for the optimal solution and near-optimal solutions for the problem, respectively.
