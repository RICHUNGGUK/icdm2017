The two key ingredients of tractography are the diffusion model (tensor, high-order tensor, Q-ball, etc.) and the means to deal with uncertainty during the tracking process (deterministic vs probabilistic mathematical framework). In this paper, we investigate the use of an analytical Q-ball model for the diffusion data within a well-formalized particle filtering framework. The proposed method is validated and compared to other tracking algorithms on the MICCAI'09 contest Fiber Cup phantom. Tractographies of in vivo adult and fetal brain Diffusion-Weighted Images (DWIs) are also shown to illustrate the robustness of the algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
