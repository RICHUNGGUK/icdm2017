The first is the decision to either accept or reject new type-1 or type-2 jobs. The second is the decision to abort jobs, i.e., to remove any type-1 or type-2 jobs from the system. We show that there exist optimal threshold policies for these two types of decisions.", "paper_title": "Optimal threshold policies in a two-class preemptive priority queue with admission and termination control", "paper_id": "WOS:000240380200002"}
