In particular, this development requires more effective and efficient evidence collection strategies, which are likely to produce the most conclusive information with limited available resources. Evidence collection is a difficult task, however, because it necessitates consideration of: a wide range of plausible crime scenarios, the evidence that may be produced under these hypothetical scenarios, and the investigative techniques that can recover and interpret the plausible pieces of evidence. A knowledge based system (KBS) can help crime investigators by retrieving and reasoning with such knowledge, provided that the KBS is sufficiently versatile to infer and analyse a wide range of plausible scenarios. This paper presents such a KBS. It employs a novel compositional modelling technique that is integrated into a Bayesian model based diagnostic system. These theoretical developments are illustrated by a realistic example of serious crime investigation.", "paper_title": "Compositional Bayesian modelling for computation of evidence collection strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000291738400010"}
