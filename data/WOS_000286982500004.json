In this paper, we presented a new dynamically fault-tolerant high-radix multistage interconnection network using a fully-adaptive self-routing. To devise the fully-adaptive self-routing for recovering the misrouting around link faults in such network, we introduce an abstract algebraic analysis of the topological structure of the high-radix Delta network. The presented interconnection network provides multiple paths by using all the links of all the stages of the network. We also present a mathematical analysis of the reliability of the interconnection network for quantitative comparison against other networks. The MTTF of 64x64 network proposed is 2.2 times greater than that of the cyclic Banyan network. The hardware cost of the proposed network is half that of the cyclic Banyan network and the 2D ring-Banyan network.", "paper_title": "The deflection self-routing Delta network: a dynamically fault-tolerant high-radix multistage interconnection network", "paper_id": "WOS:000286982500004"}
