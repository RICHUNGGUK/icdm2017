In order to take advantage of the properties of modern clustered SMP architectures a hybrid method using a combination of OpenMP nested in MPI is advocated. The development of the reference implementation is proposed. Furthermore, a few load balancing strategies are introduced: time scheduling at the annealing process level, clustering at the basic annealing step level and suspending-inside of the basic annealing step. The application of the algorithm to VRPTW-a generally accepted benchmark problem-is used to illustrate their positive influence on execution time and the quality of results.", "paper_title": "Load balanced parallel simulated annealing on a cluster of SMP nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500097"}
