Traditional cryptographic approaches are widely used to provide security in WSN. However, because of unattended and insecure deployment, a sensor node may be physically captured by an adversary who may acquire the underlying secret keys, or a subset thereof, to access the critical data and/or other nodes present in the network. Moreover, a node may not properly operate because of insufficient resources or problems in the network link. In recent years, the basic ideas of trust and reputation have been applied to WSNs to monitor the changing behaviors of nodes in a network. Several trust and reputation monitoring (TRM) systems have been proposed, to integrate the concepts of trust in networks as an additional security measure, and various surveys are conducted on the aforementioned system. However, the existing surveys lack a comprehensive discussion on trust application specific to the WSNs. This survey attempts to provide a thorough understanding of trust and reputation as well as their applications in the context of WSNs. The survey discusses the components required to build a TRM and the trust computation phases explained with a study of various security attacks. The study investigates the recent advances in TRMs and includes a concise comparison of various TRMs. Finally, a discussion on open issues and challenges in the implementation of trust-based systems is also presented.
