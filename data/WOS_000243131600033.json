Such adaptation often requires new investments in training and development. To address this issue, OMG defined a model driven development approach (MDD) which insulates business and application logic from technology evolution. Current MDD approaches falls short in fully derive implementation from models described at a high abstraction level. We propose a controlled natural language to complement UML models as an action specification language. In this article, we describe the language, its impact on systems development and the tools developed to support it. In order to demonstrate the language usability we present an application example.", "paper_title": "Natural MDA: Controlled natural language for action specifications on model driven development", "paper_id": "WOS:000243131600033"}
