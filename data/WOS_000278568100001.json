Many researchers focused on this field and have made great progress in the specific one. NURBS curve interpolation. These works greatly improved the CNC machining with constant feedrate, confined chord error and limited acceleration/deceleration. However, during CNC machining process, mechanical shocks to machine tool caused by the undesired acceleration/deceleration profile will dramatically deteriorate the surface accuracy and quality of the machined parts. This is, in most occasions, very harmful to machine tools. In this paper, an accurate adaptive NURBS curve interpolator is proposed with consideration of acceleration-deceleration control. The proposed design effectively reduces the machining shocks by constraining the machine tool jerk dynamically. Meanwhile, the constant feedrate is maintained during most time of machining process, and thus high accuracy is achieved while the feedrate profile is greatly smoothed. In order to deal with the sudden change of the acceleration/deceleration around the corner with large curvature, a real-time flexible acceleration/deceleration control scheme is introduced to adjust the feedrate correspondingly. Case study has been taken to verify the feasibility and advantages of the proposed design. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
