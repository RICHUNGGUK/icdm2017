The transient energy envelope is derived from the slice of spectrogram in the timefrequency domain. Then this transient response is fitted to a polynomial under least square criteria, and the polynomial coefficients are regarded as the feature vector. A data acquisition system has been set up to capture IEEE 802.11b Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) signals. The results exhibit an approving distinctiveness of up to 94% to classify different manufactories of WLAN cards and of 78.4% for the WLAN cards of the same manufactory.
