The system is completed by suitable boundary conditions involving non-homogeneous Dirichlet, Navier's slip and inflow/outflow parts. We prove the existence of weak solutions and show that the resulting level of the pressure is fixed by the boundary conditions. The paper is motivated by the journal bearing lubrication problem and extends the earlier results for homogeneous boundary conditions. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
