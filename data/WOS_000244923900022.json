It is often investigated in a simplistic manner focusing on end-users and on the technical aspects of security. Security, however, is a management problem and as a result, the investigation of security culture should also have a management focus. This paper describes a framework of eight dimensions of culture. Each dimension is discussed in terms of how they relate specifically to security culture based on a number of previously published case studies. We believe that use of this framework in security culture research will reduce the inherent biases of researchers who tend to focus on only technical aspects of culture from an end-users perspective.
