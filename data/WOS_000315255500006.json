It is expected that more explicitly formulated planning tools would provide benefits on securing the supply chain of biomass feedstock. In this study, the problem of finding a permutation schedule for a number of geographically dispersed fields where biomass handling operations have to be carried out involving a number of sequential tasks, was formulated as a flow shop with sequence depended set up times scheduling problems as known in the industrial domain. By applying the approach to a case study involving experimental recording of the operations executions, the execution of an optimal schedule was found to give a reduction of 9.8% in the total time as compared to a schedule based on the tacit knowledge of the operations manager.
