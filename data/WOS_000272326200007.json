An important body of research has appeared about possible frequency management schemes, but none of them proposes solutions that meet every related criteria. In this paper we present our work on dynamic spectrum allocation and pricing that offers a distributed mechanism design, well-suited to practical employment issues. Our model handles interference effects without any restricting assumptions, provides universal scalable and incentive-compatible allocation and pricing mechanisms. We provide both analytical and numerical evaluation of the proposed framework, and in either case we prove this latter to be a suitable approach to efficient and flexible spectrum utilization.
