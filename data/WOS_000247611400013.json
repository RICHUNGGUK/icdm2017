Fraenkel, J. Simpson, How many squares can a string contain? J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 82 (1998) 112-120] proved that the number of squares in a word of length n is bounded by 2n. In this note we improve this bound to 2n - Theta (log n). Based on the numerical evidence, the conjectured bound is n. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
