However, due to its complexity, the quantification of the interrelationships between the service site and its nearby business types is still a challenging task. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel joint learning scheme for service site selection. This scheme employs both the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) on the Geographical Information System (GIS) data and the partitional clustering on the service performance data. A case study for bank branch selection is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of our method. Finally, based on the joint learning scheme, we present a conceptual framework for the complete procedure of service site selection with a particular emphasis on the GIS enabled network analysis.", "paper_title": "GIS enabled service site selection: Environmental analysis and beyond", "paper_id": "WOS:000292286200004"}
