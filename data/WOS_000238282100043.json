First, the definition of HFES is discussed, including the definitions of the evaluation items and the relationships among them, based on the five common operations. Second, the running algorithms of the HFES are introduced to compute the values of those evaluation items and the result of the HFES. Subsequently, the application of the HFES in the IWfMS is presented in detail including the cooperating model. The experiments are carried out and the results show that the HFES is effective.", "paper_title": "The hierarchical fuzzy evaluation system and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100043"}
