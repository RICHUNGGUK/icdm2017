This work concentrates on the use of sensor as the primary means of interaction for computer music, and examines the relationships between types of sensors and musical functions. Experiments are described which aim to discover the particular suitability of certain sensors for specific musical tasks. The effects of additional visual feedback on the perceived suitability of these sensors is also examined. Results are given, along with a discussion of their possible implications for computer music interface design and pointers for further work on this topic.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of sensors as input devices for computer music interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000237806800012"}
