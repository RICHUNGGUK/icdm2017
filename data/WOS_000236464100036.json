This solves a long standing open question in a surprising way. As a consequence of this unconditional result and recent work by GlaBer et al. [12], complete sets for all of the following complexity classes are m-mitotic: NP, coNP, circle plus P, PSPACE, and NEXP, as well as all levels of PH, MODPH, and the Boolean hierarchy over NP. In the cases of NP, PSPACE, NEXP, and PH, this at once answers several well-studied open questions. These results tell us that complete sets share a redundancy that was not known before. In particular, every NP-complete set A splits into two NP-complete sets A(1) and A(2). We disprove the equivalence between autoreducibility and mitoticity for all polynomial-time-bounded reducibilities between 3-tt-reducibility and Turing-reducibility: There exists a sparse set in EXP that is polynomial-time 3-tt-autoreducible, but riot weakly polynomial-time T-mitot ic. In particular, polynomial-time T-autoreducibility does riot imply polynomia l-time weak T-mitoticity, which solves an open question by Buhrman and Torenvliet. We generalize autoreducibility to define poly-autoreducibility and give evidence that NP-complete sets are poly-autoreducible.", "paper_title": "Redundancy in complete sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000236464100036"}
