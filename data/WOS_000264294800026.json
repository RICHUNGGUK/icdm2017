It conquers the problem of PIR schemes using k servers: the big overheads for managing these servers. In this paper, we point out that Kushilevitz's PIR scheme will let the user get much more information than he should get in one query of the database. In addition, a novel PIR scheme with fair privacy in the user side and the server side is proposed. It protects not only the privacy of the users like previous PIR schemes, but also protects the privacy of the server to avoid revealing the information more than the user queried. The security analyses of the proposed scheme are included in this paper. The security of the proposed scheme is based on the hard Problem of factoring a big number multiplied by two big primes. Finally, we give some comparisons between our scheme and other PIR schemes.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL PRIVATE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SCHEME WITH FAIR PRIVACY IN THE USER SIDE AND THE SERVER SIDE", "paper_id": "WOS:000264294800026"}
