The design objective is to seek a static output feedback controller that is able to stabilize the uncertain system and to minimize the mixed H-2/H-infinity norm. To this end, a hybrid algorithm mixed by the technique of Hurwitz testing matrix of family of polynomial, average performance constraint and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. Due to the fact that the algorithm is based on GAs, we use a hierarchical structure to merge the conditions of Hurwitz testing matrix technique and average performance constraint into a fitness function which is called Hierarchical Fitness Function Structure (HFFS). By replacing fitness function with HFFS, any GAs can be applied to constitute the algorithm. Also, the proposed approach does not need any assumptions, so it is much more relaxed than that of Lyapunov-based design methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
