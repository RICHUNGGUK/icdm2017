Since it is expressed as differences of the correlation among measured variables, it is useful to cluster samples on the basis of the correlation among variables for adopting a multi-model approach. In addition, changes in process characteristics can be coped with in the same way. In the present work, a new clustering method, referred to as NC-spectral clustering, is proposed by integrating the nearest correlation (NC) method and spectral clustering. Spectral clustering is a graph partitioning method that can be used for sample classification when an affinity matrix of a weighted graph is given. The NC method can detect samples that are similar to the query from the viewpoint of the correlation without a teacher signal. In the proposed method, the NC method is used for constructing the weighted graph that expresses the correlation-based similarities between samples and the constructed graph is partitioned by using spectral clustering. In addition, a new soft-sensor design method is proposed on the basis of the proposed NC-spectral clustering. The usefulness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through a numerical example and a case study of parallelized batch processes. The performance of the proposed correlation-based method is better than that of the conventional distance-based methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
