It turns the problem naturally into estimating a mixing distribution, nonparametrically. This paper studies the least squares approach to solving this problem and presents two algorithms for computing the estimate. The resulting mixture density is hence just the least squares estimate of the k-monotone density. Through simulated and real data examples, the usefulness of the least squares density estimator is demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
