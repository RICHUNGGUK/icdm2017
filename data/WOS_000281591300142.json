Electric arc furnaces represent complex, multi-variable processes with time-variant parameters, and their effective modeling is a challenging task. This paper shows that adaptive neuro-fuzzy networks lend themselves well to nonlinear black-box modeling of v-i behavior of electric arc furnaces. A successful implementation is described, and its performance is illustrated in comparison to measurements from an operational furnace. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
