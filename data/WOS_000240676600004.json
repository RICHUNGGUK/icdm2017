This paper investigates one novel application of these technologies, ad hoc inner-urban shared-ride trip planning: Transportation clients such as pedestrians are seeking ad hoc shared rides from transportation hosts such as private automobiles, buses, taxi cabs or trains. While centralized trip planners are challenged by assigning clients and hosts in an ad hoc manner, in particular for non-scheduled hosts, we consider the transportation network as a mobile geosensor network of agents that interact locally by short-range communication and heuristic wayfinding strategies. This approach is not only fully scalable; we can also demonstrate that with short-range communication, and hence, incomplete transportation network knowledge a system still can deliver near-to-optimal trips.", "paper_title": "Ad hoc shared-ride trip planning by mobile geosensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240676600004"}
