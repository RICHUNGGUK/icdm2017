Tumor clustering from gene expression data provides a new way to perform cancer class discovery. Most of the existing research works adopt single-clustering algorithms to perform tumor clustering is from biomolecular data that lack robustness, stability, and accuracy. To further improve the performance of tumor clustering from biomolecular data, we' introduce the fuzzy theory into the cluster, ensemble framework for tumor clustering from biomolecular data, and propose four kinds of hybrid fuzzy cluster ensemble framework S (HFCEF), named as HFCEF-I, HFCEF-II, HFCEF-III, and HFCEF-IV, respectively, to identify samples that belong to different types of cancers: The difference between HFCEF-I and HFCEF-Il is that they adopt different ensemble generator approaches tmenerate a set of fuzzy matrices in the ensemble. Specifically, HFCEF-I applies the affinity propagation algorithm (AP) to perform clustering on the sample dimension and generates a set of fuzzy matrices in the ensemble base'd on the fuzzy membership function and base samples selected by AP. HFCEF-Il adopts AP to perform clustering on the attribute dimension, generates a set of subspaces, and obtains a set of fuzzy matrices in the ensemble by performing fuzzy c-means on subspaces. Compared with HFCEF-I and HFCEF-II, HFCEF-III and HFCEF-1V consider the characteristics of HFCEF-I and HFCEF-II. HFCEF-111 'combines HFCEFI and HFCEF-11 in a serial way, while HPCEF-1V integrates HFCEF-I and HFCEF-II in a concurrent way. HFCEFs adopt suitable consensus functions, such as the fuzzy c-means algorithm or the normalized, cut algorithm s(Ncut), to summarize generated fuzzy matrices, and obtain the final results. The experiments on real data sets from UCI machine learning repository and \" cancer gene expression profiles illustrate that 1) the proposed hybrid fuzzy cluster ensemble frameworks work well.on real data sets, especially biomolecular data, and 2) the proposed approaches are able to provide more robust, stable, and accurate results when compared with the state-of-the-art single clustering algorithms and traditional cluster ensemble approaches.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Fuzzy Cluster Ensemble Framework for Tumor Clustering from Biomolecular Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000326552800010"}
