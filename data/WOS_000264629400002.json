It is demonstrated that because of neglecting short-circuit current, previous techniques proposed to optimize the area of a fanout tree may result in excessive power consumption. This paper describes how the problem of low-power fanout optimization can be reduced to inverter-chain optimization problem and formulates the minimization of the total power consumption of an inverter chain as a geometric program. Moreover, it describes an efficient method to minimize the total power consumption of a fanout tree by using multiple-channel-length (multi-L-Gate) and multiple-threshold-voltage (multi-V-t) techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce the power consumption of the fanout trees by an average of 11.17% over SIS fanout-optimization program.", "paper_title": "Low-Power Fanout Optimization Using Multi Threshold Voltages and Multi Channel Lengths", "paper_id": "WOS:000264629400002"}
