However, the complexity of management issues, the variety of modelling objectives, and the variable availability of data require a flexible way to customize models and adapt them to each individual problem. Environmental modelling frameworks offer such flexibility; they are designed to build and run integrated models on the basis of reusable and exchangeable components. This paper presents the LIQUID (R) framework, developed by Hydrowide since 2005. The purpose of developing LIQUID (R) was to provide both easier integration of hydrological processes and preservation of their characteristic temporal and spatial scales. It suits a wide range of applications, both in terms of spatial scales and of process conceptualisations. LIQUID (R) is able to synchronize different time steps, to handle irregular geometries, and to simulate complex connections between components, in particular involving feedback. The paper presents the concepts of LIQUID (R) and the technical choices made to meet the above requirements, with focuses on the simulation run system and on the spatial discretization of process components. The use of the framework is illustrated by five application cases associated with contrasted spatial and temporal scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
