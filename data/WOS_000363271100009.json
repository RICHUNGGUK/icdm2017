However, they are very time consuming and require a significant amount of computing power. More time is needed when two techniques work together. This has become the primary impediment in applying design optimization to real-world projects. This study focuses on reducing the computing time in genetic algorithms when building simulation techniques are involved. In this study, we combine two techniques (offline simulation and divide and conquer) to effectively improve the run time in these architectural design optimization problems, utilizing architecture-specific domain knowledge. The improved methods are evaluated with a case study of a nursing unit design to minimize the nurses' travel distance and maximize daylighting performance in patient rooms. Results show the computing time can be saved significantly during the simulation and optimization process.", "paper_title": "A fast genetic algorithm for solving architectural design optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000363271100009"}
