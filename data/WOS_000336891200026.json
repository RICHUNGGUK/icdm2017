To describe shadow appearance more accurately, the proposed method builds adaptive online shadow models for sub-scenes with different conditions of irradiance and reflectance. The online shadow models are learned by utilizing Gaussian functions to fit the significant peaks of accumulating histograms, which are calculated from Hue, Saturation and Intensity (HSI) difference of moving objects between background and foreground. Additionally, object inner-edges analysis is adopted to reject camouflages, which are misclassified foreground regions that are highly similar to shadows. Finally, the main shadow regions are expanded to recycle the misclassified shadow pixels based on local color constancy. The proposed algorithm can adaptively handle the shadow appearance changes and camouflages without prior information about illuminations and scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
