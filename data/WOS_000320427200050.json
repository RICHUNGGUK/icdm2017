Therefore, parallel versions of accurate and efficient numerical solvers for high performance platforms are needed to be able to deal with these simulation scenarios in reasonable times. In this paper we present an efficient CUDA implementation of a first and second order HLL methods and a two-waves TVD-WAF one. We propose to write all these methods under a common framework, such as, their CUDA implementations share the same structure. In particular, the reformulation of TVD-WAF numerical flux and the improved definition of the flux limiter allows us to obtain a more robust solver in situations like wet/dry fronts. Finally, some numerical tests are presented showing that the TVD-WAF method is slightly slower that the first order HLL method and two times faster than the second order HLL method, but it provides numerical results almost as accurate as the second order HLL scheme.
