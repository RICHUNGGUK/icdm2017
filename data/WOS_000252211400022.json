However, current replica strategies in CDN are to statically and repeatedly keep the complete replica of the original object on many content servers. This method is weak in adapting the dynamic network, resulting in too much consumed server space and a waste of the storage cost. It becomes more serious by replicating some large-sized objects such as streaming media, which are being distributed over the Internet,more and more. In this paper, we discuss a robust replication strategy for scalable video strew-ning in CDN to reduce user response and storage cost as follows: 1) For content servers, which layer of which video contents should be selected to replicate? 2) How to test the robustness under different network environments? Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is robust and can provide much better performance than the conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Robust algorithm to retrieve scalable streaming media over content delivery networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400022"}
