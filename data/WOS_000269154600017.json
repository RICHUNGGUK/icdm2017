In this paper, rateless codes are shown to find a natural application in channels where the channel law varies unpredictably. Such unpredictability means that to ensure reliable communication block codes are limited by worst case channel variations. However, the dynamic decoding nature of rateless codes allows them to adapt opportunistically to channel variations. If the channel state selector is not malicious, but also not predictable, decoding can occur earlier, producing a rate of communication that can be much higher than the worst case. The application of rateless or \"fountain\" codes to the binary erasure channel (BEC) can be understood as an application of these ideas. Further, this sort of decoding can be usefully understood as an incremental form of erasure decoding. The use of ideas of erasure decoding result in a significant increase in reliability.", "paper_title": "Rateless Coding for Arbitrary Channel Mixtures With Decoder Channel State Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000269154600017"}
