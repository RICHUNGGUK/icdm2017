This becomes even more challenging if those sources are distributed across multiple organizations. Federations of semantic information services, combining service-orientation and semantic technologies, provide a promising solution for this problem. However, without proper measures to establish information security, companies will be reluctant to join an information federation, which could lead to serious adoption barriers. Following the design science paradigm, this paper presents general objectives and a process for designing a secure federation of semantic information services. Furthermore, new as well as established security measures are discussed. Here, our contributions include an access-control enforcement system for semantic information services and a process for modeling access-control policies across organizations. In addition, a comprehensive security architecture is presented. An implementation of the architecture in the context of an application scenario and several performance experiments demonstrate the practical viability of our approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
