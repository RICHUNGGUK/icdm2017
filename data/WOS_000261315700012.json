Design/methodology/approach - GPS is used to calibrate synchronization among the nodes, and directional antennas are used. In the protocol, different antenna mode and transmit power are used. The assertion signal and omni-directional RTS are transmitted in omni-directional mode, while directional CTS, directional RTS, DATA and ACK are transmitted in directional mode. With properly designed RTS-CTS handshake, the protocol can make full use of spatial reuse of directional communication and enhance parallelism in data transmission. Findings - The preliminary simulation results indicate that the protocol works well and achieves considerably high performance in both sparse and dense ad hoc networks. Research limitations/implications - The line of sight environment is the main limitation that the MAC protocol will be applied. Practical implications - The protocol is a very useful solution for employing directional antennas for ad hoc networks. Originality/value - The MAC protocol can effectively alleviate the directional hidden and exposed terminal problems as well as node deafness. It can greatly improve throughput and achieve low-medium access delay, making it suitable for ad hoc networks.", "paper_title": "Design, modeling and simulation of a novel directional MAC protocol for ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700012"}
