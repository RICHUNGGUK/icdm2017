We show that the satisfiability problem for two-variable, first-order logic with equivalence closure applied to two binary predicates is in 2-NEXPTIME, and we obtain a matching lower bound by showing that the satisfiability problem for two-variable first-order logic in the presence of two equivalence relations is 2-NEXPTIME-hard. The logics in question lack the finite model property; however, we show that the same complexity bounds hold for the corresponding finite satisfiability problems. We further show that the satisfiability (= finite satisfiability) problem for the two-variable fragment of first-order logic with equivalence closure applied to a single binary predicate is NEXPTIME-complete.", "paper_title": "TWO-VARIABLE FIRST-ORDER LOGIC WITH EQUIVALENCE CLOSURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000338833100003"}
