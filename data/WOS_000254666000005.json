EPSO borrows the movement rules from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and uses it as a recombination operator that evolves under selection. This paper presents a reactive power planning approach taking advantage of EPSO robustness, in a model that considers simultaneously multiple contingencies and multiple load levels. Results for selected problems are summarized including a trade-off analysis of results.", "paper_title": "A multiple scenario security constrained reactive power planning tool using EPSO", "paper_id": "WOS:000254666000005"}
