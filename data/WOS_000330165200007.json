In this paper, we propose a novel CI for a binomial proportion by modifying the midpoint of the score interval. The proposed modified interval can solve the downward spikes' problem of the score interval without enlarging the interval length. Simulation studies are carried out to illustrate the performance of the modified interval. With regard to the criterions of coverage probability, mean absolute error and expected length, our method is competitive among the several commonly used methods for constructing a CI. A real data example is also presented to show the application of our method.", "paper_title": "An improved score interval with a modified midpoint for a binomial proportion", "paper_id": "WOS:000330165200007"}
