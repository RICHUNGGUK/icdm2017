However, functional and structural MRI data reveal a multivariate nature, since neighboring voxels are highly correlated and different localized brain regions activate interdependently. Multivariate pattern classification techniques are capable of overcoming shortcomings of univariate statistics. A rising interest in such approaches on neuroimaging data leads to an increasing demand of appropriate software and tools in this field. Here, we introduce and release MANIA-Machine learning Application for NeuroImaging Analyses. MANIA is a Matlab based software toolbox enabling easy pattern classification of neuroimaging data and offering a broad assortment of machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods. Between groups classifications are the main scope of this software, for instance the differentiation between patients and controls. A special emphasis was placed on an intuitive and easy to use graphical user interface allowing quick implementation and guidance also for clinically oriented researchers. MANIA is free and open source, published under GPL3 license. This work will give an overview regarding the functionality and the modular software architecture as well as a comparison between other software packages.", "paper_title": "MANIA-A Pattern Classification Toolbox for Neuroimaging Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000339801300010"}
