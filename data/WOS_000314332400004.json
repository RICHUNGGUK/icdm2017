To support our argument, we discuss and fully disclose our extensive battery of functional group filters. We discuss the use of PAINS filters and also show the effect of similarity exclusion on structure-activity relationships. We show why limited analogue representation requires screening at higher concentrations to capture hit classes for difficult targets that otherwise may be prosecuted unsuccessfully. We construct our arguments in a structurally focused manner to be most useful to medicinal chemists, the key players in drug discovery.", "paper_title": "Broad Coverage of Commercially Available Lead-like Screening Space with Fewer than 350,000 Compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000314332400004"}
