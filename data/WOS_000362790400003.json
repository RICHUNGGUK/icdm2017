The authors collected data from 1025 open source software projects in a longitudinal study. The cross-sectional results show that the extent of a project's operating systems, the range of translated languages, programming languages, and project age positively impact OSS projects' positive outcomes with respect to market penetration and human resource attraction.", "paper_title": "A Longitudinal Study of the Impact of Open Source Software Project Characteristics on Positive Outcomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000362790400003"}
