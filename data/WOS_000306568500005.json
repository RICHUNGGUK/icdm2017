(The sigma(i) 's are thought of as the locations of balls dropped independently into urns 1...n according to some common distribution, so that, for some threshold tj, xj is the indicator of the event that at least tj balls land in urn j.) We mostly deal with the more general situation in which the sigma(i) 's need not be identically distributed, proving results which imply conditional negative association in the i.i.d. case. Some of the results-particularly Lemma 8 on graph orientations-are thought to be of independent interest. We also give a counterexample to a negative correlation conjecture of D.
