Statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) is thus developed to estimate timing distribution under process variation. Most existing SSTA techniques have difficulty in handling the non-Gaussian variation distribution and nonlinear dependence of delay on variation sources. To address this problem, we first propose a new method to approximate the max operation of two non-Gaussian random variables through second-order polynomial fitting. With such approximation, we then present new non-Gaussian SSTA algorithms for three delay models: quadratic model, quadratic model without crossing terms (semiquadratic model), and linear model. All the atomic operations (max and sum) of our algorithms are performed by closed-form formulas; hence, they scale well for large designs. Experimental results show that compared to the Monte Carlo simulation, our approach predicts the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and 95% percentile point within 1%, 1%, 6%, and 1% error, respectively.", "paper_title": "Non-Gaussian Statistical Timing Analysis Using Second-Order Polynomial Fitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164100012"}
