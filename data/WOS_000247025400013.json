We provided the mathematical formulation for the buyer's profit maximization problem and proposed a solution method based on a combination of the active set method and the Newton search procedure. Our computational study shows that the proposed method can solve the problem efficiently, and is able to generate interesting and insightful results that lead us to various managerial implications.", "paper_title": "Sourcing with random yields and stochastic demand: A newsvendor approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000247025400013"}
