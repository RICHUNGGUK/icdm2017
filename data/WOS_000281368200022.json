First we obtain a balance equation on the entropies that captures interesting properties of the classifier. Second, by normalizing this balance equation we first obtain a 2-simplex in a three-dimensional entropy space and then the de Finetti entropy diagram or entropy triangle. We also give examples of the assessment of classifiers with these tools. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
