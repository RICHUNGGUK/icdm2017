This study examines how consumer browsing frequency and gender affect perceived control and customer patronage intentions in the e-tail context. Statistical results show that browsing frequency has a positive direct effect on perceived control and patronage intentions of female consumers but does not have a significant impact on male perceived control and intentions. These findings provide theoretical insights into how consumer characteristics affect on-line decision-making and have implications for managing on-line consumers based on consumer characteristics.", "paper_title": "The Effects of Browsing Frequency and Gender on the Relationship Between Perceived Control and Patronage Intentions in E-tail", "paper_id": "WOS:000276583600006"}
