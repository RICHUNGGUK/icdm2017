Some structural properties of forward-concurrent-free nets are firstly proposed. Utilizing these properties, a method is then proposed to transform a given conjunction of GMECs into a conjunction of admissible GMECs. Furthermore, the necessary and sufficient condition of the existence of the permissive supervisor is obtained, and the optimal supervisor with a complexity of polynomial time is designed. The theoretic results are illustrated by an example that synthesizes a maximally permissive supervisor for a manufacturing system.", "paper_title": "Supervisor Synthesis for Enforcing a Class of Generalized Mutual Exclusion Constraints on Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000270947600009"}
