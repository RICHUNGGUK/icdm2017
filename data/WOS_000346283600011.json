In most cases it is assumed that attributes are Boolean, categorical or numerical. With the advent of semantic domain information in the form of ontologies, it is now common to find also semantic attributes, which may take as value a list of concepts. This paper proposes a new ontology-based procedure to compute the similarity between lists of semantic values, which may be used to compare objects. This measure is employed in an enhanced version of the k-means clustering method. The usefulness of the obtained classes has been tested in the context of a Web-based personalised recommender of Tourist destinations.", "paper_title": "Personalised recommendations based on novel semantic similarity and clustering procedures", "paper_id": "WOS:000346283600011"}
