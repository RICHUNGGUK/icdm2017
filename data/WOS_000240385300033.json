However, the variety of physical shapes and functional commands that each remote control features also raises numerous problems: the difficulties in locating the wanted remote control, the confusion among the button layout, the replacement issue, etc. Consumer electronics control system using hand gestures is a new innovative user interface that will resolve the complications of using numerous remote controls for domestic appliances. Based on one unified set of hand gestures, this system interprets the user hand gestures into pre-defined commands to control one or many devices simultaneously. The system has been tested and verified under both incandescent and fluorescent lighting conditions. The experimental results are very encouraging as the system produces real-time responses and highly accurate recognition toward various gestures.", "paper_title": "Moment invariant based control system using hand gestures", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300033"}
