Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can provide exceptionally efficient data compression for neural records. Two energy efficient hardware implementations for one dimensional, multi-level, multi-channel DWT have been compared to identify the optimal approach for real time processing within an implanted device. This paper defines area-power minimized hardware implementation of the lifting and B-spline DWT schemes and analyzes their performance tradeoffs for implantable neuroprosthetics. The lifting scheme is shown to be increasingly superior for a larger number of input channels.", "paper_title": "Analysis of lifting and B-spline DWT implementations for implantable neuroprosthetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000257226700003"}
