In this paper, a new shift scheme is given for the harmonic Arnoldi algorithm. We first analyze the harmonic Ritz values w(k+1) ,..., w(m) of A from the orthogonal complement of span of those wanted harmonic Ritz vectors with respect to K(m)(A, v(1)), then present an implicitly restarted harmonic Arnoldi algorithm with w(k+1) ,..., w(m) as shifts. Finally, through the numerical experiments, we mainly draw comparisons on our algorithm and Morgan's algorithm, and show our algorithm often performed better than Morgan's one. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
