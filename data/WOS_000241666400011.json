Algorithms are developed for minimizing the upper bound on the regional L(2) gain for exogenous inputs with L(2) norm bounded by a given value, and for minimizing this upper bound with a guaranteed reachable set or domain of attraction. Based on the structure of the optimization problems, using the projection lemma, the output feedback controller synthesis is cast as a convex optimization over linear matrix inequalities. The problems are studied in a general setting where the only requirement on the linear plant is detectability and stabilizability.", "paper_title": "Case studies on the control of input-constrained linear plants via output feedback containing an internal deadzone loop", "paper_id": "WOS:000241666400011"}
