Moreover, the area cost is often largely dominated by the memory modules. In deriving an optimized (for area and/or power) memory architecture, memory size computation is an important step in the exploration of the possible algorithmic specifications of multimedia applications. This paper presents a novel non-scalar approach for computing exactly the memory size in real-time multimedia algorithms. This methodology uses both algebraic techniques specific to the data-fiow analysis used in modem compilers and, also, more recent advances in the theory of polyhedra. In contrast with all the previous works which are only estimation methods, this approach performs exact memory computations even for applications significantly large in terms of the code size, number of scalars, and number of array references.", "paper_title": "Memory size computation for real-time multimedia applications based on polyhedral decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600002"}
