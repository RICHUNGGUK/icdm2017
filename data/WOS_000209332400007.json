The development of the future energy system will be based on planning and management of the distribution system in accordance with the philosophy of Smart grid (SG). This approach involves the extensive use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and innovative control systems in order to enable the realization of smart distribution systems, the active participation of demand, the availability of energy storage, as well as the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and Distributed Generation (DG), as well as the growing number of electric vehicles. In the paper a review of the main current challenges and possible solutions to open problems in the development of smart distribution grids are presented.", "paper_title": "Integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and electrical vehicles with smart power distribution networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209332400007"}
