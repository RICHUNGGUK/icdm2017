At each iteration, the QRPBB method first generates a point by solving a strongly convex quadratic minimization problem, which has a simple closed-form solution that is inexpensive to calculate, and then applies a projected Barzilai-Borwein method to update the solution of NMF. Global convergence result is established under mild conditions. Numerical comparisons of methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method is efficient.", "paper_title": "Quadratic regularization projected Barzilai-Borwein method for nonnegative matrix factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000361826200006"}
