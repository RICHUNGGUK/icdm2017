The objective of this paper is to develop a multi-objective facility location model accounting for a wide range of factors affecting decision-making. The proposed model selects potential facilities from a set of pre-defined alternative locations according to the number of customers, the number of competitors and real-estate cost criteria. However, that requires large amount of both spatial and non-spatial input data, which could be acquired from distributed data sources over the Internet. Therefore, a computational approach for processing input data and representation of modeling results is elaborated. It is capable of accessing and processing data from heterogeneous spatial and non-spatial data sources. Application of the elaborated data gathering approach and facility location model is demonstrated using an example of fast food restaurants location problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
