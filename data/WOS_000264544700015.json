We introduce the concept of topology coordinates, in which the topological relationships of the segments are embedded into the attributes. As a result, the computation for collision avoidance can be greatly reduced for complex motions that require tangling the segments of the body. Our method can be combinedly used with other prevalent frame-based optimization techniques such as inverse kinematics.", "paper_title": "Character Motion Synthesis by Topology Coordinates", "paper_id": "WOS:000264544700015"}
