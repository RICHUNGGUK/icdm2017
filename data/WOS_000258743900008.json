Although some modules for WiMAX networks simulation have been proposed for the ns-2, none of them implements all MAC features specified by the IEEE 802.16 standard for bandwidth management and Qos support. This paper, however, does present the design and validation of a WiMAX module based on the IEEE 802.16 standard. The module implemented includes mechanisms for bandwidth request and allocation, as well as for QoS provision. Moreover, the implementation is standard-compliant. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
