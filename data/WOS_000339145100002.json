Maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches for parameter estimation and prediction of future records are considered. The performance of the estimators is compared with those based solely on record-breaking data by means of Monte Carlo simulations, concluding that the use of delta-records is clearly advantageous. An example using real data is also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
