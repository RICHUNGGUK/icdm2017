The definition of the 2-category of diagrammatic logics relies on category theory, mainly on adjunction, categories of fractions and limit sketches. This framework is applied to the formalisation of a parameterisation process. This process, which consists of adding a formal parameter to some operations in a given specification, is presented as a morphism of logics. Then the parameter passing process for recovering a model of the given specification from a model of the parameterised specification and an actual parameter is shown to be a 2-morphism of logics.", "paper_title": "Diagrammatic logic applied to a parameterisation process", "paper_id": "WOS:000280672800007"}
