Although most existing mobile devices are equipped with both WiFi and cellular network interfaces, concurrent data transmissions over these interfaces for improved throughput are not provided. In this paper, a bandwidth aggregation prototype, named Application Layer Protocol based Aggregation (ALP-A), is developed for easy use by simply installing an application in mobile devices without modifying their operating systems or drivers. It provides desired quality-of-experience (QoE), i.e., acceptable response delay to users, learned from application characteristics and users behaviors. Furthermore, we propose an online algorithm of traffic scheduling over WiFi and cellular interfaces with the objective of minimizing energy consumption while guaranteeing the QoE. Over the prototype implemented on Andriod-based smartphones, we conduct extensive experiments to show that ALP-A outperforms existing schemes significantly.", "paper_title": "An Application Layer Protocol for Energy-Efficient Bandwidth Aggregation with Guaranteed Quality-of-Experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000354526000004"}
