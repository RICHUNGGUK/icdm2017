But there is still a difficulty to compromise between better generalization performance and smaller complexity of the ELM (a number of hidden nodes). This paper proposes a method called Delta Test-ELM (DT-ELM), which operates in an incremental way to create less complex ELM structures and determines the number of hidden nodes automatically. It uses Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as well as Delta Test (DT) to restrict the search as well as to consider the size of the network and prevent overfitting. Moreover, ensemble modeling is used on different DT-ELM models and it shows good test results in Experiments section.
