A proper edge coloring of a graph G is called acyclic if there is no 2-colored cycle in G. The acyclic edge chromatic number chi(a)'(G) of G is the least number of colors in an acyclic edge coloring of G. Alon et al. conjectured that chi(a)'(G) <= Delta(G) + 2. In this paper, we consider the sufficient conditions for the planar graphs satisfying chi(a)'(G) <= Delta(G) + 1 and chi(a)'(G) = Delta(G). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
