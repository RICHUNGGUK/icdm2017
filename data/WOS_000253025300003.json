In this paper, the population groups are assumed to occupy different locations according to the time of the year, i.e., winter and summer. A binary integer programming model is formulated to determine the optimal number and locations of primary health units for satisfying a seasonally varying demand. This model is successfully applied to the actual locations of 17 seasonally varying nomadic groups in the Middle East. Computational tests are performed on different versions of the model in order analyze the tradeoffs among different performance measures. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
