The analysis starts with the operator of a 3UPU configuration with a central strut being derived. Configuration and displacement formulas of the compliant platform are demonstrated, leading to the analytic equations of the relationship between the actuated angles of the operator and the position parameters of the end-effector. The numerical evaluation of workspace of the two-staged parallel mechanism is then followed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
