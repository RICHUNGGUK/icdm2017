The main idea is to measure the set of updating sequences to quantify the dependency of the properties under investigation from them. We propose to use the class of quasifair measures, namely measures that satisfy some fairness conditions on the updating sequences. Basic set properties like injectivity and surjectivity are adapted to the new setting and studied. In particular, we prove that they are dimensions sensitive properties (i.e., they are decidable in dimension 1 and undecidable in higher dimensions). A first exploration of dynamical properties is also started, some results about equicontinuity and expansivity behaviors are provided.", "paper_title": "m-Asynchronous cellular automata: from fairness to quasi-fairness", "paper_id": "WOS:000328125300011"}
