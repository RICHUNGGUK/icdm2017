In this method, we select input points randomly, separate the input points into inliers and outliers by computing their reprojection error, and correct the outliers so that they can become inliers. The reprojection error and correcting outliers are computed using the Triangulation method. After correcting the outliers, we can reliably recover projective motion and structure using the projective factorization method. Experimental results showed that errors can be reduced significantly compared to the previous research as a result of robustly estimated projective reconstruction.
