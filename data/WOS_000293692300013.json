Distortions in depth information may introduce geometry changes or occlusion variations in the synthesized views. In practice, depth information is stored in 8-bit grayscale format, whereas the disparity range for a visually comfortable stereo pair is usually much less than 256 levels. Thus, several depth levels may correspond to the same integer (or sub-pixel) disparity value in the DIBR-based view synthesis such that some depth distortions may not result in geometry changes in the synthesized view. From this observation, we develop a depth no-synthesis-error (D-NOSE) model to examine the allowable depth distortions in rendering a virtual view without introducing any geometry changes. We further show that the depth distortions prescribed by the proposed D-NOSE profile also do not compromise the occlusion order in view synthesis. Therefore, a virtual view can be synthesized losslessly if depth distortions follow the D-NOSE specified thresholds. Our simulations validate the proposed D-NOSE model in lossless view synthesis and demonstrate the gain with the model in depth coding.", "paper_title": "Depth No-Synthesis-Error Model for View Synthesis in 3-D Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000293692300013"}
