The notion of home is a unit of. small-scale power system that includes local energy source, energy storage, load, power conversion circuits, and control systems. An entire power system consists of multiple homes that are interconnected via a distribution network and that are connected to the commercial power grid. The interconnection is autonomously achieved with a recently developed technology of grid-connected inverters. A mathematical model of slow dynamics of the power system is also developed in this paper. The developed model enables the evaluation of steady and transient characteristics of power systems.", "paper_title": "Physical Architecture and Model-Based Evaluation of Electric Power System with Multiple Homes", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236400003"}
