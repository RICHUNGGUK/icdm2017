The calculations employed a supercell (4 x 4 x 4) slab model and three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. The strong attractive forces between RDX molecule and magnesium atoms induce the RDX's N -aEuro parts per thousand O bond breaking. Subsequently, the dissociated oxygen atoms and radical fragment of RDX oxidize the Mg surface. The largest adsorption energy is -2104.0 kJ mol(-1). We also investigated the decomposition mechanism of RDX molecule on the Mg(0001) surface. The activation energy for the dissociation step of configuration V4 is as small as 2.5 kJ mol(-1), while activation energies of other configurations are much larger, in the range of 964.9-1375.1 kJ mol(-1). Mg powder is more active than Al powder, and Mg powder performs better in increasing the combustion exothermicity of RDX as well.", "paper_title": "A DFT study of adsorption and decomposition of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine on Mg(0001) surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000324644000037"}
