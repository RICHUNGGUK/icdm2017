In this paper, the approach to simple point detection is based on techniques from cubical homology, a framework ideally suited for problems in image processing. A (d-dimensional) unitary cube (for a d-dimensional digital image) is associated with every discrete picture element, instead of a point in E-d (the d-dimensional Euclidean space) as has been done previously. A simple point in this setting then refers to the removal of a unitary cube without changing the topology of the cubical complex induced by the digital image. The main result is a characterization of a simple point p (i.e., simple unitary cube) in terms of the homology groups of the (3(d) - 1) neighborhood of p for arbitrary, finite dimensions d.", "paper_title": "On the detection of simple points in higher dimensions using cubical homology", "paper_id": "WOS:000239286900033"}
