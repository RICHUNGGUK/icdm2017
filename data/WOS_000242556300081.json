The algorithm of building qualitative states is presented and then the qualitative states graph can be created from the dynamic model of viral infection. The reasoning algorithm is given to accomplish the transitions between the qualitative states. The qualitative trends of the state variables and their relative positions of the viral infection model are obtained, and then the corresponding transition graph of these qualitative states is gained. The qualitative simulation of the system is also given without precise formulation of the model.", "paper_title": "Using qualitative description for the dynamic analysis of virus inflection", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300081"}
