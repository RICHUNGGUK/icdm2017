Focusing on interactive proof systems, one would like also to achieve unconditional soundness, so that proving a false statement is not possible even for a computationally unbounded adversarial prover. Motivated by such requirements, in this paper we address the problem of designing constant-round protocols in the plain model that enjoy simultaneously non-malleability (i.e., security against man-in-the-middle attacks) and unconditional soundness (i.e., they are proof systems). We first give a construction of a constant-round one-many (i.e., one honest prover, many honest verifiers) concurrent non-malleable zero-knowledge proof (in contrast to argument) system for every NP language in the plain model. We then give a construction of a constant-round concurrent non-malleable witness-indistinguishable proof system for every NP language. Compared with previous results, our constructions are the first constant-round proof systems that in the plain model guarantee simultaneously security against some non-trivial concurrent man-in-the-middle attacks and against unbounded malicious provers.
