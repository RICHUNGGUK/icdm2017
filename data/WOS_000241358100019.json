We propose to use Argos, an automaton-based language for reactive systems, and Larissa, its aspect-oriented extension, to show that several interfaces can be obtained from the same set of basic components, assembled in various ways. This is the basis of a quite general component-based development method for man-machine interfaces.", "paper_title": "Modular design of man-machine interfaces with Larissa", "paper_id": "WOS:000241358100019"}
