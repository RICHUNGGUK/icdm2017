The package cudaBayesreg uses GPU-oriented procedures to improve the performance of Bayesian computations. The paper motivates the need for devising high-performance computing strategies in the context of fMRI data analysis. Some features of the package for Bayesian analysis of brain fMRI data are illustrated. Comparative computing performance figures between sequential and parallel implementations are presented as well.", "paper_title": "cudaBayesreg: Bayesian Computation in CUDA", "paper_id": "WOS:000208590000008"}
