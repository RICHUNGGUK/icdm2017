Three Quality Factors, which allow analysis and comparison of different output stages, are used to design two CMOS class-AB stages. We show that using the proposed Quality Factors and the related strategy leads to an efficient design in terms trade-off among area, current consumption, bandwidth and distortion. Indeed, for one of the two stages adopted as example, the design through the Quality Factors results in superior distortion performance with respect to the design suggested in the original article. Design examples and simulations are provided to validate the design strategy.", "paper_title": "Design guidelines of CMOS class-AB output stages: a tutorial", "paper_id": "WOS:000257440000001"}
