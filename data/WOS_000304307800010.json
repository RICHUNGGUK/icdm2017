For instance, given a social network, who is the best person to introduce you to, say, Chris Ferguson, the poker champion? Or, given a network of people and skills, who is the best person to help you learn about, say, wavelets? We formally formulate this problem in two scenarios: Pair-Gateway and Group-Gateway. For each scenario, we show that it is sub-modular and thus it can be solved near-optimally. We further give fast, scalable algorithms to find such gateways. Extensive experimental evaluations on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Gateway finder in large graphs: problem definitions and fast solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000304307800010"}
