As in these applications, the PEMC's are partially immersed in liquid; an appropriate analytical model is needed to predict the dynamic behavior of these devices. In this work, a PEMC is designed and fabricated to be used as a liquid level sensing platform. An analytical model is developed and applied to evaluate the behavior of this device with respect to different tip immersion depths. To validate the proposed model, the theoretical and experimental results are compared for the tip immersion depths varying from 5 to 15 mm in water for two different resonant modes. To justify the deviations observed between the theoretical model and the experimental results, uncertain parameters and a correction factor for hydrodynamic force are introduced in theoretical model. To determine these parameters using experimental results, particles swarm optimization method is utilized. Applying this method, the deviation of theoretical results from experimental data is being significantly reduced. The results show that the uncertain parameters have negligible effect on the resonant frequency shift of the PEMC in different immersion depths, whereas the correction factor related to the hydrodynamic force affects it drastically. It is concluded that to improve the accuracy of the frequency domain modeling of PEMC partially immersed in liquid, for different immersion depths, an appropriate estimation of liquid force is required by insertion of hydrodynamic correction factor.", "paper_title": "Resonant behavior study of PZT sensor partially immersed in liquid using PSO method: modeling and experiment", "paper_id": "WOS:000350233900009"}
