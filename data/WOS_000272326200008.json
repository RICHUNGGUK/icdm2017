First, the mutual interference between the SU and the PUs is comprehensively formulated as the restrictions on the SU's transmission power. Secondly, the power allocation problem is analyzed and formulated as a constrained optimization problem which is concluded to a peak-power constrained water-filling formulation. Finally, a novel low-complexity water-filling algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem and the optimal power allocation result is achieved. In a simplified scenario, numerical results are exhibited to confirm the efficiency of the proposed water-filling algorithm, and the influence of the mutual interference on the power allocation and the system capacity is further illustrated.
