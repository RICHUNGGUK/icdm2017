The minmax rooted-tree cover problem asks to find such a set of p subtrees so as to minimize the maximum weight of the subtrees in the set. In this paper, we propose an 0(n) time (2 + epsilon) -approximation algorithm to the problem, where epsilon > 0 is a prescribed constant. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
