However, if the network is invaded by a wormhole attack, the attacker can tunnel the packets via the wormhole link to severely disrupt the DV-Hop localization process. The distance-vector propagation phase during the DV-Hop localization can even aggravate the positioning error, compared to the localization schemes without wormhole attacks. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of wormhole attack on the DV-Hop localization scheme, based on which we propose a label-based DV-Hop secure localization scheme to defend against the wormhole attack. We further theoretically prove the correctness of the proposed scheme. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed label-based DV-Hop secure localization scheme.
