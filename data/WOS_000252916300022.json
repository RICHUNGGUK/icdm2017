Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes two approaches to compute the magnetic stray field created by faulty electrical machines. The first one presents a homogenized FEM method. The second one is based on a combination of an analytical expression for the magnetic field in the machine air gap with an integral method. Findings - The studies show good agreement and demonstrate the reliability of the approach. Originality/value - Two models developed in this paper originally used to compute the stray magnetic field of electrical machines. They can contribute to develop new tools for fault monitoring.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the stray magnetic field created by faulty electrical machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300022"}
