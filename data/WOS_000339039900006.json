We present a parameterized algorithm for CONSENSUS CLUSTERING with running time O (4.24(k) . k(3) + vertical bar C vertical bar . vertical bar S vertical bar(2)), where k := t/vertical bar C vertical bar is the average Mirkin distance of the solution partition to the partitions of C. Furthermore, we strengthen previous hardness results for CONSENSUS CLUSTERING, showing that CONSENSUS CLUSTERING remains NP-hard even when all input partitions contain at most two subsets. Finally, we study a local search variant of CONSENSUS CLUSTERING, showing W[1]-hardness for the parameter \"radius of the Mirkin-distance neighborhood\". In the process, we also consider a local search variant of the related CLUSTER EDITING problem, showing W[1]-hardness for the parameter \"radius of the edge modification neighborhood\".
