In this paper, we report results of an empirical study aimed to evaluate whether computer experience and demographic user characteristics would have an effect on the way people interact with the visualized medical data in a 3D virtual environment using 2D and 3D input devices. We analyzed the interaction through performance data, questionnaires and observations. The results suggest that differences in gender, age and game experience have an effect on people's behavior and task performance, as well as on subjective user preferences.", "paper_title": "Exploring individual user differences in the 2D/3D interaction with medical image data", "paper_id": "WOS:000296279600002"}
