The sequential version is well suited to solve linear systems arising from the discretization of scalar elliptic PDEs. It is scalable in the sense that the time needed to solve a system is ( under known conditions) proportional to the number of unknowns. The associate software code is also robust and often significantly faster than other algebraic multigrid solvers. The present work addresses the challenge of porting it on massively parallel computers. In this view, some critical components are redesigned, in a relatively simple yet not straightforward way. Thanks to this, excellent weak scalability results are obtained on three petascale machines among the most powerful today available. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
