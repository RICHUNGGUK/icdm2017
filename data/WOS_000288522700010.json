In these types of applications, network nodes should ideally maximize QoS and minimize energy expenditures in video communication. This article presents PEMuR, a novel dual scheme for efficient video communication, which aims at both energy saving and high QoS attainment. To achieve its objectives, PEMuR proposes the combined use of an energy aware hierarchical routing protocol with an intelligent video packet scheduling algorithm. The adopted routing protocol enables the selection of the most energy efficient routing paths, manages the network load according to the energy residues of the nodes and prevents useless data transmissions through the proposed use of an energy threshold. In this way, an outstanding level of energy efficiency is achieved. Additionally, the proposed packet scheduling algorithm enables the reduction of the video transmission rate with the minimum possible increase of distortion. In order to do so, it makes use of an analytical distortion prediction model that can accurately predict the resulted video distortion due to any error pattern. Thus, the algorithm may cope with limited available channel bandwidth by selectively dropping less significant packets prior to their transmission. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
