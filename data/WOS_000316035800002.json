These examples are drawn from the author's own practice, in musical instrument design, video interfaces and installations, liquid architecture, interactive textiles and 3D printed individually shaped user interfaces. The reciprocal relationship between the human form and function and interface design is discussed, in the historical context of aesthetic and practical responses to technological developments, through the concept of anthropomorphic resonances. The approach proposed and illustrated through the examples aims to shape the (passive as well as the dynamic) shape of the organic user interface to establish these resonances. The use of active feedback and haptic presentation is presented as a way of creating a dynamic organic shape.", "paper_title": "Anthropomorphic Resonances: On the Relationship Between Computer Interfaces and the Human Form and Motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000316035800002"}
