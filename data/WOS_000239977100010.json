The focus of this paper is the role that synergies play for robot motor coordination, and in particular, we use a weightlifting task to demonstrate how trial-and-error learning can cause synergies to evolve from a simple control system and crude kinematic path. We also show how a robot learns to exploit its intrinsic dynamics, thereby improving performance, as individual joint motions become actively coupled via the control system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
