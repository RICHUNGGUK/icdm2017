Our problem is directly discretized by the method of fundamental solutions (MFS). The Tikhonov regularization method stabilizes a numerical solution of the problem for given Cauchy data with high noises. The accuracy of the numerical solution depends on a regularization parameter of the Tikhonov regularization technique and some parameters of the MFS. The L-curve determines a suitable regularization parameter for obtaining an accurate solution. Numerical experiments show that such a suitable regularization parameter coincides with the optimal one. Moreover, a better choice of the parameters of the MFS is numerically observed. It is noteworthy that a problem whose solution has singular points can successfully be solved. It is concluded that the numerical method proposed in this paper is effective for a problem with an irregular domain, singular points, and the Cauchy data with high noises. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
