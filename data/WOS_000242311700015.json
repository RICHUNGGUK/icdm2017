The existence of such a buffer allows us to implement noncausal algorithms for video processing at the receiver. In this paper, we describe an error control scheme that takes advantage of this fact, and employs a non-causal error-concealment algorithm. We use the knowledge of the)jacket-loss realization for the previously transmitted data to adjust the transmission strategy for the future data, knowing that this future data will be used to conceal the data in the previously lost packets. We demonstrate that such a strategy can be several times note energy efficient than ARQ.", "paper_title": "Noncausal error control for video streaming over wireless packet networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242311700015"}
