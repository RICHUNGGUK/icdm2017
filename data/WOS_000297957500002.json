In this method, an electromagnetic pulse with specific frequency equal to the Larmor frequency (the resonance frequency of the water molecules in the geomagnetic field) is sent to the underground from the surface. When the pulse is disconnected, after a few milliseconds, an electromagnetic field is returned from the water molecules and induces a voltage into the receiving antenna on the surface. As the inductive voltage generated by the protons is very small, the MRS method is very sensitive to the electromagnetic interferences and noise, which is the most important limitation for the practical application. Both the depth of investigation and precision of the MRS method depend on signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, in order to improve the performance in the noisy environments, a time-based method is hereby proposed, so that the characteristics of the merely taken noise used to estimate the features of the interfered noise with the signal. By applying an optimization process, we can remove the noise from the signal to a high extent. Also, a frequency method is investigated for comparison. It will be observed that the proposed method is actually advantageous to the mentioned frequency method and the performance indexes, especially SNR, will increase significantly.", "paper_title": "TIME-BASED NOISE REMOVAL FROM MAGNETIC RESONANCE SOUNDING SIGNALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500002"}
