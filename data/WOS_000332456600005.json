Most current approaches make the unrealistic assumption that persons walk along a fixed direction or a pre-defined path. Given a gait sequence collected from arbitrary walking directions, we first obtain human silhouettes by background subtraction and cluster them into several clusters. For each cluster, we compute the cluster-based averaged gait image as features. Then, we propose a sparse reconstruction based metric learning method to learn a distance metric to minimize the intra-class sparse reconstruction errors and maximize the inter-class sparse reconstruction errors simultaneously, so that discriminative information can be exploited for recognition. The experimental results show the efficacy of our approach.", "paper_title": "Human Identity and Gender Recognition From Gait Sequences With Arbitrary Walking Directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000332456600005"}
