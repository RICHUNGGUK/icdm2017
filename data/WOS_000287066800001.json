The shared circuits model approach of sociocognitive capacities recently proposed by Hurley in The shared circuits model (SCM): how control, mirroring, and simulation can enable imitation, deliberation, and mindreading. Behavioral and Brain Sciences 31(1) (2008)1-22 is enriched and improved in this work. A five-layer computational architecture for designing artificial cognitive control systems is proposed on the basis of a modified shared circuits model for emulating sociocognitive experiences such as imitation, deliberation, and mindreading. In order to show the enormous potential of this approach, a simplified implementation is applied to a case study. An artificial cognitive control system is applied for controlling force in a manufacturing process that demonstrates the suitability of the suggested approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
