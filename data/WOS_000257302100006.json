The stability and reliability of the system were assessed. A personal computer, a needle/catheter device, and a data acquisition interface are included in this system. Using Virtual Reality Modeling Language, an interactive virtual environment was developed. Ten participants, ranging from 20 to 28 years of age, were recruited for this study. The self-learning and training procedures encompassed an intravenous catheterization process. The experimental results showed that after a few trials, the change in task time was not obvious in each trial, and the error frequency decreased slightly with more trials. High intraclass correlation coefficients also were obtained for task time and error frequency by analyzing the test-retest reliability. These results indicated that the system was stable and that the system reliability was acceptable.", "paper_title": "The assessment of stability and reliability of a virtual reality-based intravenous injection simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000257302100006"}
