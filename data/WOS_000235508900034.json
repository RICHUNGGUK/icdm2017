In the proposed scheme, a non-full rank matrix is applied to an embedded watermark to form an asymmetric detection watermark. To detect the embedded watermark, the watermarked signal is transformed through the matrix firstly. Then a correlation test between the detection watermark and the transformed signal is performed. This scheme allows for the public release of all information, except for the embedded watermark. The performance of the scheme is analyzed, and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and robust to some common attacks.", "paper_title": "A new asymmetric watermarking scheme for copyright protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508900034"}
