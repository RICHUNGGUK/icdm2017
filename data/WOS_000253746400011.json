To improve the accuracy of identification we applied a machine-learning approach using a hidden Markov model (HMM) to capture the complex and often subtle links between a peptide sequence and its MS/MS spectrum. Model: Our model, HMM_Score, represents ion types as HMM states and calculates the maximum joint probability for a peptide/spectrum pair using emission probabilities from three factors: the amino acids adjacent to each fragmentation site, the mass dependence of ion types and the intensity dependence of ion types. The Viterbi algorithm is used to calculate the most probable assignment between ion types in a spectrum and a peptide sequence, then a correction factor is added to account for the propensity of the model to favor longer peptides. An expectation value is calculated based on the model score to assess the significance of each peptide/spectrum match. Results: We trained and tested HMM_Score on three data sets generated by two different mass spectrometer types. For a reference data set recently reported in the literature and validated using seven identification algorithms, HMM_Score produced 43 more positive identification results at a 1 false positive rate than the best of two other commonly used algorithms, Mascot and XTandem. HMM_Score is a highly accurate platform for peptide identification that works well for a variety of mass spectrometer and biological sample types.", "paper_title": "Incorporating sequence information into the scoring function: a hidden Markov model for improved peptide identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000253746400011"}
