As location systems have a direct impact over privacy and personal autonomy, the system design was preceded by a deep study of ethical and social impact. Among its contributions it can be emphasized that this study was extended both to patients and also to caregivers that were located in order to provide urgent assistance. The conclusions of this experience were compiled as design guidelines and used for the technological design.", "paper_title": "Ethically aware design of a location system for people with dementia", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000114"}
