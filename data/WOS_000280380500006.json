Some variants of these algorithms have been compared in order to find out the impact of different design configurations and the use of heuristic information. Good performance is shown after applying every algorithm to 10 well-known problem instances in comparison to NSGA-II. In addition, those algorithms which have provided the best results have been employed to tackle a real-world problem at the Nissan plant, located in Spain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
