While our primary focus and demonstrations of applicability are for moderately collisional plasmas, as described by the Landau-Fokker-Planck equation, the method is expected to be applicable also to collision processes described by the Boltzmann equation. This scheme is similar to the previously discussed velocity-based scheme (R. Caflisch et al. (2008) [7]) and the scattering-angle-based scheme (A.M. Dimits et al. (2010) [14])], but with a firmer theoretical basis and without the inherent limitation to the Landau-Fokker-Planck case. It gives a significant performance improvement (e.g., error for a given computational effort) over the velocity-based scheme. These features are achieved by assigning passive scalars to each simulated particle and tracking their evolution through collisions. The method permits a formal error analysis that agrees with numerical results. The tests performed are for the evolution of an anisotropic Maxwellian and a bump-on-tail distribution.
