Building on prior work in this area, we present definitions and new methods for characterizing and identifying four types of periodic patterns. A unifying concept across the different types of periodic patterns we consider is the use of statistical variance to define periodicity. This lends itself to efficient variance-reduction algorithms for identifying periodic patterns. We motivate and test our approach using both extensive simulated sequences and real sequence data from online clickstream data.", "paper_title": "Discovery of Periodic Patterns in Sequence Data: A Variance-Based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000307207000003"}
