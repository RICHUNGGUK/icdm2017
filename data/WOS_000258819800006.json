It is referred to as a Parameterized Interconnect Macromodeling via a TAP (PIMTAP) algorithm. PIMTAP inherits the advantages of previous multiparameter moment-matching algorithms and avoids their shortfalls. It is numerically stable and adaptive. PIMTAP model yields the same form of the original state equations and preserves the passivity of parameterized RLC networks like the well-known method passive reduced-order interconnect macromodeling algorithm for nonparameterized RLC networks.", "paper_title": "Model order reduction of parameterized interconnect networks via a two-directional Arnoldi process", "paper_id": "WOS:000258819800006"}
