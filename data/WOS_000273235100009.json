A self-structuring Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is used to approximate the unknown nonlinear plant based on I/O data collected on-line. Both the structure and the parameters of the T-S fuzzy model are updated by an on-line clustering method and a recursive least squares estimation (RLSE) algorithm. The rules of the fuzzy model can be added, replaced or deleted on-line to allow a more flexible and compact model structure. The overall controller consists of an indirect adaptive controller and a supervisory controller. The former is the dominant controller, which maintains the closed-loop stability when the fuzzy system is a good approximation of the nonlinear plant. The latter is an auxiliary controller, which is activated when the tracking error reaches the boundary of a predefined constraint set. It is proven that global stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed in the sense that all the closed-loop signals are bounded and simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "INDIRECT ADAPTIVE CONTROLLER BASED ON A SELF-STRUCTURING FUZZY SYSTEM FOR NONLINEAR MODELING AND CONTROL", "paper_id": "WOS:000273235100009"}
