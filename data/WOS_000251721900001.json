The aim of this work is to give a fast and easy to use tool capable of predicting the behaviour and the useful life of concrete mixers through geometrical and physical parameters. Simulations were conducted in steady states and in perturbed conditions. The gear reduction unit is the part of the mixer under most stress. Results were compared with data obtained from costumers on building sites. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
