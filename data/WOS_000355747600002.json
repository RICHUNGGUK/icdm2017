Whereas computationally efficient, inductive conformal predictors sacrifice different parts of the training set at different stages of prediction, which affects their informational efficiency. This paper introduces the method of cross-conformal prediction, which is a hybrid of the methods of inductive conformal prediction and cross-validation, and studies its validity and informational efficiency empirically. The computational efficiency of cross-conformal predictors is comparable to that of inductive conformal predictors, and they produce valid predictions in our empirical studies.", "paper_title": "Cross-conformal predictors", "paper_id": "WOS:000355747600002"}
