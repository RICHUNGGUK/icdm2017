Given a dangerous state which does not happen at present, our method is able to detect a possible input fact such that, if it also occurred, the dangerous situation really would happen. This method, inspired by automatic discovery of geometric theorems, is based on calculating just one reduced Groebner basis of a polynomial ideal representing the system's knowledge. An implementation in the computer algebra system Maple is included.", "paper_title": "A Groebner bases-based approach to backward reasoning in rule based expert systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000274963400004"}
