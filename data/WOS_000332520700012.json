In this way, intermittent faults are gaining importance in modern very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits. The presence of these faults is increasing due to the complexity of manufacturing processes (which produce residues and parameter variations), together with special aging mechanisms. This work presents a case study of the impact of intermittent faults on the behavior of a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) microprocessor. We have carried out an exhaustive reliability assessment by using very-high-speed-integrated-circuit hardware description language (VHDL)-based fault injection. In this way, we have been able to modify different intermittent fault parameters, to select various targets, and even, to compare the impact of intermittent faults with those induced by transient and permanent faults.", "paper_title": "Effects of Intermittent Faults on the Reliability of a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) Microprocessor", "paper_id": "WOS:000332520700012"}
