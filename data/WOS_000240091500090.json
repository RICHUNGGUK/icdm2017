GA-based design procedure at each stage (layer) of PNN leads to the selection of preferred nodes (or PNs) with optimal parameters (such as the number of input variables, input variables, and the order of the polynomial) available within PNN. A detailed design procedure is discussed in detail. To evaluate the performance of the GA-based PNN, the model is experimented with by using Medical Imaging System (MIS) data for application to Multi-variable software process. A comparative analysis shows that the proposed GA-based PNN is model with higher accuracy as well as more superb predictive capability than other intelligent models presented previously.", "paper_title": "GA-based polynomial neural networks architecture and its application to multi-variable software process", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500090"}
