In this context, many methods proposed in literature fail for lack of generality. In particular, too weak assumptions on the noise model, e. g., stationary normal additive noise, and an inaccurate choice of the wavelet family that is applied, can lead to an information loss, noise emphasizing, unacceptable enhancement results, or in turn an unwanted distortion of the original image aspect. In this paper, we consider an optimal wavelet thresholding, in the context of Discrete Dyadic Wavelet Transforms, by directly relating all the parameters involved in both denoising and contrast enhancement to signal dependent noise variance (estimated by a robust algorithm) and to the size of cancer signs. Moreover, by performing a reconstruction from a zero-approximation in conjunction with a Gaussian smoothing filter, we are able to extract the background and the foreground of the image separately, as to compute suitable contrast improvement indexes. The whole procedure will be tested on high resolution X-ray mammographic images and compared with other techniques. Anyway, the visual assessment of the results by an expert radiologist will be also considered as a subjective evaluation.", "paper_title": "DENOISING AND ENHANCEMENT OF MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGES UNDER THE ASSUMPTION OF HETEROSCEDASTIC ADDITIVE NOISE BY AN OPTIMAL SUBBAND THRESHOLDING", "paper_id": "WOS:000282064900003"}
