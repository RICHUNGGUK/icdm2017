This scheme guarantees that a D-ary fix-free code can be obtained whenever Sigma(n)(i=1)D-li <= gamma(D), where gamma(D) is equal to 5/8 for even and very close to 5/8 for odd. This result can be regarded as an extension of Yekhanin's theorem on the existence of binary fix-free codes. In the special case D = 2, the greediness of GCAS enables us to prove that if min(i) l(i) = 2, the inequality Sigma(n)(i=1) 2(-li) <= 21/32 implies the existence of a binary fix-free code with code-lengths l(1),l(2),...,l(n) .", "paper_title": "A Kraft-Type Sufficient Condition for the Existence of D-Ary Fix-Free Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200032"}
