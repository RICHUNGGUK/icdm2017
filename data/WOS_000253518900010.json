It is shown how cylindrical coordinate colour models widely used in the literature are related to or can be reduced to the derived model, thereby contributing to creating a unified cylindrical coordinate colour model. In particular, the widely used saturation expression max(R, G, B) - min(R, G, B) is derived from the proposed model. Properties of the derived chroma and saturation expressions are examined. Finally, some applications of cylindrical coordinate colour spaces are briefly reviewed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
