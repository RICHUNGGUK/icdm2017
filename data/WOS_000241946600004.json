The WDM tributary signals are generated by direct FSK modulation on a grating coupler sampled reflector tunable laser. The resultant IM-OTDM signal is up to 20 times faster than with the tributary channels and is stable and tolerant to channel interference. All-optical demultiplexing has also been validated.
