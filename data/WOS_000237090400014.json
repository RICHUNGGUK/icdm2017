Each such pair defines a pair of conjugate representations. An example of such pairs of conjugate representations, each of which spans the M-dimensional space, are the kq representations, which are the most natural representations for periodic systems. Here, we emphasize their relevance to factorizations: the number of prime numbers that make up M relates directly to the number of conjugate pairs of kq representations. It is also shown how Schwinger's factorization procedure is used for reducing M-dimensional space into subspaces according to the prime numbers that make up M.", "paper_title": "The physics of factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000237090400014"}
