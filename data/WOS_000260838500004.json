Detecting the actual meaning of a partial cognate in context can be useful for Machine Translation tools and for Computer-Assisted Language Learning tools. We propose a supervised and a semi-supervised method to disambiguate partial cognates between two languages: French and English. The methods use only automatically-labeled data; therefore they can be applied to other pairs of languages as well. The aim of our work is to automatically detect the meaning of a French partial cognate word in a specific context.", "paper_title": "Disambiguation of partial cognates", "paper_id": "WOS:000260838500004"}
