For graphs of maximum degree at most three, we prove that this problem is polynomial-time solvable when k <= 4, and NP-hard otherwise. For graphs of maximum degree at most four, we prove that this problem is NP-hard for any fixed k >= 3. We also discuss polynomial-time approximation algorithms for computing C(3)-transversals in graphs of maximum degree at most four, based on a new decomposition theorem for such graphs that leads to useful reduction rules.", "paper_title": "Cycle transversals in bounded degree graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000288610100001"}
