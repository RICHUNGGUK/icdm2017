In this paper, we consider how single-hop physical layer security techniques can be extended to multi-hop wireless networks. We show that guaranteed security can be achieved in multi-hop networks by augmenting physical layer security techniques, such as cooperative jamming, with the higher layer network mechanisms, such as routing. Specifically, we consider the secure minimum energy routing problem, in which the objective is to compute a minimum energy path between two network nodes subject to constraints on the end-to-end communication secrecy and goodput over the path. This problem is formulated as a constrained optimization of transmission power and link selection, which is proved to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, we show that efficient algorithms exist to compute both exact and approximate solutions for the problem. In particular, we develop an exact solution of pseudo-polynomial complexity, as well as an epsilon-optimal approximation of polynomial complexity. Simulation results are also provided to show the utility of our algorithms and quantify their energy savings compared to a combination of (standard) security-agnostic minimum energy routing and physical layer security. In the simulated scenarios, we observe that, by jointly optimizing link selection at the network layer and cooperative jamming at the physical layer, our algorithms reduce the network energy consumption by half.", "paper_title": "Minimum Energy Routing and Jamming to Thwart Wireless Network Eavesdroppers", "paper_id": "WOS:000357656200009"}
