It is intended to diagnostic imaging applications such as echography. The proposed implementation allows the integration of all acquisition front end as well as signal and video processing on only one single chip. It will make possible to visualize the ultrasound images in real time. It requires high resolution and real-time image processing. The proposed design, which integrates the B-mode processing modules, includes digital beamforming, quadrature demodulation of RF signals, digital filtering, envelope detection, and video processing of the received signals. This system handles 128 scan lines and 6400 samples per scan line with a 90. angle of view span. The design uses a minimum size look-up memory to store the initial scan information. Rapid prototyping based on ARM/FPGA platform combination is used to validate the operation of the described system. This system offers signifficant advantages of portability and a rapid time to market.", "paper_title": "Toward a miniaturized generation of ultrasonic-based devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000256095700012"}
