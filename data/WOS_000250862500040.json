Using a maximum-likelihood method, based on measurements taken at different quantum efficiencies, we experimentally reconstruct the nontrivial photon statistics of the state obtained by mixing at a beam-splitter two phase-averaged coherent states. The effect of using different resolution thresholds is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Nontrivial photon statistics with low resolution-threshold photon counters", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862500040"}
