In this framework, the input models are first represented using 3D point sets and then this point-based representation is used to build a multiresolution bounding sphere hierarchy. From the leaf to root nodes, spheres of various sizes are rendered into multiple-size strokes on the canvas. The proposed sphere hierarchy is developed using multiscale region segmentation. This segmentation task assembles spheres with similar attribute regularities into a meaningful region hierarchy. These attributes include colors, positions, and curvatures. This hierarchy is very useful in the following respects: 1) it ensures the screen-space stroke density, 2) controls different input model abstractions, 3) maintains region structures such as the edges/boundaries at different scales, and 4) renders models interactively. By choosing suitable abstractions, brush stroke, and lighting parameters, we can interactively generate various painterly styles. We also propose a novel scheme that reduces the popping effect in animation sequences. Many different stylized images can be generated using the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Stylized and abstract painterly rendering system using a multiscale segmented sphere hierarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000233093500006"}
