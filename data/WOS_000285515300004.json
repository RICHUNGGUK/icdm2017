Traditionally, such applications are implemented using multicast communication. A typical multicast session requires creating the shortest-path tree to a fixed number of destinations. The fundamental issue in multicasting data to a fixed set of destinations is receiver blocking. If one of the destinations is not reachable, the entire multicast request (say, grid task request) may fail. Manycasting is a generalized variation of multicasting that provides the freedom to choose the best subset of destinations from a larger set of candidate destinations. We propose an impairment-aware algorithm to provide manycasting service in the optical layer, specifically OBS. We compare the performance of our proposed manycasting algorithm with traditional multicasting and multicast with over provisioning. Our results show a significant improvement in the blocking probability by implementing optical-layer manycasting.", "paper_title": "Quality-of-Transmission-Aware Manycasting Over Optical Burst-Switched Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285515300004"}
