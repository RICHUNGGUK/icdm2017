The geometries and electronic properties of it were investigated using density functional theory methods. The Al4C unit formally transfers six electrons to the C-80 cage which induces stabilization of Al4C@C-80. A favorable binding energy, relatively large HOMO-LUMO gap, electron affinities and ionization potentials suggested the Al4C@C-80 is rather stable. The analysis of vertical ionization potential and vertical electron affinity indicate Al4C@C-80 is a good electron acceptor.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study on aluminum carbide endohedral fullerene-Al4C@C-80", "paper_id": "WOS:000315349800022"}
