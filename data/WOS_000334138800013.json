This paper focuses on detecting smart intruders whose purpose is to cross the monitored area and who can calculate the minimum exposure path with the location information sensors. A mixture deployment of mobile and static sensors are proposed in this paper. The central idea is that mobile sensors move smartly to dynamically change the topology and minimum exposure path of whole network. Thus, even the smart intruders can be detected with a high probability. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a high detection probability with small energy consumption of mobile sensors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
