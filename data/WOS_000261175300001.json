Unlike most energy-aware scheduling algorithms that consider task ordering and voltage scaling separately from task mapping, our algorithms consider them in an integrated way. EGMS uses the concept of energy gradient to select tasks to be mapped onto new processors and voltage levels. EGMSIV extends EGMS by introducing intratask voltage scaling using a Linear Programming (LP) formulation to further reduce the energy consumption. Through rigorous simulations, we compare the performance of our proposed algorithms with a few approaches presented in the literature. The results demonstrate that our algorithms are capable of obtaining energy-efficient schedules using less optimization time. On the average, our algorithms produce schedules which consume 10 percent less energy with more than 47 percent reduction in optimization time when compared to a few approaches presented in the literature. In particular, our algorithms perform better in generating energy-efficient schedules for larger task graphs. Our results show a reduction of up to 57 percent in energy consumption for larger task graphs compared to other approaches.", "paper_title": "Design of Fast and Efficient Energy-Aware Gradient-Based Scheduling Algorithms for Heterogeneous Embedded Multiprocessor Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000261175300001"}
