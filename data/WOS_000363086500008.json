However, the PDS in this proposed framework can only be used for the protocols of the Station-to-Station family, which are signature-based authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocols. In this paper, the PDS is extended to support key exchange protocols using a trusted third party and an encryption-based authentication such as those in the Needham-Schroeder family. This is achieved by means of adding new components, refinements, and transformations to the PDS. In addition, the PCL is applied to prove the correctness of the derived protocols. Then, the derivation graph of the Needham-Schroeder family is developed by using the extended PDS. Finally, the derivations and proofs of the protocols in the Needham-Schroeder family are shown in this paper.
