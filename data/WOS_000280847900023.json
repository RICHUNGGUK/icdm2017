Thus, when k << n, the new bounds on the complexity (and construction cost) of T improve upon the previously best known bounds, which are nearly cubic in n. To obtain the above result, we study the set T-l0 of line transversals which emanate from a fixed line l(0), establish an almost tight bound of O(nk(1+epsilon)) on the complexity of T-l0, and provide a randomized algorithm which computes T-l0 in comparable expected time. Slightly improved combinatorial bounds for the complexity of T-l0 and comparable improvements in the cost of constructing this set are established for two special cases, both assuming that the polyhedra of P are pairwise disjoint: the case where l(0) is disjoint from the polyhedra of P, and the case where the polyhedra of P are unbounded in a direction parallel to l(0). Our result is related to the problem of bounding the number of geometric permutations of a collection C of k pairwise-disjoint convex sets in R-3, namely, the number of distinct orders in which the line transversals of C visit its members. We obtain a new partial result on this problem.", "paper_title": "LINE TRANSVERSALS OF CONVEX POLYHEDRA IN R-3", "paper_id": "WOS:000280847900023"}
