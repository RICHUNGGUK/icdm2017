An application example with continuous behavior as it is a typical character treat of process automation is used to illustrate the initial requirements. Accordingly, the modeling concept is presented which supports application development and which is supplemented by an implementation approach for standard automation devices, e. g., programmable logic controllers. The paper further comprises an evaluation which adapts the concept for two use cases with discrete behavior (typical character treat of manufacturing automation) and validates the initially imposed requirements.", "paper_title": "Development of PLC-Based Software for Increasing the Dependability of Production Automation Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700059"}
