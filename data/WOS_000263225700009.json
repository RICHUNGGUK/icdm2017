Due to these artifacts, the CT image may not be diagnostically usable. A new reconstruction procedure is proposed that reduces the streak artifacts and that might improve the diagnostic value of the CT images. The procedure starts with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction using an iterative reconstruction algorithm and a multimodal prior. This produces an artifact-free constrained image. This constrained image is the basis for an image-based projection completion procedure. The algorithm was validated on simulations, phantom and patient data, and compared with other metal artifact reduction algorithms.", "paper_title": "Suppression of Metal Artifacts in CT Using a Reconstruction Procedure That Combines MAP and Projection Completiond", "paper_id": "WOS:000263225700009"}
