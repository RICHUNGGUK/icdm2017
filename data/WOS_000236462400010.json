The language allows for the definition of fuzzy quantifiers of the absolute and relative kind by means of piecewise linear functions on N and Q boolean AND [0, 1] respectively. In order to reason about instances, the semantics of quantified expressions is defined based on recently developed measures of the cardinality of fuzzy sets. A procedure is described to calculate the fuzzy satisfiability of a fuzzy assertion, which is a very important reasoning task. The procedure considers several different cases and provides direct solutions for the most frequent types of fuzzy assertions.", "paper_title": "Reasoning and quantification in fuzzy description logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462400010"}
