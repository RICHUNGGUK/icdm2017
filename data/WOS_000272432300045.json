A practical clinical problem of pes cavus and pes planus classification was used as an example to explain the principal and process of the system. The system was evaluated in terms of training performance and classification accuracies, and the results showed it is high-efficient and is reliable in gait analysis (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "A novel gait analysis system based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system", "paper_id": "WOS:000272432300045"}
