Even though they are very effective for reducing static power consumption, their reliable operation can be compromised by process variations and manufacturing defects. In this paper, we propose a signature analysis technique to efficiently test power-gating structures that provide intermediate power-off modes. Based on this technique, a methodology to repair catastrophic and parametric faults, and to tolerate process variations is presented. For testing and repairing multimode power switches, we propose a robust built-in self-test and built-in self-repair scheme that reduces test cost and obviates additional manufacturing steps for post-silicon repair. Simulation results highlight the low-cost and effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting, diagnosing, and repairing defects.", "paper_title": "Built-In Self-Test, Diagnosis, and Repair of MultiMode Power Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000340528200010"}
