In particular, we focus on three features of biochemical networks that make them distinct from neural networks: their diverse, complex nodal processes, their emergent organisation, and the dynamical behaviours that result from higher-order, self-modifying processes. We also consider the growing use of evolutionary algorithms in the design of connectionist systems, noting how this enables us to explore a wider range of connectionist architectures, and how the close relationship between biochemical networks and biological evolution can guide us in this endeavour.", "paper_title": "Biochemical connectionism", "paper_id": "WOS:000328125300003"}
