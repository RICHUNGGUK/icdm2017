In contrast to the most of other application areas, military surveillance networks are usually meant to be deployed randomly. Because of its probabilistic nature, this deploying framework brings up the two most important questions related to the deployment quality: the network connectivity and the network coverage. This paper addresses the typical military surveillance scenarios. It aims to provide a qualitative analytical and simulation-based analysis on detectability of both static and moving targets. The analysis covers different aspects of the deployment modeling strategies and studies their impact on detecting the intruders or on securing a clear path from one site to another. In order the barrier coverage analysis to be conducted through simulations, a special algorithm is developed. It provides gap identification and returns the number of the potentially needed mobile nodes for the strong barrier coverage to be provided. The derived analytical and simulation results and discussions show the degree the different parameters influence the deployment quality in realistic implementations.", "paper_title": "Detectability of Static and Moving Targets in Randomly Deployed Military Surveillance Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297961000007"}
