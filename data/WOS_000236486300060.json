Standard electrocardiograms were obtained and processed by independent component analysis (ICA) to extract a unified atrial activity (AA) that takes into account the atrial contribution from each surface lead. Next, this AA has been compared with internal recordings. Main atrial frequency, cross-correlation between power spectral densities and spectral coherence have been obtained in this study. Results show that information provided by surface ICA-estimated AA allows to derive atrial surface reentries in AF patients, thus improving the noninvasive knowledge of atrial arrhythmias when internal atrial recordings are unavailable.", "paper_title": "Derivation of atrial surface reentries applying ICA to the standard electrocardiogram of patients in postoperative atrial fibrillation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300060"}
