Given an integer k >= 1 and a graph G = (V, E) with a partition V-1, ...., V-p of V, it consists in deciding whether there exists a set V* in G such that vertical bar V* boolean AND V-i vertical bar n = 1 for all i is an element of {1, ..., p}, and such that the graph induced by V* is k-colorable. We investigate the complexity status of this problem in various classes of graphs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
