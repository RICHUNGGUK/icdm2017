This paper formalizes the temperature-aware real-time MPSoC assignment and scheduling problem and presents an optimal phased steady-state mixed integer linear programming-based solution that considers the impact of scheduling and assignment decisions on MPSoC thermal profiles to directly minimize the chip peak temperature. We also introduce a flexible heuristic framework for task assignment and scheduling that permits system designers to trade off accuracy for running time when solving large problem instances. Finally, for task sets with sufficient slack, we show that inserting idle times between task executions can further reduce the peak temperature of the MPSoC quite significantly.", "paper_title": "Temperature-Aware Scheduling and Assignment for Hard Real-Time Applications on MPSoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000293755900014"}
