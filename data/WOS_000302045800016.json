There are many multiagent coordination models which require relatively high memory and computation capacities of agents; thus those models are impractical for multiple sensing agent systems where agents have very limited memories and capacities. To fully relax agents from observing and memorizing other agents' actions, this paper proposes the concept of tag vector in multiagent coordination and proposes a novel tag-based solution for data sensing conflicts in multiple sensing agent systems; in the presented tag-based solution, agents can coordinate their sensed data according to their tags. The theoretical proofs and case study prove that the proposed tag-based solution can effectively solve the data sensing conflicts by making the sensed data more consistent and reducing the coordination expense.
