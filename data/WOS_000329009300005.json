In this paper, we propose a fully optical ring NoC that combines static and dynamic wavelength allocation communication mechanisms. A different wavelength-channel is statically allocated to each destination node for light weight communication. Contention of simultaneous communication requests from multiple source nodes to the destination is solved by a token based arbitration for the particular wavelength-channel. For heavy load communication, a multiwavelength-channel is available by requesting it in execution time from source node to a special node that manages dynamic allocation of the shared multiwavelength-channel among all nodes. We combine these static and dynamic communication mechanisms in a same network that introduces selection techniques based on message size and congestion information. Using a photonic NoC simulator based on Phoenixsim, we evaluate our architecture under uniform random, neighbor, and hotspot traffic patterns. Simulation results show that our proposed fully optical ring NoC presents a good performance by utilizing adequate static and dynamic channels based on the selection techniques. We also show that our architecture can reduce by more than half, the energy consumption necessary for arbitration compared to hybrid photonic ring and mesh NoCs. A comparison with several previous works in term of architecture hardware cost shows that our architecture can be an attractive cost-performance efficient interconnection infrastructure for future SoCs and CMPs.", "paper_title": "A Fully Optical Ring Network-on-Chip with Static and Dynamic Wavelength Allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000329009300005"}
