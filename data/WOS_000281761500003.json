Superlinear convergence of sSQP had been previously established under the strong second-order sufficient condition for optimality (without any constraint qualification assumptions). We prove a stronger superlinear convergence result than the above, assuming the usual second-order sufficient condition only. In addition, our analysis is carried out in the more general setting of variational problems, for which we introduce a natural extension of sSQP techniques. In the process, we also obtain a new error bound for Karush-Kuhn-Tucker systems for variational problems that holds under an appropriate second-order condition.", "paper_title": "Stabilized sequential quadratic programming for optimization and a stabilized Newton-type method for variational problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000281761500003"}
