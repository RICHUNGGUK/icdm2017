We have used the notions of semiring and semimodule, introduced the notion of semilinear space, have given numerous examples of them and defined also the notions of linear dependence and independence. We have shown that the composition operation, which plays an essential role in the analysis of fuzzy systems because of its role in the compositional rule of inference, can be interpreted as a homomorphism between special semimodules. Consequently, this operation is, in a certain sense, a linear operation. This property formally explains why fuzzy systems are attractive for applications. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
