However, despite the demand for the fair incentive systems, those systems in academia have not been well established and fairly operated. Using an example of a professor evaluation system, we examine two main problems of the existing incentive systems in academia - ignoring the input aspect and focusing only on the short-term performance. By applying the super-efficiency DEA and considering multi-period output, we show that the input factors and the time trend of outcomes need to be incorporated for the fair evaluation of professors and their research performance.
