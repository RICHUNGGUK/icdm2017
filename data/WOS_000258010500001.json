The main step is to prove the existence of a division with remainder generalising and combining the division theorems of Grauert-Hironaka and Mora. Everything else then translates naturally, Setting either m = 0 or n = 0 we get standard bases for polynomial rings respectively for power series rings as a special case. We then apply this technique to show that the t-initial ideal of an ideal over the Puiseux series field can be read of from a standard basis of its generators. This is an important step in the constructive proof that each point in the tropical variety of such an ideal admits a lifting. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
