The portal provides a simple and public interface to a sophisticated and complex Grid application-GridSAT-running on a large set of distributed computational resources hosted in different large-scale national computing centers (i.e. the national cyberinfrastructure circa 2005). In this paper we describe the design goals of the portal and how it has influenced some of the application features. We also describe how the adaptive and self-tuning features of Grid applications (written from first principles) make the portal simpler and easier to implement.
