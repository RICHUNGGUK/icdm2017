This paper proposes two heuristic approaches aiming to build proxy problem models, solvable by computationally efficient optimization methods, in order to quickly provide a sufficiently accurate approximation of the Pareto front. The first approach builds a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MO-MILP) surrogate model of the optimization problem relying on piece-wise linear approximations of objectives and constraints obtained through brute-force sensitivity computation. The second approach builds a multi-objective nonlinear programming (MO-NLP) surrogate model using curve fitting of objectives and constraints. In both approaches the desired number of approximated solutions of the Pareto front are generated by applying the 6-constraint method to the multi-objective surrogate problems. The proposed approaches are tested for the cost vs. life cycle assessment (LCA)-based environmental optimization of drinking water production plants. The results obtained with both approaches show that a good quality approximation of Pareto front can be obtained with a significantly smaller computational time than with a state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithm.
