This behavior was described by several ethologists and fuzzy modeling allows us to transform their verbal descriptions into a well-defined mathematical model. The behavior of the resulting mathematical model, as studied using both simulations and rigorous analysis, is congruent with the behavior actually observed in nature. We believe that the fuzzy modeling approach demonstrated here may supply a suitable framework for biomimicry, that is, the design of artificial systems based on mimicking natural behavior.
