Particularly, we demonstrate CIPRNet services for critical infrastructure protection (CIP) stakeholders. The role of the proposed services is to support decisions in the CIP domain. Moreover, those services are expected to serve as the underpinnings for the European Infrastructures Simulation and Analysis Centre (EISAC) which, similarly to the US NISAC, should provide operational services on CIP, for the benefits of CI operators, stakeholders and the Public Authorities committed to CIP.", "paper_title": "Advanced services for critical infrastructures protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000365127200009"}
