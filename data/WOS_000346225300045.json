The local chromatic number of G is chi(l)(G) = min{k : G has a local k-coloring). Chartrand et al. [2] asked: does there exist a graph G(k) such that chi(l)(G(k)) = chi (G(k)) = k? Furthermore, they conjectured that for every positive integer k, there exists a graph G(k) with chi(l)(G) = k such that every local k-coloring of G(k) uses all of the colors 1, 2, ..., k. In this paper we give a affirmative answer to the problem and confirm the conjecture.
