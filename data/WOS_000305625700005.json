General MNA formulation, however, leads to a differential algebraic equation (DAE) system with singular coefficient matrix, for which most of explicit methods, which usually offer better scalability than implicit methods, are not readily available. In this paper, we develop a practical two-stage strategy to remove the singularity in MNA equations of large-scale circuit networks. A topological index reduction is first applied to reduce the DAE index of the MNA equation to one. The index-1 system is then fed into a systematic process to eliminate excess variables in one run, which leads to a nonsingular system. The whole regularization process is devised with emphasis on exact equivalence, low complexity, and sparsity preservation, and is thus well suited to handle extremely large circuits.", "paper_title": "A Practical Regularization Technique for Modified Nodal Analysis in Large-Scale Time-Domain Circuit Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000305625700005"}
