We observed that the spatial reuse index in Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs) is significantly lower than in RF networks due to the relatively low spreading loss of acoustic signals. As a result, UWSNs generally have much lower network throughput. To address this problem, we propose an Underwater, Power Control MAC protocol (UPC-MAC), which leverages dynamic transmission power adjustment and a novel rate adaptation algorithm to enhance the spatial reuse efficiency. UPC-MAC is a reservation based channel access scheme. It makes use of control packet's exchanges to collect neigh-boring nodes' data transmission requests and channel condition between senders and receivers. With such information, UPC-MAC allows for concurrent data transmissions by applying Nash Equilibrium to transmission power adjustment, which can be done independently on each sender in a distributed way. Furthermore, with the channel information, senders can adjust their data transmission rates by running a rate adaptation algorithm which considers the features of a real Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) acoustic communication system. Simulation results show that UPC-MAC outperforms Slotted FAMA in terms of network goodput and lowers the energy consumption in two representative network scenarios. The simulation results also justify that our rate adaptation algorithm does improve the performance of UPC-MAC. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
