More precisely, the form of proliferating and quiescent cell lines comes out from their relations with the whole tumor mass, giving rise to a two-dimensional diffusion process, generally time non-homogeneous. This model is able to include the effects of the mutual interactions between the two subpopulations. Estimation of the rates of the two subpopulations based on some characteristics of the involved diffusion processes is discussed when longitudinal data are available. To this aim, two procedures are presented. Some simulation results are developed in order to show the validity of these procedures as well as to compare them. An application to real data is finally presented. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
