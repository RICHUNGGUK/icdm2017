This is because such data ideally provide far more detailed information on route choice and travel patterns over a longer time period than possible from traditional travel survey methods. Wearing a GPS unit is furthermore less requiring for the respondents than filling out (large) questionnaires. It places however high requirements to the post-processing of the data. This study developed and tested a combined fuzzy logic and GIS-based algorithm to process raw GPS data. The algorithm is applied to GPS data collected in the highly complex large-scale multi-modal transport network of the Greater Copenhagen area. It detects trips, trip legs and distinguishes between five modes of transport. The algorithm was validated by comparing with a control questionnaire collected among the same persons and a sensitivity analysis was performed. This showed that the algorithm (i) identified corresponding trip legs for 82% of the reported trip legs, (ii) avoided classifying non-trips such as scatter around activities as trip legs, (iii) identified the correct mode of transport for more than 90% of trip legs, and (iv) were robust towards the specification of the model parameters and thresholds. The method thus makes it possible to use GPS for travel surveys in large-scale multi-modal networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
