This paper proposes a comprehensive computational model of emotions that can be incorporated into the physiological and social components of the emotions. Since interaction between characters call have a major impact on emotional dynamics. the model presents a social learning component for learning associations among characters, which in turn affects the character's decision-making and social interactions. The model also designs a set of personality progression function to enhance Individual differences. In addition. we demonstrate this empirically through a computer simulation of a dynamic environment inhabited by a few characters to test our emotional model. The experiments show the effectiveness of our emotional model to build believable characters during interaction with the virtual environment.", "paper_title": "Modeling emotional action for social characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000262311900002"}
