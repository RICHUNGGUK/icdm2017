It is proposed to replace wires in data centers with high data-rate, point-to-point, line of sight wireless links in the 60 GHz frequency band. Beam forming using phased-array transceivers is employed to create such links between node pairs. The simulation results performed on the designed transceiver have shown that a high beam rotation angle, small phase rotation step and low phase rotation latency are achievable. Instead of arranging server racks in rows, a polygonal arrangement of server racks has been proposed where the line of sight wireless links are formed in the enclosed space between racks. Data center topologies are emulated with the polygonal prism arrangement. A large volume of wires removed from data center enclosure would not only reduce the total infrastructure cost but also enhance the cooling efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
