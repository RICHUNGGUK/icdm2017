The properties of the new aggregation operators are pointed out and their special cases are examined. New decision making methods based on the proposed operators have been presented, and they are applied to solve a financial decision making problem, which sufficiently show the flexibility and practical advantages of our new operators and decision making methods. All the above new aggregation operators and corresponding decision making methods are further extended to the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
