Our analysis shows that only half of the terms required to annotate these reports are currently included in OBO. However, we discuss methods for filling these gaps, and our reasons for preferring the OBO Foundry approach to annotation using controlled vocabularies such as SNOMED CT, the NCI Thesaurus, RadLex and the UMLS Metathesaurus. We end with a discussion of our ongoing work on image annotation and structured reporting with ontologies.", "paper_title": "Open Biomedical Ontologies applied to prostate cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000290996800004"}
