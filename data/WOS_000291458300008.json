First of all, the largest position value (LPV) rule is proposed to convert continuous harmony vectors into job permutations. Second, an efficient initialization scheme based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic is presented to construct the initial harmony memory with a certain level of quality and diversity. Third, harmony search is employed to evolve harmony vectors in the harmony memory to perform exploration, whereas a local search algorithm based on the insert neighborhood is embedded to enhance the local exploitation ability. Moreover, a new pitch adjustment rule is developed to well inherit good structures from the global-best harmony vector. Computational simulations and comparisons demonstrated the superiority of the proposed hybrid harmony search algorithm in terms of solution quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
