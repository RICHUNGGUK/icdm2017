This includes the well-known Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson classical zero-knowledge protocols for graph isomorphism and graph 3-coloring (assuming the existence of quantum computationally concealing commitment schemes in the second case). Also included is a quantum interactive proof system for a complete problem for the complexity class of problems having honest verifier quantum statistical zero-knowledge proofs, which therefore establishes that honest verifier and general quantum statistical zero-knowledge are equal: QSZK = QSZK(HV). Previously no nontrivial interactive proof systems were known to be zero-knowledge against quantum attacks, except in restricted settings such as the honest verifier and common reference string models. This paper therefore establishes for the first time that true zero-knowledge is indeed possible in the presence of quantum information and computation.", "paper_title": "ZERO-KNOWLEDGE AGAINST QUANTUM ATTACKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000267744400003"}
