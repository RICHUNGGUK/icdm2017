We discover an infinite family of 1-designs with at most two block intersection numbers that each have a unique unrefinable decomposition, and we give a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an unrefinable decomposition for each such design from the family. Combinatorial designs from this family include: finite projective planes of order n; SOMAs, and more generally, partial linear spaces of order (s, t) on (s + 1)(2) points; as well as affine designs, and more generally, strongly resolvable designs with no repeated blocks.", "paper_title": "On the structure of 1-designs with at most two block intersection numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000247208100005"}
