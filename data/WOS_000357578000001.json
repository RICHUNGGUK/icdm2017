The scenario is applicable in many industrial settings and is interesting from the academic perspective. We present a new dataset geared for the main characteristics of the scenario, and utilize it to investigate the name-based TC approach, which uses the category names as its only input and does not require training data. We evaluate and analyze the performance of state-of-the-art methods for this dataset to identify the shortcomings of these methods for our scenario, and suggest ways for overcoming these shortcomings. We utilize statistical correlation measured over a target corpus for improving the state-of-the-art, and offer a different classification scheme based on the characteristics of the setting. We evaluate our improvements and adaptations and show superior performance of our suggested method.", "paper_title": "Text Categorization from category name in an industry-motivated scenario", "paper_id": "WOS:000357578000001"}
