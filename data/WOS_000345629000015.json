In the literature, principal component pursuit solves low-rank matrix recovery problem via a convex program of mixed nuclear norm and l(1) norm. Inspired by reweighted l(1) minimization for sparsity enhancement, we propose reweighting singular values to enhance low rank of a matrix. An efficient iterative reweighting scheme is proposed for enhancing low rank and sparsity simultaneously and the performance of low-rank matrix recovery is prompted greatly. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method both on numerical simulations and real images/videos restoration, including single image restoration, hyperspectral image restoration, and background modeling from corrupted observations. All of these experiments give empirical evidence on significant improvements of the proposed algorithm over previous work on low-rank matrix recovery.", "paper_title": "Reweighted Low-Rank Matrix Recovery and its Application in Image Restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000345629000015"}
