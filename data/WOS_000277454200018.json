Hence, their scheduling algorithms have to concern not only network-oriented quality-of-service (QoS) profiles, but also application-oriented QoS targets. This is particularly challenging for satellite multimedia networks that lack fast closed-loop power control and reliable feedbacks. In this paper, we present a cross-layer packet scheduling scheme, namely Hybrid Queuing and Reception Adaptation (HQRA), which performs joint adaptations by considering the traffic information and QoS targets from the applications, the queuing dynamics induced from the network, as well as the end-to-end performance and channel variations from respective users. By jointly optimizing multiple performance criteria at different layers, the scheme enjoys quality-driven, channel-dependant, and network-aware features. HQRA can well accommodate return link diversity and the imperfect feedbacks, whilst ensuring robustness in highly heterogeneous and dynamic satellite environments. We evaluate its performance over diverse network and media configurations in comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions. We observe noticeable performance gains on application-oriented QoS, bandwidth utilization, and objective video quality, together with favorable fairness and scalability measures.", "paper_title": "Cross-layer quality-driven adaptation for scheduling heterogeneous multimedia over 3G satellite networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000277454200018"}
