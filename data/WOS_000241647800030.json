We introduce two kinds of data replication techniques, called owner-initiated data replication and client-initiated data replication, that are developed to support data replica consistency without requiring any special file system-level locking functions. Also, we present performance results on Linux clusters located at Sejong University.", "paper_title": "The consistent data replication service for distributed computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800030"}
