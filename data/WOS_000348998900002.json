This paper proposes a very low complexity Intercarrier Interference (ICI) cancellation scheme that performs as other existing methods, while reducing significantly the hardware resources consumption. The proposed method is based on implementing a reduced version of the leakage matrix, that models the ICI in a mobile channel. Simulation results show a gain in the carrier to noise ratio C/N up to 9 dB for a bit error rate BER = 10(-5) when compared to a DVB-SH receiver with no ICI compensation. In terms of receiver speed, simulations show an improvement up to 50 % in the best case.", "paper_title": "Low Complexity Intercarrier Interference Cancellation for DVB-SH Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000348998900002"}
