Since finding the minimum number of rebroadcast nodes in general ad hoc networks is NP-hard, current broadcast protocols either employ heuristic algorithms or assume extra knowledge such as position or two-hop neighbor table. However, the ZigBee network is characterized as low data rate and low cost. It cannot provide position or two-hop neighbor information, but it still requires an efficient broadcast algorithm that can reduce the number of rebroadcast nodes with limited computation complexity and storage space. To this end, this paper proposes self-pruning and forward node selection algorithms that exploit the hierarchical address space in ZigBee networks. Only one-hop neighbor information is needed; a partial list of two-hop neighbors is derived without exchanging messages between neighboring nodes. The ZigBee forward node selection algorithm finds the minimum rebroadcast nodes set with polynomial computation time and memory space. Using the proposed localized algorithms, it is proven that the entire network is covered. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance improvement in terms of the number of rebroadcast nodes, number of duplicated receivings, coverage time, and communication overhead.", "paper_title": "Tree-based data broadcast in IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240544700007"}
