Some people use collaborative filtering methods to analyze learners' profiles and provide recommendation to a new learners, but this methods provides false recommendations from beginners. We present a new method, which provides recommendations that depend on the credibility rather than the number of learners. We have designed, implemented, and tested what we call the Intelligent E-Course Agent (IECA). Our evaluation experiment shows that our approach greatly improves learners' knowledge and therefore presents a course that is more closely related to their needs.", "paper_title": "The pyramid collaborative filtering method: Toward an efficient E-Course", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100025"}
