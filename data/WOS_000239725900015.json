Combo provides two different visualization perspectives. The perpendicular (dot plot) view provides a dot plot of genome alignments synchronized with a display of genome annotations along each axis. The parallel view displays two genome annotations horizontally, synchronized through a panel displaying local alignments as trapezoids. Users can zoom to any resolution, from whole chromosomes to individual bases. They can select, highlight and view detailed information from specific alignments and annotations. Combo is an organism agnostic and can import data from a variety of file formats.", "paper_title": "Combo: a whole genome comparative browser", "paper_id": "WOS:000239725900015"}
