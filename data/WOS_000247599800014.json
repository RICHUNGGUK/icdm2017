A good part of beverages are made from fruits, for example apple juice and vine. A mathematical model was developed to predict uptake of neutral organic chemicals from soil and air into fruits. The new fruit tree model considers eight compartments, i.e. two soil compartments, fine roots, thick roots, stem, leaves, fruits, and air. Chemical equilibrium, advective transport in xylem and phloem, diffusive exchange to soil and air and growth dilution are the main processes. The parameterization is for a square-meter of an apple orchard. The model predicts that polar, non-volatile compounds will effectively be transported from soil to fruits, while lipophilic compounds will preferably accumulate from air into fruits. Results from various experiments show no disagreement with the model predictions.", "paper_title": "Fruit Tree model for uptake of organic compounds from soil and air", "paper_id": "WOS:000247599800014"}
