We propose a self-evaluation model to determine the attitudinal character for each alternative in multicriteria decision making with MEOWA operators. The value of the attitudinal character determined for each alternative by self-evaluation may be different; and each alternative can reach its highest rank with MEOWA weights, when the attitudinal character is determined for it. Then, to obtain an overall set of MEOWA weights by different attitudinal character values, the preemptive goal programming (PGP) model proposed by Wang can be used. Finally, the evaluation process of the service quality for five online stores is given to illustrate the application of the proposed method.
