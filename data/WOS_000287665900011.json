The results are evidence for a remarkable internationalization of psychological research, starting in the mid 1970s and increasing in rate at the beginning of the 1990s.

Thus, international collaboration in psychology is obviously on the rise.", "paper_title": "International collaboration in psychology is on the rise", "paper_id": "WOS:000287665900011"}
