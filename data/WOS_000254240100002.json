A hierarchical representation formed by an octree is a data structure to skip over transparent regions while requiring little preprocessing and data storage. However, in order to skip over an octant estimated to be transparent (a transparent octant), the distance from a boundary to another boundary of the octant should be calculated. Because the distance computation is expensive, we propose a precomputed data structure, the distance template, which stores direction and distance values from one boundary voxel on a face to all the boundary voxels on the remaining five faces. In the rendering step, if a ray reaches a transparent octant, it leaps over the octant by referring to the stored distance value.", "paper_title": "A distance template for octree traversal in CPU-based volume ray casting", "paper_id": "WOS:000254240100002"}
