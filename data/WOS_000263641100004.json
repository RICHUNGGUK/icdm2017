At the same time, wireless controls pose new design challenges because network and control performance affect each other. We focus our study on a wireless, mobile, multihop, robot-control scenario and compare the applicability of standard routing protocols and two network-aware control methods in realistic simulations. The scenario is demanding - with high mobility causing link breaks - and stresses the routing and control algorithms. The system is modeled and evaluated on a platform for integrated control and communication co-simulator. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated not only at the network layer, but also from the application viewpoint, in this case the mobile robot-control system.", "paper_title": "WIRELESS CONTROL OF A MULTIHOP MOBILE ROBOT SQUAD", "paper_id": "WOS:000263641100004"}
