Different from traditional networks with central control, BSs should operate in a self-organizing way (i) to support stable high-throughput green communications (ii) to avoid inter/intra cell interference, and (iii) to implement in an ease and backward compatible way; and resource management is thus a critical step to satisfy (i), (ii), and (iii). We first systematically present radio resource management based on extensive literature survey. To optimize system performance, we develop the cognitive resource management for wireless mesh networks with self-organizing BSs to utilize entire available spectrum, while BSs collect channel state information of each user by spectrum sensing. From numerical results, our resource management can significantly improve network throughput over the benchmark system, which suggests good potential for many wireless systems such as LTE-A and WiMAX 2 that are adopting mesh network architecture, to achieve universal frequency reuse.
