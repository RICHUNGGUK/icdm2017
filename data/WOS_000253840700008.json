After an expression of the likelihood ratio estimator or parameter sensitivity is introduced, the direct estimators, and conditional expectation estimators are derived. The analytical results in a study by Lam & Ng were used to verify the algorithms presented in this paper. Numerical examples of highly reliable linear, and circular C (4, 50: F), and C (4,100: F) systems were illustrated to compare the algorithm efficiencies of DS, and CEE and CEE was found to be remarkably more efficient than DS.", "paper_title": "Estimation of dependability measures and parameter sensitivities of a consecutive-k-out-of-n: F repairable system with (k-1)-step Markov dependence by simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253840700008"}
