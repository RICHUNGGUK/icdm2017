QCA supports the new devices with nanotechnology architecture. This technique works based on electron interactions inside quantum-dots leading to emergence of quantum features and decreasing the problem of future integrated circuits in terms of size. In this paper, we will successfully design, implement and simulate a new full adder based on QCA with the minimum delay, area and complexities. Also, new XOR gates will be presented which are used in 8-bit controllable inverter in QCA. Furthermore, a new 8-bit full adder is designed based on the majority gate in the QCA, with the minimum number of cells and area which combines both designs to implement an 8-bit adder/subtractor in the QCA. This 8-bit adder/subtractor circuit has the minimum delay and complexity. Being potentially pipeline, the QCA technology calculates the maximum operating speed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
