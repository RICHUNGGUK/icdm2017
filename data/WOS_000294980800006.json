The module requires extra installation effort and parameterisation, so this article aims to explain to the many potentially interested libraries, especially from the target-group of ABCD users, why and how to use the module in comparison with the basic loans module. Design/methodology/approach - After a brief history the technical concepts of the software and the required technical skills to use them are described. Findings - The article concludes that for libraries with specific conditions (external user registration, high transactional volumes, multi-policy) the extra burden of installing the software might be worth the effort. Practical implications - The installation and configuration of the software are briefly described and the possible gains offered by the software are highlighted. Originality/value - Potential users of the ABCD software will get useful information for helping to decide whether to use the additional advanced loans module.", "paper_title": "Special features of the advanced loans module of the ABCD integrated library system", "paper_id": "WOS:000294980800006"}
