In the existing methods, IMC is performed to deal with the UMV in the spatial domain after the inverse DCT (IDCT). We propose an IMC method which can deal with the UMV directly in the DCT domain without the use of the IDCT/DCT required by the existing methods. The computational complexity of the proposed method can be reduced by about half of that of the brute-force method operating in the spatial domain. Experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently reduce the processing time with similar visual quality.", "paper_title": "Inverse motion compensation for DCT block with unrestricted motion vectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934000010"}
