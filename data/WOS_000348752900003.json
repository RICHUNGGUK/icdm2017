The dual migration architecture is divided into two parts: static migration and dynamic migration. The dual migration architecture takes users'f geographical location into account, guiding users to access mobile cloud services from the nearest servers, thus shortening the transmission path between users and servers and effectively reducing transmission delay time, which would all guarantee users good quality of mobile cloud services while or after moving.", "paper_title": "Dual migration for mobile cloud service in 4G/LTE network", "paper_id": "WOS:000348752900003"}
