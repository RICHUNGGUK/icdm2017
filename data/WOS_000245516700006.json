Design/methodology/approach - In this study, two techniques, finite element analysis and numerical optimization, are employed to find out the optimal solution within the various constraints. Findings - The result shows that the total weight of sampling drill-bits was reduced over 76.7 percent. Originality/value - The proposed methodology can also be applied in different engineering design applications and provides a total integrated solution as a generic template for design engineers.", "paper_title": "Weight optimization of sampling instruments for ESA Mars Express Mission", "paper_id": "WOS:000245516700006"}
