It is the key for the whole network performance and needs to be designed carefully. Existing routing metrics have at least one of the limitations listed below. (1) Internet-oriented traffic is considered only, and client-oriented traffic is omitted, or vice versa. (2) Route selection is done in mesh network with a single gateway, so route selection is only related to selecting a route path without selecting gateway node. (3) The isotonic requirement cannot be satisfied. In order to conquer the limitations aforementioned and guide route selection, an isotonic differentiated service based interference-aware routing metric is proposed for mesh networks with multiple gateways. Traffic pattern, node load, gateway load, and intraflow and interflow interference are all taken into consideration to guide the selection of best path and best gateway. Simulations reveal that the proposed metric outperforms state-of-art metrics in terms of the average network throughput and average end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "Differentiated Service Based Interference-Aware Routing for Multigateway Multiradio Multichannel Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000338874900001"}
