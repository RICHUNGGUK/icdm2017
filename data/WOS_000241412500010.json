In order to handle complex physical characteristics such as dwell interleaving, transmitting duty cycle constraint, and energy constraint, we propose a notion of schedulability envelope. The schedulability envelope designed offline hides the details of complex radar dwell scheduling and provides a simple measure for the schedulability check. Using the schedulability envelope, the proposed technique can efficiently perform the admission control for dynamic target tracking tasks. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the system utilization by taking advantage of dwell interleaving while guaranteeing the schedulability and physical constraints.", "paper_title": "Schedulability envelope for real-time radar dwell scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000241412500010"}
