Therefore, efficient methods are required to solve it. In this paper, a recent optimization technique, namely mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) is implemented to solve the combined heat and power economic dispatch (CHPED) problem with bounded feasible operating region. Three test cases taken from the literature are used to evaluate the exploring ability of MADS. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and design and analysis of computer experiments (DACE) surrogate algorithms are used as powerful SEARCH strategies in the MADS algorithm to improve its effectiveness. The numerical results demonstrate that the utilized MADS-LHS, MADS-PSO, MADS-DACE algorithms have acceptable performance when applied to the CHPED problems. The results obtained using the MADS-DACE algorithm are considerably better than or as well as the best known solutions reported previously in the literature. In addition to the superior performance, MADS-DACE provides significant savings of computational effort. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
