We show that both methods are of comparable efficiency but axe optimized for different platforms. Parallel tempering should be chosen on multi-processor system while Wang-Landau sampling is easier to implement on a single-processor computer.", "paper_title": "Numerical comparison of Wang-Landau sampling and parallel tempering for met-enkephalin", "paper_id": "WOS:000238706700005"}
