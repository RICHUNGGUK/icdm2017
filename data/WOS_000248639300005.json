This paper proposes a novel theoretic framework, geometric structure, to conquer this problem. In order to discover the intrinsic geometric structures of general surfaces, we developed a theoretic rigorous and practical efficient method, Discrete Variational Ricci flow. Different geometries study the invariants under the corresponding transformation groups. The same geometry can be defined oil various manifolds, whereas the same manifold allows different geometries. Geometric structures allow different geometries to be defined on various manifolds, therefore algorithms based on the corresponding geometric invariants can be applied on the manifold domains directly. Surfaces have natural geometric structures, such as spherical structure, affine structure, projective structure, hyperbolic structure and conformal structure. Therefore planar algorithms based on these geometries can be defined on surfaces straightforwardly. Computing the general geometric structures on surfaces has been a long lasting open problem. We solve the problem by introducing a novel method based on discrete variational Ricci flow. We thoroughly explain both theoretical and practical aspects of the computational methodology for geometric structures based on Ricci flow, and demonstrate several important applications of geometric structures: generalizing Voronoi diagram algorithms to surfaces via Euclidean structure, cross global parametrization between high genus surfaces via hyperbolic structure, generalizing planar splines to manifolds via affine structure. The experimental results show that our method is rigorous and efficient and the framework of geometric structures is general and powerful. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
