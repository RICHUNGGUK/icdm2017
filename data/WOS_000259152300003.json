In the present study, we investigate how to perform rebalancing at the least cost. In the present paper, we use VaR as a risk measure and formulate portfolio rebalancing problems with an optimization model by considering the requirements with risk and return of a portfolio as the constraints and rebalancing cost as the objective. Since the model built herein is a nonlinear integer programming model, conventional combinatorial optimization methods are ineffective. In the present paper, we first propose a soft method for solving this complicated model and then test the model and the soft method by conducting portfolio rebalancing experiments on the New York stock market.", "paper_title": "Portfolio rebalancing with VaR as risk measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300003"}
