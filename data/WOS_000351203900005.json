Our algorithm expects input specified as an Industry Foundation Classes model, accepts a wide variety of input geometry, and is capable of accounting for a building's construction material configuration as well as its geometry. The described approach is limited to solid-to-solid heat exchange; solid-to-fluid and fluid-to-fluid heat exchanges are not considered. We analyze the performance of our algorithm on some test building models.", "paper_title": "An algorithm to generate space boundaries for building energy simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351203900005"}
