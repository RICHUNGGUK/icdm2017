The network is divided into inner and outer regions according to the distance between nodes and the base station. The inner region is consisted of several layers and nodes in outer region are deployed in grids of different sizes. Sensor data is collected by nodes in outer region and then is be transmitted to the inner region. Nodes in the inner region do data fusion and forward data from the lower layer to the higher one. Simulation results show that, compared with MTP and CDFUD, the proposed algorithm performs well in balance of energy consumption and could effectively prolong the network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Energy-Balanced Uneven Clustering Protocol Based on Regional Division for Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364665100001"}
