From the convergence study it has emerged that for both two and three-dimensional problems, the implemented elements show a convergence rate virtually equal to the corresponding theoretical values. Recommendations on optimal element size are also provided. Furthermore, the ability of the proposed methodology to remove singularities in statics has been demonstrated through a couple of examples, in both two and three dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
