A minimum FVS/FAS is an FVS/FAS which contains the smallest number of vertices/arcs. Hsu et al. [11] first proposed an algorithm which can find a minimum FA'S in a rotator graph. In this paper, we present a formula for finding an FAS for a rotator graph and prove that the FAS is minimum. This formula can be easily implemented by an efficient algorithm which obtains a minimum FAS in a rotator graph. Finally, we also present a concise formula for finding a minimum FAS in an incomplete rotator graph in this paper.", "paper_title": "MINIMUM FEEDBACK ARC SETS IN ROTATOR AND INCOMPLETE ROTATOR GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306071800009"}
