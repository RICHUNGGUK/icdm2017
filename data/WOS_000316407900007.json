Assuming that 1) u and v are two sparse vectors with (lambda) under bar (u, v) = theta and 2) the sensing matrix Phi satisfies RIP, this paper is aimed at analytically characterizing the achievable angles between Phi u and Phi v. Motivated by geometric interpretations of RIP and with the aid of the well-known law of cosines, we propose a plane-geometry-based formulation for the study of the considered problem. It is shown that all the RIP-induced norm/distance constraints on Phi u and Phi v can be jointly depicted via a simple geometric diagram in the 2-D plane. This allows for a joint analysis of all the considered algebraic constraints from a geometric perspective. By conducting plane geometry analyses based on the constructed diagram, closed-form formulas for the maximal and minimal achievable angles are derived. Computer simulations confirm that the proposed solution is tighter than an existing algebraic-based estimate derived using the polarization identity. The obtained results are used to derive a tighter restricted isometry constant of structured sensing matrices of a certain kind, to wit, those in the form of a product of an orthogonal projection matrix and a random sensing matrix. Follow-up applications in CS are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Achievable Angles Between Two Compressed Sparse Vectors Under Norm/Distance Constraints Imposed by the Restricted Isometry Property: A Plane Geometry Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000316407900007"}
