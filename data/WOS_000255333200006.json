In addition, without proper and reliable security protection, the wide spread use of agent technology in real world applications could be impeded. In this paper, evaluation of the Recorded State Mechanism (RSM) previously proposed by the authors is presented. The evaluation examines the RSM security protection and implementation overhead, in order to analyse the RSM security strength and implementation feasibility in real world application.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of tine recorded state mechanism for protecting agent integrity against malicious hosts", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333200006"}
