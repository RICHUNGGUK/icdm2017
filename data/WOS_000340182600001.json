For this reason, in this paper, an optimized strategy coverage control (OSCC) algorithm is proposed. First of all, a relation mapping model of sensor nodes and target nodes is established by OSCC which is based on geometric figure and related theories, probability theory, converge property, and so forth to complete effective reasoning and calculate certain network models. Secondly, OSCC makes efficient analysis of the calculating results figure out the least number of sensor nodes to cover specific monitoring area. Thirdly, OSCC picks out the optimal routing solution while conducting combinatorial optimization of routing path using ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, thus reducing the energy spending of whole network. In the end, this paper verifies OSCC algorithm by simulation experiment and proves it can use least sensor nodes to effectively cover target area. Also, OSCC helps greatly reduce network energy consuming, minimize network resources layout costs, and enhance network life cycle, simultaneously.", "paper_title": "An Optimized Strategy Coverage Control Algorithm for WSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000340182600001"}
