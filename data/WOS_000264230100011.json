We decompose the complexity of solving the 8-dof transformation between image pairs into two problems, that is, rectification and registration. This is achievable under a key assumption that sufficient text content forms orthogonal texture flows on the document surface. First, perspective distortion and rotation are removed from images using the texture flow information. Next, the translation and scaling are resolved by a Hough transform-like voting method. In the image composition part, Our contribution is a sharpness based selection process which composes a seamless and blur free mosaic for text content. Experiments show that our approach can produce an accurate, sharp, and high resolution mosaic of a full document page from small image patches Captured by a camera with various zooms and poses.
