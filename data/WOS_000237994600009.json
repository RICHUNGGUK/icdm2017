Comprehensively, these strategies are called a distributed slots reservation protocol (DSRP). In DSRP, QoS routing only depends on one-hop neighboring information of each mobile host (MH). In addition, slot inhibited policies (SIPs) and slot decision policies (SDPs) are proposed to determine which slots are valid to use and which slots in the valid slots can be used actually, respectively. In SDPs, three heuristic policies, 3BDP, LCFP, and MRFP, are proposed to increase the success rate of a QoS route and alleviate the slot shortage problems. Moreover, a slot adjustment protocol (SAP) is proposed for a conflicting MH to coordinate the slot usage of its neighbors during the route reservation phase in order to accommodate more routes in the network. The slot adjustment algorithm (SAA) invoked in SAP is a branch-and-bound algorithm, which is an optimum algorithm in terms of the number of slots to be adjusted, on the premise that not to break down any existing route. QoS route maintenance and improvement are also provided. By the simulation results, the proposed protocol cannot only increase the success rate in search of a route with bandwidth requirement guaranteed but also raise the throughput and efficiency of the network.
