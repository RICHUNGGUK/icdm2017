The paper deals with multi-layer optimization in service oriented sensor grid to optimize utility function of sensor grid, subject to resource constraints at resource layer, service composition constraints at service layer and user preferences constraints at application layer respectively. The multi-layer optimization problem can be decomposed into three subproblems: sensor grid resource allocation problem, service composing problem, and user satisfaction degree maximization problem, all of which interact through the optimal variables for capacities of sensor grid resources and service demand. The proposed algorithm decomposes global sensor grid optimization problem into a sequence of three subproblems at three layers via an iterative algorithm. The simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of the multi-layer optimization algorithm. The experiments compare the performance of the multi-layer global optimization approach with application layer local optimization and resource layer local optimization approach respectively.
