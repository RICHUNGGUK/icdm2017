We consider the beam problem, with a forward peaked source on phase-space, and derive P-1 approximation with a diffusion coefficient of 1/2 sigma(tr), (versus 1/3 sigma(tr) of the three dimensional problem), where sigma(tr) is the transport cross section. Further assumptions as peaked sigma(s) (theta) near theta = 0 (small angle of scattering), and small angle of flight (theta approximate to 0) yield Fokker-Planck and Fermi approximations with the diffusion coefficients sigma(tr) (rather than sigma(tr)/2 of the three dimensional case). We discretize the problem using four different Galerkin schemes and justify the results through some numerical examples. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
