However, it is possible that such supposition is violated in practice due to model misspecification or disturbances of the phenomenon not captured by the predictive models. It may lead to statistically biased and/or inefficient predictors. The present paper introduces an approach to correct predetermined forecasters by recursively modeling their remaining residuals. Two formalisms are used to illustrate the recursive approach: the well-known (linear) autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and the (non-linear) Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These models are recursively adjusted to the remaining residuals of a given forecaster until a white noise behavior is achieved. Applications involving ARIMA and ANN forecasters for Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, S&P500 Index, Google Stock Value, Nasdaq Index, Wolf's Sunspot, and Canadian Lynx data series indicate the usefulness of the proposed framework.
