The random sources of CFRO lie in delay variations (jitter), unpredictable transition behaviors as well as metastability. The CFRO is proved to be truly random by restarting from the same initial states. Compared with the so-called Fibonacci Ring Oscillator (FIRO) and Galois Ring Oscillator (GARO), the CFRO needs less than half of their time to accumulate relatively high entropy and enable extraction of one random bit. Only a simple XOR corrector is used to reduce the bias of output sequences. TRNG based on CFRO can be run continuously at a constant high speed of 150 Mbps. For higher security, the TRNG can be set in stateless mode at a cost of slower speed of 10 Mbps. The total logical resources used are relatively small and no special placement and routing is needed. The TRNG both in continuous mode and in stateless mode can pass the NIST tests and the DIEHARD tests.", "paper_title": "A Digital TRNG Based on Cross Feedback Ring Oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000330553400032"}
