At each alignment our bit-parallel algorithms process a q-gram before testing the state variable. In addition we apply reading a 2-gram in one instruction. Our point of view is practical efficiency of algorithms. Our experiments show that the new variations are faster than earlier algorithms in many cases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
