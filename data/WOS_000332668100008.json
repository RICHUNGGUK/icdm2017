However, cloud service typically come with various levels of services and performance characteristics, which makes Quality of Cloud Service (QoCS) high variance. Hence, it is difficult for the users to evaluate these cloud services and select them to fit their QoCS requirements. In this paper, we propose an accurate evaluation approach of QoCS in service-oriented cloud computing. We first employ fuzzy synthetic decision to evaluate cloud service providers according to cloud users' preferences and then adopt cloud model to computing the uncertainty of cloud services based on monitored QoCS data. Finally, we obtain the evaluation results of QoCS using fuzzy logic control. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach can perform an accurate evaluation of QoCS in service-oriented cloud computing.", "paper_title": "Towards an accurate evaluation of quality of cloud service in service-oriented cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000332668100008"}
