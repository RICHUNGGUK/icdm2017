In this paper, we present a new method for evaluating students' answerscripts using vague values, where the evaluating marks awarded to the questions in the students' answerscripts are represented by vague values. The vague mark awarded to each question of a student's answerscript can be regarded as a vague set, where each element in the universe of discourse belonging to the vague set is represented by a vague value. An index of optimism lambda determined by the evaluator is used to indicate the degree of optimism of the evaluator, where lambda is an element of [0,1]. The larger the value of lambda, the more optimistic the evaluator. The smaller the value of lambda, the more pessimistic the evaluator. The proposed method can evaluate students' answerscripts in a more flexible and more intelligent manner.", "paper_title": "Evaluating students' answerscripts using vague values", "paper_id": "WOS:000252386200006"}
