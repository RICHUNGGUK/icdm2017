This is made possible by a novel multi-scale analysis of unstructured point-clouds that automatically extracts the number of relevant features together with their respective scale all over the surface. Then, combining this ingredient with an adequate multi-scale decomposition allows us to directly enhance or reduce each feature in an independent manner. Our feature extraction is based on the analysis of the scale-variations of locally fitted surface primitives combined with unsupervised learning techniques. Our tool may be applied either globally or locally, and millions of points are handled in real-time. The resulting system enables users to accurately edit complex geometries with minimal interaction.", "paper_title": "Adaptive multi-scale analysis for point-based surface editing", "paper_id": "WOS:000344369200018"}
