The performance of this algorithm is determined by the speed at which the fermion operator is applied to a given vector, as it is the central operation in the preconditioned conjugate gradient iteration. We study a simple implementation of these operations for the fermion matrix of the Hubbard model in d + 1 spacetime dimensions, and report a performance comparison between a 2.66 GHz Intel Xeon E5430 CPU and an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 CPU using double-precision arithmetic. We find speedup factors ranging between 30 and 350 for d = 1, and in excess of 40 for d = 3. We argue that such speedups are of considerable impact for large-scale simulational studies of quantum many-body systems.
