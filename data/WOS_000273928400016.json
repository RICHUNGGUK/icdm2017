The primary goal is to insert as many double vias as possible, and maximizing the number of on-track double vias is a secondary objective. We present a zero-one integer linear program-based approach to optimally solve the DVI/ON problem. Moreover, we also discuss a special case of the DVI/ON problem and present a maximum-weighted bipartite matching-based optimal approach. Experimental results indicate that our approaches outperform existing algorithms in terms of solution quality.", "paper_title": "Optimal Double Via Insertion With On-Track Preference", "paper_id": "WOS:000273928400016"}
