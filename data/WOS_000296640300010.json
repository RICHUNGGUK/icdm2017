A band-pass filter between 8 and 20 Hz followed by rectification, and then a low-pass filter at 6 Hz are used for QRS detection. QRS subtraction was performed using three different approaches: flat, linear and spline interpolations. QRS subtraction affects the power of the signals but it normally does not affect the dominant frequency. The average power of the atrial electrograms after QRS subtraction is significantly reduced for frequencies above 10 Hz.", "paper_title": "QRS subtraction for atrial electrograms: flat, linear and spline interpolations", "paper_id": "WOS:000296640300010"}
