This work presents novel analysis and optimization techniques to enhance the performance of GTC on large-scale machines. We introduce cell access analysis to better manage locality vs. synchronization tradeoffs on CPU and GPU-based architectures. Our optimized hybrid parallel implementation of GTC uses MPI, OpenMP, and NVIDIA CUDA, achieves up to a 2x speedup over the reference Fortran version on multiple parallel systems, and scales efficiently to tens of thousands of cores.", "paper_title": "Analysis and optimization of gyrokinetic toroidal simulations on homogenous and heterogenous platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000325972000008"}
