When using active cameras to capture events distributed throughout a large area, human control becomes impractical and unreliable. This has led to the development of automated approaches for online camera control. We introduce a new automated camera control approach that consists of a stochastic performancemetric and a constrained optimizationmethod. The metric quantifies the uncertainty in the state of multiple points on each target. It uses state-space methods with stochastic models of target dynamics and camera measurements. It can account for occlusions, accommodate requirements specific to the algorithms used to process the images, and incorporate other factors that can affect their results. The optimization explores the space of camera configurations over time under constraints associated with the cameras, the predicted target trajectories, and the image processing algorithms. The approach can be applied to conventional surveillance tasks (e. g., tracking or face recognition), as well as tasks employing more complex computer vision methods (e. g., markerless motion capture or 3D reconstruction).", "paper_title": "Online Control of Active Camera Networks for Computer Vision Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330625100008"}
