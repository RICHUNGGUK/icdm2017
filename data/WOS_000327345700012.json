In this paper, we propose a view-invariant discriminative projection (ViDP) method, to improve the discriminative ability of multi-view gait features by a unitary linear projection. It is implemented by iteratively learning the low dimensional geometry and finding the optimal projection according to the geometry. By virtue of ViDP, the multi-view gait features can be directly matched without knowing or estimating the viewing angles. The ViDP feature projected from gait energy image achieves promising performance in the experiments of multi-view gait-based identification. We suggest that it is possible to construct a gait-based identification system for arbitrary probe views, by incorporating the information of gallery data with sufficient viewing angles. In addition, ViDP performs even better than the state-of-the-art view transformation methods, which are trained for the combination of gallery and probe viewing angles in every evaluation.", "paper_title": "View-Invariant Discriminative Projection for Multi-View Gait-Based Human Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000327345700012"}
