For a first, well-known, series of instances, the average errors of the evolutionary and neural network heuristics are over 10% and more than 1000 times larger than that of VNS. For a second series, this error is about 3% while the errors of the parallel VNS and of a hybrid heuristic are about 0.01% and that of parallel scatter search even smaller.", "paper_title": "Complement to a comparative analysis of heuristics for the p-median problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000251620300004"}
