However, the intrinsic nature of the problem (acquisition constraints and real objects complexity) makes hole filling and mesh completion still critical tasks for the effectual finalization of the models. In this work, we propose a new solution for filling holes and gaps and for reconstructing missing parts of mesh models that is capable to guarantee the full preservation of the input mesh. On the implicit function obtained from a Poisson Reconstruction computed on a set of oriented points derived from the input mesh, we develop an interpolation method which allows a fast and continuous surface-oracle computation which is exploited to efficiently guide a restricted Delaunay triangulation. This can be used to confine the tessellation inside the holed zones, while protecting the input mesh and the boundary curves so that simple tailoring routines can merge the obtained surface-reconstruction driven patches with the input mesh without stitching artifacts. The proposed technique is versatile and evidences its effectiveness in dealing with multiple complex holes, gaps and surface blending, and it compares favorably with respect to different, and usually more specialized, hole filling and global mesh repair techniques. As a parallel benefit, we also show how the same proposed solution can be exploited as an effective and high-quality meshing or remeshing tool. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
