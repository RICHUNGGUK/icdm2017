Based on the principle of four perspectives of balanced scorecard (BSC), of which two were changed from the financial and customer perspectives to sustainability and stakeholder perspectives to deal the insufficiently addressed issue of corporate social responsibility. Twenty-five measures of sustainable performance were recognized through expert questionnaires and through the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). Further, the relative weights of the selected measures were determined using the analytic network process (ANP). Results indicated that the five most important measures of sustainable performance were profitability (0.2528), green innovation and investment (0.1563), green image (0.1546), customer satisfaction (0.0799), and sustainability awareness of the top management (0.0516). Among these measures, the top three all belonged to the sustainability perspective, which comprised 56% of the overall weighting. The proposed SBSC framework can help Taiwanese semiconductor companies enhance their competitiveness in terms of sustainable operations is anticipated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
