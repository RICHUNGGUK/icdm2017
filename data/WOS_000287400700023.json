The tree-based parity check method is very efficient for hiding a message on image data due to its simplicity. Based on this approach, we propose a majority vote strategy that results in least distortion for finding a stego object. The lower embedding efficiency of our method is better than that of previous works when the hidden message length is relatively large.", "paper_title": "An Optimal Data Hiding Scheme With Tree-Based Parity Check", "paper_id": "WOS:000287400700023"}
