Using this method, frequency offset is estimated according to the spectrum of the received DD-OFDM signal. The estimated frequency offset is used for frequency down-conversion in the digital domain to obtain the baseband OFDM signal. With this method, all data-bearing subcarriers should fall into the OFDM bandwidth after frequency down-conversion. The validity of the method is confirmed by an experiment with 20 Gb/s OFDM-PON downstream transmission.", "paper_title": "Wide-Range Frequency Offset Estimation Method for a DD-OFDM-PON Downstream System", "paper_id": "WOS:000306276400004"}
