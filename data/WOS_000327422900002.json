This approach combines the simplicity of the SPI and the iterative thoughts of multiple imputation. The virtual complete data are imputed by conditional quantiles on the intervals. The algorithm convergence is based on the convergence of the moment estimation from the virtual complete data. Simulation studies have been carried out and the results are shown for interval-censored data generated from the Weibull distribution. For the Weibull distribution, complete procedures of the algorithm are shown in closed forms. Furthermore, the algorithm is applicable to the parameter inference with other distributions. From simulation studies, it has been found that the algorithm is feasible and stable. The estimation accuracy is also satisfactory.", "paper_title": "Study of an imputation algorithm for the analysis of interval-censored data", "paper_id": "WOS:000327422900002"}
