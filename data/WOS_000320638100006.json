The proposed LInSTSS approach is particularly suitable for application in situations when no large, publicly available, electronic linguistic resources can be found for the desired language. We describe the basic working principles of the system architecture we propose, as well as the stages of its construction and use. Also, we explain the procedure used to generate a paraphrase corpus which is then utilized in the evaluation process. Finally, we analyze the evaluation results obtained from a system created for the Serbian language, and we discuss possible improvements which would increase system accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
