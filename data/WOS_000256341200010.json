Scale invariance is defined via linear scale space theory. The results are formulated in terms of the covariance structure of the jet consisting of the scale space derivatives at a single point. Operators describing the effect in jet space of blurring and scaling are investigated. The theory developed is applicable in the analysis of naturally occurring images of which examples are provided.", "paper_title": "Second order structure of scale-space measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000256341200010"}
