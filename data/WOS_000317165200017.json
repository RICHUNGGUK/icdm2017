In this paper, this unrealistic assumption is relaxed. We assume that the retailer may pay any fraction of the purchase cost within the short permissible delay period and receives a cash discount and then the rest is paid within the long permissible delay period. A decision model is proposed for a retailer to determine the optimal ordering policy and payment plan. The closed-form optimal solution to the model is developed and analyzed. Numerical studies show that a retailer can obtain more benefits from the proposed payment plan than from the extreme payment plan in the existing literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
