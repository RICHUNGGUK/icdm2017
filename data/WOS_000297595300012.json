In the context of gradient driven topology optimization this work studies how castable designs can be obtained by use of a Heaviside design parameterization in a specified casting direction. This reduces the number of design variables considerably and the approach is simple to implement.", "paper_title": "An explicit parameterization for casting constraints in gradient driven topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000297595300012"}
