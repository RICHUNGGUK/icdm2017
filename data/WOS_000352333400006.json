Inspired by this challenge, we set out to investigate the impact of traffic load on nodes' energy consumption and having demonstrated its significance and, a relation between traffic load and interference was established by using collision numbers. Then we went on to formulate an optimization model for our topology control with the goal of minimizing the maximum power consumption among network's nodes. Analysis showed that due to the NP-hardness of the preliminary model it could not be used to achieve our objective in a reasonable time span. Thus, to overcome the shortcoming of optimization model, a novel heuristic algorithm called cell based optimization tree (CBOT) was finally introduced that was capable of constructing a suboptimal topology in a reasonable time bound by considering traffic load and interference. Simulation results verified superiority of the proposed approach over a number of reported techniques in the literature.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient Topology Control in Wireless Sensor Networks with Considering Interference and Traffic Load", "paper_id": "WOS:000352333400006"}
