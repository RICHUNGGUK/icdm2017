Disruption of insulin secretion may cause glucose to accumulate in the blood, and result in diabetes mellitus. Although deterministic models of the insulin secretion pathway have been developed, the stochastic aspect of this biological pathway has not been explored. The first step in this direction presented here is a hybrid model of the insulin secretion pathway, in which the delayed rectifying K+ channels are treated as stochastic events. This hybrid model can not only reproduce the oscillation dynamics as the deterministic model does, but can also capture stochastic dynamics that the deterministic model does not. To measure the insulin oscillation system behavior, a probability-based measure is proposed and applied to test the effectiveness of a new remedy.", "paper_title": "Randomness in the Hybrid Modeling and Simulation of Insulin Secretion Pathways in Pancreatic Islets", "paper_id": "WOS:000364492700002"}
