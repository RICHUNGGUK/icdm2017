A packet flow in such a network may be unsuccessful if it experiences errors. This may lead to situations in which a flow receives significantly less service than it is supposed to, while other receives more, making it difficult to provide fairness. In this paper we propose a QoS-aware fair. scheduling mechanism in ad hoc networks considering guaranteed and besteffort flows in the presence of link errors. The proposed mechanism provides short-term fairness for error free sessions and long-term fairness for the erroneous sessions and allows a lagging flow to receive extra service and a leading flow to give up its extra service in a graceful way. It also maximizes the resource utilization by allowing spatial reuse of resource. We also propose a CSMA/CA based implementation of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "QoS-aware fair scheduling in wireless ad hoc networks with link errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400001"}
