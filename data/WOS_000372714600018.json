WMC subsumes previously studied weighted extensions of CTL and resembles previously proposed time-extended versions of the modal mu-calculus. We develop, in addition, a symbolic semantics for WMC and demonstrate that the notion of satisfiability coincides with that of symbolic satisfiability. This central result allows us to prove two major meta-properties of WMC. The first is decidability of satisfiability for WMC. In contrast to the classical modal mu-calculus, WMC does not possess the finite model-property. Nevertheless, the finite model property holds for the symbolic semantics and decidability readily follows; and this contrasts to resembling logics for timed transitions systems for which satisfiability has been shown undecidable. As a second main contribution, we provide a complete axiomatization, which applies to both semantics. The completeness proof is non-standard, since the logic is non-compact, and it involves the notion of symbolic models.", "paper_title": "Alternation-Free Weighted Mu-Calculus: Decidability and Completeness", "paper_id": "WOS:000372714600018"}
