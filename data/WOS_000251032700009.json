This nicely contrasts the result on the effectiveness of the Higman-Haines sets for the family of context-free languages. The non-effectiveness is based on a non-recursive trade-off result between the language description mechanism of Church-Rosser languages and the corresponding Higman-Haines sets, which in turn is also valid for all supersets of the language family under consideration, and in particular for the family of recursively enumerable languages. Finally for the family of regular languages we prove an upper and a matching lower bound on the size of the Higman-Haines sets in terms of nondeterministic finite automata.
