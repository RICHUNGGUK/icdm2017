SPDY, a recently proposed alternative to HTTP, tries to address many of the limitations of HTTP (e.g., multiple connections, setup latency). In this paper, we perform a detailed measurement study to understand the benefits of using SPDY over cellular networks. Through careful measurements conducted over 4 months, we provide a detailed analysis of the performance of HTTP and SPDY, how they interact with the various layers, and their implications on Web design. Our results show that unlike in wired and 802.11 networks, SPDY does not clearly outperform HTTP over cellular networks. We identify negative interactions between the protocols used for Web access (HTTP/SPDY over TCP) and cellular radio resource management as the underlying cause. Overall performance suffers when devices go through a cellular radio state promotion after an idle period, and the consequent increase in latency. This impacts SPDY more because of the use of a single TCP connection. We conclude that a viable solution has to account for these unique cross-layer dependencies to achieve improved Web performance over cellular networks.", "paper_title": "Towards a SPDY'ier Mobile Web?", "paper_id": "WOS:000367100900024"}
