In particular, their computational efficiency is being investigated in the case when the number of cells can grow by means of cell separation rules. In order to complement this study, it is useful to provide simulation software tools for this variant of tissue P systems. The paper presents an extension of P-Lingua specification language, in order to include the class of tissue P systems with cell separation. This extension involves updating the P-Lingua parser, by reinterpreting some operators, along with some new ingredients. In addition, a new built-in simulation algorithm that has been added to the core library of P-Lingua is also presented. A case study of a family of tissue P systems with cell separation of type TSC(3) solving SAT is used to show the dynamics of the simulator.", "paper_title": "A P-Lingua based Simulator for Tissue P Systems with Cell Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344303500008"}
