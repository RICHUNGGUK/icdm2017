In order to achieve high-performance speech recognition and auditory perception in mobile devices, various types of noise have to be removed under the constraints of a space-saving microphone arrangement and few computational resources. The proposed method can reduce both the directional noise and the diffuse noise under the abovementioned constraints for mobile devices by employing a square microphone array and conducting low-computational-cost processing that consists of multiple null beamforming, minimum power channel selection, and Wiener filtering. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified in terms of speech recognition accuracy and speech quality when both the directional noise and the diffuse noise are observed simultaneously; this method reduces the number of word errors and improves the log-spectral distances as compared to conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Speech Enhancement Using a Square Microphone Array in the Presence of Directional and Diffuse Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342800009"}
