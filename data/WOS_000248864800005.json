This paper proves that for any two vertices in de Bruijn undirected graph UB(d,n), there are 2d-2 internally disjoint paths of length at most 2n+1. Therefore, the (2d-2)-wide diameter of UB(d,n) is not greater than 2n+1.", "paper_title": "Wide diameters of de Bruijn graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000248864800005"}
