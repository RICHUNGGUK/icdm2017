But the communication performance through Gigabit Ethernet is quite disappointing due to its performance discrepancies between the hardware and the communication software. To achieve over two-third physical bandwidth of a gigabit network interface, zero-copy protocol architecture is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, it is impossible to realize true zero-copy communication over non re-programmable commodity Gigabit Ethernet adapters because the DMA engines cannot separate the protocol headers from the payload data directly. This paper introduces LM (Lightweight Messages), a true zero-copy communication mechanism which combines the application level fragmentation scheme with the driver level defragmentation scheme, for existing non-programmable Gigabit Ethernet adapters. Finally, experimental results show that LM can provide better performance than other lightweight communication approaches over commodity Gigabit Ethernet.", "paper_title": "Lightweight messages: True zero-copy communication for commodity Gigabit Ethernet", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000016"}
