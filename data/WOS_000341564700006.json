The self-biased and self-regulated circuit uses a dual-feedback mechanism with a replica CP to dynamically stabilize and equalize the currents over a wide output voltage range under varying operating conditions. The circuit is further analyzed and designed in 90-nm CMOS. Extensive corner and Monte Carlo runs are used to verify its current matching capabilities as well as its stability and response within a phase locked loop. The CP achieves near perfect current matching for a wide output voltage range and for temperatures ranging from -30 degrees C to 90 degrees C and a power supply between 1.08 and 1.32 V.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Self-Regulated Charge Pump With Improved Immunity to PVT Variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000341564700006"}
