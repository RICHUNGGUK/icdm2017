The relationship between this problem and several other well-studied problems is explored, and new lower bounds are derived. Additionally, an exact enumeration algorithm, which makes use of the lower bounds, is developed to solve the problem. The algorithm is tested by using a standard benchmark set of instances. The results show that the algorithm improves upon the best-performing methods from the literature in terms of solution quality, and verifies more optimal solutions than the other available exact methods.
