The protocol uses a control message free technique and achieves slot allocation without any message-based coordination. Advantages of such a mechanism includes privacy preservation across coexisting networks since there is no explicit interaction among nodes, seamless integration of multiple trust domains without higher layer involvements, and ability to operate in high BER channels. An energy-efficiency module is also designed which uses sleep-wake scheduling to minimize the energy consumption in the system. It was shown that protocols following the proposed mechanism are able to achieve the above goals without any form of time synchronization among the network nodes. We have implemented and evaluated the protocol using NS2 simulator and the performance of the protocol has been demonstrated using extensive simulation models. Energy efficiency has been evaluated by developing analytical models which has been compared with simulation results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
