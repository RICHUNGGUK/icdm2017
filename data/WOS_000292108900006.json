Goldreich and D. Ron, On Testing Expansion in Bounded-Degree Graphs, Technical report TR00-020, ECCC, Potsdam, Germany, 2000]. We give a property tester that takes as input a graph with degree bound d, an expansion bound alpha, and a parameter epsilon > 0. The tester accepts the graph with high probability if its expansion is more than alpha, and rejects it with high probability if it is epsilon-far from any graph with expansion alpha' with degree bound d, where alpha' < alpha is a function of alpha. For edge expansion, we obtain alpha' = Omega(alpha(2)/d), and for vertex expansion, we obtain alpha' = Omega(alpha(2)/d(2)). In either case, the algorithm runs in time <(O)over tilde>(n((1+mu))/(2)d(2)/epsilon alpha(2)) for any fixed mu > 0.", "paper_title": "AN EXPANSION TESTER FOR BOUNDED DEGREE GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292108900006"}
