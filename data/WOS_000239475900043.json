The positive theory of G is decidable, provided that the existential positive theory of G is decidable and that A and phi(A) are proper subgroups of the base group H with A boolean AND phi(A) finite. Analogous results are also shown for amalgamated products. As a corollary, the positive theory and the existential theory with rational constraints of any finitely generated virtually-free group is decidable.", "paper_title": "Theories of HNN-extensions and amalgamated products", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900043"}
