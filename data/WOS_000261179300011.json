Under such situation, one may not be able to visualize the receiving model unless the lost model information has been retransmitted. Progressive model transmission offers an alternative to avoid the \"all or nothing situation\" by allowing a model to be visualized with a degraded quality when only part of the model data has been received. Unfortunately, in case some model refinement information is missing, one may still need to wait for such information to be retransmitted before the model can be rendered with a desired visual quality. To address this problem, we have developed a novel error resilient packetization scheme. We first construct a Non-Redundant Directed Acyclic Graph to encode the dependencies among the vertex splits of a progressive mesh. A special Global Graph Equipartition Packing Algorithm is then applied to partitioning this graph into several equal size sub-graphs, which is packed as packets. The packing algorithm comprises two main phases: initial partition phase and global refinement phase. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can minimize the dependencies between packets. Hence, it reduces the delay in rendering 3D models with proper quality at the clients.", "paper_title": "An Effective Error Resilient Packetization Scheme for Progressive Mesh Transmission over Unreliable Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000261179300011"}
