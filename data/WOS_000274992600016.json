After a fully specified test vector or a partially specified test cube is generated at an arbitrary iteration of the test generation process, the test vector improvement step modifies so as to increase the number of yet-undetected target faults that detects. This is done in this paper using a simulation-based process. We show that even if was generated using dynamic test compaction heuristics, it is possible to improve further. When is partially specified to accommodate test data compression, the test vector improvement step does not change the number of unspecified bits of. The final result is a smaller test set and/or a higher fault coverage (if the test generation process does not detect all the detectable faults).", "paper_title": "On Test Generation With Test Vector Improvement", "paper_id": "WOS:000274992600016"}
