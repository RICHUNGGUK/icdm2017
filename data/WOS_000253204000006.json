Starting with an empty graph on n vertices, choose the next edge uniformly at random among all edges not yet considered, but only insert it if the graph remains planar. We show that for all epsilon > 0, with high probability, theta(n(2)) edges have to be tested before the number of edges in the graph reaches (1 + epsilon)n. At this point, the graph is connected with high probability and contains a linear number of induced copies of any fixed connected planar graph, the first property being in contrast and the second one in accordance with the uniform random planar graph model.
