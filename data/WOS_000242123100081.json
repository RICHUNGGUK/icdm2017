Several time frequencies have been considered: from five minutes to daily trades. At the current stage our major findings may be summarized as follows: a) unsupervised neural networks are helpful to localize profitable intraday patterns, and they make possible to achieve higher performances than common trading rules; b) trading strategies based on neural networks make exploitable with profits almost continuous trades (i.e. scalping), until transaction costs maintain below proper thresholds.", "paper_title": "On the profitability of scalping strategies based on neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100081"}
