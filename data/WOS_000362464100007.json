Nine image-plus-depth sources are first selected, and a depth image-based rendering (DIBR) technique is used to render stereoscopic image pairs. Distortions applied to either the texture image or the depth image before stereoscopic image rendering include: Gaussian blur, additive white noise, down-sampling blur, JPEG and JPEG-2000 (JP2K) compression and transmission error. Furthermore, the distortion caused by imperfect rendering is also examined. The MCL-3D database contains 693 stereoscopic image pairs, where one third of them are of resolution 1024*768 and two thirds are of resolution 1920*1080. The pair-wise comparison was adopted in the subjective test for user friendliness, and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) were computed accordingly. Finally, we evaluate the performance of several 2D and 3D image quality metrics applied to MCL-3D. All texture images, depth images, rendered image pairs in MCL-3D and their MOS values obtained in the subjective test are available to the public (http://mcl.usc.edu/mc1-3d-database/) for future research and development.", "paper_title": "MCL-3D: A Database for Stereoscopic Image Quality Assessment using 2D-Image-Plus-Depth Source", "paper_id": "WOS:000362464100007"}
