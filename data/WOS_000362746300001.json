However, it has come to the point where various forms of the leakage centering on people that are the subject of core asset leakage cannot be solved through technological method. At present time in which the limitation of information security that seeks technological security has been clearly revealed, there is an increasing interest in industrial security for establishing convergence security system upon understanding technological/physical/managerial security measures and establishing security strategies. Accordingly, this paper conducted an analysis on the characteristics of industrial security manpower to present a vision and systematically cultivate industrial security experts manpower for protecting core technologies of companies in intelligent sensor network. In particular, occupational cluster of industrial security experts manpower was classified, which was verified by conducting case analysis. In addition, it estimated the demand for industrial security experts manpower by substituting it to the present condition of manpower of Korea. It is expected that the result of this study will be able to be used as basic information for cultivating industrial security experts manpower in intelligent sensor network.", "paper_title": "A Study on Industrial Security Experts Demanding Forecasting in Intelligent Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000362746300001"}
