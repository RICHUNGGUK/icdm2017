It provides an excellent aid for path and accessibility planning in robotics and for simulating various manufacturing operations. It has proven difficult to evaluate the boundary of the volume swept by a solid bounded by trimmed parametric surfaces undergoing an arbitrary analytic motion. Hence, prior solutions use one or several of the following simplifications: (1) approximate the volume by the union of a finite set of solid instances sampled along the motion; (2) approximate the curved solid by a polyhedron; and (3) approximate the motion by a sequence of simpler motions. The approach proposed here is based on the third type of simplification: it uses a polyscrew (continuous, piecewise-helical) approximation of the motion. This approach leads to a simple algorithm that generates candidate faces, computes the two-cells of their arrangement, and uses a new point-in-sweep test to select the correct cells whose union forms the boundary of the swept volume.
