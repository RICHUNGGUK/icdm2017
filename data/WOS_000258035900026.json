Based on an OFDM frame format with adding the pseudo-noise code, the frame timing and the channel impulse response could be obtained by the proposed scheme. With the estimated channel information, a frequency domain one-tap equalizer is presented to achieve the signal compensation. The simulation results show the missing probability of frame start with the proposed algorithm performs better than that with the moving average scheme and Beek's scheme under the Rayleigh channel. Also, the frame timing could be exactly obtained with the proposed schemes at SNR is large than -10 dB. Besides, the estimator mean square error with the proposed channel estimation scheme is better than that with the least squared scheme and minimum mean square error scheme. With the estimated channel response, the signal could be compensated by the one-tap equalizer and the BER performance is shown in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
