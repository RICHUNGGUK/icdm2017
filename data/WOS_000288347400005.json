When dealing with images having more than one channel, the computational burden becomes even more dramatic. For this reason, in this paper we investigate on a methodology to speed-up template matching on multi-channel images without deteriorating the outcome of the search. In particular, we propose a fast, exhaustive technique based on the Zero-mean Normalized Cross-Correlation (ZNCC) inspired from previous work related to grayscale images. Experimental testing performed over thousands of template matching instances demonstrates the efficiency of our proposal. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
