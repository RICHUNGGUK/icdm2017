Moreover, real-world illumination has impact on recognition performance. This paper presents an illumination robust single sample face recognition approach, which utilizes multidirectional orthogonal gradient phase faces to solve the above limitations. In the proposed approach, an illumination insensitive orthogonal gradient phase face is obtained by using two vertical directional gradient values of the original image. Multi-directional orthogonal gradient phase faces can be used to extend samples for single sample face recognition. Simulated experiments and comparisons on a subset of Yale B database, Yale database, a subset of PIE database and VALID face database show that the proposed approach is not only an outstanding method for single sample face recognition under illumination but also more effective when addressing illumination, expression, decoration, etc. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
