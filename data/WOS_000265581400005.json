Similar phases can be seen in Adam Smith's theory of economics. The authors suggest the introduction of the Universal Dialectical Systems Theory (UDST) as a common denominator of the values and methods of the requisitely holistic observation, perception, thinking, emotional and spiritual life, decision-making, and action by interdisciplinary creative co-operation and information, as a means to link natural and social sciences.", "paper_title": "FROM DIVISION TO INTEGRATION OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES BY THE UNIVERSAL DIALECTICAL SYSTEMS THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000265581400005"}
