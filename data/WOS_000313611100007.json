Classical approaches rely on both strong assumptions of either limited or full diffusion of solutes in the matrix and simplified fracture configurations. We analyze fracture-matrix transport in two-dimensional Sierpinski lattice structures, which display a wide range of matrix block sizes. The analysis is conducted in several transport regimes that are limited by either diffusion or block sizes. Our simulation results can be used to validate the simplifying assumptions that underpin classical analytical solutions and to benchmark other numerical methods. They also demonstrate that both hydraulic and structural properties of fractured rocks control the residence time distribution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
