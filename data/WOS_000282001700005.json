Without feedback, the secrecy capacity over such a channel generally converges to a constant at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A half-duplex secure protocol allowing the destination to actively transfer random keys in the form of known interference is proposed. It is shown that using multiple antennas at the destination is instrumental in achieving a secrecy rate that grows linearly with log SNR. The pre-log factor of the secrecy rate, i.e., the number of secure degrees of freedom, is characterized, revealing an interesting interplay between the numbers of antennas at the three communication nodes. The relationship of the achievable secure degrees of freedom to those obtained in the case without feedback is finally discussed.", "paper_title": "Secure Communications With Insecure Feedback: Breaking the High-SNR Ceiling", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700005"}
