Design/methodology/approach - In this work, induction machines (IM) were studied for automotive traction applications, more specifically, for HV. The necessary models and methods to analyse and design such electric machines were developed. A limited number of finite element computations was used to establish a non-linear electromagnetic model of the machine. This model was then adapted to study the sensitivity of the design for the most significant geometric variations. Thus, one can easily adapt a machine for new sizing requirements. Findings - This modelling methodology was extended to take into account a great number of parametric variations. This model was used for constrained optimisation on the geometry of a machine. To achieve this, a new \"reset model optimisation\" method was proposed, combining fast computations, precision and simplicity. This methodology was used to design an IM with HV-sizing considerations. Practical implications - The methodology is based on an improved equivalent circuit of the M where the FEM accuracy (saturation) is combined with the potential of analytical modelling (simple and quick). Originality/value - This half-analytical, half-FEM methodology is well adapted for research projects where the specifications are frequently reviewed.", "paper_title": "Cost performance size optimization for automotive induction machines - A fast and accurate FEM, analytical model and optimization mixed procedure", "paper_id": "WOS:000237037300004"}
