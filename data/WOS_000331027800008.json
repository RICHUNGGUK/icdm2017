In this paper, we investigate the simultaneous switching noise (SSN) in a resonant clock network compared to that in conventional clocking. Analytical and simulation results show that employing the clock generated by a resonant clock network reduces the SSN voltage on power supply rails. The main drawback of using a sinusoidal clock is that the short-circuit power increases in the clocked devices. This problem is also investigated and discussed analytically. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
