To reduce delays in the WSN, the sensor node will send out redundant packets. Suppose the WSN has a cell-partitioned structure and the two-hop relay algorithm is adopted, the relay/destination nodes selection will determine the networks performance. The FLS is applied to the nodes selection. In contrast with the cases that only consider one descriptor, the FLS application can manage the delay/energy tradeoffs to meet the network performance requirements. Another work discussed is packets transmission in WSNs. We proposed FLS in the optimisation of SIR threshold selection. Average delay and distance of a node to the source node are selected as antecedents for the FLS. The output of FLS provided adjusting factors for the SIR threshold. Simulation results showed the fuzzy optimisation could achieve a better network efficiency, reduce the average delay and extend the network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Latency-aware and energy efficiency tradeoffs for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000281577500001"}
