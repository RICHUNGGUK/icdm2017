In short, our proposed framework makes its contribution by featuring three desired functionalities as follows. First, during the construction process, two components can be snapped together through the most matched faces. Second, deformation can be performed arbitrarily on any face of the resulting mesh. Third, the assignment of color and texture attributes on the resulting mesh is intuitively and flexibly done in a user-friendly manner. By enjoying a simpler user interface, our system strikes a good balance between efficiency and expressiveness, thus making it particularly appropriate for the purpose of rapid architecture prototyping. Results are shown to demonstrate that our framework is not only good at simulating a wide variety of existing architectures, but also capable of creating even avant-garde architectural styles.", "paper_title": "Fast architecture prototyping through 3D collage", "paper_id": "WOS:000301185900004"}
