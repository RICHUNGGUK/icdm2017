We focus on photodressed excitonic electron-hole pair states related to the optical properties of the system concerned. Here, we parallelize the loop of propagation sectors, which is regarded as a rate-determining step in the whole calculation: in each sector calculated R-matrix Green's functions are playing a key role. The evaluated parallelization efficiency is found sufficiently high, compared with a conventional algorithm without such parallelization. Restriction of this efficiency arising from the inter-core communications is also discussed. Further, it is shown that by virtue of the present parallelization, we readily obtain high-resolution excitonic absorption spectra revealing conspicuous dynamic Fano resonance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
