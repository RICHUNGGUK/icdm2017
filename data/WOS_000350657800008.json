It starts with a brief overview of general control architectures, followed by the presentation of the design methodology based on the concept of an embodied agent. Multi-level decomposition of system structure enables the formulation of the operation of each of the resulting subsystems in terms of transition functions, specifying their state evolution. The paper also introduces mathematical and graphical notations, complementing each other, defining formally the control system behaviour. As an example the specification of a control system of a robot utilizing multi-camera visual servoing for object following is presented.", "paper_title": "Robot Control System Design Exemplified by Multi-Camera Visual Servoing", "paper_id": "WOS:000350657800008"}
