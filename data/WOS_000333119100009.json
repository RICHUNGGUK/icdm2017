This SOFNN-ACA is constructed online via simultaneous structure and parameter learning processes. In structure learning, a set of fuzzy rules can be self-designed using an information-theoretic methodology. The fuzzy rules with high spiking intensities (SI) are divided into new ones. And the fuzzy rules with a small relative mutual information (RMI) value will be pruned in order to simplify the FNN structure. In parameter learning, the consequent part parameters are learned through the use of an ACA that incorporates an adaptive learning rate strategy into the learning process to accelerate the convergence speed. Then, the convergence of SOFNN-ACA is analyzed. Finally, the proposed SOFNN-ACA is used to model nonlinear systems. The modeling results demonstrate that this proposed SOFNN-ACA can model nonlinear systems effectively.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Systems Modeling Based on Self-Organizing Fuzzy-Neural-Network With Adaptive Computation Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000333119100009"}
