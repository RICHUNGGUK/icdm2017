Furthermore, the qualitative measures for the intersections are specified based on the alpha-cut induced fuzzy topology, which are (A(alpha)boolean AND partial derivative A)(x)< 1-alpha and ((A(c))(alpha)boolean AND partial derivative A)(x)< 1-alpha. In other words, the intersection of the interior and boundary or boundary and exterior are always bounded by 1-alpha, where alpha is a value of a level cutting. Specifically, the following areas are covered: (a) the homeomorphic invariants of the fuzzy topology; (b) a definition of the connectivity of the newly developed fuzzy topology; (c) a model of the fuzzy topological relations between simple fuzzy regions in GIS; and (d) the quantitative values of topological relations can be calculated.", "paper_title": "Computing the fuzzy topological relations of spatial objects based on induced fuzzy topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000240676600002"}
