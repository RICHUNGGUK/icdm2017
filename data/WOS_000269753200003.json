We present a function phi(n) = Theta(n(2)) such that if f <= phi(n) then there is a long fault-free path between every pair of distinct vertices of the largest fault-free block of Q(n). Moreover, the bound provided by phi(n) is asymptotically optimal. Furthermore, we show that assuming f <= phi(n), the existence of a long fault-free path between an arbitrary pair of vertices may be verified in polynomial time with respect to n and, if the path exists, its construction performed in linear time with respect to its length.
