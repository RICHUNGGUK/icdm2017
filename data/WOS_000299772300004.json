To better understand such use of CMC, we investigate copresence-defined as a communicator's perception of being with other communication partners through CMC-and its role in affecting the intention to continue using the medium. We explore three social-relational antecedents of copresence: prior use of the medium, perceived critical mass, and user commitment to maintain the relationship with others. Hypotheses are tested with survey data on the use of instant messenger. In general, the results support the research hypotheses. We suggest that the concept of copresence can be a novel and helpful theoretical perspective for understanding the use of CMC for social-relational purposes.", "paper_title": "Copresence and Its Social-Relational Antecedents in Computer-Mediated Communication: The Case of Instant Messenger", "paper_id": "WOS:000299772300004"}
