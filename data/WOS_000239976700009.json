This paper fills an important research gap by describing a quantitative model of trust in automation. We extend decision field theory (DFT) to describe the multiple sequential decisions that characterize reliance on automation in supervisory control situations. Extended DFT (EDFT) represents an iterated decision process and the evolution of operator preference for automatic and manual control; The EDFT model predicts trust and reliance, and describes the dynamic interaction between operator and automation in a closed-loop fashion: the products of earlier decisions can transform the nature of later events and decisions. The simulation results show that the EDFT model captures several consistent empirical findings, such as the inertia of trust and the nonlinear characteristics of trust and reliance. The model also demonstrates the effects of different types of automation on trust and reliance. It is possible to expand the EDFT model for multioperator multiautomation situations.", "paper_title": "Extending the decision field theory to model operators' reliance on automation in supervisory control situations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239976700009"}
