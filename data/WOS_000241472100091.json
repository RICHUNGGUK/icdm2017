We have shown that they can be applied to other domains, like image retrieval and hyperspectral image unsupervised segmentation. In both cases the key idea is that Morphological Autoassociative Memories (MAAM) selective sensitivity to erosive and dilative noise can be applied to detect the morphological independence between patterns. The convex coordinates obtained by linear unmixing based on the sets of morphological independent patterns define a feature extraction process. These features may be useful either for pattern classification. We present some results on the task of visual landmark recognition for a mobile robot self-localization task.", "paper_title": "Morphological neural networks and vision based mobile robot navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100091"}
