In this paper, we examine some fundamental problems on the ambiguity of erasing morphisms. We provide a detailed analysis of so-called ambiguity partitions, and our main result uses this concept to characterise those strings that have a morphism of strongly restricted ambiguity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are strings for which the set of unambiguous morphisms, depending on the size of the target alphabet of these morphisms, is empty, finite or infinite. Finally, we show that the problem of the existence of unambiguous erasing morphisms is equivalent to some basic decision problems for nonerasing multi-pattern languages. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
