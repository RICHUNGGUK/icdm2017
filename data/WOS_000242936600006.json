Since the number of quantum bits that can currently be built is limited, while many quantum technologies are inherently three ( or more) valued, we consider extending the reach of the realistic quantum systems by building a QFT over ternary quantum digits. Compared to traditional binary QFT, the q-valued transform improves approximation properties and increases the state space by a factor of (q/2)(n). Further, we use nonbinary QFT derivation to generalize and improve the approximation bounds for QFT.", "paper_title": "Scaling and better approximating quantum Fourier transform by higher radices", "paper_id": "WOS:000242936600006"}
