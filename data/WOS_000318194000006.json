The basic idea consists in growing the aggregates by adding grains at that position where the local filling factor is smallest. We then show that there exists an approximately linear relationship between the fractal dimension and the detector radius by which the local filling factor is determined. Fractal dimensions between 1.7 and 3.0 have been realized as examples for aggregates containing 10(2)-10(4) grains. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
