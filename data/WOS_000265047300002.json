It is based on the definition and computation of the gradient of the uplink cell load factor and the downlink transmitted power, which are the two main parameters that reflect the actual cell load in the two link directions. The paper shows that the gradient is able to capture the relevant information about the spatial distribution of traffic, which has an impact on cell performance. The proposed methodology is also used as the basis for defining and evaluating new Radio Resource Management (RRM) strategies that operate at a multi-cell level.", "paper_title": "A novel approach to smart multi-cell radio resource management based on load gradient calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000265047300002"}
