Significant and vital decisions are usually made by the heterogeneous groups of managers or experts in organizations. In many situations, experts may decide on the basis of imprecise information coming from a variety of sources about alternatives. In fact, some criteria are completely quantifiable, some partially quantifiable, and others completely subjective. This paper proposes a fuzzy extension of TOPSIS method for heterogeneous group decision making models under fuzzy environment. It converts the decision makers' fuzzy decision matrices into an aggregated decision matrix to determine the most preferable choice among all possible alternatives. The results of a numerical example of proposed method have been highly consistent based on the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and showed good agreement with other methods.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy extension of TOPSIS model for group decision making under multiple criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000310867300006"}
