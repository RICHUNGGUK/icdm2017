Our knowledge about the probability of events pertaining to the output of some function of interest from the risk analysis model can be either represented by a fuzzy probability or by a probability interval. It is shown that this interval is the average cut of the fuzzy probability of the event, thus legitimating the propagation method. Besides, several independence assumptions underlying the joint probability-possibility propagation methods are discussed and illustrated by a motivating example. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
