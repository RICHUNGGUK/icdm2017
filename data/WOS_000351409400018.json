Based on the interest rate, the price of the zero-coupon bond is another important indicator to measure the economic level. Therefore, the study on the price of the zero-coupon bonds with different maturity dates is a fundamental issue in economics. This paper regards the interest rate as an uncertain process and prices the zero-coupon bond through the uncertain interest model. In addition, this paper proposes a general interest rate model in uncertain environment and employs a numerical method to price the zero-coupon bond.", "paper_title": "An interest rate model in uncertain environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000351409400018"}
