The nonlinear time-delay system is modeled as fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) system, and fuzzy logic systems are used to eliminate the uncertainties of the system. A sufficient condition for the existence of fuzzy controller is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and adaptive law. Based on Lyapunov stability theorem, the fuzzy control scheme guarantees the desired tracking performance in sense that all the closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Simulation results of 2-link manipulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control scheme.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Robust Tracking Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Time-Delay System", "paper_id": "WOS:000364346600005"}
