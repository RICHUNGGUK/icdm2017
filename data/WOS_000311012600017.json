We propose a trusted inter-domain fast authentication scheme based on the split mechanism network. The proposed scheme can realize proof of identity and integrity verification of the platform as well as proof of the user identity. In our scheme, when the mobile terminal moves to a new domain, the visited domain directly authenticates the mobile terminal using the ticket issued by the home domain rather than authenticating it through its home domain. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is highly effective and more secure than contemporary inter-domain fast authentication schemes.", "paper_title": "Trusted Inter-Domain Fast Authentication Protocol in Split Mechanism Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000311012600017"}
