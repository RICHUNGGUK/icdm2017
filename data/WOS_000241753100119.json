Because PMD possesses the time-varying and the statistical properties, to establish an effective control algorithm for adaptive or automatic PMD compensation is a challenging task. Widely used control algorithms are the gradient-based peak search methods, whose main drawbacks are easy being locked into local sub-optima for compensation and no ability to resist noise. In this paper, we introduce particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is an evolutionary approach, into automatic PMD compensation as feedback control algorithm. The experiment results showed that PSO-based control algorithm has unique features of rapid convergence to the global optimum without being trapped in local sub-optima and good robustness to noise in the transmission line that had never been achieved in PMD compensation before.", "paper_title": "An intelligent PSO-based control algorithm for adaptive compensation polarization mode dispersion in optical fiber communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100119"}
