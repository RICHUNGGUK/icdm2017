This paper fills these gaps by examining the roles of corporate entrepreneurship (CE) and competitive intensity at the firm level, thereby contributing to research on IT business value. Using data from manufacturing firms in China, we find that CE fully mediates the effect of IT capabilities on product innovation performance and that competitive intensity moderates the proposed relationships.
