A piece of music is modelled as a graph, with each musical note presented as a vertex and the relationship between a pair of musical notes as an edge. The relationship is determined by stream segregation. According to the proposed matching conditions, searching for a musical pattern is equivalent to searching for a special subgraph called a maximal matched CRP subgraph. The comparisons are made between the patterns identified by the graph-theoretical approach and those by the musicologists.", "paper_title": "A graph-theoretical approach for pattern matching in post-tonal music analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000250551300003"}
