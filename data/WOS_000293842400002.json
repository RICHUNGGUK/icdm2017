Delivery time functions are developed based on practical data analysis and the cost models for both linear and non-linear delivery time functions are derived. Analytic solution for system with linear delivery times is derived and a search algorithm for system with non-linear delivery times is established. Finally, sensitivity analysis is made to help decision makers achieve a lower total cost in practice.", "paper_title": "Integrated planning problem in supply chains with time-varying delivery", "paper_id": "WOS:000293842400002"}
