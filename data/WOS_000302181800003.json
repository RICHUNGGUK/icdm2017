We propose a new approach to represent the marginal distribution of the wavelet coefficients using finite mixtures of generalized Gaussian (MoGG) distributions. The MoGG captures a wide range of histogram shapes, which provides better description and discrimination of texture than using single probability density functions (pdf's), as proposed by recent state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we propose a model similarity measure based on Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) approximation using Monte Carlo sampling methods. Through experiments on two popular texture data sets, we show that our approach yields significant performance improvements for texture discrimination and retrieval, as compared with recentmethods of statistical-based wavelet modeling.", "paper_title": "Wavelet Modeling Using Finite Mixtures of Generalized Gaussian Distributions: Application to Texture Discrimination and Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800003"}
