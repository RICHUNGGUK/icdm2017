Hence, sufficient resources must be provided for handoff (HO) connections when a mobile station (MS) moves from one cell to another. Effective allocation of resources can be achieved when the exact future trajectory of MSs is known in advance. However, such a scenario is unrealistic. The next best possibility is to employ user mobility prediction to determine the cell(s) a MS will likely visit in the near future. In this paper, we present an extensive survey and classification of channel (bandwidth) reservation schemes which employ user mobility prediction in the resource reservation process. We also present a survey and classification of call admission control (CAC) schemes, including discussion of prioritized and non-prioritized handoff schemes, which can be useful for researches both in academia and industry.", "paper_title": "Predictive mobile-oriented channel reservation schemes in wireless cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286195300010"}
