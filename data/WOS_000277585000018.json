We present a bounded-error quantum algorithm that solves this problem in time N1/2+o(1). In particular, approximately balanced formulas can be evaluated in O(root N) queries, which is optimal. The idea of the algorithm is to apply phase estimation to a discrete-time quantum walk on a weighted tree whose spectrum encodes the value of the formula.", "paper_title": "ANY AND-OR FORMULA OF SIZE N CAN BE EVALUATED IN TIME N1/2+o(1) ON A QUANTUM COMPUTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000277585000018"}
