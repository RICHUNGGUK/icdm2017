We convert a fuzzy linearVolterra-Fredholm integral equation to a system of fuzzy equations by using FFGM and FCM. The existence and uniqueness of the solution and convergence of the proposed method are proved in detail. Finally some examples show the accuracy of these methods.", "paper_title": "The use of fuzzy expansion method for solving fuzzy linear Volterra-Fredholm integral equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000332245500020"}
