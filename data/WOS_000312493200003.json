By employing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, several delay-dependent criteria for the passivity of the considered T-S fuzzy systems are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be checked numerically using the effective LMI toolbox in MATLAB. The obtained results improve and generalize some previous results, two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.", "paper_title": "Analysis on passivity and passification of T-S fuzzy systems with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000312493200003"}
