These antennas are split in the middle into two halves and are excited by a coaxial probe. In first configuration, the fractal geometry is used to achieve wide bandwidth from 3.5 to 5.0 GHz covering the body area network frequencies as well as the IEEE 802.11a WLAN frequencies. The average peak gain within the band is about 7 dBi. The second investigation involves miniaturization of rectangular DRA by using FRC along the cross-sectional boundary. By this, a DRA at 3.2 GHz could be realized using second iteration of modified rectangular curve fractal geometry resulting in a 50% size reduction by maintaining same radiation characteristics.
