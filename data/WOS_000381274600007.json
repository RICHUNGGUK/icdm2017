We define research impact as conducting research that makes a difference to individuals, businesses, industries, and societies. While assessment groups like the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) want scholars to make an impact, sometimes they operationalize impact in ways that may encourage scholars to pursue research goals tangential to making a difference. With this paper, we hope to stimulate thinking in the IS community on creating research assessment techniques that encourage our scholars to make a difference.", "paper_title": "Assessing IS Research Impact", "paper_id": "WOS:000381274600007"}
