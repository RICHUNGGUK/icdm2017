Currently, computer vision techniques are applicable in a challenging soccer context. Scene interpretation is performed based on the complexity of the semantic. For each area of vision-based systems, computer vision methodologies are analyzed along with their strengths and weaknesses. We have also investigated whether the existing approaches are equally applicable for real-time soccer video semantic analysis.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF VISION BASED SYSTEMS TO DETECT REAL TIME GOAL EVENTS IN SOCCER VIDEOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000323028100006"}
