The method is illustrated with two types of examples: a hypothetical outage of the main fixed line network operator in Ireland, and seven examples of outages affecting individual local exchanges in areas with concentrations of technology-intensive employment or dense residential population. The national fixed line outage has an estimated cost of (sic)42-50 per household-day arising from effects on the productive and residential sectors, with possible further losses from effects on retail payments and high societal value facilities such as emergency services. Estimated quantifiable economic costs from outages affecting a single local exchange range from (sic)370,000 to (sic)1.1 million per day. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
