A systematic study of the influence of the advection term discretization scheme, namely (ODE, LUST) and the SGS model (sigma-model, WALE and dynamic Smagorinsky) on the accuracy of the solution is presented in this work. Three canonical cases with increasing complexity are considered in this study, namely, a fully developed turbulent channel flow with Re-tau = 395, a backward facing step and a wall-mounted hump. Mean errors with respect to DNS or experimental data are quantified in order to compare the relative accuracy of each combination of scheme/model. Detailed comparison of the numerical simulations performed by the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM (R) shows that the sigma-model with the LUST discretization scheme yields the best results. This combination of sigma-model with LUST discretization scheme has hence been used to study the turbulent flow characteristics in an engine-like geometry. Results show good agreement with experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
