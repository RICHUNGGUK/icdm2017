Three-dimensional computer imagery and segmentation algorithms are used to visualise and isolate the regions of interest. These regions are then approximated by best-fit ellipsoids and the mean best-fit ellipsoid is used as a measure of preferred inclusion orientation. A Windows program is developed to implement these procedures and results found from both manufactured and natural data are presented. These results show that the radiodensity contrast plays a major role in the ability of the software to isolate inclusions from their matrix and hence determine rock fabric. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
