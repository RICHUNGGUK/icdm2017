Each group will contain all the emails that require the same action. Therefore, instead of replying each email alone, all the emails in the same group will be bundled, and one reply template will be used to respond to all emails in one shot. As a result, the process of the email within one group will be converted from \"many replies to many senders\" into \"one-reply to many senders\" (or Reply (M- >M) into Reply (1- >M)). This paper suggests that the email handlers should give the user the capability to bundle a set of emails into one group using categorization, and then responding to all the emails in the same group by one reply. The paper identifies different shapes of relationships. The paper describes the prototype for each relationship with the advantages of each one, and then it provides the functionality to convert the relationship from one form to another in order to save the time of the emailer. The use of categorization was implemented on a conference event. The collected results showed that the overall performance was improved.", "paper_title": "Categorizing received email to improve delivery", "paper_id": "WOS:000293548200005"}
