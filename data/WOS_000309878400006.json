In this study, we propose a kernel orthogonal transform method for breast cancer diagnosis. We test our method using the widely used Wisconsin breast cancer diagnosis (WBCD) dataset. The performance of the method is evaluated in terms of the classification accuracy, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC). The experimental results show that our method classifies more accurately than all of the previous methods.", "paper_title": "Breast cancer diagnosis based on a kernel orthogonal transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000309878400006"}
