A new NDGM with the fractional-order accumulation is put forward. The first value is effective when the accumulation order number is not 1, and the priority of new information can be better reflected when the accumulation order number becomes smaller. Three real case studies show that the proposed grey model has higher performances not only on model fitting but also on forecasting.", "paper_title": "Non-homogenous discrete grey model with fractional-order accumulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342204600024"}
