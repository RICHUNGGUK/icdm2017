Using an identity that arises in the formulation of PS, we derive expressions for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and J divergences between two distributions from possibly different parametric families These expressions naturally stem from PS when the geometric path is used to link the two extreme densities We examine the use of the KL and J divergence measures in PS in a variety of model selection examples In this context, one challenging aspect of PS is that of selecting an appropriate auxiliary density that will yield a high quality estimate of the marginal likelihood without incurring excessive computational effort The J divergence is shown to be helpful for choosing auxiliary densities that minimize the error of the PS estimators These results increase appreciably the usefulness of PS (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "A path sampling identity for computing the Kullback-Leibler and J divergences", "paper_id": "WOS:000277110000002"}
