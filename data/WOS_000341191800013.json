The design purpose is to improve the dynamic response of an interconnected power system after load demand changes. A genetic algorithm (GA)-based solution technique is applied to generate a Pareto set of global optimal solutions to the given multi-objective optimization problem. In addition, the best compromise solution from the obtained Pareto solution set is selected by a fuzzy-based membership value assignment method. Simulation results are presented and compared with conventional GA-PID controller and another new controller. All the simulations show the successful performance of proposed approach in controlling the frequency of the power system.", "paper_title": "Design of PID controller using multi-objective genetic algorithm for load frequency control in interconnected power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000341191800013"}
