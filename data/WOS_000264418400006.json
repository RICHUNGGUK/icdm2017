There are, however, many predicates (like equality of real numbers) and functions that are absolutely non-computable, that is, not computable for any representation. Many of these results can be deduced from a simple lemma. In this article we prove this lemma for multi-representations and apply it to a number of examples. As applications, we show that various predicates and functions on computable measure spaces are absolutely non-computable. Since all the arguments are topological, we prove that the predicates are not relatively open and the functions are not relatively continuous for any multi-representation.", "paper_title": "Absolutely non-computable predicates and functions in analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000264418400006"}
