The data comes from an international study in which various microbial and chemical parameters were determined in heavily polluted waters from diverse geographical areas. A total of 38 variables derived from the microbial and chemical parameters were defined to characterise the available 103 observations. Four methods were evaluated: Euclidean k-nearest-neighbour, linear Bayesian classifier, quadratic Bayesian classifier and a support vector machine. The main aim was the obtention of highly accurate predictive models using the lowest number of variables possible. After a strong feature selection process, the obtained results show that predictive models using only two variables emerge with 100% correct classification. The obtained solutions make use of a linear combination of a discriminating tracer (the enumeration of phages infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) and a universal non-discriminant faecal indicator. Other models not using the discriminant tracer were developed, though a higher number of variables was needed to achieve a high rate of correct classification. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
