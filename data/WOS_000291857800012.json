The design strategy depends on the construction of a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. A continuously differentiable control law is obtained to globally uniformly asymptotically stabilise the closed-loop system. The simulation shows the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "Globally uniformly asymptotical stabilisation of time-delay nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000291857800012"}
