This paper provides an overview of how digital archivists use digital forensics tools and techniques to approach their work, comparing and contrasting archival with traditional computer forensics. Archives encounter a wide range of digital materials. This paper details a specific example within archival forensics the analysis of complex, interactive, new media digital artworks. From this, the paper concludes with considerations for future directions and-recommendations to the traditional forensics community to support the needs of cultural heritage institutions.
