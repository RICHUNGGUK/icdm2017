The use of box splines is motivated by their ability to handle complex geometries better than tensor-product B-splines. The box spline we use is defined by a set of vectors invariant under the multiplication by a sampling matrix. We show that such a box spline satisfies a dilation equation which is the basis for the scale-space filtering we propose. Several numerical applications in 2-D conclude the correspondence.", "paper_title": "Application of the convergence of the control net of box splines to scale-space filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000250241500020"}
