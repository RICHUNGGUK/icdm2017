They consider isotropic behaviour for steel and concrete and orthotropic behaviour for timber, all the materials are modelled with non-linear mechanical behaviour. Besides, the interaction between materials is modelled using contact elements associated with friction. The results obtained in the numerical simulations are evaluated and compared with results obtained in laboratory shear tests. The model developed showed the capacity to simulate the behaviour of the joints if the materials used are properly modelled. Nevertheless further research is still necessary to improve the modelling of the materials particularly timber. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. and Civil-Comp Ltd.
