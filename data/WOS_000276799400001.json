Afterwards, we discuss common OBS network loss models that are frequently used in routing optimization. As examples of such application, we present a linear and a non-linear formulation of a multi-path routing optimization problem with an indication on convenient resolution methods The presented algorithms are appropriate for proactive load balancing routing and aim at the improvement of network-wide burst loss performance To compare performance results, both methods are evaluated by simulation in a set of unified network scenarios (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
