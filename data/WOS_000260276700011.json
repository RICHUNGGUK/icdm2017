Restrictive partially blind signatures incorporate the advantages of these two blind signatures. Recently, Chen-Zhang-Liu first proposed an ID-based restrictive partially blind signature from bilinear pairings (Chen, X.F., Zhang, F.G., Liu, S.L., 2007. ID-based restrictive partially blind signatures and applications. The Journal of Systems and Software 80 (2), 164-171). However, in this paper, we show that Chen-Zhang-Liu's scheme has a security weakness. Their scheme does not satisfy the property of restrictiveness as they claimed, and an account-holder cannot be revealed when double-spending happens. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
