The difficulty associated with RC development suggests improved strategic planning and analysis techniques can save significant development time and effort. This article presents a new abstract modeling language and environment, the RC Modeling Language (RCML), to facilitate efficient design space exploration of RC systems at the estimation modeling level, that is, before building a functional implementation. Two integrated analysis tools and case studies, one analytical and one simulative, are presented illustrating relatively accurate automated analysis of systems modeled in RCML.", "paper_title": "RCML: An Environment for Estimation Modeling of Reconfigurable Computing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308659300005"}
