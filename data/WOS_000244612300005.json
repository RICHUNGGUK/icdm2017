Due to the difficulty for subjects to evaluate too many LCD-TVs simultaneously, the pairwise comparison of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method was implemented in this study. After investigating the relationship between subjective assessments and physical measurements, some useful information can be provided for the industry to improve the quality of LCD-TVs. Results indicated that luminance, contrast and response time are the important factors in selecting an LCD-TV from a user's point of view. However, after realizing the effect of sharpness, subjects considered that it is the most differentiable factor for selecting an LCD-TV. Therefore, LCD-TV manufactures should emphasize these important factors to improve the quality. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
