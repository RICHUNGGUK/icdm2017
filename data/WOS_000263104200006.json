We find some combinatorial properties for the generating polynomial of such distribution, together with an explicit formula for its coefficients. Afterwards, we carry out an analogous study for the subset of centrosymmetric involutions without fixed points.", "paper_title": "The Eulerian distribution on centrosymmetric involutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000263104200006"}
