The proposed design builds on our centralized body area network access scheme (CBAS), a receiver-initiated medium access control (MAC) scheme that improves the visibility of a BAN in a coexistent environment, where diverse networks with various physical and MAC protocols share the radio spectrum. The design enhances CBAS by incorporating a network layer scheme that improves the packet delivery ratio (PDR), while minimizing the need for multihop cooperative transmissions; thus, packet delay is less compromised to achieve higher PDRs. The MAC layer provides the network layer with local information about the quality of on-body links to enable the BAN to identify the most reliable links in a distributed manner. Extensive experimental results are presented, which give insights on how the proposed cross-layer design improves PDR and packet delay. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed design which takes advantage of dynamic scheduling and multihop relays as warranted by the link conditions.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Design for Prompt and Reliable Transmissions Over Body Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000340119000022"}
