Moreover, automated workload distribution among the devices is based on offline profiling, together with new programming directives that define the device-independent data access range per work-group. Therefore, an OpenCL program originally written for a single compute device can, after inserting a small number of programming directives, run efficiently on a platform consisting of heterogeneous compute devices. Performance is ensured by introducing the technique of virtual cache management, which minimizes the amount of host-device data transfer. Our new OpenCL runtime is evaluated by a diverse set of OpenCL benchmarks, demonstrating good performance on various configurations of a heterogeneous system.", "paper_title": "Enabling a Uniform OpenCL Device View for Heterogeneous Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589800009"}
