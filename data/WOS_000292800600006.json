WMNs are typically deployed as backbone networks, usually employing spatial TDMA (STDMA)-based access schemes which are suitable for the high traffic demands of WMNs. This paper aims to achieve higher utilization of the network capacity and thereby aims to increase the application layer throughput of STOMA-based WMNs. The central idea is to use optimized link state routing (OLSR)-specific routing layer information in link layer channel access schedule formation. This paper proposes two STDMA-based channel access scheduling schemes (one distributed, one centralized) that exploit OLSR-specific information to improve the application layer throughput without introducing any additional messaging overhead. To justify the contribution of using OLSR-specific information to the throughput, the proposed schemes are compared against one another and against their non-OLSR-aware versions via extensive ns-2 simulations. Our simulation results verify that utilizing OLSR-specific information significantly improves the overall network performance both in distributed and in centralized schemes. The simulation results further show that OLSR-aware scheduling algorithms attain higher end-to-end throughput although their non-OLSR-aware counterparts achieve higher concurrency in slot allocations.
