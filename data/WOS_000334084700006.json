However, for many programs this semantics is ineffective. In order to compute useful solutions, one needs the ability to modify the search method that explores the alternative execution branches. TOR, a well-defined hook into Prolog disjunction, provides this ability. It is light-weight thanks to its library approach and efficient because it is based on program transformation. TOR is general enough to mimic search-modifying predicates like ECLiPSe's search/6. Moreover, TOR supports modular composition of search methods and other hooks. The TOR library is already provided and used as an add-on to SWI-Prolog. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
