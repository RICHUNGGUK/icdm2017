For non-regenerative and altruistic relays we propose a low-complexity joint scheme, which simultaneously selects multiple relays and users for cooperation as well as assigns the selected users to different selected relays for service. The proposed scheme is sub-optimal and utilizes only the channel gains between the nodes, which leads to reduced feedback and overhead in comparison to schemes that require full channel knowledge. Furthermore, the complexity of the scheme scales linearly as the product of the total number of relays, the total number of users and the number of selected users. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed joint scheme compared to a scheme with neither user-relay selection nor user-relay association and another scheme with user-relay association, but no user-relay selection. The favorable performance and low-complexity of the proposed scheme make it very attractive for possible implementation in emerging broadband wireless relay networks (e.g., LTE-Advanced).", "paper_title": "A Novel Low-Complexity Joint User-Relay Selection and Association for Multi-User Multi-Relay MIMO Uplink", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800021"}
