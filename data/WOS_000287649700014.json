First, the stability condition is derived for 2-D systems with nonlinearity by exploiting the Lyapunov method. Based on this result, a state feedback controller and an output feedback controller are designed to achieve stability for the closed-loop system. Next, H-infinity controllers are given in terms of the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, some numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis and stabilisation for a class of 2-D nonlinear discrete systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000287649700014"}
