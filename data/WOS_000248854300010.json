The resulting expressions are cast into a form where the dependence of the motion on initial conditions is explicit and the equations governing the orientation of the body involve only real numbers. Based on these results, an efficient method to calculate the location and orientation of the rigid body at arbitrary times is presented. This implementation can be used to verify the accuracy of numerical integration schemes for rigid bodies, to serve as a building block for event-driven discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations of general rigid bodies, and for constructing symplectic integrators for rigid body dynamics.
