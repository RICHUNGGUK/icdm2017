In case where EEG is one of the modalities, it is of interest to relate a nonlinear function of the raw EEG time-domain signal, say, EEG band power, to another modality such as the hemodynamic response, as measured with NIRS or fMRI. In this work we tackle exactly this problem defining a novel algorithm that we denote multimodal source power correlation analysis (mSPoC). The validity and high performance of the mSPoC framework is demonstrated for simulated and real-world multimodal data.", "paper_title": "Integration of Multivariate Data Streams With Bandpower Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000324763600004"}
