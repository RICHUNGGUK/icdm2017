Although the extant research has studied the effect of design elements, such as product presentation, recommendation agents, and image and text on consumer choice, little is known about how Internet vendors could distribute products in a multi-page online product catalog for better performance. It is well-known that the first page of an online product catalog is particularly important to a vendor. Based on price signaling literature and cue consistency theory, this study investigates how price and product popularity cues could be carefully designed for the first page to achieve better sale performance. This study suggests there is a delicate balance point where price cues and popularity cues can achieve consistency and synergy and lead to better page value perceptions for the first page. The boosted page value perceptions, in turn, lead to better sales from the first page. This study extends the theory of cue consistency to the product group level. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
