This paper presents a survey of many recent developments and state-of-the-art methods. Several criteria are proposed that are used to assess the approaches. A taxonomy of existing algorithms is proposed and methods are separated in three groups: static methods, gamut-based methods, and learning-based methods. Further, the experimental setup is discussed including an overview of publicly available datasets. Finally, various freely available methods, of which some are considered to be state of the art, are evaluated on two datasets.", "paper_title": "Computational Color Constancy: Survey and Experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000294132800007"}
