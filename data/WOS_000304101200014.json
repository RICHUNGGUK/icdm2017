In this paper we present an efficient structure, based on polyphase filter banks, for CR receivers. Its core, an analysis channelizer, is a variant of the standard M-path polyphase down converter channelizer. It is able to perform M/2-to-1 down sampling of the input time series while it shifts, by aliasing, all the M channels to base-band. A perfect reconstruction (PR) filter is selected as low-pass prototype for avoiding energy losses during the signal processing. A post analysis block is designed for extracting, when necessary, from the base-band aliased channels, the spectra, or their fragments, belonging to different signals. A selector commutes the output ports of the post analysis block that contain spectral fragments of the same bandwidths and properly delivers them to the up converter synthesis channelizers that reassemble them. The synthesis channelizers are P-n-path polyphase up converter modified for performing 1-to-P-n/2 up sampling of the input time series. Complex frequency rotators, placed at the output of the synthesizers, compensate the frequency offsets, applied in the transmitter, that are responsible for the arbitrary center frequency positioning of the received signals. At the end of the receiver chain, arbitrary interpolators resample the base-band centered signals to obtain two samples per symbol needed for the further processing stages.", "paper_title": "Polyphase analysis filter bank down-converts unequal channel bandwidths with arbitrary center frequencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000304101200014"}
