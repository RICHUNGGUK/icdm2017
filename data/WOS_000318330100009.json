In this paper, we give an overview of the network planning and optimization processes in 3G networks. Emphasis is given on the interdependence between coverage and capacity, which increases the complexity of operating 3G networks in a cost effective and quality assuring manner. We stretch out the importance of introducing automated procedures in these challenging tasks and describe main inputs and outputs of these procedures, such as initial network configuration and constraints, drive test data, and key performance indicators statistics and goals. We use two case studies from a operational 3G system to indicate the improvements on the network when these automated procedures are employed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
