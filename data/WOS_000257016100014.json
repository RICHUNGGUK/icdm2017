In this paper, we propose a systematic scheme to provide delay guaranteed service for CDMA based wireless networks. The proposed scheme works based on the distributed queuing random access with fix assignment protocol for CDMA wireless network (DQRAP + AP/CDMA) including a hierarchical scheduling algorithm and an admission control scheme. The proposed solution has been designed to have an ability to accommodate integrated traffic and provide delay guaranteed service to real-time traffic with delay requirements. A series of simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposal. The results prove that the proposed solution can effectively guarantee the delay requirements from different real-time traffic streams. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
