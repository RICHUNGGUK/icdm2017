In this paper, a robust power control scheme via link gain pricing with H(infinity) estimator is proposed. The scheme guarantees the interference temperature of the PUs through operating in the network-centric manner, and keeps the fairness between the SUs through link gain pricing. Furthermore, the H(infinity) filter is also used in the proposed scheme to estimate the channel variation, and thus the power control scheme is robust to the severe channel fading. Plenty of simulations are taken, and prove its superior robust performance against the channel fading, and its effectiveness in guaranteeing the interference temperature limit of the PUs.", "paper_title": "Robust Power Control for Cognitive Radio in Spectrum Underlay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000296087500001"}
