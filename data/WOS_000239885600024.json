The notion of epsilon-point of an algebraic hypersurface is quite intuitive. It essentially consists in a point such that when substituted in the implicit equation of the hypersurface gives values of small module. Intuition says that an epsilon-point of a hypersurface is a point close to it. In this paper, we formally analyze this assertion giving bounds of the distance of the epsilon-point to the hypersurface. For this purpose, we introduce the notions of height, depth and weight of an epsilon-point. The height and the depth control when the distance bounds are valid, while the weight is involved in the bounds. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
