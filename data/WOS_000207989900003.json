The purpose of this study is to revisit an early proposition by Nolan and colleagues regarding corporate IT purchasing behavior, called the Stages Hypothesis. We find that the Stages Hypothesis cannot be viewed as a general theory describing the IT purchasing behavior of firms; however, the development of the IT budget of some mostly large firms in our sample is consistent with the Stages Hypothesis. Based on further analyses, we offer a new interpretation of the Stages Hypothesis.", "paper_title": "Do IT Managers Learn How to Control Spending on New Information Technology?
