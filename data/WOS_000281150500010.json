The concept of a consistent function with respect to dominance relations is first introduced and its properties are investigated. Then, some main invariant properties of dominance relations under relation mappings are studied. It is proven that attribute reductions in the original ordered information system and its image system are equivalent under the condition of homomorphism. By means of the results, we can get the smaller image system that has the same reducts as a given massive ordered information system.", "paper_title": "Some invariant properties of ordered information systems under homomorphism", "paper_id": "WOS:000281150500010"}
