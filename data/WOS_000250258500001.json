Popescu, An identification scheme based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, The 4th international Conference on High-Performance Computing in the Asia-Pacific Region, vol. 2 (2000) 624-625] using a one-way hash function. For making the trade-off of performance and security stand to benefit most, the proposed scheme is constructed on the elliptic curve cryptosystem. The scheme protects the signer from chosen-message attack and also identifies a forged signature.
