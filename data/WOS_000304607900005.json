Although these structures are often complex, analyzing them enables us to detect several inter and intra connections amongst people in and outside their organizations. In this context, we present an approach using data mining techniques in order to identify intra and inter organizational linkages amongst groups of people with similar profiles. Using clustering techniques, we identify groups of people in a way that allows us to evaluate how researchers collaborate in the Brazilian scientific scenario of Computing Science. Besides this, we are able to understand how research flows amongst the best universities and research centres in Brazil. Understanding the Scientific Brazilian scenario can help the development of research in other scenario or even in other Social Network Types.", "paper_title": "Identifying Workgroups in Brazilian Scientific Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304607900005"}
