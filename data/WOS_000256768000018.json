The model is combined with an on-chip power supply grid model in order to analyze noise caused by switching buses in a power supply grid. The bus is modeled as distributed resistance-inductance-capacitance (RLC) lines that are capacitively and inductively coupled to each other. Different switching patterns and driver skewing times are also included in the model. The power supply grid is modeled as a network of RLC segments. The model is verified by comparing it to HSPICE. The error was below 8%. The model is applied to determine the influence of driver skewing times on maximum power supply noise.", "paper_title": "Modeling of on-chip bus switching current and its impact on noise in power supply grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000256768000018"}
