The stability of the LBM is a challenging problem in the simulation of compressible flows with different types of embedded discontinuities. The present study proposes an approach for simulation of inviscid flows by a compressible LB model in order to enhance the robustness using a combination of Essentially Non Oscillatory (ENO) scheme and Shock-Detecting Sensor (SDS) procedure. A sensor is introduced with adjustable parameters which is active near the discontinuities and affects less on smooth regions. The validity of the improved model to capture shocks and to resolve contact discontinuity and rarefaction waves in the well-known benchmarks such as, Riemann problem, and shock reflection is investigated. In addition, the problem of supersonic flow in a channel with ramp is simulated using a skewed rectangular grid generated by an algebraic grid generation method. The numerical results are compared with analytical ones and those obtained by solving the original model. The numerical results show that the presented scheme is capable of generating more robust solutions in the simulation of compressible flows and is almost free of oscillations for high Mach numbers. Good agreements are obtained for all problems.", "paper_title": "The use of shock-detecting sensor to improve the stability of Lattice Boltzmann Model for high Mach number flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000349228100006"}
