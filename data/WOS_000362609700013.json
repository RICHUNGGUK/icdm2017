The generalized Hoek-Brown (HB) failure criterion, but by keeping a constant value of the exponent, alpha = 0.5, was used. The failure criterion was smoothened both in the meridian and pi planes. The nonlinear optimization was carried out by employing an interior point method based on the logarithmic barrier function. The results for the obtained bearing capacity were presented in a non-dimensional form for different values of GSI, m(i), sigma(ci)/(gamma b) and q/sigma(ci). Failure patterns were also examined for a few cases. For validating the results, computations were also performed for a strip footing as well. The results obtained from the analysis compare well with the data reported in literature. Since the equilibrium conditions are precisely satisfied only at the centroids of the elements, not everywhere in the domain, the obtained lower bound solution will be approximate not true.
