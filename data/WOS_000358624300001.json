Given a set N of n items with at most d positive subsets of N, each positive subset having cardinality at most r, we need to determine the set P subset of P(N) of positive subsets via group tests. In this paper, we give an adaptive algorithm for group testing for the complex model, for all r <= 2, which can be seen as a generalization of the binary splitting method for classical group testing (r = 1). For fixed r, our algorithm solves the problem with O (d(r) logn) tests while the best known non-adaptive algorithm requires O (d(r+1)(1+3/d)(d) log n/d)tests. While non-adaptive solutions are preferable for some applications that require parallelization of tests, our adaptive algorithm is superior when d grows with n, yielding a polynomial number of tests on d and logk.
