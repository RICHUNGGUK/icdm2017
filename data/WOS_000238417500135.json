The current generation of grid information services lack the ability to determine how trustworthy a particular grid service provider or grid customer is likely to be. In this paper, we propose a grid information service with reputation management facility and its underlying algorithm for computing and managing reputation in service-oriented grid computing. Our reputation management service is based on the concept of dynamic trust and reputation adaptation based on community experiences. The working model and functionality offered by the proposed reputation management service is discussed.", "paper_title": "A reputation-based Grid Information Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500135"}
