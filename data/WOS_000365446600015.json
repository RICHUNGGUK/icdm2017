One of the novelties of our approach is that directional and anisotropic geometric features are efficiently extracted and used for the recognition step. In addition, our approach is augmented by regularization theory (RSN) in order to control the trade-off between the fidelity to the data (gallery) and the smoothness of the solution (probe). In this work, we address the challenging problem of the single training sample per subject (STSS). We compare our new algorithm against different state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Regularized directional feature learning for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000365446600015"}
