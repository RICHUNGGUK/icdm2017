A demand for more flexibility led to the integration of a symbolic model definition module into the existing program. We elaborate on our motivations and choices made to our decision for the gPROMS language. The existing program is described, and in some detail the functionalities to minimise the modelling errors and to enhance the detection of them. The gPROMS language itself, the evolution of it and the selected subset are described. Additionally, new attributes of the language are described: spline construction, intermediate graphical results, and definition of a large number of simulations/optimisations. The symbolic model definition module is demonstrated on the determination of an attainable region and the thermal cracking of ethane. The symbolic modelling module proved to be cost effective and improved the quality of the main engine. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
