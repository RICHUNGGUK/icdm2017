Government funding agencies invest heavily to CIRT projects every year. Thus, it is important to select the desired CIRT projects to avoid undesirable budget consumed. The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated method for CIRT project selection. In this method, competitiveness and collaboration of candidate innovative research teams (IRTs) are used to assess and select projects. The criteria for competitiveness and collaboration are finalized in light of literature review as well as real situations. A formal decision procedure that aggregates competitiveness and collaboration performances of CIRTs is then presented. It integrates analytic hierarchy process (AHP), scoring method and weighted geometric averaging method. Some sample data from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) is used to illustrate the potential application of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
