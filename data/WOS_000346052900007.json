Many organizations have introduced ICT-based processes to reduce the use of paper as primary documentation. Nevertheless, paper documents are still being used in healthcare. Purpose: To better understand this situation, we have studied the use of paper-based patient lists in two wards in a Norwegian hospital that has 'gone digital'. We seek to answer the question: \"Why is it that paper-based patient lists are maintained in the ward of a hospital going digital?\" Methods: Participant observations and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Results: Patient lists allow nurses to immediately record, retrieve, and share relevant patient information at the point of care in a way that is not immediately available through the EPR system. Paper-based tools continue to serve purposes beyond and outside what is currently supported by current electronic information systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
