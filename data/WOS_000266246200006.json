The architecture was implemented using a state-of-the-art semantic-mediation toolset for design-time and run-time integration tasks. The design-time tools supported a domain ontology definition, message annotations, message schema transformations and reconciliation rules specifications. The run-time tools performed exchanges, transformations, and reconciliations of the messages. The architecture supports a supply-chain integration scenario where heterogeneous automotive manufacturing supply-chain applications exchange inventory information.", "paper_title": "A semantic-mediation architecture for interoperable supply-chain applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000266246200006"}
