The agent has detailed knowledge of the environment and the obstacles only in the vicinity of its current position. Far away obstacles are only partially known and may even change dynamically. The algorithm makes use of the wavelet transform to construct an approximation of the environment at different levels of resolution. We associate with this multiresolution representation of the environment a graph, whose dimension can be made commensurate to the on-board computational resources of the agent. The adjacency list of the graph can be efficiently constructed directly from the approximation and detail wavelet coefficients, thus further speeding up the whole process. Simulations are presented to test the efficiency of the algorithm using non-trivial scenarios.", "paper_title": "Multiresolution Hierarchical Path-Planning for Small UAVs Using Wavelet Decompositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000303588600008"}
