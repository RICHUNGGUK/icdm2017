However, current policy-management systems are a poor fit for the domain because they don't support decentralized management in open environments. The Community-Based Policy-Management System (CBPMS) can manage services in domains where relationships are dynamic and flexible, policy specification is distributed and uses multiple languages, and management decision-making is shared between users and service providers. This article describes the CBPMS schema and architecture, showing how it provides flexible, dynamic, and extensible policy-based management capabilities to those who provide user services on the Web.", "paper_title": "Service-Oriented Policy Management for Web-Application Frameworks", "paper_id": "WOS:000271603500008"}
