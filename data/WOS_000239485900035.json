However, in practice this concept still remains difficult to be exploited due to the lack of formalization and supporting methodology. In this paper, we propose a way to formalize the process pattern concept by introducing it into a process meta-model. We provide a general definition to cover various kinds of process-related patterns in different domains. We define rigorously process concepts and their relations to allow representing processes based on process patterns and to facilitate the development of supporting tools. By distinguishing process patterns at different abstraction levels, we aim to develop a systematic approach to define and apply process patterns.", "paper_title": "A UML-based process meta-model integrating a rigorous process patterns definition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485900035"}
