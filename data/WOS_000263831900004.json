Each agent handles a specific job-list in a bidirectional flowshop. For the individual agent scheduling problem, a formulation is proposed in continuous time domain and compared with an IP formulation in discrete time domain. Of particular interest is the formulation of the machine utilization functionboth in continuous time and discrete time. Fast heuristic methods are proposed With the relaxation of the machine capacity. For the integrated resource allocation and scheduling problem, a linear programming relaxation approach is applied to solve the global resource allocation and a fast heuristic method is applied to solve each scheduling subproblem. The proposed solution is compared experimentally with that from the integer programming solver by CPLEX.", "paper_title": "Integrated Resource Allocation and Scheduling in a Bidirectional Flowshop With Multimachine and COS Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000263831900004"}
