Our method leverages the advantages of low-rank linear filtering by reducing the problem of 2D convolution to multiple 1D convolutions, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the filtering operation. In the case of rank 1 filters (e.g., the box filter and Gaussian filter), the kernel is described as 'separable' since it can be implemented as a horizontal 1D convolution followed by a 1D vertical convolution. While many filter kernels which result in bokeh effects cannot be approximated closely by separable kernels, they can be effectively approximated by low-rank kernels. We demonstrate the speed and flexibility of low-rank filters by applying them to image blurring, tilt-shift postprocessing, and depth-of-field simulation, and also analyze the approximation error for several aperture shapes.", "paper_title": "Fast Bokeh effects using low-rank linear filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000353831400008"}
