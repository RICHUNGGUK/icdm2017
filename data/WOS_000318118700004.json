Web mining plays an important role in discovering such knowledge. This mining can be roughly divided into three categories, including Web usage mining, Web content mining, and Web structure mining. Data and knowledge on the Web may, however, consist of imprecise, incomplete, and uncertain data. Because fuzzy-set theory is often used to handle such data, several fuzzy Web-mining techniques have been proposed to reveal fuzzy and linguistic knowledge. This paper reviews these techniques according to the three Web-mining categories abovefuzzy Web usage mining, fuzzy Web content mining, and fuzzy Web structure mining. Some representative approaches in each category are introduced and compared. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "A survey of fuzzy web mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000318118700004"}
