In the first scenario, no parameterization of the basic curves is available, only well-spaced samples; in the second, a parameterization is available but cannot be used directly in a spline framework; only in the third scenario can pieces of basic curves be exactly re-represented and included into the spline. In all three cases the output is a cubic C-2 spline suitable for standard CAD downstream processing. A key challenge in constructing the spline is to cope with transitions in the presence of strongly differing curvatures. Here we introduce a new form of curvature-sensitive averaging.
