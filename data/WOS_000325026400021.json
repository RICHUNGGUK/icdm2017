In this way, Kalman filtering approach may not be robust in the presence of modeling uncertainties. So, several methods have been proposed to design robust estimators for the systems with uncertain parameters. In this paper, an optimized filter is proposed for this problem considering an uncertain discrete-time linear system. After converting the subject to an optimization problem, three algorithms are used for optimizing the state estimator parameters: particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, modified genetic algorithm (MGA) and learning automata (LA). Experimental results show that, in comparison with the standard Kalman filter and some related researches, using the proposed optimization methods results in robust performance in the presence of uncertainties. However, MGA-based estimation method shows better performance in the range of uncertain parameter than other optimization methods.", "paper_title": "Robust state estimator design for uncertain linear systems using optimization techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000325026400021"}
