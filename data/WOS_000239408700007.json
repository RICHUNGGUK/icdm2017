This method is extended to compute upper and lower bounds on the information rate of very general channels with memory by means of finite-state approximations. Further upper and lower bounds can be computed by reduced-state methods.", "paper_title": "Simulation-based computation of information rates for channels with memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408700007"}
