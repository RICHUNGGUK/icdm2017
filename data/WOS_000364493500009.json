Concrete hydration was accelerated by heat curing. The compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and resistivity of the concrete were analyzed. Maximum expansion occurred in the BOF and DSS samples containing 0.30-0.60 mm and 0.60-1.18 mm particles, respectively. Deterioration was more severe in the BOF samples. In the slag aggregates for the complete replacement of fine aggregate, severe fractures occurred in both the BOF and DSS samples. Scanning electron microscopy revealed excess CH after curing, which caused peripheral hydration products to become extruded, resulting in fracture.", "paper_title": "Expansion behavior of concrete containing different steel slag aggregate sizes under heat curing", "paper_id": "WOS:000364493500009"}
