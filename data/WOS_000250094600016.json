An unsupervised spectral mapping method is extended to a semi-supervised situation with multiplicative modulation of similarities between data. Our proposed algorithm is derived by linearization of this nonlinear semi-supervised mapping method. Experiments using the proposed method for some public benchmark data and color image data reveal that our method outperforms a supervised algorithm using the linear discriminant analysis and a previous semi-supervised classification method.", "paper_title": "Semi-supervised classification with spectral projection of multiplicatively modulated similarity data", "paper_id": "WOS:000250094600016"}
