In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to combine Artificial Immune and particle filter for articulated body motion tracking, fusing the strengths of both approaches. Compared with previous optimization based particle filter, our method overcomes the disadvantages of inefficiency by incorporating artificial immune algorithm into particle filter. Evaluations on MOCAP dataset show that immune particle filter algorithm performs better than anneal particle filter.", "paper_title": "Articulated body tracking by immune particle filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300107"}
