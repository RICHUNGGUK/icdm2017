The solution polynomials are reconstructed using a WENO scheme by taking advantage of handily available and yet valuable information, namely the derivatives, in the context of the discontinuous Galerkin method. The stencils used in the reconstruction involve only the van Neumann neighborhood and are compact and consistent with the DG method. The developed HWENO limiter is implemented and used in a discontinuous Galerkin method to compute a variety of both steady-state and time-accurate compressible flow problems on unstructured grids. Numerical experiments for a wide range of flow conditions in both 2D and 3D configurations are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of the designed HWENO limiter for the DG methods.
