The major contribution of this paper is the proposal of a novel segmentation algorithm that improves lung segmentation for cases in which the lung has a unique shape and pathologies such as pleural effusion by incorporating multiple shapes and prior information on neighbor structures in a graph cut framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm by comparing it to conventional one using a synthetic image and clinical thoracic CT volumes. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
