In terms of the contingent cone and tangent derivative, we extend the Abadie CQ to more general convex multifunction cases and introduce the strong ACQ for both multifunctions and inequality systems. Some seemly unrelated notions are unified by the new ACQ and strong ACQ. Relationships among ACQ, strong ACQ, basic constraint qualification (BCQ) and strong BCQ are discussed. Using the strong ACQ, we study calmness of a closed and convex multifunction between two Banach spaces and, different from many existing dual conditions for calmness, establish several primal characterizations of calmness. As applications, some primal characterizations for error bounds and linear regularity are established; in particular, some existing results are improved.", "paper_title": "Strong Abadie CQ, ACQ, calmness and linear regularity", "paper_id": "WOS:000336278500004"}
