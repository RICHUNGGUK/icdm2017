Particularly, the high-density through-silicon via based integration could lead to ultra-high temperature hotspots and permanent silicon device damage. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive strategy to effectively diffuse heat throughout the 3D geometry. This strategy employs a dynamic programming network to select and optimize the direction of data manoeuvre in a network-on-chip (NoC). We also developed a tool, which is based on the accurate HotSpot thermal model and SystemC cycle accurate model, to simulate the thermal system and evaluate our approach. We found that the proposed approach can significantly diffuse the hotspots from a 3D geometry and overall temperature can be significantly reduced. Given the same thermal constraints, the throughput performance of an adaptive NoC can also be improved. This work enables a new avenue to explore the on-chip adaptability for the future large-scale 3D integration.", "paper_title": "Dynamic On-Chip Thermal Optimization for Three-Dimensional Networks-On-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000319822100006"}
