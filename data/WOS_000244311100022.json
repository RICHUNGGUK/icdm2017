Different from traditional methods, which use motion features to detect vehicles, this method introduces a new color transform model to find important \"vehicle color\" for quickly locating possible vehicle candidates. Since vehicles have various colors under different weather and lighting conditions, seldom works were proposed for the detection of vehicles using colors. The proposed new color transform model has excellent capabilities to identify vehicle pixels from background, even though the pixels are lighted under varying illuminations. After finding possible vehicle candidates, three important features, including corners, edge maps, and coefficients of wavelet transforms, are used for constructing a cascade multichannel classifier. According to this classifier, an effective scanning can be performed to verify all possible candidates quickly. The scanning process can be quickly achieved because most background pixels are eliminated in advance by the color feature. Experimental results show that the integration of global color features and local edge features is powerful in the detection of vehicles. The average accuracy rate of vehicle detection is 94.9%.", "paper_title": "Vehicle detection using normalized color and edge map", "paper_id": "WOS:000244311100022"}
