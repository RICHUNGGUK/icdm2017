Although many different styles of evaluation are used, there is no clear consensus on the most relevant approaches. We report a review of papers published in International Symposium of Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) proceedings in the past decade, building on the previous work of Swan and Gabbard (2005). Firstly, we investigate the evaluation goal, measurement and method of ISMAR papers according to their usability research in four categories: performance, perception and cognition, collaboration and User Experience (UX). Secondly, we consider the balance of evaluation approaches with regard to empirical-analytical, quantitative-qualitative and participant demographics. Finally we identify potential emphases for usability study of AR systems in the future. These analyses provide a reference point for current evaluation techniques, trends and challenges, which benefit researchers intending to design, conduct and interpret usability evaluations for future AR systems.
