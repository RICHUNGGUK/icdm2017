Many remarkable solutions have been developed in this area, most of which have proven to be effective in the protection of user privacy against different types of attacks. Recently, the privacy preservation problem has also been considered in the realm of wireless sensor networks due to their imminent adoption in real-world scenarios. A special challenge that arises from the analysis of the flow of sensor nodes' communications is the location privacy problem. In this paper, we concentrate on analyzing the suitability of traditional anonymous communication systems originally designed for the Internet to the original scenario of sensor networks. The results show that, in most cases, traditional solutions do not provide the adequate protection means for the particular problem of location privacy, while other solutions are very much resource consuming for the restricted capabilities of sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "(Un)Suitability of Anonymous Communication Systems to WSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000318170300012"}
