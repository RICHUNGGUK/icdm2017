The proposed method takes image structure into account and uses a low complexity homogeneity measure to evaluate the intensity uniformity of a local region based on high-pass operators. We experimented with monochrome images under different types of distortions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides better consistency with the perceived image quality. It is suitable for real applications to control the processed image quality.", "paper_title": "Homogeneity based image objective quality metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000241296100012"}
