A possible explanation is that genetic variants with small effects have not been detected. The chance is <8% that a causal SNP will be directly genotyped. The effects of its neighboring SNPs may be too weak to be detected due to the effect decay caused by imperfect linkage disequilibrium. Moreover, it is still challenging to detect a causal SNP with a small effect even if it has been directly genotyped. Results: In order to increase the statistical power when detecting disease-associated SNPs with relatively small effects, we propose a method using neighborhood information. Since the disease-associated SNPs account for only a small fraction of the entire SNP set, we formulate this problem as Contiguous Outlier DEtection (CODE), which is a discrete optimization problem. In our formulation, we cast the disease-associated SNPs as outliers and further impose a spatial continuity constraint for outlier detection. We show that this optimization can be solved exactly using graph cuts. We also employ the stability selection strategy to control the false positive results caused by imperfect parameter tuning. We demonstrate its advantage in simulations and real experiments. In particular, the newly identified SNP clusters are replicable in two independent datasets.
