By taking the full advantage of the packet-based transmission in NCSs, a delay compensation control approach is proposed to actively compensate the network-induced delay in Markovian jump linear system framework. Different from previously reported delay compensation control approaches to NCSs, an output feedback strategy is used to generate the control input packet. A new necessary and sufficient condition is proposed to perform the stability analysis of networked closed-loop system. Furthermore, by using the recently established singular Markovian jump system theory, the controller design problem is solved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by using a numerical example. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
