The HTSS is modeled in the form of multiobjective framework to simultaneously maximize GENCOs profit and minimize emissions of thermal units. In the proposed model the valve loading effects which is a nonlinear problem by itself is linearized. Also a dynamic ramp rate of thermal units is used instead of a fix rate leading to more realistic formulation of HTSS. Furthermore, the multi performance curves of hydro units is developed and prohibited operating zones (POZs) of thermal unit are considered in HTSS problem. Also, in the proposed framework, the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) of HTSS is converted to mixed integer programming (MIP) problem that can be effectively solved by optimization softwares even for real size power systems. The lexicographic optimization and hybrid augmented-weighted epsilon-constraint technique is implemented to generate Pareto optimal solutions. The best compromised solution is adopted either by using a fuzzy approach or by considering arbitrage opportunities to achieve more profit. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is studied based on the IEEE 118-bus system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
