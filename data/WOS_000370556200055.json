Our design uses a broadcast and select architecture, based on a passive star coupler and fast tunable transceivers. In addition we employ time division multiplexing to achieve very low switching latency. Our demo shows the feasibility of the switch data plane using a small testbed, comprising two transmitters and a receiver, connected through a star coupler.", "paper_title": "A High-Radix, Low-Latency Optical Switch for Data Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200055"}
