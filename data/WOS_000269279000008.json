In this paper, we address the issue of how to provide proportional differentiated services in OBS networks. Firstly, a Dynamic Wavelength Selection (DWS) scheme is introduced to provide proportional differentiated services in bufferless OBS networks by dynamically assigning more and longer periods of wavelengths to high priority classes. This scheme can also utilize wavelengths efficiently because the wavelengths are shared among different classes. Next, a Delayed Burst Assignment (DBA) scheme is introduced, by which bursts of the high priority class are given a higher probability for reserving wavelengths by scheduling the bursts of the low priority class with a delay to provide quality of service (QoS) in OBS networks. The integration of these two schemes provides proportional differentiated services and improves the burst loss performance by giving the burst head packet (BHP) two opportunities of scheduling its data burst (DB).
