However, while authentication is still needed in the power request, because the power request could leak the life pattern to the malicious adversary, privacy preservation of the sensitive information in power request also needs to be considered. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving power request (PPP) scheme to fulfill the security requirements. In particular, when requesting for the power with the authentication guarantee, the source smart meter will not leak the identity to the power generator and substations of the smart grid. In addition, our proposed PPP scheme is efficient in terms of communication and computation overhead, which can be demonstrated by numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Privacy-Preserving Power Request in Smart Grid Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337155400013"}
