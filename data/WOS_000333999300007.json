The method was next extended to reacting flows (RDEM) by Le Metayer et al. (2005). The objective of the present work is to compute high speed combustion waves in a robust and accurate way using RDEM. Several ingredients need to be implemented within the RDEM framework to achieve this goal and they are successively assessed on non-reacting interface problems using DEM and on reacting flows using RDEM. These ingredients are: the anti-diffusive approach developed in Despres and Lagoutiere (2002), the Large Time Step generalization of Godunov's method proposed by LeVeque and an original upwind downwind-controlled spitting method (UDCS). Numerical experiments performed on one-dimensional non-reacting (water gas shock tube problem) and reacting (Chapman-Jouguet deflagration, strong detonation wave) flows demonstrate the combination of DEM/RDEM with UDCS and the anti-diffusive approach yields excellent robustness and accuracy properties.
