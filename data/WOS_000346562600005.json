For automatic online signature verification, rather than storing an image of the completed signature, data are represented in the form of a time series of pen position and status information allowing the extraction of temporal-based features. For visualisation purposes, signature images need to be recreated from time-series data. In this study, the authors investigate the accuracy and verification performance of a series of interpolation methods for recreating a signature image from the time-series data contained in two ISO/IEC data storage formats. The authors experiments investigate dynamic data stored at various sample rates and signature images recreated at differing resolutions. Their study indicates possible best practice in terms of image recreation method, recreated image resolution and temporal sample rate and assesses the effect on the accuracy of reconstructed signature data.", "paper_title": "Assessment of methods for image recreation from signature time-series data", "paper_id": "WOS:000346562600005"}
