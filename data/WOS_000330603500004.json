Instead of monotone mapping, the notion of dominated mappings is applied. We have used weaker contractive conditions and weaker restrictions to obtain unique fixed points. An example is given which shows that how this result can be used when the corresponding results cannot Our results generalize, extend and improve several well-known conventional results.", "paper_title": "Common fixed points of a pair of Hardy Rogers Type Mappings on a Closed Ball in Ordered Partial Metric Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603500004"}
