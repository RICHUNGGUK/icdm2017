Based on the relation between the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix and the largest degree of the scale-free network, we show that adding a new edge to the node of largest degree will generally weaken the synchronizability of a scale-free network. We consequently propose a method to effectively enhance the network synchronizability by attaching the new edge to a node whose nearest-neighbors have small degrees. The effect of the new method is analyzed and demonstrated with comparisons.", "paper_title": "ENHANCING THE SYNCHRONIZABILITY OF SCALE-FREE NETWORKS BY ADDING EDGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000274267700005"}
