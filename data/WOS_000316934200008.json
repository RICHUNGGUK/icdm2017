In order to not only attain the image focusing properties and more visual information in the fused image, but also sensitive to the human visual perception, a local multidirection variance (LEOV) fusion rule is proposed for lowpass subband coefficient. In order to introduce more visual saliency, a modified local contrast is defined. In addition, according to the feature of distribution of highpass subband coefficients, a direction vector is proposed to constrain the modified local contrast and construct the new fusion rule for highpass subband coefficients selection The NSCT is a flexible multiscale, multidirection, and shift-invariant tool for image decomposition, which can be implemented via the atrous algorithm. The proposed fusion algorithm based on NSCT not only can prevent artifacts and erroneous from introducing into the fused image, but also can eliminate 'block effect' and 'frequency aliasing' phenomenon. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved better fusion results than wavelet-based and CT-based fusion method in contrast and clarity.", "paper_title": "A Novel Multifocus Image Fusion Algorithm Based on Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000316934200008"}
