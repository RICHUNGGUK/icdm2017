A three-layer feed forward back propagation neural network having 3-7-1 architecture network was trained using 37 data sets measured from laboratory investigation. Ten new data sets were used for the, validation and comparison of the air flow rate by ANN and multi-variate regression analysis (MVRA) to develop more confidence on the proposed method. Results were compared based on coefficient of determination (CoD) and mean absolute error (MAE) between measured and predicted values of air flow rate. It was found that CoD between measured and predicted air flow rate was 0.995 and 0.758 by ANN and MVRA, respectively, whereas MAE was 0.0413 and 0.1876.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural network for prediction of air flow in a single rock joint", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552600032"}
