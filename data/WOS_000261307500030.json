With the support of the GSM troubleshooting ontology, a text-mining-empowered data refurbishing technique can successfully \"refurbish\" a real-life customer service database. The refurbished database then can support an association rule-mining algorithm that utilizes multiple minimum supports to discover better troubleshooting rules. We have developed an intelligent GSM troubleshooting system based on these techniques. Our experimental results with the system show a substantial improvement in both the quality and the quantity of the mined troubleshooting rules. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
