This paper looks into key communication infrastructure design aspects, and analyzes two representative evolution cases of Active Network Management (ANM) for distributed control. Relevant standard initiatives, communication protocols and technologies are introduced and underlying engineering challenges are highlighted. By analyzing two representative case networks (meshed and radial topologies) at different voltage levels (33 and 11 kV), this paper discusses the design considerations and presents performance results based on numerical simulations. This study focuses on the key role of the telecommunications provision when upgrading and deploying distributed control solutions, as part of future ANM systems.", "paper_title": "Communication Infrastructures for Distributed Control of Power Distribution Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290414000016"}
