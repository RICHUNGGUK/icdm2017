The problem is motivated by the anonymization network Tor, and the difficulties that arise when aiming to estimate the number of Tor users. We present a way to perform distributed user counting with accurate estimates and a high level of privacy protection, based on a probabilistic data structure. We start from a relatively naive approach, and analyze the level of privacy protection that it provides. Subsequently, we improve on this baseline mechanism, building upon the gained insights. In order to assess the privacy properties of the discussed techniques, we use a novel probabilistic analysis approach which compares an attacker's a priori and a posteriori knowledge.
