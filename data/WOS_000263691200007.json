For the transition, bifurcation of potential function is utilized. We demonstrate the behavior transition of the walking robot between biped and quadruped locomotion as an adaptation to the environment depending on the gradient of a slope. The behavior transition is carried out by using bifurcation of parameters used for control. We also show the effectiveness of hysteresis in the transition. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
