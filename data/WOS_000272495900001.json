ICub is a humanoid robot platform that has been conceived as a result of the development of the European Project RobotCub. Mechanical problems of the current head sub-system of iCub robot have been studied in order to figure out improvements for a new design. The feasibility of the new design has been checked through dynamic simulations of the head operations. The successful results have shown plots with curve evolutions of smooth shapes and suitable values of important kinematic and dynamic parameters of the head structure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
