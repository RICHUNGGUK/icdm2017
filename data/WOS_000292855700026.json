In this paper, we proposed a new method for characterizing protein sequences the Weighted Segmented Pseudo-amino acid composition Moment Vector (W-SPsAA-MV). From protein sequences, the encoding method of W-SPsAA-MV is applied to protein functional class prediction associated with the nearest neighbor algorithm (NNA) and covariant discriminant (CD) classifier. The experiment results show that our new method is efficient to predict functional class of query proteins when protein-protein interaction information is limited.", "paper_title": "Predicting Protein Functional Class with the Weighted Segmented Pseudo-Amino Acid Composition Moment Vector", "paper_id": "WOS:000292855700026"}
