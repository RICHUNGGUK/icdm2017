The cubicity of G, denoted as cub(G), is the minimum k such that G is the intersection graph of a collection of k-cubes. Many NP-complete graph problems can be solved efficiently or have good approximation ratios in graphs of low cubicity. In most of these cases the first step is to get a low dimensional cube representation of the given graph. It is known that for graph G, cub(G) <= left perpendicular2n/3right perpendicular. Recently it has been shown that for a graph G, cub(G) >= 4(Delta + 1) In n, where n and Delta are the number of vertices and maximum degree of G, respectively. In this paper, we show that for a bipartite graph G = (A boolean OR B, E) with |A| = n(1), |B| = n2, n(1) <= n(2), and Delta' = min {Delta(A),Delta(B)}, where Delta(A) = max(a is an element of A)d(a) and Delta(B) = max(b is an element of B) d(b), d(a) and d(b) being the degree of a and b in G, respectively , cub(G) <= 2(Delta' + 2) bar left rightln n(2)bar left arrow. We also give an efficient randomized algorithm to construct the cube representation of G in 3 (Delta' + 2) bar right arrowIn n(2)bar left arrow dimension. The reader may note that in general Delta' can be much smaller than Delta. (C) 2008 Elseiver B.V.
