In our proposed CDD-UW-OFDM system, the first transmit antenna transmits a UW-OFDM and then, for every UW-OFDM block, the i-th transmit antenna transmits a cyclically delayed version of the symbols transmitted at the first transmit antenna. With this proposed CDD-OFDM system, each antenna transmission is a UW-OFDM. Also, at the receiver under a certain condition on the cyclic delay amounts, the received signal is equivalent to that of a single transmit antenna UW-OFDM transmission with a longer multipath channel. We design the lengths of UW and cyclic delays to achieve the full multipath and spatial diversities for the CDD-UW-OFDM system when the linear MMSE receiver is used. We then present some simulation results to illustrate the claimed performance of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "Cyclic delay transmission for unique word OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500007"}
