The development stages for an electronic product can be diverse: design, manufacturing, test, and many hours of engineering. However, are the different development stages of a project or an electronic product included in the teaching programs of our universities? In this paper, several proposals regarding the development stages of a project and their relationship with the curriculum in some countries are analyzed.", "paper_title": "From the Idea to the Product: An Academic Tour", "paper_id": "WOS:000372658300013"}
