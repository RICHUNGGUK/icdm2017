The authors evaluated the real energy consumption of the HMP system tuned for a set of 50 application codes using a data-mining tool for finding code similarities and selecting HMP configurations. The selected HMP system configuration requires a small cache configuration and consumes less energy when compared to a homogeneous system with the same number of cores and only with a very modest increase in execution time.", "paper_title": "Application-oriented cache memory configuration for energy efficiency in multi-cores", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714500008"}
