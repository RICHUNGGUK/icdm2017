Approaches addressing this challenge are driven by the requirements of the environment and the characteristics of users. This paper addresses the challenge of optimising resource allocation through the combined application of game theory and normative tools such MPEG-21 and MPEG-7. The resulting game play leads to a forced Nash equilibrium where a change of strategy will not make any player better off.", "paper_title": "A game approach to optimization of bandwidth allocation using MPEG-7 and MPEG-21", "paper_id": "WOS:000313965800013"}
