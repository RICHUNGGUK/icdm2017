In our approach, the problems of feature extraction and classifier design are viewed together as a single matter of estimating the optimal parameters from limited data. We propose, for the problem of facial recognition, a combination between an Interest Operator based feature extraction technique and a k-NN statistical classifier having the parameters determined using a pattern search based optimization technique. This approach enables us to achieve both higher classification accuracy and faster processing time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
