The present study aims to design and evaluate haptic interfaces with vehicle seats. Three experiments were conducted by testing a haptic seat in a simulator with a total of 20 participants. The first experiment measured reaction time, subjective satisfaction, and subject workloads of the haptic, visual, and auditory displays for the four signals primarily used by vehicle navigation systems. The second experiment measured reaction time, subjective satisfaction, and subjective workloads of the haptic, auditory, and multimodal (haptic + auditory) displays for the ringing signal used by in-vehicle Bluetooth hands-free systems. The third experiment measured drivers' subjective awareness, urgency, usefulness, and disturbance levels at various vibration intensities and positions for a haptic warning signal used by a driver drowsiness warning system. The results indicated that haptic seat interfaces performed better than visual and auditory interfaces, but the unfamiliarity of the haptic interface caused a lower subjective satisfaction for some criteria. Generally, participants showed high subjective satisfaction levels and low subjective workloads toward haptic seat interfaces. This study provided guidance for implementing haptic seat interfaces and identified the possible benefits of their use. It is expected that haptic seats implemented in vehicles will improve safety and the interaction between driver and vehicle.", "paper_title": "Haptic Seat Interfaces for Driver Information and Warning Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299772600001"}
