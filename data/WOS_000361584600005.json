By using standard descent schemes, the procedure can never get stuck in local minima (since the error functional only has a minimum), but will always and steadily decrease the error until getting to the original solution (the only minimum). In this paper, we propose a variable step-size implementation of our variational approach. We are able to perform this implementation without any extra functional evaluation. We show the efficacy of this new implementation on some standard problems found in the literature. (C) 2014 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).
