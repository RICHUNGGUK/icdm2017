They are extreme new, innumerous and mutational. Partial and fragmented network security knowledge is usually provided by traditional computer security systems, including IDS, anti-virus system, etc., and direct knowledge query of web search engines. However, they are unable to provide users with the comprehensive knowledge and rapid reaction solutions. Users are consequently hard to clarify the causes and consequences of network security problems. A Comprehensive Security Integrated (CSI) model with acquisition, storing, reusing and integration of network security knowledge for cloud computing is proposed to help understand and trace the suspicious network attack threats and origins. Also, several knowledge classes (frames) are constructed in the implementation for knowledge query and manipulation. The process of CSI model and how it provides the comprehensive knowledge for problem solving are then explained by demonstration cases. Moreover, the demonstration results indicate that the CSI model and the implementation are more efficient than traditional fragmented knowledge from web search.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive Security Integrated Model and Ontology within Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000327912200008"}
