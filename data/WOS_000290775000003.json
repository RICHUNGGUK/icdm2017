Making use of these approaches the \"minimal\" meta-theoretical principles which allow one to treat approximations in rough set theory are discussed and formulated in explicit way, in particular the conditions which can assure what can be rightly considered as lower and upper approximations of some approximable set. The hierarchy of approximation spaces generated in this way on a universe is then discussed.", "paper_title": "An Investigation About Rough Set Theory: Some Foundational and Mathematical Aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000290775000003"}
