Because of possible motion of patients during the CTA examination, precise elimination of non-contrasted tissues, including bones, calcifications, and soft tissue, is still very challenging for lower legs, that is, from knees to toes. We propose novel registration-based framework for detection and correction of the motion in lower legs, which typically occurs between and during CTA pre-contrast and post-contrast acquisitions. Within the framework, two registration cores are proposed as alternatives, and resulting CTA subtraction images are compared with Advanced Vessel Analysis considered one of the reference commercial tools among clinical applications for CTA of lower extremities. The CTA subtraction images of 55 patients examined for PAOD are evaluated visually by four expert observers on the Philips Extended Brilliance Workspace using four criteria assessing the overall robustness of tested methods. According to the complex evaluation, the proposed framework enabled valuable improvements of CTA examination of lower legs.", "paper_title": "Novel registration-based framework for CT angiography in lower legs", "paper_id": "WOS:000323519800002"}
