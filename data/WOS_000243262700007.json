Decomposing the overall performance-management problem into smaller subproblems that individual controllers solve cooperatively allows for the scalable control of large computing systems. The control framework also adapts to controller failures and allows for the dynamic addition and removal of controllers during system operation. This article presents a case study showing how to manage the dynamic power consumed by a computer cluster processing a time-varying Web workload.", "paper_title": "Distributed cooperative control for adaptive performance management", "paper_id": "WOS:000243262700007"}
