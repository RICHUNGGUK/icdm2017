The problem is nontrivial and takes, in general, an exponential amount of time to solve. Hence, this paper focusses on a simple version of Systems of Simple Sequential Processes with Resources ((SPR)-P-3), called kth-order system, where each resource place holds one token to be shared between two processes. The exact number of reachable (forbidden, live and deadlock) states can be computed recursively.", "paper_title": "Recursive solution of number of reachable states of a simple subclass of FMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000335668300029"}
