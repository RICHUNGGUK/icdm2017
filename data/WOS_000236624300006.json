We focus on regular path queries, which are the integral part of most of the query languages for semistructured databases. To enable approximations, we allow the regular path queries to be distorted. The distortions are expressed in the system by using weighted regular expressions, which correspond to weighted regular transducers. After defining the notion of weighted approximate answers we show how to compute them in order of their proximity to the query. In the new approximate setting, query containment has to be redefined in order to take into account the quantitative proximity information in the query answers. For this, we define the approximate containment, and its variants k-containment and reliable contain-ment. Then, we give an optimal algorithm for deciding the k-containment. Regarding the reliable approximate containment, we show that it is polynomial time equivalent to the notorious limitedness problem in distance automata.", "paper_title": "Regular path queries under approximate semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000236624300006"}
