In this paper, we propose a novel data transmission scheme between a number of specified source nodes and the single sink, which can efficiently restrict the usage frequency of each relay node, measured by the number of source nodes using it for data transmission. On the basis of the importance of source nodes that is closely related to deployed location, they form a descending sequence such that each node finds the minimum energy path earlier than the succeeding one. Then, the energy-efficient multiple path algorithm with the computational complexity of O(n(3)) is developed for deriving the minimum energy paths, where n is the number of nodes in the network. Also, a polynomial algorithm is presented for deriving the range of the feasible values of N-0 serving as the threshold of the usage frequency of relay nodes, in which each can guarantee the existence of the solution. Further, we theoretically investigate the existence of the solution and the tree-structured solution using m-ary tree. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve significant performance enhancement.
