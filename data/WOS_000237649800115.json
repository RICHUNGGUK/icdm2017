Relationship of jobs, risk items and human resources have been used successfully for schedule and project progress. There are many defects that cause the schedule and progress management problems during software development. This paper designs the opportunity tree framework that remove and manage the schedule and quality problems as well. For the similar projects, we can estimate defects and prepare to solve them by using domain expert knowledge and the opportunity tree framework, which can greatly improve the software process.", "paper_title": "Design opportunity tree for schedule management and evaluation by COQUALMO", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800115"}
