It is proved that the set of functions that are generated by the SOPNN with its activation function in L-loc(p)(R) is dense in L-p(K) for any compact set K subset of R-N, if and only if the activation function is not a polynomial almost everywhere. It is also shown that if the activation function of the SPSNN is in L-loc(infinity)(R), then the functions generated by the SPSNN are dense in L-p(K) if and only if the activation function is not a constant (a.e.).", "paper_title": "L-p approximation capabilities of sum-of-product and sigma-pi-sigma neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252398100007"}
