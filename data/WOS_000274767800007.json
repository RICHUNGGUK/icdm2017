Such exploit program often sends attack packets in the first few packets. A Lightweight Network intrusion Detection system (LNID) is proposed for detecting such attacks on Telnet traffic. It characterizes normal traffic behavior and computes the anomaly score of a packet based on the deviation from the normal behavior. Instead of processing all traffic packets, an efficient filtering scheme proposed in the study can reduce system workload and only 0.3% of the original traffic volume is examined for anomaly. According to the performance comparisons with other network-based IDS, LNID is the most efficient on detection rate and workload reduction, (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
