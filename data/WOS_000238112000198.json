But it is difficult to realize online processing for data stream. In this paper, a new adaptive LDA method is proposed. We decompose the online LDA problem into two adaptive PCA problems and develop a fixed point adaptive PCA to implement adaptive LDA. Online updating of in-class scatter matrix S-w (t) and covariance matrix C-x (t) are derived in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed method has no learning rate, fast convergence and less time-consuming.", "paper_title": "An incremental linear discriminant analysis using fixed point method", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000198"}
