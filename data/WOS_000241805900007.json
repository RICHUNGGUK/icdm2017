The method exploits the recent development of five degrees-of-freedom miniaturized catheter tip electromagnetic trackers such that the position and orientation of the bronchoscope can be accurately determined. This allows the effective recovery of unknown camera rotation and airway deformation, which is modelled by an active shape model (ASM). ASM captures the intrinsic variability of the tracheo-bronchial tree during breathing and it is specific to the class of motion it represents. The method reduces the number of parameters that control the deformation, and thus greatly simplifies the optimisation procedure. Subsequently, pq-based registration is performed to recover both the camera pose and parameters of the ASM. Detailed assessment of the algorithm is performed on a deformable airway phantom, with the ground truth data being provided by an additional six degrees-of-freedom electromagnetic (EM) tracker to monitor the level of simulated respiratory motion.", "paper_title": "Nonrigid 2-D/3-D registration for patient specific bronchoscopy simulation with statistical shape modeling: Phantom validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805900007"}
