This model can well describe practical architectures of more realistic neural networks. Some novel yet generic criteria for global exponential stability of such neural networks are derived by establishing an extended Halanay differential inequality on impulsive delayed dynamical systems. The distinctive feature of this work is to address exponential stability issues without a priori stability assumption for the corresponding delayed neural networks without impulses. It is shown that the impulses in neuronal connectivity play an important role in inducing global exponential stability of recurrent delayed neural networks even if it may be unstable or chaotic itself. Furthermore, example and simulation are given to illustrate the practical nature of the novel results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
