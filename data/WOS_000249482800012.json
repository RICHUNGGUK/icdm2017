The facial expressions of 26 neonates (age 18-72h) were photographed experiencing the acute pain of a heel lance and three nonpain stressors. Four algorithms were evaluated on out-of-sample observations: PCA, LDA, SVMs and NNSOA. NNSOA provided the best classification rate of pain versus nonpain (90.20%), followed by SVM with linear kernel (82.35%). We believe these results indicate a high potential for developing a decision support system for diagnosing neonatal pain from images of neonatal facial displays. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
