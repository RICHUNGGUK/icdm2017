However, the regularity of these structural and functional brain networks across multiple neuroimaging modalities and also across different individuals is largely unknown. This paper presents a novel approach to inferring group-wise consistent brain subnetworks from multimodal DTI/resting-state fMRI datasets via multi-view spectral clustering of cortical networks, which were constructed upon our recently developed and validated large-scale cortical landmarks-DIC-CCOL (dense individualized and common connectivity-based cortical landmarks). We applied the algorithms on DTI data of 100 healthy young females and 50 healthy young males, obtained consistent multimodal brain networks within and across multiple groups, and further examined the functional roles of these networks. Our experimental results demonstrated that the derived brain networks have substantially improved inter-modality and inter-subject consistency.", "paper_title": "Inferring Group-Wise Consistent Multimodal Brain Networks via Multi-View Spectral Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000324251000002"}
