The four decision variables of keywords, author's nationality, research category, and year of publication, are implemented for data mining with total of 110,080 data items. The research findings show that some specific ANNs methodologies and applications pattern can be extracted from the mining results, and these describe the ANNs development over this period. In addition, using more data mining approaches for analysis could provide different explanations for ANNs development. Finally, discussion and brief conclusion are presented. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
