This study presents a novel cloud approach that, focusing on China's special construction requirements, proposes a series of as-built BIM (building information modeling) tools and a self-organised application model that correlates project engineering data and project management data through a seamless BIM and BSNS (business social networking services) federation. To achieve a logically centralised single-source data structure, a unified data model is constructed that integrates two categories of heterogeneous databases through the adoption of handlers. Based on these models, key technical mechanisms that are critical to the successful management of large amounts of data are proposed and implemented, including permission, data manipulation and file version control. Specifically, a dynamic Generalised List series is proposed to address the sophisticated construction file versioning issue. The proposed cloud has been successfully used in real applications in China. This research work can enable data sharing not only by individuals and project teams but also by enterprises in a consistent and sustainable way throughout the life of a construction project. This system will reduce costs for construction firms by providing effective and efficient means and guides to complex project management, and by facilitating the conversion of project data into enterprise-owned properties.
