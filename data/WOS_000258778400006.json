Hence, a choice needs to be made to determine which services are to participate in a given composite service. In general, multi-QoS constrained Web Services composition, with or without optimization, is a NP-complete problem on computational complexity that cannot be exactly solved in polynomial time. A lot of heuristics and approximation algorithms with polynomial- and pseudo-polynomial-time complexities have been designed to deal with this problem. However, these approaches suffer from excessive computational complexities that cannot be used for service composition in runtime. In this paper, we propose a efficient approach for multi-QoS constrained Web Services selection. Firstly, a user preference model was proposed to collect the user's preference. And then, a correlation model of candidate services are established in order to reduce the search space. Based on these two model, a heuristic algorithm is then proposed to find a feasible solution for multi-QoS constrained Web Services selection with high performance and high precision. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve the expecting goal.", "paper_title": "Efficient approach for Web services selection with multi-QoS constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000258778400006"}
