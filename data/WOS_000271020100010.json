The proposed energy-efficient LCFFs reduce the power consumption of clock networks with dual-edge triggering, support sleep mode of power management mechanisms with data retention, and have symmetry in setup times and insensitivity to output parasitics. With all these features, the proposed LCFFs have 19% and 38% lower power-delay product than the conventional LCFF, as demonstrated by postlayout simulation results.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Dual-Edge-Triggered Level Converting Flip Flops With Symmetry in Setup Times and Insensitivity to Output Parasitics", "paper_id": "WOS:000271020100010"}
