First, the basic asynchronous switched Boolean network model is provided. With the method of semi-tensor product, the Boolean dynamics is translated into linear representation. Second, necessary and sufficient conditions for ASBN synchronization with free Boolean sequence control and close-loop control are derived, respectively. Third, some illustrative examples are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of Asynchronous Switched Boolean Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000368292400024"}
