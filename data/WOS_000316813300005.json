In this paper, we propose a queue resource allocation strategy for traffic dynamics in scale-free networks. With a finite resource of queue, the allocation of queue length on node i is based on B-i, where B-i is the generalized betweenness centrality of node i. The overall traffic capacity of a network system can be evaluated by the critical packet generating rate (R-c). Through the use of the proposed queue allocation scheme for the shortest path protocol and efficient routing protocol, our strategy performs better than the uniform queue length allocation strategy, which is demonstrated by a larger value of the critical generating rate. We also give a method to estimate the network traffic capacity theoretically.", "paper_title": "QUEUE RESOURCE REALLOCATION STRATEGY FOR TRAFFIC SYSTEMS IN SCALE-FREE NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000316813300005"}
