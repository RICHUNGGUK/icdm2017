The main purpose of this issue is to distribute the nodes efficiently with high-quality coverage and low cost. However, in most research, studies of random deployment and achieving full coverage are conducted based on the assumption that ideal open space exists in which there are no boundaries or obstacles. This assumption makes the research results difficult to practice. In this work, we considered general indoor scenes in order to develop and propose an obstacle-resistant full-coverage deployment (ORFCD) algorithm based on two-dimensional space considering the boundaries and the typical model of the obstacles, i.e., rectangular obstacles. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deployment algorithm.", "paper_title": "Research to Achieve Full-Coverage in the Complex Environment of Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322851600013"}
