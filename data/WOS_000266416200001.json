We bring together the fields of combinatorial enumeration, where efficient algorithms have been designed for (special cases of) some of these combinatorial objects, and constraint programming, where the requisite symmetry breaking has at best been done statically so far. We design the first search procedure and identify the first symmetry-breaking constraints for the general case of unlabelled necklaces. Further, we compare dynamic and static symmetry breaking on real-life scheduling problems featuring (unlabelled) necklaces. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
