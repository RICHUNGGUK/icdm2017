Actually, information systems (IS) are said to be cooperative if they share common goals in their environment and jointly contribute to achieve these common goals. Obviously, this presupposes the ability to exchange information and then to use it in accordance with each information system required. In the literature, these features refer to interoperability. In this context, one of the main issues concerns the evaluation of the lack of interoperability between Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) through the measurement of their semantic gaps. In order to achieve this purpose, this paper proposes a mathematical formalisation of the semantic relationships between CIS conceptual models. The resulting formal model is then analysed for evaluating the lack of interoperability implications to the global information systems shared goals. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study dealing with a B2M (Business to Manufacturing) interoperability requirement between an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) application.
