Multifirm studies have largely been dyadic and emphasize transaction costs over cocreation of value. Contemporary environments involve IT investments being made by multiple companies in cooperative, platform-based, and relational arrangements where the objective is to cocreate value. If IT serves as a tool, an output. or is instrumental in generating this cocreated value, then it falls within the cocreation domain of this special issue. In this introductory article, we frame the discussion of cocreating IT value through four layers of relational arrangement between firms, describe the papers in the special issue with respect to this framework, and briefly describe an agenda for research in this important area.", "paper_title": "COCREATING IT VALUE: NEW CAPABILITIES AND METRICS FOR MULTIFIRM ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300480200014"}
