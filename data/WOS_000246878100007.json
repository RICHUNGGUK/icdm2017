Particular features of both the cutting process, and of the material to be cut, bring in a set of unusual constraints, when compared with other cutting processes, which confer additional complexity and originality to the problem. In particular, this is a matter of practical and economic relevance, since the solution methods are intended to be implemented in a real-life industrial environment. The concept of dynamic graph is exploited to deal with the arc routing problem under study, which is modelled as a dynamic rural postman problem. The constructive heuristics developed, the \"higher up vertex heuristic\" (HUV) and the \"minimum empty path heuristic\" (MEP) are tested with real data sets. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
