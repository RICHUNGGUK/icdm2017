It uses a switched-capacitor (SC) array to transfer the sampled charges directly into the headphone driver. The overall DAC gain is precisely controlled by a novel reference stage. A new dynamic element matching algorithm, based on split-set data-weighted averaging (SDWA), is used to improve the dynamic range and to reduce the nonlinearity caused by mismatches in the multibit DAC.", "paper_title": "A 100-dB gain-corrected delta-sigma audio DAC with headphone driver", "paper_id": "WOS:000246764800004"}
