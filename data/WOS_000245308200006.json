Therefore, it can be applied to some particular situations in electronic commerce. In this paper, we formally define the security model for the non-interactive ID-based deniable authentication protocol and present a new efficient ID-based deniable authentication protocol based on RSA assumption. What's more, we also use the techniques from provable security to analyze the security of our proposed protocol.", "paper_title": "A new ID-based deniable authentication protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000245308200006"}
