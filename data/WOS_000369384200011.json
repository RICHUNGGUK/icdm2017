Discrete cosine transform (DCT) is the most popular tool used in watermarking algorithm. But the watermarking algorithm based on DCT is not the most ideal choice in terms of the complexity and robustness. All phase discrete cosine biorthogonal transform (APDCBT) owns the characteristics of high frequency attenuation and good applications in image coding, image denoising and other fields of digital image processing, which provides an efficient method for watermarking. In this paper, a new watermarking algorithm based on APDCBT is proposed. Besides, the binary image watermark is scrambled by Arnold transform to enhance its privacy and robustness greatly in our algorithm. The watermark information is embedded in direct-current (DC) components considering DC components have much larger perceptual capacity. Compared with the DCT algorithm, the proposed algorithm has stronger robustness in embedding and extracting the watermark. Experimental results show that our algorithm can satisfy the imperceptibility and robustness very well. Furthermore, our algorithm is tested against four kinds of attacks: JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, salt & pepper noise and rotation.", "paper_title": "Embedding Binary Image Watermark in DC Components of All Phase Discrete Cosine Biorthogonal Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000369384200011"}
