The nucleation and mobility model for the Ag-n (n = 1-8) clusters on the perfect and oxygen vacancy MgO(100) surfaces was investigated. The results show that the Ag atoms locate initially at the surface oxygen vacancy sites; then, with the growth of Ag cluster sizes, the large Ag clusters move possibly out of the vacancy sites by a rolling model, and diffuse on the MgO surface under a certain temperature condition. The relative energies needed for moving out of the oxygen vacancy region for the adsorbed Ag-n clusters with the rolling model have been predicted. The even-odd oscillation behaviors for the cohesive energies, nucleation energies, first ionization potentials and HOMO-LUMO gaps of the adsorbed Ag-n clusters with the variation of cluster sizes have also been discussed.", "paper_title": "Nucleation and mobility model of Ag-n clusters adsorbed on perfect and oxygen vacancy MgO surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000290577000016"}
