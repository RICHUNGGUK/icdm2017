We took a conservative approach and mechanised the original LATEX sources, without changing their technical content, except to correct errors: we found problems in the original texts and missing invariants in the refinements. Based on these experiences, we present novel and detailed guidance on how to drive Z/Eves successfully. The work contributes to the research objectives of building the Repository for the Verified Software Grand Challenge.", "paper_title": "Z/eyes and the Mondex Electronic Purse", "paper_id": "WOS:000243130900002"}
