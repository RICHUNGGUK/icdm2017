We propose a new cross-layer solution to enhance overlay/ISP interactions by providing a comprehensive, media aware, open, and standardized interface between ISPs and application overlays. We further discuss how cooperation between the layers will be improved and describe an example use case to demonstrate the benefit of such interworking.
