The efficiency of the trust evaluation process is largely governed by the trust derivation, as it dominates the overhead in the process, and performance of WSNs is particularly sensitive to overhead due to the limited bandwidth and power. This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process. We show with the help of simulations that our trust derivation scheme can achieve both intended security and high efficiency suitable for WSN-based IoT networks.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Aware Trust Derivation Scheme With Game Theoretic Approach in Wireless Sensor Networks for IoT Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000209672000007"}
