They include reviews of Artificial life machines; Poker-playing \"bots\"; Advanced systems to harness a human's electrical field; \"smart beer mat\"; computer vision surveillance system; robotic systems for gastric surgery; future combat systems. Design/methodology/approach - General review and survey of selected research and development topics. Findings - Illustrates the multi-and trans-disciplinary nature of cybernetics and systems. Aims to further research and development activity. Practical implications - The choice of reviews provides an awareness of the current trends in these areas of endeavour but are necessarily selective. Orginality/value - The reviews are selected from a global database and give a studied assessment of current research and development initiatives.", "paper_title": "Contemporary systems and cybernetics - Innovative applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236842300016"}
