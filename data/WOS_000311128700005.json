The aim of capacity design is the formation of plastic hinges without shear failure of the elements. This is achieved by deriving the design shear forces from equilibrium conditions, assuming that plastic hinges, with their possible over-strengths, have been formed in the adjacent joints of the elements. In this equilibrium situation, the parameters (dimensions, material properties, axial forces etc) are random variables. Therefore, the capacity design of shear forces is associated with a probability of non-compliance (probability of failure). In the present study the probability of non-compliance of the shear capacity design in columns is calculated by assuming the basic variables as random variables. Parameters affecting this probability are examined and a modification of the capacity design is proposed, in order to achieve uniformity of the safety level.", "paper_title": "Reliability of column capacity design in shear", "paper_id": "WOS:000311128700005"}
