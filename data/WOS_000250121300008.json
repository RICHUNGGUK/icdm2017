Using an established pencil-and-paper-based method for the assessment of VSN (the Rivermead Behavioural Inattention Test) as a reference, a battery of computer-based hand-drawing tests is developed and shown to be effective in distinguishing between stroke subjects with and without neglect. The novel approach adopts measurements both of the outcome and the process by which the drawing tasks are executed. This approach provides a novel diagnostic capability which results in increased test sensitivity, a more objective assessment and a reduction in overall evaluation time. The paper describes the development of a binary assessment system using the computer-based acquisition and analysis of task data alongside feature selection techniques to maximise performance.", "paper_title": "Feature-based assessment of visuo-spatial neglect patients using hand-drawing tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250121300008"}
