In non-deterministic domains, this number is often the most critical factor in analyzing the solution. However, as this paper reviews, a robust calculus for this number has yet to be documented. Thus reliance on it alone poses a risk to users of commercial systems. This paper demonstrates how supplemental statistics can be calculated and used to decrease this risk. We hope these ideas will lead to better commercial expert systems and better user decision. making.", "paper_title": "MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY IN RULE-BASED SYSTEMS: ONE IS NOT ENOUGH", "paper_id": "WOS:000261042400009"}
