We derive the analytical integral-form expression of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the received signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio (SINR) at the destination node, based on which the closed-form of the outage probability is obtained. Analysis shows that the proposed relay selection scheme achieves the best SINR at the destination node with interference to the primary user being limited by a pre-defined level. Simulation results are also presented to verify the analysis. The proposed relay selection approach is an attractive way to obtain diversity gain in a multi-cell cognitive network.", "paper_title": "Study of Relay Selection in a Multi-Cell Cognitive Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696800018"}
