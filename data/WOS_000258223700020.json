The local transformations can be taken from a variety of families, e.g. similarities or rotations, generating different types of parameterizations. In the first case, the parameterization tries to force each 2D triangle to be an as-similar-as-possible version of its 3D counterpart. This is shown to yield results identical to those of the LSCM algorithm. In the second case, the parameterization tries to force each 2D triangle to be an as-rigid-as-possible version of its 3D counterpart. This approach preserves shape as much as possible. It is simple, effective, and fast, due to pre-factoring of the linear system involved in the global phase. Experimental results show that our approach provides almost isometric parameterizations and obtains more shape-preserving results than other state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "A local/global approach to mesh parameterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000258223700020"}
