The nonlinear friction is depicted by a nonlinear friction model, and a switched nonlinear system is used to model the parameter jump caused by load change. Hyperstability theory is used in the designing procedure, which provides more options for adaptive laws than Lyapunov theory. In the presence of friction and changing loads, asymptotic tracking is achieved under arbitrary switching, which is not able to accomplish by a non-switched adaptive controller. The proposed method is validated by a simulation of a 2 degree of freedom manipulator.", "paper_title": "Switched adaptive tracking control of robot manipulators with friction and changing loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000346067800001"}
