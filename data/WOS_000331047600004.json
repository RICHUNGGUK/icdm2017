Specifically, given the tolerances of pre-fabricated members, the uncertainty in the position of nodes is calculated in terms of variances and covariances. Twoconstituent elements of planar trusses (i.e. two-bar unit cell and redundant member) are formulated based on linear models of kinematics and deformation mechanics. Subsequently, these models are combined together in a single algorithm to construct a suitable procedure for estimation of uncertainty zone of each node. Accuracy of the developed method is verified by comparing its results with outcomes of Monte Carlo simulations. Also, appropriate numerical examples are presented to investigate important characteristics of error propagation in planar truss structures and obtain configurations with minimum shape deviation.", "paper_title": "An algorithm for geometrical uncertainty analysis in planar truss structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000331047600004"}
