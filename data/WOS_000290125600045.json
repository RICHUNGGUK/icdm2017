In this Letter, we study the periodogram and weighted phase averager, which are standard solutions in the uniform sampling scenarios, for tackling the problem. It is shown that the estimation performance of both approaches can attain the optimum benchmark of the Cramer-Rao lower bound, although the former technique has a smaller threshold signal-to-noise ratio.", "paper_title": "On Optimum Single-Tone Frequency Estimation Using Non-uniform Samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600045"}
