In this paper, we adopt a simple but effective approach for simulating this behavior on glass panes in a physically plausible manner. We combine a particle system and a height map to compute their movements and shapes. Our approach efficiently handles the merging of water drops and the formation of residual water droplets. We report our results for several examples of water behavior simulated in real time. The experimental results show that our system simulates water drops and water flows with high quality.
