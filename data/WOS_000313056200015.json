The used techniques yield upper bounds if the (generalized) Weierstrass semigroup (J Pure Appl Algebra 207(2), 243-260, 2006) for an n-tuple of places is known, even if the exact defining equation of the curve is not known. As shown in examples, this sometimes enables one to get an upper bound for the number of rational places for families of function fields. Our results extend results in (J Pure Appl Algebra 213(6), 1152-1156, 2009).", "paper_title": "Bounding the number of points on a curve using a generalization of Weierstrass semigroups", "paper_id": "WOS:000313056200015"}
