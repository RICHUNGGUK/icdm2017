The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of such asymmetric carriage on postures and gait symmetry in ground reaction force (GRF) during walking. Kinematics and GRF of 19 adults were recorded while they walked under five load conditions: no load, dumbbell (10 and 20% body weight) held in right and left hand, respectively. After loading, the trunk bent towards the loaded or unloaded side in right- and left-hand trials and under different load weight conditions. The amplitude of trunk bend increased with load, accompanied by decreased stride width, progressively inclined legs towards unloaded side and higher level of asymmetry in medial/lateral GRF (GRFm/l) and free vertical moment GRF (GRFm). The findings indicate the postural adjustment is likely related to the characteristics of load and the task experience and handedness of subject and the unilateral load increases the gait asymmetry in GRFm/l and GRFm.", "paper_title": "Effect of unilateral load carriage on postures and gait symmetry in ground reaction force during walking", "paper_id": "WOS:000278314600005"}
