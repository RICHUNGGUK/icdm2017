Common experience is that such preclinical tests require the sacrifice of a relatively large number of animals, and are particularly time-and money-consuming. Results: As a first step to overcome these hurdles, we have developed an ordinary differential equation model that includes all relevant entities (such as activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and memory T cells), and investigated the induction of immunological memory in the context of wild-type mice injected with a dendritic cell-based vaccine. We have simulated the biological behavior both in the presence and in the absence of memory T cells. Comparing results of ex vivo and in silico experiments, we show that the model is able to envisage the expansion and persistence of antigen-specific memory T cells. The model might be applicable to more complex vaccination schedules and substantially in any biological condition of prime-boosting. Availability and implementation: The model is fully described in the article.", "paper_title": "Induction of T-cell memory by a dendritic cell vaccine: a computational model", "paper_id": "WOS:000339121900013"}
