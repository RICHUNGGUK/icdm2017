Cast shadow detection is critical for accurate object detection in video streams, and their misclassification can cause errors in segmentation and tracking. Many algorithms for shadow detection have been proposed in the literature; however a complete, comparative evaluation of existing approaches is lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of shadow detection methods, organised in a novel taxonomy based on object/environment dependency and implementation domain. In addition a comparative evaluation of representative algorithms, based on quantitative and qualitative metrics is presented to evaluate the algorithms on a benchmark suite of indoor and outdoor video sequences.
