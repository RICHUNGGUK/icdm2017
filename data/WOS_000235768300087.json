A timing vector is composed of the keystroke duration times interleaved with the keystroke interval times. Which times or features to use in a classifier is a classic feature selection problem. Genetic algorithm based wrapper approach does not only solve the problem, but also provides a population of \"fit\" classifiers which can be used in ensemble. In this paper, we propose to add uniqueness term in the fitness function of genetic algorithm. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed approach performed better than two phase ensemble selection approach and prediction based diversity term approach.", "paper_title": "GA SVM wrapper ensemble for keystroke dynamics authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300087"}
