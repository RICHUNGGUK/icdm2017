We derive kernel forms of several well-known class separability criteria, and gene subset selection based on the kernelized criteria is applied to microarray cancer classification problems. The performance of our proposed strategy is compared in experiments with those of the conventional filter approach as well as gene ranking methods. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
