While depth sensors of sophisticated scanners allow precise spatial data processing, it is possible to use a multi-camera system for direct data acquisition and recognition of selected objects as well. The main goal of this paper is the analysis of three-dimensional objects to enable numerical evaluation of measurements important for proposals of the appropriate treatment after dental operations. Methods presented include (1) computer analysis of a single de-noised and thresholded image used for detection of its components and (2) presentation of tools for three-dimensional modeling using a double camera system. The proposed algorithms allow semi-automatic evaluation of measurements between selected objects. The resulting general algorithm can be used both in biomedical applications and engineering to detect measurements in static image frames or videosequences.", "paper_title": "Multi-camera systems use for dental arch shape measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000362680600006"}
