The goal is to provide optical networks with intelligent networking functions and capabilities in its control plane to enable rapid optical connection provisioning, multiplexing, and switching at different granularity levels, especially wavelength and time slot. In this paper, we propose a new Distributed Advance Reservation System for Interconnected Optical networks (DARSION). DARSION supports advance resource reservation across multiple domains. The user specifies the service he/she requires, the start time of the reservation, and the duration of the reservation. DARSION provides the user with the resources that can be reserved at the start time and other times in the future carefully selected. This is in opposition to existing approaches that respond with either an acceptation or a rejection of the request. We performed simulations to evaluate the proposed system. The simulations results show lower user request blocking probability when using the proposed system. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
