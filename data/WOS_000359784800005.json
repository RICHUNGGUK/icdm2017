Many efforts have been made to facilitate the process of HTH detection, mostly based on the power analysis of chips. The techniques would be more beneficial if trust-driven techniques are used during the system design. Whereas design for hardware trust (DFHT) is one of the fields of interest, most current approaches include ad-hoc and gate-level design techniques. This paper discusses the advantage of physical-level design approaches with integrated strategies for improving the HTH-detection probability. As a proof of concept, a placement technique is presented with the goal of enhancing the ability of HTH detection techniques based on local power signal analysis. Our results show that the background effects on power pads can be leveraged by a simple partitioning-based placement algorithm. Minimizing the background effects leads to a better Trojan-to-background-effect ratio and more (by about 1.7 times) Trojan detectability.", "paper_title": "A Trust-Driven Placement Approach: A New Perspective on Design for Hardware Trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000359784800005"}
