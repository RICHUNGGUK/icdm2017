The proposed method is based on the burst dimming method that controls the duty ratio for the two switches of the electronic ballast by intermittently modulated pulse signal. This paper presents a fully digital circuit using an erasable programmable logic device (EPLD). To verify the validity of the proposed method, the implemented control circuit was applied to the electronic ballast for a 100 W electrudeless fluorescent lamp. As a result, a dimming method with a wide illumination range from 5 to 100% was obtained.", "paper_title": "A new dimming algorithm for the electrodeless fluorescent lamps", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500004"}
