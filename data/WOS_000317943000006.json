However, the behaviour of the diaphragm wall due to the installation of the cross walls is still unclear. This study performed a series of 3D numerical studies of wall deflections for deep excavations with cross walls and studied the effects on the wall deflection of several parameters, including the number of cross walls, the distance to the cross wall, the cross wall interval, the cross wall height and the cross wall embedment. The results presented in this study can be used as a first approximation for cases in which cross walls are designed to reduce the wall deflection induced by deep excavation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
