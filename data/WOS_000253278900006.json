By the proposed method, powerful radial basis function (RBF) networks can be produced based on a genetic algorithm (GA), which is applied for auto-configuring the structure of the networks and obtaining the optimal network. parameters. The Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is used to evaluate the fitness of individual networks. Therefore, the genetic algorithm-radial basis function (GA-RBF) networks have a better generalization performance and simpler network structure. Four different GA-RBF network models based on pretreated spectra (multiplicative scatter correction MSC, standard normal variate SNV, first-derivative and second-derivative spectra) have been established and compared. The obtained GA-RBF networks can give robust and satisfactory prediction and the optimal GARBF networks after the SNV treatment is found to provide the best results. It is demonstrated that the proposed GA-RBF method based on NIR spectral data is a valuable toot for quantitative analysis. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
