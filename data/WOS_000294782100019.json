A recent line of research suggests that pairs of proteins with functional and physical interactions co-evolve with each other. Here, by analyzing hundreds of orthologous sets of three fungi and their co-evolutionary relations, we demonstrate that co-evolutionary assumption may violate the Markov assumption. Our results encourage developing alternative probabilistic models for the cases of extreme co-evolution.", "paper_title": "Co-evolution Is Incompatible with the Markov Assumption in Phylogenetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000294782100019"}
