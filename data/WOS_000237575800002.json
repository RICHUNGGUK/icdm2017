We consider fitting a polyline with k joints under the min-sum criteria with respect to L-1- and L-2-metrics, which are more appropriate measures than uniform and Hausdorff metrics in statistical context. We present efficient algorithms for the 1-joint versions of the problem and fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for the general k-joint versions.", "paper_title": "Polyline fitting of planar points under min-sum criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000237575800002"}
