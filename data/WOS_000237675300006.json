In this article, we investigate the relations among inclusion measures, similarity measures, and the fuzziness of fuzzy sets, prove eight theorems that inclusion measures, similarity measures, and the fuzziness of fuzzy sets can be transformed by each other based on their axiomatic definitions, and propose some new formulas to calculate inclusion measures, similarity measures, and the fuzziness of fuzzy sets. These results can be applied in many fields, such as pattern recognition, image processing, fuzzy neural networks, fuzzy reasoning, and fuzzy control.
