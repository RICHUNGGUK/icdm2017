To realistically represent the turbulent partially premixed nature in the flow region between nozzle exit and flame base, the level-set approach coupled with the conserved scalar flamelet model has been applied. The unstructured-grid level-set approach has been developed to allow the geometric flexibility and computational efficiency for the solution of the physically and geometrically complex reacting flows. The pressure-velocity coupling is handled by the multiple pressure-correction method. The predicted flame pattern is in good conformity with the Measured one. In terms of the liftoff height. the agreement between prediction and experiment IS quite good. Even if there are noticeable deviations in a certain region, the predicted profiles for the overall flame structure agree reasonably well with the experimental data. These numerical results indicate that the present levels set-based flamelet approach in conjunction with the unstructured-grid finite-volume method is capable of realistically predicting the essential features and precise structure of the turbulent-lifted jet flame with computational efficiency.
