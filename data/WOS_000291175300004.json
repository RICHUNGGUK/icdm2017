In addition, the evolution of technology toward higher spectral efficiency has led to the introduction of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) by 3GPP for use in future long-term evolution (LTE) systems. However, given the current penetration of legacy technologies such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), operators will face some periods in which both Radio Access Technologies (RATs) coexist. In this context, Joint Radio Resource Management (JRRM) mechanisms are helpful because they enable complementarities between different RATs to be exploited and thus facilitate more efficient use of available radio resources. This paper proposes a novel dynamic JRRM algorithm for LTE-UMTS coexistence scenarios based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which is considered to be a good candidate for achieving the desired degree of flexibility and adaptability in future reconfigurable networks. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in dynamic environments under different load conditions and is compared with various baseline solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
