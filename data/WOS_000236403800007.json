Design/methodology/approach - The start point is the local energy balance of the ferromagnetic material. Dissipation is represented by a friction-like force, which derives from a non-differentiable convex functional. Several elementary hysteresis cells can be combined, in order to increase the number of free parameters in the model, and therefore improve the accuracy. Findings - A friction-like force is a good way to represent magnetic dissipation at the macroscopic level. The proposed method is easy to implement and non-differentiability amounts in this case to a simple \"if' statement. Research limitations/implications - The next steps are the extension to dynamic hysteresis and the in-depth analysis of the identification process, which is only sketched in this paper. Practical implications - This vector model, which is based on a reasonable phenomenological description of local magnetic dissipation, enables the numerical analysis of rotational hysteresis losses on a sound theoretical basis. Originality/value - It proposes a simple, general purpose macroscopic model of hysteresis that is intrinsically a vector one, and not the vectorization. of a scalar model.", "paper_title": "An energy-based vector hysteresis model for ferromagnetic materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000236403800007"}
