In 2004, Khot-Kindler-Mossel-O'Donnell showed UG-hardness of (1 - epsilon, delta)-approximating Max-2Lin(Z(q)) for q = q(epsilon, delta) a sufficiently large constant; however, achieving the same hardness for Max-2Lin(Z) was given as an open problem in Raghavendra's 2009 thesis. In this work, we show that fairly simple modifications to the proofs of the Max-3Lin(Z(q)) and Max-2Lin(Z(q)) results yield optimal hardness results over Z. In fact, we show a kind of \"bicriteria\" hardness: Even when there is a (1 - epsilon)-good solution over Z, it is hard for an algorithm to find a d-good solution over Z, R, or Z(m) for any m >= q(epsilon, delta) of the algorithm's choosing.", "paper_title": "Hardness of Max-2Lin and Max-3Lin over Integers, Reals, and Large Cyclic Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000361245000005"}
