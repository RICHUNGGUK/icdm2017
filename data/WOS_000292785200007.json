Firstly, we have defined some fuzzy approximation relations on fuzzy n-cell number space, and studied their properties. Secondly, as application, we have developed an algorithmic version of classification in an imprecise or uncertain environment by using the fuzzy approximation relations. Practical examples are provided to show the application and rationality of the proposed techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
