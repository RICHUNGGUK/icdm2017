It builds on a proposition that past projects similar to the new one would suggest a reasonable range of craft quantities. This paper finds that when measuring the similarity between the new project and historical projects, traditional similarity measure methods fail to consider the nonlinearity and muticollinearity embedded in the problem, as well as differences across crafts. An innovative similarity measurement algorithm was therefore proposed to tackle the above issues with a carefully designed orthogonalization process and Sobol's total sensitivity analysis. The application of the proposed algorithm to the craft quantity takeoff of a power plant project was introduced, demonstrating a better result compared with traditional methods. It is likely that the proposed algorithm will advance current CBR practices in construction management.", "paper_title": "Improved Similarity Measure in Case-Based Reasoning with Global Sensitivity Analysis: An Example of Construction Quantity Estimating", "paper_id": "WOS:000344004300002"}
