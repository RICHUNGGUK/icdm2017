For a set K of integers at least two, recall that a pairwise balanced design is a linear space on v points whose lines (or blocks) have sizes belonging to K. We show that, for any prescribed set of sizes K and lower bound d on the dimension, there exists a of dimension at least d for all sufficiently large and numerically admissible v.", "paper_title": "Pairwise Balanced Designs with Prescribed Minimum Dimension", "paper_id": "WOS:000330972200011"}
