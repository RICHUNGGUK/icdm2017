Informally, this hypothesis poses the existence of a subexponential size hitting set computable by subexponential size uniform TC0 circuits against size n arithmetic circuits with multilinear output. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), we show that this hypothesis is sufficient for proving that either permanent does not have polynomial size (nonuniform) arithmetic circuits, or that the Boolean circuit class uniform TC is strictly contained in uniform NC2.
