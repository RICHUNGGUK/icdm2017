This causes great difficulties for novice users. In order to overcome this difficulty, a self-adaptive multi-objective harmony search (SAMOHS) algorithm based on harmony memory variance is proposed in this paper. In the SAMOHS algorithm, a modified self-adaptive bandwidth is employed, moreover, the self-adaptive parameter setting based on variation of harmony memory variance is proposed for harmony memory considering rate (HMCR) and pitch adjusting rate (PAR). To solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), the proposed SAMOHS uses non-dominated sorting and truncating procedure to update harmony memory (HM). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAMOHS, it is tested with many benchmark problems and applied to solve a practical engineering optimization problem. The experimental results show that the SAMOHS is competitive in convergence performance and diversity performance, compared with other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In the experiment, the impact of harmony memory size (HMS) on the performance of SAMOHS is also analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
