In this paper, we focus on estimating missing elements for an incomplete uncertain 2-tuple linguistic preference relation. First, the additive consistency of an uncertain 2-tuple linguistic preference relation is defined. Based on the defined additive consistency, we define acceptable incomplete uncertain 2-tuple linguistic preference relation and propose two new algorithms, including an iterative algorithm and an optimization-based algorithm to estimate the missing elements for an uncertain 2-tuple linguistic preference relation. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the two algorithms.", "paper_title": "Consistency-based algorithms to estimate missing elements for uncertain 2-tuple linguistic preference relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000343408700009"}
