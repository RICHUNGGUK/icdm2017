Often there is a need to assess clusters of a different form, such as around roads or river systems. These clusters are often linear or can be approximated by combinations of several linear segments. In this paper the recovery of point and line clusters is considered jointly. An example application is given where both linear or point clustering could be present. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
