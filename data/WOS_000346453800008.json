However, to extract useful information, the temporal dimension also has to be accounted for which increases the complexity of the problem. For this reason, there is a need for suitable data mining techniques for this source of data. In this work, we developed a data mining methodology to extract multidimensional sequential patterns to characterize temporal behaviors. We then used the extracted multidimensional sequences to build a classifier, and show how the patterns help to distinguish between the classes. We evaluated our technique using a real-world dataset containing information about land use in Mali (West Africa) to automatically recognize if an area is cultivated or not. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
