The Laplace transform of the distribution of the stationary buffer content is expressed through the minimal positive solution to a crucial equation, similar to the fundamental equation satisfied by the busy period of an M/G/1 queue. Furthermore, the distribution of the stationary buffer content is shown to be regularly varying with index -alpha + 1 if the distribution of the service times is regularly varying with index -alpha < -1. Meanwhile, the first [alpha]-2 moments of the stationary buffer content are given, where [x] is the ceiling function of the real number x. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
