In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for the HFS scheduling problem with minimum makespan objective. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a new approach hybridizing PSO with bottleneck heuristic to fully exploit the bottleneck stage, and with simulated annealing to help escape from local optima. The proposed PSO algorithm is tested on the benchmark problems provided by Carlier and Neron. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms all the compared algorithms in solving the HFS problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
