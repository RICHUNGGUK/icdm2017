The main drawback of such protocols is their inefficiency and unbounded delay when the system load is heavy. On the other hand, a contention-free MAC protocol, such as token passing, has a better and fair throughput when the system is heavy loaded. The main drawback of such protocols is their inefficiency when only a small amount of users want to transmit. In this paper, we propose a new load awareness single-hop wireless ad hoc MAC protocol (which is called the LA protocol) that exploits the benefits of both contention-based and contention-free protocols. A contention-based MAC protocol is used when the system is light loaded and a contention-free one is used otherwise. Our LA protocol, which operates in a distributed fashion and is fully compatible with the IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) standard, can switch smoothly between the contention-based protocol and the contention-free one. Simulation results show that our protocol indeed extracts the better part of two kinds of protocols.
