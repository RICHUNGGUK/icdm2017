Two variables, cell temperature and cell current density were employed as input variables, cell voltage value of DMFC acted as output variable. Using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) test on 21 samples, the maximum absolute percentage error (APE) yields 5.66%, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is only 0.93% and the correlation coefficient (R-2) as high as 0.995. Compared with the result of artificial neural network (ANN) approach, it is shown that the modeling ability of SVR surpasses that of ANN. These suggest that SVR prediction model can be a good predictor to estimate the cell voltage for DMFC system.", "paper_title": "SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION MODEL FOR DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELL", "paper_id": "WOS:000306971000008"}
