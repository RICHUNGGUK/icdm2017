Analogy based estimation (ABE), which is essentially a case based reasoning (CBR) approach, is one of the most popular techniques. In order to improve the performance of ABE, many previous studies proposed effective approaches to optimize the weights of the project features (feature weighting) in its similarity function. However, ABE is still criticized for the low prediction accuracy, the large memory requirement. and the expensive computation cost. To alleviate these drawbacks, in this paper we propose the project selection technique for ABE (PSABE) which reduces the whole project base into a small subset that consist only of representative projects. Moreover, PSABE is combined with the feature weighting to form FWPSABE for a further improvement of ABE. The proposed methods are validated on four datasets (two real-world sets and two artificial sets) and compared with conventional ABE, feature weighted ABE (FWABE), and machine learning methods. The promising results indicate that project selection technique could significantly improve analogy based models for software cost estimation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
