However, current Gabor models do not account for long-range contextual modulation. This paper introduces a new model which extends a state-of-the-art model of contextual modulation by incorporating long-range convolution at the scale of the visual field. The significance of this new mechanism is that it accounts for perceptual filling-in of occluded receptive fields with purely low-level vision processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
