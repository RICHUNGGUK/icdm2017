Conventional methods of analysis of fMRI data are generally based on time-domain correlation analysis concentrating mainly on the multiple epoch data and generally do not provide good results for single epoch data. The main focus of this study is the analysis of single epoch data, constrained by certain experiments such as pain response, sleep, administration of pharmacological agents, which can only have a single or very few stimulus cycles. Further, our method obviates the need to exclusively model the hemodynamic response function and correctly identifies the voxels with delayed activation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in detecting brain activation by using both synthetic and real fMRI data.", "paper_title": "Power spectral based detection of brain activation from fMR images", "paper_id": "WOS:000250198500007"}
