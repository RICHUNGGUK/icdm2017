The novelty of the proposed framework is in demonstrating that the architectural power intent properties developed using high-level artifacts can be automatically translated into properties over low-level control sequences gleaned from UPF specifications of power domains, and that the resulting properties can be used to formally verify the global on-chip power management logic. The proposed translation uses a considerable amount of domain knowledge and is also not purely syntactic, because it requires formal extraction of timing information for the low-level control sequences. We present a tool, called POWER-TRUCTOR which enables the proposed framework, and several test cases of significant complexity to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Formal Verification of Architectural Power Intent", "paper_id": "WOS:000312835000008"}
