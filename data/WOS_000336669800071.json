As its typical case, IoT-based smart rehabilitation systems are becoming a better way to mitigate problems associated with aging populations and shortage of health professionals. Although it has come into reality, critical problems still exist in automating design and reconfiguration of such a system enabling it to respond to the patient's requirements rapidly. This paper presents an ontology-based automating design methodology (ADM) for smart rehabilitation systems in IoT. Ontology aids computers in further understanding the symptoms and medical resources, which helps to create a rehabilitation strategy and reconfigure medical resources according to patients' specific requirements quickly and automatically. Meanwhile, IoT provides an effective platform to interconnect all the resources and provides immediate information interaction. Preliminary experiments and clinical trials demonstrate valuable information on the feasibility, rapidity, and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "IoT-Based Smart Rehabilitation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800071"}
