Our Formally Safe Routing (FSR) toolkit performs all of these functions from the same algebraic representation of routing policy. We show that routing algebra has a very natural translation to both integer constraints (to perform safety analysis using SMT solvers) and declarative programs (to generate distributed implementations). Our demonstration with realistic topologies and policies shows how FSR can detect problems in an AS's iBGP configuration, prove sufficient conditions for BGP safety, and empirically evaluate convergence time.", "paper_title": "FSR: Formal Analysis and Implementation Toolkit for Safe Inter-domain Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000302124800060"}
