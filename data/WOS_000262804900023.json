By establishing an L-operator differential inequality with mixed delays and using the properties of M-cone and stochastic analysis technique, we obtain some sufficient conditions ensuring the exponential p-stability of the impulsive stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed delays. These results generalize a few previous known results and remove some restrictions on the neural networks. Two examples are also discussed to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results.
