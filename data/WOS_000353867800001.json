In order to dealt disruption and disconnections a store, carry and forward paradigm is used in which node stores the incoming messages in its buffer, carries it while moving and forward when comes within the transmission range of other nodes. Message forwarding contributes and important role in increasing its delivery. For instance, probabilistic routing protocol forwards message to a node having high probability value to meet message destination. These protocols cannot handle a situation in which the node continually transmits messages even the probability difference is very small. In this paper, we have proposed a routing protocol known as Threshold Based best custodian Routing Protocol (TBbcRP) for delay tolerant network. We have proposed a threshold-based method to compute the quality value which is the ability of node to carry message. A self-learning mechanism has been used to remove the delivered messages from the network. Moreover, a buffer aware mechanism has been used that make sure availability of buffer space at receiver before message transmission. We have compared the performance of TBbcRP with Epidemic, PRoPHET and Delegated Forwarding. The proposed TBbcRP outperforms in terms of maximizing the delivery probability, reducing number of transmissions and message drop.", "paper_title": "Threshold Based Best Custodian Routing Protocol for Delay Tolerant Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000353867800001"}
