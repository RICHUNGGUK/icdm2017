A restriction of determinantal computation is considered in which the underlying affine map lambda x.L(x) must satisfy a rank lowerability property: L mapping to mxm matrices is said to be r-lowerable, if there exists an such that rank (L(a))a parts per thousand currency signm-r. In this model strongly nonlinear and exponential lower bounds are proved for several polynomial families.
