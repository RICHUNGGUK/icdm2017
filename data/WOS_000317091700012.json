Most existing learning techniques that extract signal-level contents from video data struggle to scale due to efficiency limits. With the development of pervasive positioning techniques, discovering hot topics from multimedia data by their geographical tags has become practical: videos taken by advanced cameras are associated with GPS locations, and geo-tagged videos from YouTube can be identified by their associated GPS locations on Google Maps. It enables us to know the cultures, scenes, and human behaviors from videos based on their spatiotemporal distributions. However, meaningful topic discovery requires an efficient clustering approach, through which coherent topics can be detected according to particular geographical regions without out-of-focus effects. To handle this problem, this paper presents a filter-refinement framework to discover hot topics corresponding to geographical dense regions, and then introduces two novel metrics to refine unbounded hot regions, together with a heuristic method for setting rational thresholds on these metrics. The results of extensive experiments prove that hot topics can be efficiently discovered by our framework, and more compact topics can be achieved after using the novel metrics.
