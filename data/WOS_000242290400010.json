Modern large-memory computers have made possible direct application of transport methods to large-scale computational models. However, many numerical acceleration techniques common to lattice transport codes are not applicable to heterogeneous geometry, especially high-dominance ratio when eigenvalue problems are solved. Consequently, large heterogeneous reactor problems have remained computationally intensive and impractical for routine engineering applications. Based on the characteristics method, this new code solves the transport equation by following neutron tracks. Due to the excessive number of these tracks in the demanding context of 3D large-scale calculations, the parallelization of the solver is the only way to obtain a fast solution. The parallelization is based on distributing a group of tracks, generated by a common ray tracing procedure, on several processors. An analytical model for the communication/computation ratio is presented in order to predict the specific performance on different kind of architectures. A scalability analysis based on the isoefficiency function is performed on our parallel code when we increase the size of the problem and the number of processors. Tests are done to validate the analytical model by comparing the results to those given by the empirical tests. Results show that our parallel code is scalable and portable.", "paper_title": "Scalability modeling for deterministic particle transport solvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000242290400010"}
