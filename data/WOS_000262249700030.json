However, in the literature, the pseudo-static approach was used by few researchers to compute the seismic vertical pullout resistance, where the real dynamic nature of earthquake accelerations cannot be considered. Under the seismic conditions, the values of the unit weight component of uplift factor f(gamma E) are determined for different magnitudes of soil friction angle, soil amplification, embedment ratio and seismic acceleration coefficients both in the horizontal and vertical directions. It is observed that the uplift factor f(gamma E) decreases significantly with the increase in seismic accelerations and amplification but increases with the increase in embedment ratio. The results are compared with the existing values in the literature and the significance of the present methodology for designing the horizontal strip anchor is discussed. In presence of vertical earthquake acceleration and amplification of vibration, the present values of f(gamma E) compare reasonably well with the existing pseudo-static values obtained by modifying the horizontal acceleration coefficient.
