The objective is to determine an optimal value of the due date and an optimal allocation of jobs onto machines so as to minimize a total cost function, which is the function of earliness, tardiness and due date values. For the problem under study, we establish a set of properties of an optimal solution and suggest a two-phase algorithm to tackle the problem. First, we limit the number of due dates one needs to consider in pursuit of optimality. Next, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to build an optimal schedule for a fixed due date. The key result is an O(m(2) log m) algorithm that solves the main problem to optimality. Scope and purpose: To extend the existing research on cost minimization with earliness, tardiness and due date penalties to the case of uniform parallel machines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
