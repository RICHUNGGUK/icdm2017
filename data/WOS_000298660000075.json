Some properties of the interpolating scaling functions are presented and are utilized to reduce the solution of the generalized Burgers-Huxley equation to the solution of a system of algebraic equations. Also another method which is based on the mixed collocation finite difference schemes is developed to solve this important nonlinear partial differential equation. Illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the presented techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
