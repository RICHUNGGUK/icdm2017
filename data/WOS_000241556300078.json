This method naturally integrates the motion and the static local appearance features and generates accurate boundary criteria via a boosting approach. We extend the conventional Adaboost classifier into a posterior probability form, which can be embedded in a particle filtering-based shape tracking framework. To make the tracking process more robust and faster, we use a PCA subspace shape representation to constrain the shape variation and lower the dimensionality. We also learn two shape-dynamic models for systole and diastole separately, to predict the shape evolution. Our tracking method incorporates the static appearance, the motion appearance, the shape constraints, and the dynamic prediction in a unified way. The proposed method has been implemented on 50 tagged MRI sequences. The experimental results show the accuracy and robustness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Boosting and nonparametric based tracking of tagged MRI cardiac boundaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300078"}
