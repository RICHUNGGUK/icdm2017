However, there are redundant or irrelevant features, which will reduce the performance of classification models. Considering the feature problems, we propose an embedded feature selection method, called Multi-label Embedded Feature Selection (MEFS), to improve classification performance by selecting features. MEFS embeds classifier and considers the label correlation. Other three representative multi-label feature selection methods, known as LP-Chi, max and avg, together with four multi-label classification algorithms, is included for performance comparison. Experimental results show that the performance of our MEFS algorithm is superior to those filter methods in the music emotion dataset.", "paper_title": "Embedded Feature Selection for Multi-label Classification of Music Emotions", "paper_id": "WOS:000307642700005"}
