As a special scatterer, the antenna can be responsible for the larger part of the total RCS of many military platforms. In this article, the configuration of the metal patch is modified, based on the difference of the current distribution while the antenna radiates and scatters. The monostatic radar cross section of proposed antenna is reduced in most parts of the band with polarized and phi polarized. Maximally 14 dBsm RCS reduction is achieved. The gain of the proposed antenna and reference antenna are in good agreement in most of the impedance bandwidth. Results are provided to demonstrate that the excellent radiation and perfect stealth performance is achieved. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
