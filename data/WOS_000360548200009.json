These types of emerging mobile networks can provide new forms of valuable information that are currently not available on this scale via any traditional data collection methods. In such networks, price competition is the most important factor among the participants (mobile devices, services organizers [SOs], and users), highly affecting their quality of experience. In this article, we first explain how a game theory model can depict social behavior, price competition, and the evolutionary relationship among devices, SOs, and users, and then provide insights to understand the price competition process of the participants in mobile networks. Finally, we outline several important open research directions.", "paper_title": "QOE-ENSURED PRICE COMPETITION MODEL FOR EMERGING MOBILE NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000360548200009"}
