On the other hand, the aim of steganalysis is to detect the presence of embedded data in a given media. In this paper, a steganalysis method is presented for the colored joint photographic experts group images in which the statistical moments of contourlet transform coefficients are used as the features. In this way, binary particle swarm optimization algorithm is also employed as a closed-loop feature selection method to select the efficient features in tandem with improvement of the detection rate. Nonlinear support vector machine and two variants of radial basis neural networks, i.e., radial basis function and probabilistic neural network, are used as the classification tools and their performance is compared in detecting the stego and clean images. Experimental results show that even for low embedding rates, the detection accuracy of the proposed method is more than 80% along with 30% reduction in the size of feature set.", "paper_title": "Improved contourlet-based steganalysis using binary particle swarm optimization and radial basis neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308825000021"}
