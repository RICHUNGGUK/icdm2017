The server takes at most H consecutive working vacations if the system remains empty after the end of a working vacation. Employing the supplementary variable and embedded Markov chain methods, we obtain the queue length distribution at different time epochs. Based on the various system length distribution, the probability of blocking, mean waiting times and mean system lengths have been derived. Finally, numerical results are discussed.
