The presence of intentional misspellings significantly decrease the accuracy of existing spell checking techniques for TL words. In this work, we formally investigate the nature and type of compressions used in SMS texts, and develop a Hidden Markov Model based word-model for TL. The model parameters have been estimated through standard machine learning techniques from a word-aligned SMS and standard English parallel corpus. The accuracy of the model in correcting TL words is 57.7%, which is almost a threefold improvement over the performance of Aspell. The use of simple bigram language model results in a 35% reduction of the relative word level error rates.", "paper_title": "Investigation and modeling of the structure of texting language", "paper_id": "WOS:000252521600004"}
