The type-2 fuzzy logic system permits us to model the uncertainties among rules and the parameters related to data analysis. In this paper, we propose an indirect method to create an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system from a historical data, where Footprint of Uncertainties of fuzzy sets are extracted by implementation of an interval type-2 FCM algorithm and based on an upper and lower value for the level of fuzziness m in FCM. Finally, the proposed model is applied for prediction of carbon monoxide concentration in Tehran air pollution. It is shown that the proposed type-2 fuzzy logic system is superior in comparison to type-1 fuzzy logic systems in terms of two performance indices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
