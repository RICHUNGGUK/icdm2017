Existing approaches estimate these illumination parameters directly in the high dimensional image space, while we estimate the parameters in two steps: first to project the image to an orthogonal linear subspace based on spherical harmonic basis functions; then to calculate the parameters in the low dimensional subspace. The experimental results on CMU PIE database and Yale Database B showed the stability and effectiveness of this method. The resulting illumination information can help to synthesize more realistic relighting images and recognize object under variable illumination.", "paper_title": "Estimating illumination parameters in real space with application to image relighting", "paper_id": "WOS:000235772300050"}
