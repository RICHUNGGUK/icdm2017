The presence of the interface, a polygonal curve, induces a natural triangulation in which the vertices of the prefractal are also nodes of the triangulation. In order to achieve an optimal rate of convergence of the numerical approximation a suitably refined mesh around the reentrant corners is required. This is achieved by generating a mesh compliant with the Grisvard's condition. We present the mesh algorithm and a detailed proof of the Grisvard conditions. (C) 2014 IMACS.
