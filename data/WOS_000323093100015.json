To facilitate large scale computations the algorithm is designed to retain strict data localization on processors. A high-order conservative ENO scheme is used for calculating the numerical fluxes and level sets are used to define the objects immersed in the flow field. A modified ghost fluid method is used for interface treatment of embedded objects. The issues involved in paralielization of the moving boundary flow solver are presented with emphasis on strong shocks interacting with embedded interfaces (solid-fluid and solid-solid) in a three-dimensional compressible flow framework. The handling of moving boundaries tracked using a narrow-band level set technique leads to issues peculiar to the multi-processor environment. The solution to object passage between sub-domains and treatment of ghost regions for inter-processor communication are addressed in the current work. Example calculations for three-dimensional impact-penetration problems and shocked particulate flows are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
