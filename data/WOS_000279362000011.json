In this article, this concept is generalized with the following definition. We say that a family of functions from [n] to [k] is a delta-balanced (n, k)-family of perfect hash functions if for every S subset of [n], vertical bar S vertical bar = k, the number of functions that are 1-1 on S is between T/delta and delta T for some constant T > 0. The standard definition of a family of perfect hash functions requires that there will be at least one function that is 1-1 on S, for each S of size k. In the new notion of balanced families, we require the number of 1-1 functions to be almost the same ( taking delta to be close to 1) for every such S. Our main result is that for any constant delta > 1, a delta-balanced (n, k)-family of perfect hash functions of size 2(O(k) (log) (log k)) log n can be constructed in time 2(O(k log log k)) log n. Using the technique of color-coding we can apply our explicit constructions to devise approximation algorithms for various counting problems in graphs. In particular, we exhibit a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for approximating both the number of simple paths of length k and the number of simple cycles of size k for any k <= O(log n/log log log n) graph with n vertices. The approximation is up to any fixed desirable relative error.", "paper_title": "Balanced Families of Perfect Hash Functions and Their Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000279362000011"}
