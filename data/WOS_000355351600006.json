With the analytic model we derive the per-node throughput of each node and quantify the impact of hidden nodes on per-node throughput. Through our analysis, we find that nodes having more hidden nodes are likely to have worse throughput performance than nodes having less hidden nodes, so resulting in unfairness in per-node throughput. We next propose a new algorithm, called the fake collision algorithm, to solve the unfairness due to hidden nodes. The proposed fake collision algorithm allows nodes with poor throughput to acquire more transmission opportunities by slightly modifying the Binary Exponential Backoff algorithm of the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function. To this end, the fake collision algorithm uses a new control parameter called the fake collision probability which can be obtained from a computation algorithm that we develop based on our analytic model. We show that the fairness in per-node throughput can be achieved with the fake collision probability for each node through simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
