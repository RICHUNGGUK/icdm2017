The challenge was the validation of the wrappers' specification with Alliance CAD Tools. A wrapper is a standard gateway used by a subscriber to access an interconnect. Because there are as many wrappers as subscribers, it is relevant to have an estimation of the wrapper's area, its frequency and then compare these results to the router's. The interest to perform this study with academic tools is to show that commercial tools are not the unique way for experimentations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
