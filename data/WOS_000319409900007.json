The design of a distributed low-complexity scheduling algorithm becomes even more challenging when taking into account a physical interference model, which requires the SINR at a receiver to be checked when making scheduling decisions. To do so, we need to check whether a transmission failure is caused by interference due to simultaneous transmissions from distant nodes. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm under a physical interference model, which is amenable to distributed implementation with 802.11 CSMA technologies. The proposed scheduling algorithm is shown to achieve throughput optimality. We present two variations of the algorithm to enhance the delay performance and to reduce the control overhead, respectively, while retaining throughput optimality.", "paper_title": "DSS: Distributed SINR-Based Scheduling Algorithm for Multihop Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319409900007"}
