If both technologies will be integrated, however, it is projected not only to maximize the effectiveness of 3D display but also to create a new market for personalized display. The purpose of this research is to suggest SMART (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Action oriented, Reliable, and Timely), which is the criteria for developing and applying personalized 3D display technologies. This research analyzes the existing multi-view 3D display and acquisition technologies, determines the technologies suitable for integration with bio-signal measurement technologies, and identifies the types of bio-signals that could create synergy with multi-view 3D display technologies. To test and apply the suggested SMART, this research conducts case study in health care field.", "paper_title": "A personalized display technology integrating the technologies of bio-signal measurements and multi-view 3D display", "paper_id": "WOS:000354493000010"}
