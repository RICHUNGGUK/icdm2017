We study the size of the largest connected component of the subgraph generated by independently removing each vertex of the Hamming torus with probability 1 -p. We show that if p =./ n, then there exists.c > 0, which is the positive root of a degree d polynomial whose coefficients depend on a1,..., ad, such that for. <.c the largest component has O(log n) vertices (w. h. p. as n.8), and for. >.c the largest component has (1 -q). i ai - nd-1 + o(nd-1) vertices and the second largest component has O(log n) vertices w. h. p. An implicit formula for q < 1 is also given. The value of.c that we find is distinct from the critical value for the emergence of a giant component in bond percolation on the Hamming torus.", "paper_title": "Site Percolation on the d-Dimensional Hamming Torus", "paper_id": "WOS:000338289200006"}
