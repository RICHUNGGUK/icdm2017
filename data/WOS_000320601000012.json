Though traditional login/password-based schemes are easy to implement, they have been subjected to several attacks. As an alternative, token and biometric-based authentication systems were introduced. However, they have not improved substantially to justify the investment. Thus, a variation to the login/password scheme, viz. graphical scheme was introduced. But it also suffered due to shoulder-surfing and screen-dump attacks. In this paper, we introduce a framework of our proposed (IPAS) Implicit Password Authentication System, which is immune to the common attacks suffered by other authentication schemes.
