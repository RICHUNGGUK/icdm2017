It is considered a powerful extension of XML to deal with dynamic XML data from autonomous and heterogeneous data sources on a very large scale via Web services. However, AXML is still at an immature stage and various issues need to be investigated before it can be accepted widely. This paper will focus on two issues facing the current AXML system, namely the representation and the query process. We propose superior representation and improved query evaluation for AXML. For justification purposes, we compare our proposed algorithms with the existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "On the improvement of active XML (AXML) representation and query evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677700005"}
