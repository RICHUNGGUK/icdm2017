However, the lack of available large-scale testbeds and publicly accessible multiple paths grossly prohibits the adoption of the technology. Here, we demonstrate a large-scale multipath playground deployed on Planet Lab Europe, which can be used either by experimenters and researchers to test and verify their multipath-related ideas (e.g., enhancing congestion control, fairness or even the arrangement of multiple paths) and also by early adopters to enhance their Internet connection even if they are single-homed(1).", "paper_title": "A Large-Scale Multipath Playground for Experimenters and Early Adopters", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900057"}
