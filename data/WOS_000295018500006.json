Based on this esteem, we calculate required hop count between two given MNs. In homogeneous mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where all MNs utilize the same transmission power, the hop count between any two MNs is proportional to the distance between them. Given the distance between each pair of MNs, this paper suggests the optimal transmission range (OTR) of MNs, which is the minimum possible power to guarantee end-to-end delay constraints of requested connections in the entire network. Packet collision is also considered in computing the OTR. All problems are investigated in both a two-dimensional (20) and a three-dimensional (3D) area. Simulation results substantiate the accuracy of proposed estimation methods. The errors of the per-hop advancement estimation are just 0.88% and 2.33% in a 20 and 3D areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
