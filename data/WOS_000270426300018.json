A less conservative delay-dependent robust stability condition is presented in term of LMIs (linear matrix inequalities) by using a new fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Neither any model transformation nor any bounding technique for bounding cross terms is needed during the derivation of the stability condition. Differently from previous Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, not only the membership function information but also the information of time-varying-delay state x(t -tau(t)), delay-upper-bounded state x(t-h), current state x(t) and the derivative of the state x(t) are used to construct the fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.", "paper_title": "DELAY-DEPENDENT ROBUST STABILITY OF UNCERTAIN T-S FUZZY SYSTEMS WITH TIME-VARYING DELAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300018"}
