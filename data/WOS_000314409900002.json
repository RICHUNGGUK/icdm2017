The reputation system is a popular technique currently used for providing a global quality score of a service provider to requesters. However, such global information is far from sufficient for service requesters to choose the most qualified services. In order to tackle this problem, the authors present a trust based architecture containing a computational trust model for quantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of services. In this trust model, they firstly construct a network based on the direct trust relations between participants and rating similarity in service oriented environments, then propose an algorithm for propagating trust in the social network based environment which can produce personalized trust information for a specific service requester, and finally implement the trust model and simulate various malicious behaviors in not only dense but also sparse networks which can verify the attack-resistant and robustness of the proposed approach. The experiment results also demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of the approach.", "paper_title": "Trust Based Service Selection in Service Oriented Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000314409900002"}
