The designs of these mechanisms are complicated and repeated with graph-relevant concerns. In this paper, we propose the \"distributed line graphs\" (DLG), a universal technique for designing DHTs based on arbitrary regular graphs. Using DLG, the main features of the initial graphs are preserved, and thus people can design a new DHT by simply choosing the graph with desirable features and applying DLG to it. We demonstrate the power of DLG by illustrating four DLG-enabled DHTs based on different graphs, namely, Kautz, de Bruijn, butterfly, and hypertree graphs. The effectiveness of our proposals is demonstrated through analysis, simulation, and implementation.", "paper_title": "Distributed Line Graphs: A Universal Technique for Designing DHTs Based on Arbitrary Regular Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000306557800002"}
