An empirical investigation was conducted to analyse user experience on the 36 main microblogging service elements, using a sample of 216 users of Sina Weibo, which is the biggest microblog in China. The tetra-class model was then applied to identify the contribution of each service element to the overall satisfaction. Through correspondence analysis, we calculated, respectively, the contribution to dissatisfaction when the service element was negatively evaluated and that to satisfaction when it was positively evaluated. Based on these two contribution values, we classified the service elements into four categories: Basic, Secondary, Plus, and Key. In order to know the preferences of different users towards the microblogging service elements, we segmented the users into groups according to their microblogging characteristics and personal attributes and then discussed the variations of the service, categorising among different user groups. Finally, we analysed the results and reached some conclusions, which could be helpful for the improvement of customised microblogging services.", "paper_title": "User satisfaction evaluation of microblogging services in China: using the tetra-class model", "paper_id": "WOS:000346575400003"}
