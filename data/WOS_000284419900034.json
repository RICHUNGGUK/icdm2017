In this paper, a construction of balanced quaternary sequences with period N equivalent to 2(mod 4) and optimal autocorrelation value and a construction of almost balanced binary sequences with period N equivalent to 0(mod 4) and optimal autocorrelation value are presented. Both constructions are a generalization of earlier ones.", "paper_title": "New Classes of Balanced Quaternary and Almost Balanced Binary Sequences With Optimal Autocorrelation Value", "paper_id": "WOS:000284419900034"}
