The concept is explained in the context of a case study that used naturalistic methods to explore the information-seeking behaviour of 10 participants, aged 16 to 18, as they searched for, selected, and used information for a school-based inquiry project on a topic related to the history of Western civilization. The study found an array of sub-searches, or Genres of Search, embedded within the information problem-solving process, each genre representing a distinct information need. The Genres of Search concept is useful for mapping irregularities in successive searching and provides insight into the nature of the tasks involved in the search process.", "paper_title": "Genres of Search: A Concept for Understanding Successive Search Behaviour", "paper_id": "WOS:000273545200001"}
