We have also investigated the capability of an iris filter to discriminate between nodules and false-positive findings. Suspicious regions were characterized with features based on the iris filter output, gray level and morphological features, extracted from the CT images. Functions calculated by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to reduce the number of false-positives. The system was evaluated on CT scans containing 77 pulmonary nodules. The system was trained and evaluated using two completely independent data sets. Results for a test set, evaluated with free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis, yielded a sensitivity of 80% at 7.7 false-positives per scan. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
