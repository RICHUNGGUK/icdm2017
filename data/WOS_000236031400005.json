Here, their applicability to capacitive sensing is investigated. Switched-mode FPAAs were not originally introduced for the readout of elementary sensors or their desensitization from parasitics. Nonetheless, we show that specific techniques can make them up to the task of reading capacitance variations in the tens fF range. We also show that FPAA sensor interfaces can achieve automatic, trimmer-free calibration by FPAA reconfiguration. We conclude by illustrating a sample application as a proof-of-concept of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Applicability of field programmable analog arrays to capacitive sensing in the Sub-pF range", "paper_id": "WOS:000236031400005"}
