An algorithm is given in this paper for generating a substitute valuation using a random number generator. In addition, the geometry of the set of all substitute valuations for a fixed number of goods K is investigated. The set consists of a union of polyhedrons, and the maximal polyhedrons are identified for K = 4. It is shown that the maximum dimension of the polyhedrons increases with K nearly as fast as two to the power K. Consequently, under broad conditions, if a combinatorial algorithm can present an arbitrary substitute valuation given a list of input numbers, the list must grow nearly as fast as two to the power K.
