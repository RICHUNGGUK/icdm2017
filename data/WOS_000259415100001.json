Despite some negative examples, in many important situations, the length of this path is quite close to the length of a geodesic curve. We show that in the case of a bounded convex set endowed with a nu-self-concordant barrier, the length of the central path is within a factor O(nu(1/4)) of the length of the shortest geodesic curve.", "paper_title": "Primal central paths and Riemannian distances for convex sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000259415100001"}
