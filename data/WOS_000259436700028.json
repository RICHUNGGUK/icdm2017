Since independent equations are valid unconditionally, they are better suited for the equational proof style using induction and rewriting, which is often found in proofs in theorem provers or on paper. We relate the problem to the well-known minimization problem for propositional DNF formulas and show that it is Sigma(P)(2)-complete. We then develop a concrete algorithm to compute minimal patterns, which naturally generalizes the standard Quine-McCluskey procedure to the domain of term patterns.", "paper_title": "Pattern minimization problems over recursive data types", "paper_id": "WOS:000259436700028"}
