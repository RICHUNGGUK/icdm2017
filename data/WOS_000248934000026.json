In this paper, we propose an efficient rate control scheme based on the complexity of MB (Macro Block) while conventional transcoding schemes use that of a picture. Since the frequency domain transcoder has to calculate the spatial activity of MB to adjust the quantization step, a process of converting the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) data into spatial one is required. The proposed scheme calculates the spatial activity from DCT data without converting them to pixel domain.", "paper_title": "Efficient rate control scheme using complexity of macro block for MPEG-2 transcoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934000026"}
