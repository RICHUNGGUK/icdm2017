Data analysis of the received signal strength indication is very essential for understanding the underlying location-dependent features and patterns of location fingerprints. This knowledge can assist a system designer in accurately modeling a positioning system, improving positioning performance, and efficiently designing such a system. This study investigates extensively through measurements, the features of the received signal strength indication reported by IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network interface cards. The results of the statistical data analysis help in identifying a number of phenomena that affect the precision and accuracy of indoor positioning systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
