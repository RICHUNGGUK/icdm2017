The theoretical foundation of this important topic suffers from a lack of a generally accepted analytical framework as well as a lack of widely accepted example problems. This article tackles both problems by discussing necessary conditions for useful and practically relevant theoretical analysis as well as introducing a concrete family of dynamic example problems that draws inspiration from a well-known static example problem and exhibits a bi-stable dynamic. After the stage has been set this way, the framework is made concrete by presenting the results of thorough theoretical and statistical analysis for mutation-based evolutionary algorithms and artificial immune systems.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Randomised Search Heuristics for Dynamic Optimisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000367333600002"}
