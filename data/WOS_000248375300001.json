We study a newly proposed measure, a Resource Allocation Queueing Fairness Measure (RAQFM), first introduced in Raz, Levy, and Avi-Itzhak (Perform. Eval. Rev. 32(l):130-141, 2004). We analyze the properties of RAQFM and tie them to intuition, provide bounds for its values, and discuss briefly how it yields to analysis.", "paper_title": "A resource allocation queueing fairness measure: properties and bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000248375300001"}
