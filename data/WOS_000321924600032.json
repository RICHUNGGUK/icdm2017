At present, most of the existing learning machines, such as support tensor machine (STM), involve nonconvex optimization problems and need to resort to iterative techniques. Obviously, it is very time-consuming and may suffer from local minima. In order to overcome these two shortcomings, in this paper, we present a novel linear support higher-order tensor machine (SHTM) which integrates the merits of linear C-support vector machine (C-SVM) and tensor rank-one decomposition. Theoretically, SHTM is an extension of the linear C-SVM to tensor patterns. When the input patterns are vectors, SHTM degenerates into the standard C-SVM. A set of experiments is conducted on nine second-order face recognition datasets and three third-order gait recognition datasets to illustrate the performance of the proposed SHTM. The statistic test shows that compared with STM and C-SVM with the RBF kernel, SHTM provides significant performance gain in terms of test accuracy and training speed, especially in the case of higher-order tensors.", "paper_title": "A Linear Support Higher-Order Tensor Machine for Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000321924600032"}
