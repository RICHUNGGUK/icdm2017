Multiway data analysis has recently become popular as an exploratory analysis tool in discovering the structures in higher-order data sets, where data have more than two modes. We provide a review of significant contributions in the literature on multiway models, algorithms as well as their applications in diverse disciplines including chemometrics, neuroscience, social network analysis, text mining, and computer vision.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised Multiway Data Analysis: A Literature Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000260999100001"}
