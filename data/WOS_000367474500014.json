A quick order promising method for an iron and steel enterprise, based on short-term production capacity balancing planning is proposed in this paper. With the help of this method, ATP (Available-To-Promise) concept is extended to RATP (Resource-Available-To-Promise) and DTP (Delivery-To-Promise) is given while making the resource promise. A heuristic method is developed to match the available resources with the order demand and the actual data testing results have shown that the method proposed can meet the demand of online order promising in a relatively short time.", "paper_title": "An Heuristic Order Promising Method Based on Short-Term Production Capacity Balancing Planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000367474500014"}
