To the best of our knowledge, little or no research has been performed so far to understand the relationships between IT resources, innovativeness and sustainability. This paper analyzes the relationships between two types of IT resources (technological IT and human IT resources), innovativeness and firms' green management (GM) capabilities. Using survey data from Spanish firms this study finds that: (1) innovativeness is a core capability that helps the firm to develop GM capabilities; (2) the deployment of technological IT and human IT resources has a direct effect on the development of an innovative environment; and (3) IT impacts on GM capabilities through the capability of innovativeness.", "paper_title": "INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED INNOVATIVENESS AND GREEN CAPABILITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000287427800010"}
