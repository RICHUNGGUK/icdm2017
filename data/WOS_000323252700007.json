A sufficient condition for noise attenuation is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities, so a robust filter can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Finally, some examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity filtering for uncertain two-dimensional continuous systems with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000323252700007"}
