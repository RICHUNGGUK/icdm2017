But it seems to be inapplicable to the cases where the states change abruptly or there exist model mismatches in non-linear systems. Therefore, based on the EFKF, a new concept of the improved fuzzy Kalman filter (IFKF) is proposed in this article. Due to the introduction of the extension orthogonality principle given as a criterion to design the new algorithm, the IFKF can track the abrupt changes of the states and has definite robustness against the model mismatches. Finally, computer simulations with a MIMO nonlinear model are presented, which illustrate that the proposed IFKF has the strong tracking ability and robustness against the model mismatches.", "paper_title": "An improved fuzzy Kalman filter for state estimation of non-linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277149800006"}
