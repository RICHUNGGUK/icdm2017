A windowed input feature consists of a number of pixels, and the dimension of input space is determined by the number of windowed features. Each element of an image covariance matrix can be obtained from the inner product of two windowed features. The 2D-PCA and 2D-LDA methods are then obtained from principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis, respectively, using the image covariance matrix. In the case of 2D-LDA, there is no need for PCA preprocessing and the dimension of subspace can be greater than the number of classes because the within-class and between-class image covariance matrices have full ranks. Comparative experiments are performed using the FERET, CMU, and ORL databases of facial images. The experimental results show that the proposed 2D-LDA provides the best recognition rate among several subspace methods in all of the tests. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
