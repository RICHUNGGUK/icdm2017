This model is instantiated with a sparse recurrently connected neural network that has spiking leaky integrator units and continuous Hebbian learning. First we study the structure, modularization, and size of neocortex, and then we describe a generic computational model of the cortical circuitry. A characterizing feature of the model is that it is based on the modularization of neocortex into hypercolumns and minicolumns. Both a floating- and fixed-point arithmetic implementation of the model are presented along with simulation results. We conclude that an implementation on a cluster computer is not communication but computation bounded. A mouse and rat cortex sized version of our model executes in 44% and 23% of real-time respectively. Further, an instance of the model with 1.6 x 10(6) units and 2 x 10(11) connections performed noise reduction and pattern completion. These implementations represent the current frontier of large-scale abstract neural network simulations in terms of network size and running speed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
