The surge of new malwares with more complex structures and dynamic characteristics leads to efficient fusion of multi-source malicious information more difficult in detection. In this paper, we propose a new multi-source based method to detect Android malwares by emphasizing on the traditional static features, control flow graph, and repacking characteristics. Each category of features is treated as an independent information source in feature extracting rules building and classification. Then, the Dempster-Shafer algorithm is used to fuse these information sources. This method can improve accuracy of malware detection without adding too many instability characteristics that are extracted from disassembled codes, and have better performance in the resistance to code obfuscation technologies. To verify our method, different categories of apps are collected to build the dataset in our experiment. Based on the dataset, our method can achieve 97% detection accuracy and 1.9% false positive rate.
