We describe the complete methodology we developed for the construction of such graphs and provide some baselines for this task by evaluating relevant state-of-the-art technology. We situate our research in the context of text exploration, since it was motivated by joint work with industrial partners in the text analytics area. Accordingly, we present our motivating scenario and the first gold-standard dataset of TEGs. However, while our own motivation and the dataset focus on the text exploration setting, we suggest that TEGs can have different usages and suggest that automatic creation of such graphs is an interesting task for the community.", "paper_title": "Textual entailment graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000362983100003"}
