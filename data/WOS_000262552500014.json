Emphasis is placed on deriving direct relations between the indicators and mesh distortion. The work is based Oil use of the finite Volume discretization for evaluation of first order spatial derivatives. The analytic form of the truncation error is derived and applied to elementary types of mesh distortion including typical hybrid grid interfaces. The corresponding analytic expressions provide direct relations between computational accuracy and the degree of stretching, skewness, shearing and non-alignment of the mesh. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
