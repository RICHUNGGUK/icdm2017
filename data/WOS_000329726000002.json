Ontology learning is a series of methods and technologies to construct ontology automatically or semi-automatically. Concept and hierarchy learning are the most important parts of the ontology construction. This paper proposes an ontology concept and hierarchy learning method based on the Pachinko Allocation Model. The above problem is transformed into a probability and statistical inference problem by building an ontology concept learning model. Gibbs sampling is used to estimate the parameters. Then, using the ontology concept generation algorithm based on WordNet, an abstract description of the ontology concept is obtained. Experimental results on the standard test dataset show that the proposed method can offer an effective solution to ontology concept and hierarchy learning.", "paper_title": "A PAM-based ontology concept and hierarchy learning method", "paper_id": "WOS:000329726000002"}
