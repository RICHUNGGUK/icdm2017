The research community has a consensus for the need of a standardized protocol stack for M2M communications. On the other hand, cognitive radio technology is very promising for M2M communications due to a number of factors. It is expected that cognitive M2M communications will be indispensable in order to realize the vision of IoT. However cognitive M2M communications requires a cognitive radio-enabled protocol stack in addition to the fundamental requirements of energy efficiency, reliability, and Internet connectivity. The main objective of this paper is to provide the state of the art in cognitive M2M communications from a protocol stack perspective. This paper covers the emerging standardization efforts and the latest developments on protocols for cognitive M2M networks. In addition, this paper also presents the authors' recent work in this area, which includes a centralized cognitive medium access control (MAC) protocol, a distributed cognitive MAC protocol, and a specially designed routing protocol for cognitive M2M networks. These protocols explicitly account for the peculiarities of cognitive radio environments. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocols not only ensure protection to the primary users (PUs) but also fulfil the utility requirements of the secondary M2M networks.", "paper_title": "Cognitive Machine-to-Machine Communications for Internet-of-Things: A Protocol Stack Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098400001"}
