To the best of our knowledge, problems of this type have not been considered in the literature, except for some particular cases when either the state space is finite-dimensional or there is no delay in the dynamics. We develop the method of discrete approximations to derive necessary optimality conditions in the extended Euler-Lagrange form by using advanced tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation in infinite dimensions. This method consists of the three major parts: (a) constructing a well-posed sequence of discrete-time problems that approximate in an appropriate sense the original continuous-time problem of dynamic optimization; (b) deriving necessary optimality conditions for the approximating discrete-time problems by reducing them to infinite-dimensional problems of mathematical programming and employing then generalized differential calculus; (c) passing finally to the limit in the obtained results for discrete approximations to establish necessary conditions for the given optimal solutions to the original problem. This method is fully realized in the delay-differential systems under consideration.", "paper_title": "Optimal control of delay-differential inclusions with multivalued initial conditions in infinite dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000261458100008"}
