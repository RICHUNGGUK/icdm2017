RFID is a commonly used technology for tracking and tracing, and is replacing the barcode in various industries. However, its measurement advantages have not yet been taken up in the field of physical fitness testing, in which human errors often occur due to the difficulty in tracking and scoring test takers simultaneously. An RFID-based automatic scoring system can eliminate errors by automatic tracking and scoring. A preliminary system was developed for the PACER and 6-min walk test scoring, and it was evaluated during pilot testing. The RFID-based system is a successful example of the application of RFID technology to the field of physical fitness testing, showing great potential in physical fitness and activity tracking and scoring. The proposed system enables the mass testing of many students or examinees accurately, and it could significantly reduce the burden of test administers. This system also has great potential to extend into the physical activity monitoring and promotion area.", "paper_title": "RFID-Based Automatic Scoring System for Physical Fitness Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000355211600002"}
