The method views the drawing sketch as the result of a stochastic process that is governed by a hidden stochastic model and identified according to its probability of generating the output. To capture a user's drawing habits, a composite feature combining both geometric and dynamic characteristics of sketching is defined for sketch representation. To implement the stochastic process of online multi-stroke sketch recognition, multi-stroke sketching is modeled as an HMM chain while the strokes are mapped as different HMM states. To fit the requirement of adaptive online sketch recognition, a variable state-number determining method for HMM is also proposed. The experiments prove both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive online multi-stroke sketch recognition based on Hidden Markov Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100099"}
