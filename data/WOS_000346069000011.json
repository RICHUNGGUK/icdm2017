This study aimed to introduce a Lagrangian-Eulerian coupling model to predict globe rupture resulting from primary blast effect. A finite element model of a human eye was created using Lagrangian mesh. An explosive and its surrounding air domain were modelled using Eulerian mesh. Coupling the two models allowed simulating the blast wave generation, propagation and interaction with the eye. The results showed that the peak overpressures caused by blast wave on the corneal apex are 2080, 932.1 and 487.3kPa for the victim distances of 0.75, 1.0 and 1.25m, respectively. Higher stress occurred at the limbus, where the peaks for the three victim distances are 25.5, 14.1 and 6.4MPa. The overpressure threshold of globe rupture was determined as 2000kPa in a small-scale explosion. The findings would provide insights into the mechanism of primary blast-induced ocular injuries.", "paper_title": "Prediction of globe rupture caused by primary blast: a finite element analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000346069000011"}
