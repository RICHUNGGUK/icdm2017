This algorithm uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a normalized similarity matrix to partition the data, and is simple to implement. However, when the image is corrupted by noise, spectral clustering cannot obtain satisfying segmentation performance. In order to overcome the noise sensitivity of the standard spectral clustering algorithm, a novel fuzzy spectral clustering algorithm with robust spatial information for image segmentation (FSC_RS) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a non-local-weighted sum image of the original image is generated by utilizing the pixels with a similar configuration of each pixel. Then a robust gray-based fuzzy similarity measure is defined by using the fuzzy membership values among gray values in the new generated image. Thus, the similarity matrix obtained by this measure is only dependent on the number of the gray-levels and can be easily stored. Finally, the spectral graph partitioning method can be applied to this similarity matrix to group the gray values of the new generated image and then the corresponding pixels in the image are reclassified to obtain the final segmentation result. Some segmentation experiments on synthetic and real images show that the proposed method outperforms traditional spectral clustering methods and spatial fuzzy clustering in efficiency and robustness.
