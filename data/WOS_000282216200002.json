Our approach adopts a multi-baseline stereo strategy using a set of multi-perspective panoramas where large baseline lengths are available. We design two image acquisition rigs for capturing such multi-perspective panoramas. The first one is composed of two parallel stereo cameras. By rotating the rig about a vertical axis, we generate four multi-perspective panoramas by resampling the regular perspective images captured by the stereo cameras. Then a depth map is estimated from the four multi-perspective panoramas and an original perspective image using a multi-baseline matching technique with different types of epipolar constraints. The second one is composed of a single camera and two mirrors. By rotating the rig, we acquire a spatio-temporal volume that is made up of the sequential images captured by the camera. Then we estimate a depth map by extracting trajectories from the spatio-temporal volume by using a multi-baseline stereo technique by considering occlusions. We can consider both rotating rigs as a single rotating camera with a very large field of view (FOV), that offers a large baseline length in depth estimation. In addition, compared with a previous approach using two multi-perspective panoramas from a single rotating camera, our approach can reduce matching errors due to image noise, repeated patterns, and occlusions by multi-baseline stereo techniques. Experimental results using both synthetic and real images show that our approach produces high quality panoramic 3D reconstruction.", "paper_title": "PANORAMIC 3D RECONSTRUCTION USING STEREO MULTI-PERSPECTIVE PANORAMA", "paper_id": "WOS:000282216200002"}
