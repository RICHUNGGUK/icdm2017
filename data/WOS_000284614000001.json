These properties can be used in the problem of identification of a belief function from sample data. More concretely, we study the set of isometries, the set of invariant measures and the adjacency structure. From these results, we prove that the polytope of belief functions is not an order polytope if the referential has more than two elements. Similar results are obtained for plausibility functions.", "paper_title": "ON THE POLYTOPES OF BELIEF AND PLAUSIBILITY FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000284614000001"}
