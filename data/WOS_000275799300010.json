These schemes facilitate the various retransmission strategies at relay and single-user and multi-user iterative decoding techniques at destination, suitable for trade-offs between performance, latency. and complexity. When channel state information (CSI) is available, pre-coding and power allocation at the relay can be exploited to enhance the information transmission reliability over the relay-destination channel, thus improving the overall system performance. Simulation result shows their superiority to direct transmission under the same transmit power and bandwidth efficiency. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
