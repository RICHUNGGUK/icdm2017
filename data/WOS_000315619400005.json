We are interested in the problem of evaluating (model checking) such formulas in a powerset lattice. We assume that the quantifier-free part of the expression can be any monotone function given by a black-box - we may only ask for its value for given arguments. As a first result we prove that when the lattice is fixed, the problem becomes polynomial (the assumption about the quantifier-free part strengthens this result). As a second result we show that any algorithm solving the problem has to ask at least about n(2) (namely Omega(n(2)/log n) queries to the function, even when the expression consists of one mu and one nu (the assumption about the quantifier-free part weakens this result).", "paper_title": "SOME RESULTS ON COMPLEXITY OF mu-CALCULUS EVALUATION IN THE BLACK-BOX MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000315619400005"}
