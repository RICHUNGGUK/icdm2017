Quantification of 3D micro architecture of the inter-granular airspace in the grain bulks can also contribute to the development of predictive models of insect movement and for designing acoustic systems for insect infestation detection. In this study, inter-connected 3D array of void spaces was characterized by geometrical quantities such as specific surface area, pore throat size and nodal pore volume. These features were obtained from a 13.1 cm x 13.1 cm x 5 cm volume of wheat and pea bulks. The grain bulks were imaged using a high resolution X-ray computed tomography system at 200 mu m resolution. The spatial distributions were computed based on 3D medial axis analysis of the void space in the images using 3DMA-Rock software and a high performance Polaris computer. The other features calculated were medial axis tortuosity, throat surface area and porosity from the 3D images. Characterization of pore throat network provides reliable observation for facilitating realistic prediction of permeability and the nature of air and gas distribution inside grain bulks.
