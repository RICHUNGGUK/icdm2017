The current methods [14], [12], [8] require to discover classification rules before any action rule can be constructed from them. Several definitions of action rules [8], [13], [9], [3] have been proposed. They differ in the generality of their classification parts but they are always constructed from certain pairs of classification rules. Our new strategy defines the classification part of an action rule in a unique way. Also, action rules are constructed from single classification rules. We show how to compute their confidence and support. Action rules are used to reclassify objects. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the level of reclassification freedom for objects in a decision system.", "paper_title": "Action rules discovery, a new simplified strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800051"}
