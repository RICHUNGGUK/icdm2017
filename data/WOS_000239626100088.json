So, ubiquitous service need a service matchmaker which presents more easily and with accuracy. The coupling of webservices and semantic web technology provides the ability to automatically discover, compose and execute webservices. However, the composition of services is generally static because these services are usually described using BPEL4WS or WSFL, restricting dynamic operation because the composite service only has a sequence execution plan. This dynamic composition cannot generate a parallel execution plan for many Internet business applications. In this paper, we design an ontology based framework for dynamic webservice composition. Also, we present a semantic webservice framework using dynamic composition model. This dynamic composition model can generate a parallel execution plan. These plans are calculated using QoS model, hence the best execution plan is selected.", "paper_title": "Dynamic service composition model for ubiquitous service environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100088"}
