One wants to find a sufficient condition on these points to grant that there exists a rational cubic passing through them, and interpolating the curve in a prescribed way. We found such a condition, studying real pencils of cubics. A generic complex pencil has twelve singular (nodal) cubics and nine distinct base points; any eight of them determines the ninth one and hence the pencil. If the pencil is real, exactly eight of its singular cubics are distinguished, that is real, with a loop containing some base points. If eight of the base points lie in convex position in RP2, one can often deduce the sequence of distinguished cubics out of some simpler combinatorial data, expressed in terms of mutual positions of points and conics.", "paper_title": "Pencils of cubics as tools to solve an interpolation problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000243923900004"}
