In this paper, we present a data processing flow of 3D reconstruction based on Chang'E-1 (CE-1) three-line imagery (120 m) and laser altimeter (LAM) data to acquire pixel-level resolution DEM. First, initial global disparity estimation was generated, and then corresponding points were acquired pixel-by-pixel by Adaptive Support-Weight Approach. A Least Square Image matching method was used to achieve sub-pixel accuracy, ultimately resulting in pixel-level resolution DEM (120 m). Global lunar 100 m DEM (GLD100 DEM) from LROC WAC stereo imagery is employed for comparison analysis and the mean elevation difference between two DEMs is less than 120 m. Experimental results show that the processing flow is effective and reliable for acquiring pixel-level DEM based on CE-1 data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
