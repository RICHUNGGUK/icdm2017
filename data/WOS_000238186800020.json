We discuss the impact of these experimental results on the security of the Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld key exchange protocol [2] with originally suggested parameters as well as with recently updated ones.", "paper_title": "Random subgroups of braid groups: An approach to cryptanalysis of a braid group based cryptographic protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000238186800020"}
