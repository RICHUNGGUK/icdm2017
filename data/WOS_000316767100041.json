The plant is considered as possibility distribution on a plant space and the closed loop specifications are given in terms of the peak of sensitivity function described by fuzzy numbers. The controller design is understood as the inclusion of respective alpha-cuts. Such consideration makes it possible to degrade the closed loop specifications towards the uncertainty that occurs very rarely. The proposed procedure is applied on the speed control of a hydraulic turbine - a non-minimum phase system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
