Using firmly established CIE principles, absorbance-wavelength data from visible spectra recorded using a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer are taken as input, with chromaticity coordinates being generated as output. The calorimetric transformations described are well known to colour scientists, with the methodology and background now being made accessible to the electrochromic materials community. Colour stimulus measurement example calculation results are firstly presented for aqueous solutions of the dyes, Erythrosin B (red), Acid Green 25 and Remaxol Brilliant Blue R. and then for tracking electrochromic in situ colour stimulus changes in the methyl viologen and n-heptyl viologen systems. The quantification of colour during each viologen dication to cation radical reduction process, and each reverse (oxidation) process, showed that subtle changes in both hue and luminance could be detected, with evidence of colour contributions from both the cation radical and the cation radical dimer.
