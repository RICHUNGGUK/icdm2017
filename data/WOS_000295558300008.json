Despite the availability of multiple channels in several of the current wireless standards, only a small fraction of them are non-overlapping and many channels are partially overlapped. In this paper, we formulate the joint channel assignment and flow allocation problem for multi-channel multi-radio WMNs as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Unlike most of the previous studies, we consider the case when both non-overlapped and partially overlapped channels are being used. We consider an objective of maximizing aggregate end-to-end throughput and minimizing queueing delay in the network, instead of the sum of link capacities, since the traffic characteristics of a multi-hop WMN are quite different from a single hop wireless network. Our static channel assignment algorithm incorporates network traffic information, i.e., it is load aware. Our formulation takes into consideration several important network parameters such as the transmission power of each node, path loss information, the signal to interference plus noise ratio at a node, and the frequency response of the filters used in the transmitter and receiver. We show by simulations that our MILP formulation makes efficient use of the spectrum, by providing superior channel assignments and flow allocations with the addition of partially overlapped channels, without the use of any additional spectrum. We also justify the need to consider alternative objective functions such as, minimizing average queueing in the network. We also propose a polynomially bounded heuristic algorithm to scale the proposed algorithm to bigger network topologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
