Due to difficulties in real-time measurement of ground motion acceleration and also intrinsic uncertain nature of structural damping, it is assumed that these data are not available for control purposes. First, these uncertain data are estimated by appropriate adaptive laws. Then a developed adaptive backstepping control strategy is used to propose a control law which only depends on feedback measurements of displacement and velocity vectors. Two numerical examples are provided and the result of the proposed approach is presented in comparison with LQR design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
