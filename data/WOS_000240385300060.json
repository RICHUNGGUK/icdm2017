Our approach do not depends on special facilities and it applies multi-view epipolar geometry and motion analysis principles to reconstruct 3D ear model. Ear feature points selecting and matching based on ear contour division method in user interactive way are proposed in this paper. Detail experimental results and comparisons with existing reconstruction methods are provided. Potential 3D ear feature extraction and recognition ways are discussed in the final part.", "paper_title": "3D ear reconstruction attempts: Using multi-view", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300060"}
