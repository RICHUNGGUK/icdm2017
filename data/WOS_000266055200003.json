The correlation between each of the fifteen pairs of source items and five kinds of citation data-citation count, impact factor, immediacy index, citing half-fife, and cited half-fife-are examined based on the Pearson correlation tests. The Fisher's z-transform is employed to test the significant difference between the Pearson correlation coefficient for each pair of citation data from the three subject areas. The significance of mean difference of each citation data was examined by t test. The similarities and differences in citation data among the three subjects are identified.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Comparison of Citation Data between Journals of Education, Library & Information Science, and Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000266055200003"}
