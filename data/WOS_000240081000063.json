Thus, location privacy is an major security issue of ubiquitous computing environment. Most research on location privacy is focused on protecting the location information itself. However, not only prohibiting acquirement of the sensitive information illegally but also forbidding abuse of the information obtained legally is important to protect user privacy. In order to satisfy this claim, we propose a new privacy-aware service protocol for a ubiquitous computing environment. The proposed protocol decouples the relation between a user's identity and location. Moreover, it uses anonymous communication channel to hide the user's service consume pattern.", "paper_title": "A privacy-aware service protocol for ubiquitous computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000063"}
