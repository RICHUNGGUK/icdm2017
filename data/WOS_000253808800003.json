As an estimate of mutual information, a robust version of the Edgeworth expansion is used, on which gradient descent is performed. As an application, we consider the extraction of both the mother and the fetal antepartum electrocardiograms (ECG) from multielectrode cutaneous recordings on the mother's thorax and abdomen.", "paper_title": "Constrained subspace ICA based on mutual information optimization directly", "paper_id": "WOS:000253808800003"}
