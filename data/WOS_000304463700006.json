Supplier selection among different manufacturers is one of the most important aspects of competition among market participants. In this paper, we study a supplier selection taking into consideration three key criteria: price, quality and delivery performance. A game theory-based model is proposed for the problem in such a way that each buyer tries not only to optimise his/her own problem but also to remove the other buyers from their optimum points. We apply a combination of multi-criteria decision-making methods and an extension of the ordinal game theory to find the Nash equilibrium for selecting the right supplier in a competitive market. The success of this model will be supported by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "A novel method for supplier selection by two competitors, including multiple criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000304463700006"}
