This paper provides two contributions to the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) of autonomic computing systems using Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs). First, we describe the structure and functionality of an MDE tool that visually captures the design of EJB applications, their quality of service (QoS) requirements, and the adaptations applied to their EJBs. Second, the paper describes how MDE tools can be used to generate code to simulate adaptive systems for verification and plug EJBs into a Java component framework that provides runtime adaptation capabilities.", "paper_title": "Simplifying autonomic enterprise Java Bean applications via model-driven engineering and simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254668100002"}
