The two objective functions considered in this problem are to minimize both makespan and total weighted tardiness. The computational results show that the proposed heuristic is computationally efficient and provides solutions of reasonable quality. The proposed TSA outperforms other algorithms in terms of the number of non-dominated solutions and the quality of its solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
