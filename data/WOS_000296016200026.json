The generic framework is based on a supervised learning formulation which leads to reduced orderings. A training set for the background and another training set for the foreground are needed as well as a supervised method to construct the ordering mapping. Two particular cases of learning techniques are considered in detail: 1) kriging-based vector ordering and 2) support vector machines-based vector ordering. These supervised orderings may then be used for the extension of mathematical morphology to vector images. In particular, in this paper, we focus on the application of morphological processing to hyperspectral images, illustrating the performance with practical examples.", "paper_title": "Supervised Ordering in IRp: Application to Morphological Processing of Hyperspectral Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000296016200026"}
