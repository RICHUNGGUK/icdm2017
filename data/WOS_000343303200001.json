First, based on the sampled unit-step response data of the afore-mentioned multiple time-delay system, the conventional balanced model-reduction method is utilised to construct an approximated discrete-time model of the original (known/unknown) multiple time-delay continuous-time transfer function matrix. Then, a digital decoupling controller is designed by utilising the extended adjoint decoupling method together with the conventional discrete-time root-locus method. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Digital decoupling controller design for multiple time-delay continuous-time transfer function matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303200001"}
