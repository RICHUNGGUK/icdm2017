Through quantitative study, we show that existing event detection approaches are challenged to explore the sensing capability of a deployed system and choose the right sensors to meet user-specified accuracy. Event detection systems are also challenged to provide a generic system that efficiently adapts to environmental dynamics and works easily with a range of applications, machine learning approaches, and sensor modalities. Consequently, we propose Watchdog, a modality-agnostic event detection framework that clusters the right sensors to meet user-specified detection accuracy during runtime while significantly reducing energy consumption. Watchdog can use different machine learning techniques to learn the sensing capability of a heterogeneous sensor deployment and meet accuracy requirements. To address environmental dynamics and ensure energy savings, Watchdog wakes up and puts to sleep sensors as needed to meet user-specified accuracy. Through evaluation with real vehicle detection trace data and a building traffic monitoring testbed of IRIS motes, we demonstrate the superior performance of Watchdog over existing solutions in terms of meeting user-specified detection accuracy, energy savings, and environmental adaptability.", "paper_title": "A Learning-Based Approach to Confident Event Detection in Heterogeneous Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345012500010"}
