Each day, pool nurses have to be assigned for the following days to public hospitals while taking into account a variety of soft and hard constraints regarding working date and time, working patterns, nurses qualifications, nurses' and hospitals' preferences, as well as costs. Extensive computational experiments based on a four week simulation period were used to evaluate three different scenarios varying the number of nurses and hospitals for six different hospitals' demand intensities. The results of our simulations and optimizations reveal that the proposed ACO algorithm achieves highly significant improvements compared to a greedy assignment algorithm. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
