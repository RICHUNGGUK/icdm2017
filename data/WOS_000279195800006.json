In our approach, each camera view is first decomposed automatically into regions based on the correlation of object dynamics across different spatial locations in all camera views. A new Cross Canonical Correlation Analysis (xCCA) is then formulated to discover and quantify the time delayed correlations of regional activities observed within and across multiple camera views in a single common reference space. We show that learning the time delayed activity correlations offers important contextual information for (i) spatial and temporal topology inference of a camera network; (ii) robust person re-identification and (iii) global activity interpretation and video temporal segmentation. Crucially, in contrast to conventional methods, our approach does not rely on either intra-camera or inter-camera object tracking; it thus can be applied to low-quality surveillance videos featured with severe inter-object occlusions. The effectiveness and robustness of our approach are demonstrated through experiments on 330 hours of videos captured from 17 cameras installed at two busy underground stations with complex and diverse scenes.", "paper_title": "Time-Delayed Correlation Analysis for Multi-Camera Activity Understanding", "paper_id": "WOS:000279195800006"}
