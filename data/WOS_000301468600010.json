This suggests that 'Best Practice' is context-dependent. To better understand the contextual nature of best practice, we want to explore how organisations actually go about achieving software objectives. We require a research framework that captures this information in a way that makes no assumptions about practices, and that is descriptive in nature. We have developed a framework based on the perspective that practices exist to meet specific objectives. We have experimented with the framework by using it to capture the practices of three New Zealand organisations and by application to an idealised XP process. Our capture of organisational practices revealed interesting mechanisms for further study, including a dependence upon informal practices linked with strong communication and the idea of 'push' versus 'pull' for information elicitation. Our capture of XP exposed some context-dependent risks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
