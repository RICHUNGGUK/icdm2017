CPS integration modeling language, which is a multi-view domain specific modeling language for CPS application modeling have previously been proposed. A Code Generation Framework for CPS integration modeling (CPSiCGF) is proposed in the paper. It reads the CPS application model created during the specification stage, and produces the full configuration of the application as well as the corresponding codes to make the final application executable. Automatic code generation and fast reconfiguration can be achieved using the framework, based on the code generation tools and the CPS components library. The proposed CPSiCGF was then utilized in the design and implementation of an embedded CNC lathe system which was based on the platform of ARM2440+DSP TMS320C6713+FPGA. The experimental results have shown the feasibility, convenience and advantages of CPSiCGF in the developing of a kind of complicated cyber physical system, embedded CNC system.
