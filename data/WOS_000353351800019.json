In these paradigms, common information exchange between two data centers can be assisted via one or more substrate nodes, which correspond to bidirectional relaying communication. In this paper, we investigate the performance of time division broadcast (TDBC) protocol in bidirectional cloud networks in the presence of channel estimation errors (CEEs). The tight asymptotic expressions for individual and system outage probabilities are first presented in closed-form. It is shown that CEE causes outage probability to remain fixed even if the channel is noiseless. Then, the symbol error rate performance for TDBC protocol with M-ary Phase Shift Keying and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation signals is analyzed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our analytical results. Furthermore, comparison of signal-to-noise ratio gap ratio shows that TDBC protocol is less sensitive to the effect of CEE than analog network coding protocol.
