Mixed-initiative planning systems are useful tools in such situations, because they can support several common activities performed in these organizations. However, as collaborative members are involved in different decision making planning levels, they consequently require different information types and forms of receiving planning information. Unfortunately, collaborative planning delivery is a subject that has not been given much attention by researchers, so that users cannot make the most of such systems since they do not have appropriate support for interaction with them. This work presents a general framework for planning information delivery, which is divided into two main parts: a knowledge representation aspect based on an ontological set and a reasoning mechanism for multimodality visualization. This framework is built on a mixed-initiative planning basis, which considers the additional requirements that the human presence brings to the development of collaborative support systems.", "paper_title": "Semantic Based Support for Planning Information Delivery in Human-agent Collaborative Teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000350211700004"}
