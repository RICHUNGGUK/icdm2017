For a visual sensor network, the visual sensors have particular characteristics such as directional sensing, limited angle of view, and line-of-sight view. Target tracking with visual sensors is different from that with scalar sensors. Moreover, the quality of sensed visual data can be much important in many applications. In this paper, the concept of Voronoi diagram is utilized for target tracking in visual sensor networks. The structure of Voronoi cells is suitable for the design of a distributed/localized algorithm and it exists a property of bisector for dividing a distance line or region. This paper proposed a Voronoi-based distributed sensor handover protocol for visual sensor networks. The simulation result shows the benefits of our proposed approach in terms of target-detected latency, target-tracked ratio, and average target distance, which indicates that the quality of target tracking service can be improved with the proposed approach for visual sensor networks.", "paper_title": "A Voronoi-Based Sensor Handover Protocol for Target Tracking in Distributed Visual Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332975100001"}
