Unlike homotopy methods, the algorithm is not based on a deformation of the system; instead, it traces real curves connecting the solutions to one system of equations to those of another, eventually leading to the desired real solutions. It also differs from homotopy methods in that it follows only real paths and computes no complex solutions to the original equations. The number of curves traced is essentially bounded above by the fewnomial bound for real solutions, and the method takes advantage of any slack in that bound.", "paper_title": "Khovanskii-Rolle Continuation for Real Solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000300097200003"}
