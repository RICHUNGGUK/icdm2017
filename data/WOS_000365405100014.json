An optimization problem is formulated to assign resources and guarantee the signal quality for every channel. Compared with the resource allocation in a fixed-grid wavelength-division multiplexing scenario, our method achieves significant bandwidth reduction and transmission distance extension in flexible-grid networks. The maximum spectrum usage is shown to be insensitive to the ordering of channels. We also analyze the relation between modulation formats and transmission distance based on the results of the proposed method. Finally, we demonstrate the performance and scalability of the proposed algorithm in ring networks.", "paper_title": "Resource Allocation for Flexible-Grid Optical Networks With Nonlinear Channel Model [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000365405100014"}
