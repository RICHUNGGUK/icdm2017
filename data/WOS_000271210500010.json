This paper presents ROMA, a practical, distributed channel assignment and routing protocol that achieves good multi-hop path performance between every node and one or more designated gateway nodes in a dual-radio network. ROMA assigns non-overlapping channels to links along each gateway path to eliminate intra-path interference. ROMA reduces inter-path interference by assigning different channels to paths destined for different gateways whenever possible. Evaluations on a 24-node dual-radio testbed show that ROMA achieves high throughput in a variety of scenarios.", "paper_title": "Practical, Distributed Channel Assignment and Routing in Dual-radio Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000271210500010"}
