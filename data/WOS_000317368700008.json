Magnetic paste is prepared from NdFeB powder and an epoxy resin, filled into lithographically defined photoresist molds or metal molds, and formed into resin-bonded magnets after curing at room temperature. A coercivity of 772.4 kA/m, a remanence of 0.27 T, and a maximum energy product of 22.6 kJ/m(3) have been achieved in an NdFeB disk micromagnet with dimensions of I broken vertical bar 200 mu mx70 mu m. Based on the developed micro-patterning of resin-bonded magnets, a fully integrated electromagnetic vibration energy harvester has been designed and fabricated. The dimensions of the energy harvester are only 4.5 mmx4.5 mmx1.0 mm, and those of the micromagnet are 1.5 mmx1.5 mmx0.2 mm. This microfabrication technique can be used for producing permanent magnets tens or hundreds of micrometers in size for use in various magnetic devices.", "paper_title": "Resin-bonded NdFeB micromagnets for integration into electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters", "paper_id": "WOS:000317368700008"}
