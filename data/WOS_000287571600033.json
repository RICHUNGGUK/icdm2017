This paper presents a two-level market solution for services composition optimization in mobile grid. All participants in the mobile grid environment including grid resources, services and users can be represented as agents. We apply economic agents to build mobile grid service management, where mobile grid service consumers and providers can buy and sell grid service based on an economic architecture. Services composition optimization is decomposed into service market level optimization and resource market level optimization. Two-level market converges to its optimal points: a globally optimal point is achieved. The system utility of mobile grid is maximized when the equilibrium prices are obtained through the service market level optimization and resource market level optimization. in the simulation, the performance evaluation of two-level market algorithm for mobile grid is conducted.
