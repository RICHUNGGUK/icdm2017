The growth of the World Wide Web and the advantages of the software technologies arising from it render this goal possible. This paper discusses how modern information technology, particularly the ISO 10303-STEP and extensible Markup Language - XML, can be utilized jointly to support the communication of different partners. An approach to support enterprise operation through efficient data exchanges, by adopting modern data modeling techniques for integration among partners worldwide and using the web as a communication layer, is described. The paper deals particularly with the ship repair industry as a case study of these problems and suggests a feasible solution. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
