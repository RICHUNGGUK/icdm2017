In order to find relevant knowledge, the user needs to rummage through the rules. To make this task easier, we propose a new interactive mining methodology based on well adapted dynamic visual representations. It allows the user to drive the discovery process by focusing his/her attention on limited subsets of rules. We have implemented our methodology with two complementary 2D and 3D visualization supports. These implementations exploit the user's focus to guide the generation of the rules by means of a specific constraint-based rule-mining algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
