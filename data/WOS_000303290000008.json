Over the years, different models have uncovered various phenomena exhibited by the system, many of which have direct impact on its performance. In this paper we identify and characterize a phenomenon that has not been previously observed: homogeneous peers (with respect to their upload capacities) experience heterogeneous download times. This behavior has direct impact on peer and system performance, such as high variability of download times, unfairness with respect to peer arrival order, bursty departures and content synchronization. Detailed packet-level simulations and prototype-based experiments on the Internet were performed to characterize this phenomenon. We also develop a mathematical model that accurately predicts the heterogeneous download rates of the homogeneous peers as a function of their content. In addition, we apply the model to calculate lower and upper bounds to the number of departures that occur in a burst. The heterogeneous download rates are more prevalent in unpopular swarms (very few peers). Although few works have addressed this kind of swarm, these by far represent the most common type of swarm in BT. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
