In the conventional multi-alternative games initiated by Bolger, each player can choose any alternative with equal possibilities. In actual social life, there exist situations in which players have some restrictions on their choice of alternatives. Considering such situations, we study restricted multi-alternative games. A value for a given game is proposed.", "paper_title": "A VALUE BASED ON MARGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR MULTI-ALTERNATIVE GAMES WITH RESTRICTED COALITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277828600004"}
