Previous research which aims to achieve JIT job completion mainly worked on static scheduling problems, in which all jobs are available from time zero or the available time of each job is known beforehand. In contrast, dynamic scheduling problems which involve continual arrival of new jobs are not much researched and dispatching rules remain the most frequently used method for such problems. However, dispatching rules are not high-performing for the JIT objective. This study proposes several routing strategies which can help dispatching rules realize JIT completion for jobs arriving dynamically in hybrid flow shops. The routing strategies are based on distributed computing which makes realtime forecast of completion times of unfinished jobs. The advantages include short computing time, quick response and robustness against disturbance. Computer simulations show that the performance of dispatching rules combined with the proposed routing strategies is significantly higher than that of dispatching rules only and that of dispatching rules combined with the previous routing methods.
