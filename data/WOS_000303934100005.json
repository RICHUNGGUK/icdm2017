Each relay node transmits the mixed signal consisting of weighted source signal and intentional noise. The problem of power allocation, the joint design of beamforming and jamming weights are investigated, and an iterative scheme is proposed. It is demonstrated by the numerical results that the proposed hybrid scheme further improves secrecy rate, as compared to traditional cooperative schemes.", "paper_title": "Increasing Secrecy Capacity via Joint Design of Cooperative Beamforming and Jamming", "paper_id": "WOS:000303934100005"}
