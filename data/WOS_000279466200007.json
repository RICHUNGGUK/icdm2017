Although the importance of consensus-building methods has been recognized in the collaborative decision support applications, there has been very little research addressing the problem of measuring consensus in the context of spatial collaborative decision-making. The main aim of this paper is to present an implementation of a consensus measuring procedure within WebGIS-based collaborative decision support tool. The collaborative tool, called Participatory-GIS.com, has been used for tackling a site-selection problem in the Town of Canmore, Alberta. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
