However, transmission failures occur frequently in the multihop transmission over wireless media. Thus, a loss recovery mechanism is required to provide end-to-end reliability. In addition, because the sensor nodes are very small devices and have insufficient resources, energy-efficient data transmission is crucial for prolonging the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. This paper proposes a transmission power control mechanism for reliable data transmission, which satisfies communication reliability through recovery of lost packets. The proposed method calculates packet reception rate (PRR) of each hop to maintain end-to-end packet delivery rate (PDR), which is determined based on the desired communication reliability. Then, the transmission power is adjusted based on the PRR to reduce energy consumption. The proposed method was evaluated through extensive simulations, and the results show that it leads to more energy-efficient data transmission compared to existing methods.", "paper_title": "Transmission Power Control with the Guaranteed Communication Reliability in WSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000363580200001"}
