Data streams coming from sensors are inherently noisy, imprecise and inaccurate, with differing sampling rates and complex correlations with each other. These characteristics pose a significant challenge for traditional approaches to storing, representing, exchanging, manipulating and programming with sensor data. Semantic Web technologies provide a uniform framework for capturing these properties. Offering powerful representation facilities and reasoning techniques, these technologies are rapidly gaining attention towards facing a range of issues such as data and knowledge modelling, querying, reasoning, service discovery, privacy and provenance. This article reviews the application of the Semantic Web to pervasive and sensor-driven systems with a focus on information modelling and reasoning along with streaming data and uncertainty handling. The strengths and weaknesses of current and projected approaches are analysed and a roadmap is derived for using the Semantic Web as a platform, on which open, standard-based, pervasive, adaptive and sensor-driven systems can be deployed.
