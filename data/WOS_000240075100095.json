The efficacy of the model in kernel machines depends on the distance between the unknown true function and the linear subspace, specified by the training data set, of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space corresponding to an adopted kernel. In this paper, we propose a framework for the model selection of kernel-based learning machines, incorporating a class of kernels with an invariant metric.", "paper_title": "Model selection using a class of Kernels with an invariant metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100095"}
