In comparison with conventional fuzzy controllers, this approach takes the advantages of evolutionary strategy, fuzzy control, and PSO, thereby obtaining better population diversity, avoiding premature convergence, and achieving self-adaptive redundant control. This hybrid computing is then applied to develop an optimal fuzzy controller of redundant wheeled robots. The optimal parameters of the dynamic controller are self-adaptive via the proposed FC-ESPSO to resolve trajectory-tracking problem. Simulation results are given to exhibit the merits of the proposed FC-ESPSO than other related control methods for redundant wheeled robots.", "paper_title": "Optimal Fuzzy Controller Design Using an Evolutionary Strategy-Based Particle Swarm Optimization for Redundant Wheeled Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000360706100004"}
