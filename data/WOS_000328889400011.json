In this paper we use randomization to overcome this problem in the multi-unit auction setting. In particular, we construct a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for multi-unit auctions that is truthful in expectation, whereas there is evidence that no polynomial-time truthful deterministic mechanism provides an approximation ratio better than 2. We leverage the FPTAS to show for the first time that truthful in expectation polynomial-time mechanisms are provably stronger than polynomial-time universally truthful mechanisms. Specifically, we show that there is a setting, related to multi-unit auctions, in which (1) there is a nonpolynomial time truthful mechanism that always outputs the optimal solution, and that (2) no universally truthful randomized mechanism can provide an approximation ratio better than 2 in polynomial time, but (3) an FPTAS that is truthful in expectation exists.", "paper_title": "ON THE POWER OF RANDOMIZATION IN ALGORITHMIC MECHANISM DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000328889400011"}
