A flexible, low latency, and high capacity recycling-fiber-delay-line (Rec-FDL) based collision resolution mechanism is proposed with higher switching efficiency for burst services than that by the conventional packet retransmission algorithm (C-PRA). The system performances, including stability, blocking rate (BR), and longest packets waiting latency (LPWL) are analyzed. The simulation shows that the system stability condition for the Rec-FDL mechanism is the new packet arriving rate lambda less than 30x10(6) packets/s. In addition, the BR and Rec-FDL induced LPWL are 0.1235-0.1413 and 6.305 ns-7.651 ns, respectively, with increasing the number of CPUs connected to the system from 4 to 16,384, while the increment for LPWL induced by the conventional algorithm is 3.9 ns at the same conditions as above. Therefore, the mechanism presented here is more beneficial for the system scalability and has higher latency reducing abilities than the C-PRA.", "paper_title": "Contention resolution mechanisms for asynchronous optical packet switching based high performance computing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000280650400005"}
