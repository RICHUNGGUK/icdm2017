An interference detection method is proposed. Using this, distance between bodies can be determined during simulation, without having to solve a system of nonlinear equations. The approach is illustrated by simulating a cam-follower mechanism. Impact is modelled using nonlinear compliance at the point of contact, and friction is modelled as Coulomb's friction. Numerical integration is partially validated using energy balance. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
