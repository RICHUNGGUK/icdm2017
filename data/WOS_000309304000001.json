These basis functions generate S-lambda curves. We show that S-lambda curves include Bezier curves, Poisson curves, rational Bezier curves and a lot of other curves. Therefore the research in this paper provides a unified scheme for dealing with these well-known curves. We study some important properties of the S-lambda basis functions and S-lambda curves. Furthermore, by means of the technique of generating functions, a new convenient and practical method for local changes of S-lambda curves is proposed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
