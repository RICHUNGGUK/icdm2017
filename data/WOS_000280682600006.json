The advantage of using the Boussinesq-type-like equations with the reference velocity is to provide an analytical-based non-hydrostatic pressure distribution at the top-layer and to optimize wave dispersion property. The sigma-based non-hydrostatic model naturally tackles the so-called overshooting issue in the case of non-linear steep waves. Efficiency and accuracy of this non-hydrostatic model in terms of wave dispersion and nonlinearity are critically examined. Overall results show that the newly developed model using a few layers is capable of resolving the evolution of non-linear deep-water wave groups.
