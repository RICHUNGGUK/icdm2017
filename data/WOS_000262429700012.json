On the basis of existing results on nondegenerate equilibria in mathematics, we further discuss degenerate equilibria for such networks and present properties and distributions of the equilibria, which enables us to draw the coexistence conditions of nondegenerate and degenerate equilibria (e.g., singular lines). Our theoretical results provide a useful framework for precise tuning on the network parameters, e.g., the feedbacks and visual inputs. Simulations are also presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Continuous Attractors for 2-D Linear Threshold Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429700012"}
