The new method incorporates derivative constraints on the interference DOA (direction of arrival) into power minimization approach, which could broaden the width of nulls in the interferences directions and adapt to the rapid change of the interference directions. Compared with the traditional wide nulling algorithm based on the derivative constraints, the new method does not have to know or estimate the DOAs of the desired signal and the interference. The new method is firstly discussed in the context of spatial processing, and then extended to space-time adaptive processing to mitigate wideband diffusive multipath interference. Effectiveness of the new method is verified via simulation examples.", "paper_title": "Power minimization with derivative constraints for high dynamic GPS interference suppression", "paper_id": "WOS:000301568200013"}
