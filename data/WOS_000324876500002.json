To realize SETs, a binary decision diagram-based SET array is proposed as a suitable candidate for implementing Boolean circuits. Then, some works started developing computer-aided design techniques for this new architecture. However, most of them focused on the development of mapping techniques. How to verify the mapping results is still an open problem. Thus, in this paper, we address this problem and develop a satisfiability (SAT)-based verification method. We propose a transformation approach to model the functionality of a mapped SET array as a conjunctive normal form formula. Then, the problem that whether the SET array is functionally equivalent to its specification circuit can be solved with a SAT solver. The experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully verify correct and incorrect SET array implementations with reasonable verification time.", "paper_title": "Verification of Reconfigurable Binary Decision Diagram-Based Single-Electron Transistor Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000324876500002"}
