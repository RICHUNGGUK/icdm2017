It allows the exact evaluation of the regularized union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference simultaneously. Moreover, this approach is simpler than other methods, including those that provide an approximate evaluation or only a rendering of the result. It is based on a simple data structure and on the use of an octree which facilitates the division of the geometry into subsets for distribution among several threads, and accelerates the spatial queries needed during the process. This method is designed to be used in a multithreaded environment and it can also be implemented using an out-of-core approach. We also present some experimental results, and a comparison with other systems that also provide an exact evaluation of the Boolean operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
