More precisely, we focus our interest on a software cost estimation problem, which includes predicting the effort required to develop a software system basing on values of cost factors. The case study of analysing the COCOMO data set, containing descriptions of representative historical projects, allows us to discuss how this approach could be used to: identify the most discriminatory cost factors, extract meaningful rule representation of classification knowledge from data, construct accurate rule based classifiers.", "paper_title": "An empirical study of using rule induction and rough sets to software cost estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239251300007"}
