In this work, we describe the development of a virtual reality interface for use in operating a combine while harvesting virtual crops. Using the actual combine cab hardware for control input commands and operational displays, we provide a virtual farm that allows the operator to operate every aspect of the combine while using the true set of buttons, levers, and switches for a realistic driving experience. This simulator is designed primarily for operator training on the adjustment and operation of the machine controls, the use of automatic guidance systems, and interaction with the precision farming automation systems. However, the simulator is also applicable for engineering design development, where new control modes and hardware could be assessed in a virtual environment.", "paper_title": "GREENSPACE: Virtual Reality Interface for Combine Operator Training", "paper_id": "WOS:000309029000001"}
