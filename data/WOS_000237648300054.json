This can be exploited by the adversaries to launch a new kind of attack specific to SSO systems. In this paper, we propose the Weakest Link Attack, which is a kind of parallel session attack feasible in the above settings. Our attack enables adversaries to succeed at all levels of authentication associate to the victim user by breaking only at the weakest one. We present a detailed case study of our attack on web SSO as specified in Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) V2.0, an OASIS standard released in March, 2005. We also suggest the corresponding repair at the end of the paper.(1)", "paper_title": "Weakest link attack on single sign-on and its case in SAML V2.0 web SSO", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300054"}
