The primary channel between primary transmitter and primary receiver is under Rayleigh fading. The secondary interference channel between secondary transmitter and primary receiver is under Rice fading. By employing various factors, such as the spectrum sensing scheme and the spatial distribution of the secondary users, the proposed model gives an accurate expression of interference probability compared to the statistical models that just approximate the probability model of the interference or bounds models that aim at finding the bounds of the interference. The proposed probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and the mean and variance of interference can be extended to a number of applications including power control, spectrum sensing evaluation, secondary users density analysis, and setting interference toleration threshold. Moreover, the framework developed in this paper can be applied to the interference analysis for the nodes of cognitive networks distributed in irregular geographical shapes like finite or infinite zone. The simulation result verifies our theory and is in agreement with the expectation.", "paper_title": "Interference of Cognitive Wireless Networks on Rayleigh and Rice Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000333838500001"}
