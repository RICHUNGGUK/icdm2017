In this paper, we focus on the feature weighting problem in a specific machine learning area: multiple-instance learning, and propose maximum margin multiple-instance feature weighting (M3IFW) to seek large classification margins in the weighted feature space. The designed M3IFW algorithm can be applied to both standard binary-class multiple-instance learning and the corresponding multi-class learning, and we abbreviate them to B-M3IFW (binary-class M3IFW) and M-M3IFW (multi-class M3IFW), respectively. Both B-M3IFW and M-M3IFW contain three kinds of unknown variables, i.e., positive prototypes, classification margins, and weighting coefficients. We utilize the coordinate ascent algorithm to update the three kinds of unknown variables, respectively and iteratively, and then perform classifications in the weighted feature space. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of M3IFW in improving classification accuracies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
