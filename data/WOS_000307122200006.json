In contrast to the traditional approaches, a hybrid system with HMMs and GMMs was employed for data classification. A hybrid approach using multi-leads, i.e., lead-V1, V2, V3 and V4 for myocardial infarction were developed and HMMs were used not only to find the ECG segmentations but also to calculate the log-likelihood value which was treated as statistical feature data of each heartbeat's ECG complex. The 4-dimension feature vector extracted by HMMs was clustered by GMMs with different numbers of distribution (disease and normal data). SVMs classifier was also examined for comparison with our system in experimental result. There were total 1129 samples of heartbeats from clinical data, including 582 data with myocardial infarction and 547 normal data. The sensitivity of this diagnosis system achieved 85.71%, specificity achieved 79.82% and accuracy achieved 82.50% statistically. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
