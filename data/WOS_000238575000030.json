Meetings are recorded through a collaborative writing environment specially designed to capture participants activities. This information, usually lost in common recordings of multimodal meetings, offers novel possibilities for indexing, navigation and information retrieval in archived meetings. Meeting Miner uses temporal information from the logs of actions captured on self-contained information items (paragraphs of text) to uncover potential information links between these semantic data units. A novel space-based action navigation scheme is presented. Keywords and topic search as well as more advanced queries can be performed by the system. We illustrate the system navigation modalities with several browsing examples.", "paper_title": "Navigating multimodal meeting recordings with the meeting miner", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000030"}
