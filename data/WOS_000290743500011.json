We focus on the model of learning with queries, and study a restriction of the class of k-quasiHorn formulas, that is, conjunctive normal form formulas where the number of unnegated literals per clause is at most k. This class is known to be as hard to learn as the general class CNF of conjunctive normal form formulas. By imposing some constraints, we define a fragment of this logic that can be learned using only membership queries. Also we prove that none of these constraints makes by itself the class learnable.
