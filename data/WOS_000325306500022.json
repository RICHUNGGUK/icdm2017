It aims for an unified and generic notation. Design/methodology/approach - The coupled formulation is derived rigorously using the concept of winding functions. Strong and weak coupling approaches are proposed and examples are given. Discretization methods of the partial differential equations and in particular the winding functions are discussed. Reasons for instabilities in the numerical time domain simulation of the coupled formulation are presented using results from differential-algebraic-index analysis. Findings - This paper establishes a unified notation for different conductor models, e.g. solid, stranded and foil conductors and shows their structural equivalence. The structural information explains numerical instabilities in the case of current excitation. Originality/value - The presentation of winding functions allows to generically describe the coupling, embed the circuit equations into the de Rham complex and visualize them by Tonti diagrams. This is of value for scientists interested in differential geometry and engineers that work in the field of numerical simulation of field-circuit coupled problems.", "paper_title": "Winding functions in transient magnetoquasistatic field-circuit coupled simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000325306500022"}
