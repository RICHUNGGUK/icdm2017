Anatomical keeled and pegged prosthesis as well as reversed prosthesis were the studied implants. The bone models were built based on computed tomography (CT) images and using a computer aided design-based modelling pipeline. The finite element method was used to solve the contact problem between the surface of the polyethylene (PE) components and the corresponding articular component. The aim of this work was to determine linear and volumetric PE wear, for several radial mismatches, in conditions of pathological (rheumatoid arthritis) and non-pathological bone. Results showed that contact pressures and linear wear developed in anatomical prosthesis were higher than those visualised in reversed prosthesis. However, anatomical prosthesis exhibited a better volumetric wear performance. Moreover, our findings indicated higher values of volumetric wear in higher congruent models and on pathological bone conditions.", "paper_title": "Wear analysis in anatomical and reversed shoulder prostheses", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434100005"}
