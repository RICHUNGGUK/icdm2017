Under the ICN paradigm, an end user only needs to care about what he wants but not where it is. Then many clean-slate proposals have been proposed under this principle. Of them, two common content naming schemes are used: one is flat and the other one is hierarchical. Based on different naming schemes, different content addressing schemes are designed with different features accordingly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid content naming scheme and the corresponding content addressing scheme to take their advantages simultaneously. In the proposed scheme, the core network and the access network are completely separated by their different functions and the edge router is used for the name mapping and content caching. In this way, the stability of the core network can be guaranteed and the end user can be served in an efficient way. Besides, the security transmission and user privacy can be well guaranteed. We also design a backward-compatible architecture based on this novel idea so that the ICN benefits can be preserved even when it is deployed in a small-scale environment. Based on the proposed model, the performance of our proposed scheme under two scenarios are investigated and compared with that in basic PURSUIT and CCN cases. The numerical results demonstrate the efficiency improvements of our proposed scheme under different cases and it will be a promising architecture in the ICN world.", "paper_title": "Scalable and Secure Information-Centric Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000327912200001"}
