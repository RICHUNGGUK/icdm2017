The bumpy properties of an object are determined by height maps. But in the process of generating height maps, a problem arises, i.e. to get a correct value of the pixel height, empirical data should be calculated repeatedly, which proves very complicated, and meanwhile the realistic rendering effect is reduced, because the bumpy property is exaggerated in the height map. Therefore, in this paper, we present a method for describing the details of the bumpy texture, where a new concept \"bumpy map\" is introduced to replace the height map. Experimental results demonstrate that the bumpy details produced by the \"bumpy map\" are more consistent with the original bumpy texture than by the method of height map.", "paper_title": "An improved description method of the bumpy texture", "paper_id": "WOS:000264106500012"}
