The proposed approach consists in generating a mesh in computational space for a generic configuration of the moving body. The management of body and mesh motion is carried out in computational space using a sliding mesh paradigm. The mesh in physical space is obtained through PDE mapping operators. Two mapping operators and two discretization techniques are implemented, validated and compared. The overall methodology is applied to complex geometric configurations representative of engineering applications. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
