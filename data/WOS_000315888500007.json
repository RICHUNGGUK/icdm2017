Recently, functional models of these networks have been suggested, ranging from Boolean to constraint-based methods. However, learning such models from large-scale data remains a formidable task, and most modeling approaches rely on extensive human curation. Here we provide a generic approach to learning Boolean models automatically from data. We apply our approach to growth and inflammatory signaling systems in humans and show how the learning phase can improve the fit of the model to experimental data, remove spurious interactions, and lead to better understanding of the system at hand.", "paper_title": "Reconstructing Boolean Models of Signaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000315888500007"}
