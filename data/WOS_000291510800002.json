Then only the cooperation of all the signers in the proxy group can generate the proxy signatures on behalf of the original signer. Recently, Cao and Cao gave the first formal definition and security model of an identity-based multi-proxy signature scheme, then proposed an identity-based multi-proxy signature scheme from bilinear pairings and proved its security in their security model. Although they proved that their scheme is secure under this model, we disprove their claim and show that their scheme is not secure. We also present a simple fix to prevent this attack.
