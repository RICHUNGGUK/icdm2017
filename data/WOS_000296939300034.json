However, they are unable to do that wirelessly in a real-time fashion due to the insufficient network bandwidth or transmission quality. In this paper, we proposed a system model for mobile users to perform the up-streaming of their videos. The users can upstream their real-time videos through their mobile devices and wireless network technology. Due to the various network conditions and video quality, we proposed the multiple profiles upstream function. We provided adaptive forward error correction (AFEC) codes, automatic repeat request (ARQ) and unequal loss protection (ULP) for selection base on the hardware capability and the network states to ensure the quality of service (QoS). Finally, we used NS-2 as simulation tool to verify our scheme.", "paper_title": "A CROSS-LAYER APPROACH OF MULTIMEDIA UP-STREAMING TO ENSURE QOS IN WIMAX", "paper_id": "WOS:000296939300034"}
