A lot of effort has been undertaken to model such multianticipative driving behavior using a macroscopic approach, which is useful for real-time prediction and control applications due to its fast computational demand. However, these macroscopic models have increasingly failed with an increased number of anticipations. To this end, this article puts forward derivation of an improved macroscopic model for multianticipative driving behavior using a modified gas-kinetic approach. First, the basic (microscopic) generalized force model, which has been claimed to fit well with real traffic data, is chosen for the derivation. Second, the derivation method relaxes the condition that deceleration happens instantaneously. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the model are carried out to show the improved performance of the derived model over the existing (multianticipative) macroscopic models.", "paper_title": "Multianticipative Nonlocal Macroscopic Traffic Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000332054800002"}
