This paper presents a Conscientious Rival Penalized Competitive Learning (CRPCL) text clustering algorithm, which uses LSA to reduce the dimensionality and improves RPCL to set a conscientious threshold to restrict a winner that won too many times and to make every neural unit win the competition at near ideal probability. The experiments demonstrate good performance of this method.", "paper_title": "A conscientious rival penalized competitive learning text clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000186"}
