In a laser scan of such a scene, these simple shapes can still be identified. We present a one-parameter algorithm that can identify point sets on a plane for which a rectangle is a fitting boundary. These rectangles have a guaranteed density: no large part of the rectangle is empty of points. We prove that our algorithm identifies all angles for which a rectangle fits the point set of size n in O(nlogn) time. We evaluate our method experimentally on 13 urban data sets and we compare the rectangles found by our algorithm to the a-shape as a surface boundary. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
