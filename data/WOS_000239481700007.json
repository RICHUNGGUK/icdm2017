Our approach is constructed on the basis of comparison of mean and standard deviation of fuzzy numbers. In this approach, the first phase maximizes the possibilistic mean value of fuzzy objective function and obtains a set of feasible solutions. The second phase minimizes the standard deviation of the original fuzzy objective function, by considering all basic feasible solutions obtained at the end of the first phase. The advantage of the proposed approach is its simplicity in programming and computation. Moreover, we also generalize the concept of linear programming duality and extend the duality as well as the weak duality theory to FFLP.", "paper_title": "Fully fuzzified linear programming, solution and duality", "paper_id": "WOS:000239481700007"}
