We see that the application of information-theoretic concepts to networks leads to interesting tasks and gives a possibility for understanding information processing in networks. The main contribution of this article is a method for determining the structural information content of graphs that is based on a tree decomposition. It turns out that the computational complexity of the underlying algorithm is polynomial. Finally, we present some numerical results to study the influence of the used methods on the resulting information contents.", "paper_title": "Information-theoretic concepts for the analysis of complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258905000003"}
