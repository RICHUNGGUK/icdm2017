Using a node addressing scheme based on the EJ number system, we give a shortest path routing algorithm for hexagonal mesh networks. We also extend the known efficient one-to-all broadcasting algorithm on hexagonal mesh networks to algorithms for one-to-one personalized broadcasting, all-to-all broadcasting, and all-to-all personalized broadcasting algorithms. Their time complexity and optimality are analyzed.", "paper_title": "Efficient Communication Algorithms in Hexagonal Mesh Interconnection Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297352200009"}
