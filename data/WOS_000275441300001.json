They provide many advantages over electric motors, including high force to weight ratio, fast response time and compact size. However, precise control of electro-hydraulic systems, due to their inherent nonlinear characteristics, cannot be easily obtained with conventional linear controllers. Most flow control valves can also exhibit some hard nonlinearities such as dead-zone due to valve spool overlap. This work describes the development of an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller for an electro-hydraulic system with unknown dead-zone. The boundedness and convergence properties of the closed-loop signals are proven using Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat's lemma. Numerical results are presented in order to demonstrate the control system performance.", "paper_title": "Sliding Mode Control with Adaptive Fuzzy Dead-Zone Compensation of an Electro-hydraulic Servo-System", "paper_id": "WOS:000275441300001"}
