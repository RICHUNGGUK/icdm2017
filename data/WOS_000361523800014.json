From parent's perspective, the ideal scenario would be one in which they could dynamically decide about the suitability of any content. Since this desired scenario entails many practical problems, we propose an intermediate solution where parents delegate the decision of blocking any piece of TV content on a trustworthy set of parents. Our approach provides a collaborative parental control model based on two pillar: (1) a parenting social network where parents interact, freely give their opinion about TV content and tag this content (collaborative tagging); and (2) a model of trust relationship between parents. Regarding the deployment of parental control, we introduce a parental monitoring system for DVB-IPTV content, which is based on social technologies. The proposal combines information from the service provider and from parents in a social network to predict whether content should be blocked.", "paper_title": "IPTV parental control: A collaborative model for the Social Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000361523800014"}
