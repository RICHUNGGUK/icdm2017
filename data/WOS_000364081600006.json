We consider weaker notions of reducibility, including the so-called Lambda(0)(alpha)-reductions, and try to find for various natural topological spaces X the least ordinal alpha(X) such that for every alpha(X) <= beta < omega(1) the degree-structure induced on X by the Delta(0)(beta)-reductions is simple (i.e. similar to the Wadge hierarchy on the Baire space). We show that alpha(X) <= omega for every quasi-Polish space X, that alpha(X) <= 3 for quasi-Polish spaces of dimension not equal infinity, and that this last bound is in fact optimal for many (quasi-) Polish spaces, including the real line and its powers.", "paper_title": "Wadge-like reducibilities on arbitrary quasi-Polish spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000364081600006"}
