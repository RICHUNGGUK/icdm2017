Yield improvement is the most challenging part of COF manufacturing in view of its processing complexity, mainly in the screen-printing process. The process parameters such as ink capacity, origin control distance, angle of the squeezer, method of mixing, freshness of ink, speed of printing, and speed of scraper are considered to improve the pinholes. In Taguchi method, a two level orthogonal array is used to determine the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. Analysis of variance and the F-test values are used to determine the most significant process parameters affecting the pinholes. Confirmation analysis tests with the optimal levels of process parameters are carried out. The results of the experiment show that Taguchi method is a very suitable approach with regard to solving quality problems related to such pinholes.
