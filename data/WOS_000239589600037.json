We initiate an investigation of the encounter of ML with QIP by defining and studying novel learning tasks that correspond to Machine Learning in a world in which the information is fundamentally quantum mechanical. We shall see that this paradigm shift has a profound impact on the learning process and that our classical intuition is often challenged.", "paper_title": "Machine Learning in a quantum world", "paper_id": "WOS:000239589600037"}
