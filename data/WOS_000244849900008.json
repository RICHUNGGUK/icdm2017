Then there is a bipartition of V into two classes A and B so that, for both i = 1, 2, we have eG(i) (A, B) >= m(i)/2 - root(m(i)) over bar. This gives an approximate answer to a question of Bollobas and Scott. We also prove results about partitions into more than two vertex classes. Our proofs yield polynomial algorithms.", "paper_title": "Maximizing several cuts simultaneously", "paper_id": "WOS:000244849900008"}
