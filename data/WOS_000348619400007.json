In this study, we calculated the potential of mean force for the degradation of A beta 42 by IDE in the presence and absence of ATP by umbrella sampling with hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, using the SCC-DFTB QM Hamiltonian and Amber ff99SB force field. Results indicate that the reaction occurs in two steps: The first step is characterized by the formation of the intermediate. The second step is characterized by breaking the peptide bond of the substrate, the latter being the rate-determining step. In our simulations, the activation energy barrier in the absence of ATP is 15 +/- 2 kcal mol(-1), which is 7 kcal mol(-1) lower than in the presence of ATP, indicating that the presence of the nucleotide decreases the reaction rate by about 10(5) times.", "paper_title": "QM/MM Simulations of Amyloid-beta 42 Degradation by IDE in the Presence and Absence of ATP", "paper_id": "WOS:000348619400007"}
