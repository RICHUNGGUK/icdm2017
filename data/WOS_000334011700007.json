An orientation of G is a Pfaffian orientation if every nice cycle of G has an odd number of edges directed in either direction of the cycle. A graph is Pfaffian if it has a Pfaffian orientation. If a graph is Pfaffian, then the number of perfect matchings of it can be computed in polynomial time. In this paper, we focus on a special type of 1-extendable bipartite graph with maximum degree Delta(G) = vertical bar V(G)vertical bar/2. We characterize some properties of Pfaffian graphs in this type. According to the properties, we find an algorithm in time O(vertical bar E(G)vertical bar(2)) to determine whether a graph G in this type is Pfaffian or not. Furthermore, if G is Pfaffian, this algorithm also constructs a Pfaffian orientation of it. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
