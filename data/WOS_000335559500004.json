Efficient routing algorithms have received considerable attention in previous studies for achieving the required efficiency, but these methods do not pay close attention to coverage, which is one of the most important Quality of Service parameters in wireless sensor networks. Suitable route selection for transferring information received from the environment to the sink plays crucial role in the network lifetime. The proposed method tries to select an efficient route for transferring the information. This paper reviews efficient routing algorithms for preserving k-coverage in a sensor network and then proposes an effective technique for preserving k-coverage and the reliability of data with logical fault tolerance. It is assumed that the network nodes are aware of their residual energy and that of their neighbors. Sensors are first categorized into two groups, coverage and communicative nodes, and some are then re-categorized as clustering and dynamic nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides greater efficiency energy consumption.", "paper_title": "An efficient routing algorithm to preserve -coverage in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000335559500004"}
