These regions are relatively less influenced by the deformations that are caused by facial expressions. The extracted features revealed to be efficient and robust in the presence of facial expressions. A region-based histogram descriptor computed from these features is used to uniquely represent a 3D face. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then trained as a classifier based on the proposed histogram descriptors to recognize any test face. In order to combine the contributions of the two facial regions (eyes-forehead and nose), both feature-level and score-level fusion schemes have been tested and compared. The proposed approach has been tested on FRGC v2.0 and BU-3DFE datasets through a number of experiments and a high recognition performance was achieved. Based on the results of \"neutral vs. non-neutral\" experiment of FRGC v2.0 and \"low-intensity vs. high-intensity\" experiment of BU-3DFE, the feature-level fusion scheme achieved verification rates of 97.6% and 98.2% at 0.1% False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and identification rates of 95.6% and 97.7% on the two datasets respectively. The experimental results also have shown that the feature-level fusion scheme outperformed the score-level fusion one. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
