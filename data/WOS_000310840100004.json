This study focuses on amateur blogs, which are the major customers for blog service providers (BSPs). The purposes are to investigate the antecedents of continuous blog sharing and determine whether they change with gender, age, and blog experience differences. Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework and related social-psychological foundations, this study proposes outcome expectancy of financial capital, knowledge capital, and social capital, perceived usability, social influence, self-disclosure, and information literacy as the antecedents of continuous blog sharing. A survey of 268 blog authors reveals that usability is a necessary condition for continuous blog sharing. Outcome expectancy for knowledge capital and social capital can encourage continuous sharing behaviour, but expectancy for financial capital does not. Meanwhile, blog sharing is primarily a personal endeavour facilitated by inner self-disclosure, not extrinsic information literacy or social influence. In addition, the antecedents differ according to gender, age, and blog experience differences.", "paper_title": "Experience differences and continuance intention of blog sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000310840100004"}
