This survey focuses on some aspects of estimation and decision fusion. In estimation fusion, we discuss the development of fusion architectures and algorithms with emphasis on the cross-correlation between local estimates from different sources. On the other hand, the techniques for decision fusion are discussed with emphasis on the classifier combining techniques. In addition, methods using neural networks for data fusion are briefly discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
