The relationships between vibration and noise reduction levels at resonance frequency and rotor speed are presented. Moreover, it is shown that a large damping factor will lead to smaller vibration reduction level with AVC while, in contrast, a large resonance frequency will increase the vibration reduction level. Both finite element analyses and experiments were carried out on a prototype 8/6 SRM to validate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Analysis of vibration reduction level in an 8/6 switched reluctance machine by active vibration cancellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000282324700008"}
