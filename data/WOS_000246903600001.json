The subsystem includes only two variables, exposed class E(t) and infectious class I(t) in free block of a community, but they are the main source of SARS epidemics spread. We proved mathematically that a maximum quarantine/isolation measures for them would reduce SARS epidemics to minimum extent in minimum time according to Pontryagin's minimum principle. Finally, the numerical simulations are given, and the results are satisfied.", "paper_title": "Optimal control of SARS epidemics based on cybernetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000246903600001"}
