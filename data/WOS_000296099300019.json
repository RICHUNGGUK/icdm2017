The key issue for bolstering performance is the variance setting for the bolstering kernel. Heretofore, this variance has been determined in a non-parametric manner from the data. Although bolstering based on this variance setting works well for small feature sets, results can deteriorate for high-dimensional feature spaces. Results: This article computes an optimal kernel variance depending on the classification rule, sample size, model and feature space, both the original number and the number remaining after feature selection. A key point is that the optimal variance is robust relative to the model. This allows us to develop a method for selecting a suitable variance to use in real-world applications where the model is not known, but the other factors in determining the optimal kernel are known.", "paper_title": "High-dimensional bolstered error estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296099300019"}
