This class includes Ising models with homogeneous pairwise potentials but arbitrary (inhomogeneous) unary potentials. Similarly, the partition function and marginal probabilities can be computed in polynomial time for random fields on complete bipartite graphs, provided they have homogeneous pairwise potentials. We expect that these tractable classes of large-scale random fields can be very useful for the evaluation of approximation algorithms by providing exact error estimates.", "paper_title": "A Class of Random Fields on Complete Graphs with Tractable Partition Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000322029000019"}
