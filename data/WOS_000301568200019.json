This approach focuses on handling attributes and state relations, and permitting users and services to operate over them, i.e., read/write their data values and compare them according to a dense state order. We show that the reliability-aware synthesis problem for the specification is EXPTIME-complete and we give an exponential-time algorithm (CSM-NSA) which for a given formula psi and a synthesis model, synthesizes available services in the library satisfying psi over the synthesis model (if they exist) or responds with \"not satisfiable\" (otherwise). The specification psi is a fragment of PCTL (probabilistic computation tree logic), obtained from \"ordinary\" CTL (computation tree logic) by replacing the EX, AX, EU and AU operation with their quantitative counterparts X (> p) , X (=1), U (> p) , and U (=1), respectively. As opposed to NSA, we provide a more effective algorithm to replace the NSA algorithm called CSM-HSA (heuristic synthesis algorithm). Though HSA is an incomplete algorithm, the answer is correct. The experiments show that the HSA algorithm solves the problem of reliability-aware service synthesis effectively and efficiently.", "paper_title": "Reliability-aware automatic composition approach for web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000301568200019"}
