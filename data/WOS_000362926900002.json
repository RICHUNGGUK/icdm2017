In situations where I(phi) can be approximated by an estimate of the form N-1 Sigma(N-1)(n=0) phi(Xn), with {x(n)}(n=0)(N-1) a point set in [0, 1)(s), it is now well known that the O-p(N-1/2) Monte Carlo convergence rate can be improved by taking for {x(n)}(n=0)(N-1) the first N = lambda b(m) points, lambda is an element of (1, ..., b - 1), of a scrambled (t, s)-sequence in base b >= 2. In this paper we derive a bound for the variance of-scrambled net quadrature rules which is of order O(N-1) without any restriction on N. As a corollary, this bound allows us to provide simple conditions to get, for any pattern of N, an integration error of size O-p(N-1/2) for functions that depend on the quadrature size N. Notably, we establish that sequential quasi-Monte Carlo (Gerber & Chopin, 2015) reaches the O-p(N-1/2) convergence rate for any values of N. In a numerical study, we show that for scrambled net quadrature rules we can relax the constraint on N without any loss of efficiency when the integrand phi is a discontinuous function while, for sequential quasi-Monte Carlo, taking N = lambda b(m) may only provide moderate gains.
