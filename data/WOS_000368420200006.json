An (n, q(k), n - k + 1)(q) code is called a maximum distance separable (MDS) code. In this paper, some MDS codes over small alphabets are classified. It is shown that every (k + d - 1, q(k), d)(q) code with k >= 3, d >= 3, q is an element of{5, 7} is equivalent to a linear code with the same parameters. This implies that the (6, 5(4), 3)(5) code and the (n, 7(n-2), 3)(7) MDS codes for n is an element of{6, 7, 8} are unique. The classification of one-error-correcting 8-ary MDS codes is also finished; there are 14, 8, 4, and 4 equivalence classes of (n, 8(n-2), 3)(8) codes for n = 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. One of the equivalence classes of perfect (9, 8(7), 3)(8) codes corresponds to the Hamming code and the other three are nonlinear codes for which there exists no previously known construction.", "paper_title": "On the Classification of MDS Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000368420200006"}
