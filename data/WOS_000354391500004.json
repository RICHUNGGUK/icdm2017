No prior information about the shape is available, so the inverse problem is classified as function estimation. Least square method is used to model the inverse problem, which intends to minimize the difference between measured and calculated data. Considering ill-posedness of the inverse problem, Tikhonov regularization method is used to stabilize the solution. The numerical results show that the proposed hybrid method is able to recover the boundary shape, and can sharply reduce the required computation time. While considering the oscillations at the both boundaries of the estimated results, the parallel QPSO is used in order to both obtain better estimation and reduce computation time.", "paper_title": "Identification of boundary shape using a hybrid approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000354391500004"}
