Network alignment performs comparative analysis across multiple PPI networks to understand their connections and relationships. However, PPI data in high-throughput experiments still suffer from significant false-positive and false-negatives rates. Consequently, high-confidence network alignment across entire PPI networks is not possible. At best, local network alignment attempts to alleviate this problem by completely ignoring low-confidence mappings; global network alignment, on the other hand, pairs all proteins regardless. To this end, we propose an alternative strategy: instead of full alignment across the entire network or completely ignoring low-confidence regions, we aim to perform highly specific proteinto-protein alignments where data confidence is high, and fall back on broader functional region-to-region alignment where detailed protein-protein alignment cannot be ascertained. The basic idea is to provide an alignment of multiple granularities to allow biological predictions at varying specificity. Results: DualAligner performs dual network alignment, in which both region-to-region alignment, where whole subgraph of one network is aligned to subgraph of another, and protein-to-protein alignment, where individual proteins in networks are aligned to one another, are performed to achieve higher accuracy network alignments. Dual network alignment is achieved in DualAligner via background information provided by a combination of Gene Ontology annotation information and protein interaction network data. We tested DualAligner on the global networks from IntAct and demonstrated the superiority of our approach compared with state-of-the-art network alignment methods. We studied the effects of parameters in DualAligner in controlling the quality of the alignment. We also performed a case study that illustrates the utility of our approach.", "paper_title": "DualAligner: a dual alignment-based strategy to align protein interaction networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342913000011"}
