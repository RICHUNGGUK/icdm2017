First, the 2-D Gauss-Lobatto grid on the square [-1,1] x [-1,1] is mapped to a triangular domain by means of a singular mapping. A singularity subtraction technique is used to account for the most singular terms of the asymptotic expansions near the top corners of the flow. The unsteady Navier-Stokes equations in the vorticity-streamfunction formulation are then solved in this transformed grid using an influence matrix technique. A third order Adams Bashforth/Backward differentiation method appears to provide excellent numerical stability for the scheme and also permits a larger critical time step. Detailed characteristics of the flow and comparisons with published results are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
