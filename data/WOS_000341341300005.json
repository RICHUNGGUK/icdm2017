We use phase models to study the dynamics of neurons and derive charge-balanced controls that achieve the minimum and maximum interspike times for a given bound on the control amplitude. Our derivation is valid for any arbitrary shape of the phase response curve and for any value of the given control amplitude bound. In addition, we characterize the change in the structures of the charge-balanced time-optimal controls with the allowable control amplitude. We demonstrate the applicability of the derived optimal control laws by applying them to mathematically ideal and experimentally observed neuron phase models, including the widely studied Hodgkin-Huxley phase model, and by verifying them with the corresponding original full state-space models. This work addresses a fundamental problem in the field of neural control and provides a theoretical investigation to the optimal control of oscillatory systems.", "paper_title": "Design of Charge-Balanced Time-Optimal Stimuli for Spiking Neuron Oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000341341300005"}
