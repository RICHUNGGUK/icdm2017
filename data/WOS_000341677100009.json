The healthcare field is one of the popular applications for this technology that adopts sensor devices to sense signals of negative physiological events, and to notify users. The development and implementation of long-term healthcare monitoring that can prevent or quickly respond to the occurrence of disease and accidents present an interesting challenge for computing power and energy limits. This study proposed a green cloud-assisted healthcare service on WBAN, and considered the sensing frequency of the physiological signals of various body parts, as well as the data transmission among the sensor nodes of WBAN. The cloud-assisted healthcare service regulates the sensing frequency of nodes by considering the overall WBAN environment and the sensing variations of body parts. The experimental results show that the proposed service can effectively transmit the sensing data and prolong the overall lifetime of WBAN. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
