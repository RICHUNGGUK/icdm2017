A series of numeric experiments is included to illustrate the performance of the networks. The construction of gHFNN exploits fundamental technologies of Computational Intelligence (CI), namely fuzzy sets, neural networks, and genetic algorithms (GAs). The architecture of the gHFNNs results from a synergistic usage of the genetic optimization-driven hybrid system generated by combining Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN) with Polynomial Neural Networks (PNN). In this tandem, a FNN supports the formation of the condition part of the rule-based structure of the gHFNN. The conclusion part of the gHFNN is designed using PNNs. We distinguish between two types of the simplified fuzzy inference rule-based FNN structures showing how this taxonomy depends upon the type of a fuzzy partition of input variables. As to the conclusion part of the gHFNN, the development of the PNN dwells on two general optimization mechanisms: the structural optimization is realized via GAs whereas in case of the parametric optimization we proceed with a standard least square method-based learning. To evaluate the performance of the gHFNN, we experimented with three representative numerical examples. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed gHFNN come with higher accuracy as well as superb predictive capabilities when compared with other neurofuzzy models.", "paper_title": "Simplified fuzzy inference rule-based genetically optimized Hybrid Fuzzy Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256307400007"}
