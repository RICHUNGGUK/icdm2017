In this paper we demonstrate Scylla a Programmable Network Fabric architecture for Enterprise WLANs. The framework supports basic Virtual Network Function lifecycle management functionalities such as instantiation, monitoring, and migration. We release the entire platform under a permissive license for academic use.", "paper_title": "Virtual Network Function Orchestration with Scylla", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200059"}
