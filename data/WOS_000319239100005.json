We construct a global computation scheme for the critical equilibrium configurations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method via a clamped-pinned rod fabricated from linearly elastic, or specially hardening/softening material, loaded by either a horizontal or a follower force. We show some correspondence between the equilibrium states of these two load cases, and different snapping processes are revealed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
