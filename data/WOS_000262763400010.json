Previous work shows that correlated fading reduces the link performance of multiple antenna systems, but how correlated fading affects the throughput of multiuser data networks is still unknown since the throughput depends not only on the link performance but also on the multiuser diversity. We derive the throughput of the multiuser data networks with various transmit diversity schemes under correlated fading channels. The impact of correlated fading on the throughput is investigated. Analytical and simulation results show that, although correlated fading is harmful for link performance, it increases the throughput of the multiuser data networks if the transmit scheme is appropriately selected.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Transmit Diversity in Multiuser Data Networks With Fading Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000262763400010"}
