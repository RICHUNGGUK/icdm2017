Although PAVER does not solve optimization problems, it automates the task of performance data analysis and visualization, taking into account various performance metrics. These include not only robustness and efficiency, but also quality of solution. This paper discusses the tools and the performance metrics used, as well as the design of the server. We give examples of performance data analysis using an instance of the COPS test case for nonlinear programming to illustrate the features of the server.", "paper_title": "A server for automated performance analysis of benchmarking data", "paper_id": "WOS:000234633600006"}
