The approach combines the output of local detectors with a nonparametric set of global models for the part locations based on over 1,000 hand-labeled exemplar images. By assuming that the global models generate the part locations as hidden variables, we derive a Bayesian objective function. This function is optimized using a consensus of models for these hidden variables. The resulting localizer handles a much wider range of expression, pose, lighting, and occlusion than prior ones. We show excellent performance on real-world face datasets such as Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and a new Labeled Face Parts in the Wild (LFPW) and show that our localizer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the less challenging BioID dataset.", "paper_title": "Localizing Parts of Faces Using a Consensus of Exemplars", "paper_id": "WOS:000326502200010"}
