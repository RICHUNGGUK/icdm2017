It is assumed that (i) a moving target with known trajectory is viewed by all cameras at non-overlapping periods in time, (ii) the target trajectory is estimated with a limited error at a constant sampling rate, and (iii) the sequences are recorded by stationary cameras with constant frame rates and fixed intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The proposed approach reduces the problem of synchronizing N non-overlapping sequences to the problem of robustly estimating a single line from a set of appropriately-generated points in RN+1. This line describes all temporal relations between the N sequences and the moving target. Our technique can handle arbitrarily-large misalignments between the sequences and does not require any a priori information about their temporal relations. Experimental results with real-world and synthetic sequences demonstrate that our method can accurately align the videos. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
