To face challenges linked with quality, cost, cycle time, development and environment, semiconductors industries set classical process control methods. However many interactions between product-processes and tools are not exploited in practice for fine tuning controls operations and detecting premises of non conformities occurrences.", "paper_title": "Operational methods for improving manufacturing control plans: case study in a semiconductor industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000262578000005"}
