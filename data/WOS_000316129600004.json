The analytical expressions for correlations are evaluated in terms of quantities that can be experimentally accessed by a selfconsistent analysis of the detectors' outputs. We demonstrate that high-order correlations can be used to characterize the nature of the optical states, for instance by better discriminating between classical and quantum behavior even in critical situations, such as multimode twin-beam state. The results are in very good agreement with the theory, both for classical states and quantum states.", "paper_title": "HIGH-ORDER PHOTON-NUMBER CORRELATIONS: A RESOURCE FOR CHARACTERIZATION AND APPLICATIONS OF QUANTUM STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000316129600004"}
