The purpose of this paper is to develop a computational method for obtaining optimistic Stackelberg solutions to such a problem. Based on alpha-level sets of fuzzy random variables, we first transform the fuzzy random bilevel programming problem into an alpha-stochastic interval bilevel linear programming problem. To minimize the interval objective functions, the order relations which represent the decision maker's preference are defined by the right limit and the center of random interval simultaneously. Using the order relations and expectation optimization, the alpha-stochastic interval bilevel linear programming problem can be converted into a deterministic multiobjective bilevel linear programming problem. According to optimistic anticipation from the upper level decision maker, the optimistic Stackelberg solution is introduced and a computational method is also presented. Finally, several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
