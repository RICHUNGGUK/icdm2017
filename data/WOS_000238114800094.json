In the analysis, retransmission probability, which is a typical input parameter in the literature so far, is iteratively obtained from equilibrium number of backlogs in the system in conjunction with a binary exponential backoff algorithm. In numerical examples, the effects of SSs' mobility on access throughput and mean access delay are examined.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of IEEE802.16e random access protocol with mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800094"}
