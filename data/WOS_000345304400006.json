Over the past 10 years, the designers of integrated circuits (IC) and intellectual properties (IP) have faced increasing threats including counterfeiting, reverse-engineering and theft. This is now a critical issue for the microelectronics industry, mainly for fabless designers and IP designers. Coupled with increasing pressure to decrease the cost and increase the performance of ICs, the design of a secure, efficient, lightweight protection scheme for design data is a serious challenge for the hardware security community. However, several published works propose different ways to protect design data including functional locking, hardware obfuscation and IC/IP identification. This study presents a survey of academic research on the protection of design data. It concludes with the need to design an efficient protection scheme based on several properties.", "paper_title": "Survey of hardware protection of design data for integrated circuits and intellectual properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000345304400006"}
