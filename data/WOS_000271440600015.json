The PCFLARNN consists of a number of simple small-scale Chebyshev functional link artificial recurrent neural network (CFLARNN) modules. Compared to the standard recurrent neural network (RNN), those modules of PCFLARNN can simultaneously be performed in a pipelined parallelism fashion, and this would lead to a significant improvement in its total computational efficiency. Furthermore, contrasted with the architecture of a pipelined RNN (PRNN), each module of PCFLARNN is a CFLARNN whose nonlinearity is introduced by enhancing the input pattern with Chebyshev functional expansion, whereas the RNN of each module in PRNN utilizing linear input and first-order recurrent term only fails to utilize the high-order terms of inputs. Therefore, the performance of PCFLARNN can further be improved at the cost of a slightly increased computational complexity. In addition, due to the introduced nonlinear functional expansion of each module in PRNN, the number of input signals can be reduced. Computer simulations have demonstrated that the proposed filter performs better than PRNN and RNN for nonlinear colored signal prediction, nonstationary speech signal prediction, and chaotic time series prediction.", "paper_title": "Pipelined Chebyshev Functional Link Artificial Recurrent Neural Network for Nonlinear Adaptive Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000271440600015"}
