A literature review of actuator FDD for UHs is given firstly. Based on actuator healthy coefficients (AHCs), which are introduced to represent actuator faults, a combined dynamic model is established with the augmented state containing both the flight state and AHCs. Then the actuator fault detection and diagnosis problem is transformed into a general nonlinear estimation one: given control inputs and the measured flight state contaminated by measurement noises, estimate both the flight state and AHCs recursively in each time-step, which is also known as the simultaneous state and parameter estimation problem. The estimated AHCs can further be used for fault tolerant control (FTC). Based on the existing widely used nonlinear estimation methods such as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the extended set-membership filter (ESMF), three kinds of adaptive schemes (KF-UKF, MIT-UKF and MIT-ESMF) are proposed by our team to improve the actuator FDD performance. A comprehensive comparative study on these different estimation methods is given in detail to illustrate their advantages and disadvantages when applied to unmanned helicopter actuator FDD.", "paper_title": "SIMULTANEOUS STATE AND PARAMETER ESTIMATION BASED ACTUATOR FAULT DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS FOR AN UNMANNED HELICOPTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000351850200013"}
