We will not discuss here quantum computer algorithms, like the algorithm by Shor, or their advantages and disadvantages. We only cover the material that lies at the foundations of quantum information and computing and epistemological questions. We attempt to connect the famous debate between Einstein and Bohr on quantum entanglement to some of the latest work on qubits and quantum computing and to the mathematical theorems that form the basis of these discussions, particularly the theorem of Bell. We present a critical analysis of this material and hope that this will give the reader a better understanding of what can be said with certainty about the nature of quantum information.", "paper_title": "What is quantum information?", "paper_id": "WOS:000240890100001"}
