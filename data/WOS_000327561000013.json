Different types of features characterise different facets of the handwriting. We have designed a scheme for multiple feature based identity establishment using multi-kernel learning. A new formulation for multi-kernel learning using genetic algorithm has been presented. The efficacy of the framework using individual and combination of features is demonstrated for Devanagari script input. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
