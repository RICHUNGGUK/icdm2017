Designing and modeling such a cross-organizational workflow is a complicated, time-consuming process and requires that a designer has extensive experience. Workflow logs captured by different cross-organizational systems provide a very valuable source of information on how business processes are executed in reality and thus can be used to derive workflow models through process mining. In this paper, we investigate the application of process mining for workflow integration based on the concept of RM_WF_Net, a type of Petri net extended with resource and message factors. Four coordination patterns are defined for workflow integration. A process mining approach is presented to discover the coordination patterns between different organizations and the workflow models in different organizations from the running logs containing the information about resource allocation. A process integration approach is then presented to obtain the model for a cross-organizational workflow based on the model mined for each organization and the coordination patterns between different organizations.
