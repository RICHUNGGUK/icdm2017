Lower bounds for the achieved goodput when robust scheduling is used are derived and through simulation we study the impact in terms of blocked calls and QoS achieved by the robust solution for two different cell topology layouts: when 2-hop relaying is allowed and when only direct base station to user transmissions are allowed. The results reveal that the price of robustness is lower for the 2-hop case than the single hop case.", "paper_title": "Robust cross layer optimization in relay aided cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321974700022"}
