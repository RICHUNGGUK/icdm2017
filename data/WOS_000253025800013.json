The well known application sharing protocols include RFB (Remote FrameBuffer), RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and ITU-T T.128. A generic application sharing architecture is proposed for providing the capability of connecting various application sharing servers with the same application sharing client. A communication standard for application sharing systems is defined based on the Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM). To compare with previous application sharing systems, there are many advantages including easy to use, easy to connect, easy to integrate, higher scalability and less bandwidth consumption.
