For image processing of 10 bits, the improvement of a dynamic false contour and driving high density PDP, the high-speed driving technology needs to be developed. In this study, the relationship between the barrier-rib height of the PDP and the address discharge for high-speed addressing were analyzed using a 4-in. stripe type VGA PDP panel. The barrier-rib height of the test panels varied between 100 and 180 gm. The results showed that the lower the barrier-rib was, the narrower the width of the scan pulse became. At a barrier-rib height of 100 mu m, the minimum data voltage was 55.9 V and the dynamic margin of the address voltage was 23.5 V, with a scan pulse width of 0.8 mu s and a ramp voltage of 220 V for a 4-in. test panel.
