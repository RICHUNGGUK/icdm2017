The algorithm is based on bi-directional and bounded dynamic programming with decremental state space relaxation. We compare different strategies proposed in the literature to guide decremental state space relaxation: our experiments on instances derived from the literature show that there is no dominance between these strategies. We also propose a new heuristic technique to initialize the critical vertex set and we provide experimental evidence of its effectiveness. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
