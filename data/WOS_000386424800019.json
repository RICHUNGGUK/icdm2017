Users express their analysis in Datalog with bag-monotonic aggregate operators, which enables the expression of computations from a broad variety of application domains. Queries are translated into query plans that can execute in shared-nothing engines, are incremental, and support a variety of iterative models (synchronous, asynchronous, different processing priorities) and failure-handling techniques. The plans require only small extensions to an existing shared-nothing engine, making the approach easily implementable. We implement the approach in the Myria big-data management system and use our implementation to empirically study the performance characteristics of different combinations of iterative models, failure handling methods, and applications. Our evaluation uses workloads from a variety of application domains. We find that no single method outperforms others but rather that application properties must drive the selection of the iterative query execution model.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous and Fault-Tolerant Recursive Datalog Evaluation in Shared-Nothing Engines", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800019"}
