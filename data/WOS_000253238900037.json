A PID controller is developed via the EP algorithm. By using the EP algorithm, optimal control gains in PID controlled chaotic systems are derived such that a performance index of integrated absolute error (IAE) is as minimal as possible. Moreover, as an application, the proposed EP-based PID control scheme is then applied to a chaotic secure communication system. To verify the system performance, basic electronic components containing OPA, resistor and capacitor elements are used to implement the proposed PID-based chaotic secure communication system. Finally, both simulation results and the circuit experiments demonstrate the proposed PID scheme's success in the communication application. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
