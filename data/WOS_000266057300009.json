We propose a scheme where price information is propagated along the network path, where each network resource subtracts its share of value from packet's price. The proposed scheme establishes a direct relationship between expressed willingness to pay and gained QoS level. The scheme could be further developed and implemented with compliancy to QoS standards, like Differentiated and Integrated Services. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
