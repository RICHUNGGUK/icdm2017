This RTIS can also deduce the travel times on the other road links without real-time AVI data. The travel times, in RTIS, are estimated by the real-time AVI data, the off-line travel time estimates and the related spatial variance-covariance relationships between road links. The real-time AVI data adopted for RTIS are Autotoll tag data in Hong Kong: whereas the off-line link travel time estimates and their spatial variance-covariance matrices are obtained from a traffic flow simulator. By integration of these real-time and off-line traffic data together, the travel times on the road links either with or without real-time AVI data can be updated at 5-min intervals. Validation of journey time estimates is carried out at various selected paths in Hong Kong urban area. The results show that the performance of RTIS on real-time journey time estimation in Hong Kong is satisfactory and acceptable. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
