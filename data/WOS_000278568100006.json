It is a well-known computationally complex problem, where computational complexity increases exponentially as the number of faults increases. Thus, warrants the application of heuristic techniques or Al-based optimization tools to diagnose the exact faults in real time. In this research, rollout strategy-based probabilistic causal model (RSPCM) has been proposed to solve graph-based multiple fault diagnosis problems. Rollout strategy is a single-step iterative process, implemented in this research to improve the efficiency and robustness of probabilistic causal model. In RSPCM instead of finding all possible combinations of faults, collect the faults corresponding to each observed manifestations that can give the best possible result in compared to other methods. Intensive computational experiments on well-known data sets witness the superiority of the proposed heuristic over earlier approaches existing in the literature. From experimental results it can easily inferred that proposed methodology can diagnosed the exact fault in the minimum fault isolation time as compared to other approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
