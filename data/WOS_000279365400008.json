Optimal resource management is thus among the most important challenges in WSNs development and its success requires accurate and practical models based on detailed insight concerning the factors contributing to the overall power consumption of a WSN mote. To achieve such awareness, that will enable models development, appropriate measuring test-beds and methodologies are needed, facilitating reliable and accurate power consumption measurements of critical functionalities. To cover the need for energy models that precisely define the power consumption behavior of WSN hardware platforms, this paper contributes with a measuring methodology including three steps: the design and implementation of a measuring system for a wide range of power consumption thresholds, the identification, isolation and measurement of elementary functionalities of a WSN platform with respect to their contribution to the overall mote power consumption, and the extraction of valuable conclusions based on the respective measurements resulting in the composition of a practical, yet accurate power consumption model.
