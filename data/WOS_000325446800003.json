The spatiotemporal distribution and interaction of these synaptic inputs produce complex patterns of Ca2+ dynamics in the Purkinje cell dendrites. The Ca2+ signals originate from Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores that are mediated by the metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling pathway. These Ca2+ signals are essential for the induction of various forms of synaptic plasticity and for controlling the input output relationship of Purkinje cells. In this article we review Ca2+ signaling in Purkinje cell dendrites. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
