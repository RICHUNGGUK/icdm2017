In this context, the test case selection aims to eliminate redundant or unnecessary test data, which is crucial for the definition of test strategies. This paper presents a systematic review on the test case selection conducted through a selection of 449 articles published in leading journals and conferences in Computer Science. We addressed the state-of-art by collecting and comparing existing evidence on the methods used in the different software domains and the methods used to evaluate the test case selection. Our study identified 32 papers that met the research objectives, which featured 18 different selection methods and were evaluated through 71 case studies. The most commonly reported methods are adaptive random testing, genetic algorithms and greedy algorithm. Most approaches rely on heuristics, such as diversity of test cases and code or model coverage. This paper also discusses the key concepts and approaches, areas of application and evaluation metrics inherent to the methods of test case selection available in the literature.", "paper_title": "Test Case Selection: A Systematic Literature Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000341843100006"}
