This paper formulates a restructuring problem for 0-1 integer programming and presents a network-based solution method, which uses a distance parameter between every pair of characteristics for similarity metric. This paper presents basic theorems for clustering characteristics and defining of inheritance hierarchy. We create inheritance hierarchies based on the rules for a definition of class relationship. The method is analyzed and compared with the existing method.
