By using the Lyapunov functional method, some sufficient conditions have been derived to ensure the exponential stability for the error system, and thus the drive system synchronize with the response system. Moreover, the designing laws for the controlling gain matrix in the synchronization of neural networks are proposed via output or state coupling. Two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
