The method allows the extraction of aggregate features from images and the automatic classification of them based on surface characteristics. The concept of entropy is used to extract features from digital images. An analysis of the use of this concept is presented and two classification approaches, based on neural networks architectures, are proposed. The classification performance of the proposed approaches is compared to the results obtained by other algorithms (commonly considered for classification purposes). The obtained results confirm that the presented method strongly supports the detection of weathered aggregates.", "paper_title": "Entropy-Based Approach to Analyze and Classify Mineral Aggregates", "paper_id": "WOS:000285476000009"}
