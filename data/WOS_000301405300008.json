This partitioning problem is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we use the simulated annealing with a new solution representation. In our method, we can automatically generate different number of location areas using Compact Index (CI) to obtain the optimal/best partitions. We compare the results obtained in our method with the earlier results available in literature. We show that our methodology is able to perform better than earlier methods.", "paper_title": "LOCATION AREA PLANNING USING SIMULATED ANNEALING WITH A NEW SOLUTION REPRESENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405300008"}
