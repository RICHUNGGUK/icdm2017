Based on the sliding cycle time constraint, the proposed algorithm guarantees the maximum polling interval, an essential property for delay-sensitive applications and interactive services. We then introduce an iterative resource pooling that processes bursty best-effort traffic and achieves high throughput even under non-uniform upstream traffic distribution. We prove that greedy iterative resource pooling converges to equal resource allocation exponentially fast. Extensive numerical simulations show that SLICT outperforms existing techniques in all aspects: throughput, delay, packet loss and average queue size. Finally, SLICT has been implemented on an EPON FPGA board and the performance is confirmed under real traffic.", "paper_title": "Iterative resource pooling for bandwidth allocation in TDM-PON: algorithm, convergence and experimental evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308330600006"}
