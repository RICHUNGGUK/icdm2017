The discrimination and prediction are mainly based on decision tree coupled with adaptive boosting algorithm, and classification and regression tree, respectively, using three neighboring residues of the mutant sit. along N- and C-terminals. Our method showed an accuracy of 82% for discriminating the stabilizing and destabilizing mutants, and a correlation of 0.70 for predicting protein stability changes upon mutations.", "paper_title": "iPTREE-STAB: interpretable decision tree based method for predicting protein stability changes upon mutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000247348300016"}
