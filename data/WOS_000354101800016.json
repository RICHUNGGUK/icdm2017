The new factors contributing to congestion include local pin access paths, vias, and various design rules. In this paper, we propose a practical congestion model with measurement of the impact of design rules, and resources consumed by vias and local pin access paths. The model is compatible with path search algorithms commonly used in global routing. Validated by full-flow routing, this congestion model correlates better with real resource consumption situation in detailed routing, compared with previous work. It leads to better solution quality and shorter runtime of detailed routing when it is used in the layer assignment phase of global routing stage.", "paper_title": "Design-Rule-Aware Congestion Model with Explicit Modeling of Vias and Local Pin Access Paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000354101800016"}
