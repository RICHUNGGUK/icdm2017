This paper considers the tactical distribution problem for a large pipeline network. Solutions to this problem consist of volume transfers satisfying local demands, correctly stocking production volumes, and observing a number of operational constraints. This work defines the tactical planning problem and proposes a novel and compact network flow model to address it. Also, a procedure is given to decompose the flow solution into pumping operations that can be used as input for short-term schedulers. Our experiments were performed over real instances provided by a large oil company. These instances consisted of 30 pipelines in an extension of 7000 km, 14 depots, 192 tanks, and more than 60 products. The model was tested with real-world instances and showed significant improvements over manually generated plans, which is the current practice. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
