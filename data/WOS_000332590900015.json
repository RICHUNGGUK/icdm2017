However, both the identification error rate and response time increase as the number of enrollees increases. In this paper, we combine a score level fusion scheme and a metric space indexing scheme to improve the accuracy and response time in biometric identification, using only scores as information sources. We firstly propose a score level indexing and fusion framework which can be constructed from the following three schemes: (I) a pseudo-score based indexing scheme, (II) a multi-biometric search scheme, and (III) a score level fusion scheme which handles missing scores. A multi-biometric search scheme can be newly obtained by applying a pseudo-score based indexing scheme to multi-biometric identification. We secondly propose the NBS (Naive Bayes search) scheme as a multi-biometric search scheme and discuss its optimality with respect to the retrieval error rate. We evaluated our proposal using the datasets of multiple fingerprints and face scores from multiple matchers. The results showed that our proposal significantly improved the accuracy of the unimodal biometrics while reducing the average number of score computations in both the datasets.", "paper_title": "A General Framework and Algorithms for Score Level Indexing and Fusion in Biometric Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000332590900015"}
