In this article, we illustrate the motivations for distributed problem solving and provide an overview of two distributed problem-solving models, namely distributed constraint-satisfaction problems (DCSPs) and distributed constraint-optimization problems (DCOPs), and some of their algorithms.", "paper_title": "Distributed Problem Solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000309621600005"}
