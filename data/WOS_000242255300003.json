By only two on-line closed-loop step tests, the equivalent process inputs and outputs are derived. Based on the information, of equivalent inputs and outputs, four transfer functions of the sub-systems or two transfer functions of decentralized equivalent, single-loop processes of second order plus dead time (SOPDT) models can, be directly identified by a modified step identification method. Then, the single loop tuning approaches can, be applied to tune the decentralized controllers based on either relative gain array (RGA) detuning or independent design of ideal control loop approximation. Some typical processes have been, employed to compare the two tuning procedures and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A practical decentralized PID auto-tuning method for TITO systems under closed-loop control", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255300003"}
