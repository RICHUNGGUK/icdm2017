Front objects of interest, the human eye receives high visual resolution through nonuniform distribution of photoreceptors. Therefore. this paper proposes auto exposure and focus algorithms for the real-time video camera systern based on the visual characteristic of the human eye. For given moving objects. the visual weight is modeled for quantifying the visual importance and the associated auto exposure and focus parameters are derived by applying the weight to the traditional numerical expression, i.e., the DOM (Difference of Mediato and Tenengrad methods for auto focus.", "paper_title": "Object-Based Auto Exposure and Focus Algorithms Based on the Human Visual System", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630900017"}
