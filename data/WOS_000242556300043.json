Secondly, to handle constraints in multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), a new constraint handling strategy is proposed, which keeps infeasible elitists to act as bridges connecting disconnected feasible regions besides feasible ones during optimization and adopts stochastic ranking to balance objectives and constraints in each generation. Finally, this strategy is applied to NSGA-II, and then is compared with DCDP on six benchmark constrained MOPs. Our results demonstrate that distribution and stability of the solutions are distinctly improved on the problems with two or more disconnected feasible regions, such as CTP6.", "paper_title": "Infeasible elitists and stochastic ranking selection in constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300043"}
