To bridge the gap between user's vague perception and explicit motion scene description, we propose a Scene Description Language that can translate user's input into a series of set operations between inverted lists. Our Scene Description Language has three-layer structures, each describing scenes at different levels of granularity. By introducing automatic transition strategy into our retrieval process, our system can search motions that do not exist in a motion database. This property makes our system have potentials to serve as motion synthesis purpose. Moreover, by using various kinds of qualitative features and adaptive segments of motion capture data stream, we obtain a robust clustering that is flexible and efficient for constructing motion graph. Some experimental examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Content-based human motion retrieval with automatic transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600031"}
