In digital imaging, JPEG is the most popular lossy compression standard and JPEG images are ubiquitous. Today's digital techniques make it easy to tamper JPEG images without leaving any visible clues. Furthermore, most image tampering involves JPEG double compression, it heightens the need for accurate analysis of JPEG double compression in image forensics. In this paper, to improve the detection of JPEG double compression, we transplant the neighboring joint density features, which were designed for JPEG steganalysis, and merge the joint density features with marginal density features in DCT domain as the detector for learning classifiers. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves the detection performance. We also study the relationship among compression factor, image complexity, and detection accuracy, which has not been comprehensively analyzed before. The results show that a complete evaluation of the detection performance of different algorithms should necessarily include image complexity as well as the double compression quality factor. In addition to JPEG double compression, the identification of image capture source is an interesting topic in image forensics. Mobile handsets are widely used for spontaneous photo capture because they are typically carried by their users at all times. In the imaging device market, smartphone adoption is currently exploding and megapixel smartphones pose a threat to the traditional digital cameras. While smartphone images are widely disseminated, the manipulation of images is also easily performed with various photo editing tools. Accordingly, the authentication of smartphone images and the identification of post-capture manipulation are of significant interest in digital forensics. Following the success of our previous work in JPEG double compression detection, we conducted a study to identify smartphone source and post-capture manipulation by utilizing marginal density and neighboring joint density features together. Experimental results show that our method is highly promising for identifying both smartphone source and manipulations. Finally, our study also indicates that applying unsupervised clustering and supervised classification together leads to improvement in identifying smartphone sources and manipulations and thus provides a means to address the complexity issue of the intentional post-capture manipulation on smartphone images.", "paper_title": "Detection of JPEG double compression and identification of smartphone image source and post-capture manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000326387300004"}
