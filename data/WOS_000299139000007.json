We commonly use cloud service client-side software in a straightforward fashion. However, when more devices and users participate in heterogeneous services, the difficulty of managing these services efficiently and conveniently increases. In this paper, we report a novel cloud-oriented file service, Wukong, which provides a user-friendly and highly available facilitative data access method for mobile devices in cloud settings. Wukong supports mobile applications, which may access local files only, transparently accessing cloud services with a relatively high performance. To the best of our knowledge, Wukong is the first file service that supports heterogeneous cloud services for mobile devices by using the innovative storage abstraction layer. We have implemented a prototype with several plugins and evaluated it in a systematic way. We find that this easily operable file service has a high usability and extensibility. It costs about 50 to 150 lines of code to implement a new backend service support plugin. Wukong achieves an acceptable throughput of 179.11 kB/s in an ADSL environment and 80.68 kB/s under a countryside EVDO 3G network with negligible overhead. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
