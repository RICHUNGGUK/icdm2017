In this paper, we propose a novel method, which is based on Heat Kernel Signature (HKS) and triangular mesh structure to achieve handwritten word image matching. HKS can tolerate large variations in handwritten word images and capture local features. On the other hand, the triangular mesh structure is used to present global characteristics. Moreover, our method does not need pre-processing steps. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
