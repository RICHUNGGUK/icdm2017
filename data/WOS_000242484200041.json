The optimal confidence interval is obtained by maximizing the coverage probability with a fixed width at a least favorable configuration of means. Then, the sample sizes can be determined by this procedure. It has been shown that the optimal interval is globally optimal over all possible choices of symmetric and asymmetric intervals. In situations where the two-stage sampling procedure cannot be completely carried through, a one-stage sampling procedure can be implemented, and their relationship is discussed. A numerical example to demonstrate the use of these sampling procedures is given. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
