The algorithm was designed to process large sequences of real-time magnetic resonance (MR) images containing the 2-D midsagittal view of a human vocal tract airway. The segmentation algorithm uses an anatomically informed object model, whose fit to the observed image data is hierarchically optimized using a gradient descent procedure. The goal of the algorithm is to automatically extract the time-varying vocal tract outline and the position of the articulators to facilitate the study of the shaping of the vocal tract during speech production.", "paper_title": "Region Segmentation in the Frequency Domain Applied to Upper Airway Real-Time Magnetic Resonance Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000263920500002"}
