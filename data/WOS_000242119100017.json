Recent empirical studies have shown that they suffer from freeloaders, that is, peers that consume many more resources or content than they contribute. In this paper we propose a coalition formation based incentive mechanism for P2P file sharing systems, that improves the system performance for the coalition participant peers. In addition, it discourages free-loader like behavior. The mechanism presents a formal approach to the problem based on game theory that takes into account the rational and self-interested behavior of the peers.", "paper_title": "Coalition formation in P2P file sharing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242119100017"}
