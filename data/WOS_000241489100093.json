These limitations make the process complex and sometimes limit the applicability of developed methodologies because of a lack of suitable features in overlapping areas. To address these problems, this paper presents a methodology that uses the topological characteristics of the terrain itself, which is represented by a contour tree (CT). This approach provides a robust methodology without the restrictions involved in methods that employ conjugate features. Our method also makes the overall process of adjustment generally applicable and automated.", "paper_title": "Adjustment for discrepancies between ALS data strips using a contour tree algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100093"}
