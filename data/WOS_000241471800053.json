Various methods in detecting traffic variations at abnormally high rate have been reported. We note that a recent paper by Kuzmanovic and Knightly, which explains a type of DDOS attacks that may result in abnormally low traffic rate. Such a type of abnormal variations of traffic, therefore, can easily evade from detection systems based on abnormally high traffic rate. This paper presents a real-time and reliable detection approach to detect traffic variations at both abnormally high and low rates. The formulas in terms of detection probabilities, miss probabilities, classification criterion, and detection thresholds are proposed.", "paper_title": "A real-time and reliable approach to detecting traffic variations at abnormally high and low rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800053"}
