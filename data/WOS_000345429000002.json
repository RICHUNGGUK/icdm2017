The method contributes to so-called semantic data mining, a data mining approach where domain ontologies are used as background knowledge, and where the new challenge is to mine knowledge encoded in domain ontologies, rather than only purely empirical data. The authors have developed a tool that implements this approach. Using this the authors have conducted an experimental evaluation including comparison of our method to state-of-the-art approaches to classification of semantic data and an experimental study within emerging subfield of meta-learning called semantic meta-mining. The most important research contributions of the paper to the state-of-art are as follows. For pattern mining research or relational learning in general, the paper contributes a new algorithm for discovery of new type of patterns. For Semantic Web research, it theoretically and empirically illustrates how semantic, structured data can be used in traditional machine learning methods through a pattern-based approach for constructing semantic features.", "paper_title": "Pattern Based Feature Construction in Semantic Data Mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000345429000002"}
