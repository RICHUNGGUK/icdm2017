This facilitates compositional analysis for architectural verification and plays a crucial role in all industrial areas where high-performance microprocessors allow growing integration of multiple applications on a single platform. We propose a compositional approach to formal specification and schedulability analysis of real-time applications running under a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) global scheduler and preemptive Fixed Priority (FP) local schedulers, according to the ARINC-653 standard. As a characterizing trait, each application is made of periodic, sporadic, and jittering tasks with offsets, jitters, and nondeterministic execution times, encompassing intra-application synchronizations through semaphores and mailboxes and interapplication communications among periodic tasks through message passing. The approach leverages the assumption of a TDM partitioning to enable compositional design and analysis based on the model of preemptive Time Petri Nets (pTPNs), which is expressly extended with a concept of Required Interface (RI) that specifies the embedding environment of an application through sequencing and timing constraints. This enables exact verification of intra-application constraints and approximate but safe verification of interapplication constraints. Experimentation illustrates results and validates their applicability on two challenging workloads in the field of safety-critical avionic systems.", "paper_title": "Compositional Verification for Hierarchical Scheduling of Real-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000318642300004"}
