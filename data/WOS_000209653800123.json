Over the last few years, we have seen a plethora of IoT solutions making their way into the industry marketplace. Context-aware communications and computing have played a critical role throughout the last few years of ubiquitous computing and are expected to play a significant role in the IoT paradigm as well. In this paper, we examine a variety of popular and innovative IoT solutions in terms of context-aware technology perspectives. More importantly, we evaluate these IoT solutions using a framework that we built around well-known context aware computing theories. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for context-aware product development and research in the IoT paradigm. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing IoT products in the marketplace and highlights a number of potentially significant research directions and trends.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Internet of Things From Industrial Market Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800123"}
