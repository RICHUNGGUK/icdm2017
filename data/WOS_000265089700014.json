We introduce two new metrics and concepts of certain types of difference values on fuzzy n-cell number space and study their properties. Further, based on the metrics or difference values appropriately defined, we put forward an algorithmic version of pattern recognition in an imprecise or uncertain environment, and we also give practical examples to show the application and rationality of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Representation of Uncertain Multichannel Digital Signal Spaces and Study of Pattern Recognition Based on Metrics and Difference Values on Fuzzy n-Cell Number Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089700014"}
