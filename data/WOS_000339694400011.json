There are a large number of process variables at a typical hot mill and principal component analysis is a well-known technique for reducing the number of process variables. This paper estimates the principal components associated with the hot mill process variables and puts these through an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to find those hot mill running conditions that will minimise the amount of scale observed on the bottom of the rolled strip. It was found that the variation observed in all the hot mill process variables could be captured through the use of just six principal components, and that using just three of these in an ANFIS was sufficient to identify those operating conditions leading to coils being produced with a consistently low scale count. Specifically, it was found that the best operating conditions for the hot mill were when the first component was lower than -0.098 the second lower than 0.8058 and the third higher than -0.482. These ranges in turn corresponded to certain hot mill temperatures that depended to some extent on the base chemistry of the incoming slab. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
