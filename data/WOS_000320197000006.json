With the assumption of the existence of an upper bound to the inhibitory weights in neurobiological networks, it is shown that chunking increases the number of memorized items in working memory from the \"magical number 7\" to 16 items. The optimal number of chunks and the number of the memorized items in each chunk are the \"magical number 4\".", "paper_title": "BEHIND THE MAGICAL NUMBERS: HIERARCHICAL CHUNKING AND THE HUMAN WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000320197000006"}
