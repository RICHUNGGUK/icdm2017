These designs are called Space-Filling Designs. Different measures or metrics quantify how a set of points is spread out. In this paper, we present two types of measures of uniformity: discrepancy and point-to-point measures which take into account the distances between the pairs of points. However these criteria of quantification do not permit the qualification of the distribution. Thus, we discuss a new approach to assess the quality of computer experiments. This approach is based on a graph constructed from the set of points of the experimental design. This graph, called Minimum Spanning Tree, allows us to deduce two parameters-the mean and the standard deviation of the edges length-which characterize the points distribution to be studied.
