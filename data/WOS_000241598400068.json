The system extracts the most relevant features from a set of training samples and builds a hierarchical structure of them. By focusing on those features common to all trained objects, and also searching for those features particular to a reduced number of classes, and eventually, to each object class. To allow for efficient rotation invariance, we propose the use of non-Gaussian steerable filters, together with an Orientation Integral Image for a speedy computation of local orientation.", "paper_title": "Orientation invariant features for multiclass object recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400068"}
