We demonstrate fitting this representation to meshes of varying resolutions and sampling quality. The fitting process is adaptive and provides controls for both the average and the maximum allowable error. The representation is suitable for applications which require consistent parameterizations across different surfaces.", "paper_title": "Adaptive smooth surface fitting with manifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000265539300024"}
