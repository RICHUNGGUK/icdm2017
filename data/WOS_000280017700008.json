This type of pairwise sample comparison is important in manufacturing process quality control, forensic science and other applications where determination of a match probability between two samples is required. Analysis of the pairwise comparisons between multiple LIBS spectra from a single glass sample shows that some assumptions required by parametric methods may not hold in practice, motivating the adoption of a non-parametric permutation test. Without rigid distributional assumptions, the permutation test exhibits excellent discriminating power while holding the actual size of Type I error at the nominal level.
