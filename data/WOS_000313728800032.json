The considered scenario assumes that the estimation is based on a few channel use observations during a short sensing period. Using large dimensional random matrix theory, an estimator referred to as G-estimator is derived. This estimator is proved to be consistent as the number of antennas and observations grow large and its asymptotic performance is analyzed. In particular, the G-estimator satisfies a central limit theorem with asymptotic Gaussian fluctuations. Simulations are provided which strongly support the theoretical results, even for small system dimensions.", "paper_title": "Performance of Mutual Information Inference Methods Under Unknown Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000313728800032"}
