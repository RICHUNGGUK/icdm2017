Some combination rules mix evidential information where sources are independent; other rules are suited to combine evidential information held by dependent sources. In this paper we have two main contributions: First we suggest a method to quantify sources' degree of independence that may guide the choice of the more appropriate set of combination rules. Second, we propose a new combination rule that takes consideration of sources' degree of independence. The proposed method is illustrated on generated mass functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
