Inspired by an existing Homotopy-type algorithm for the optimal precoder design of MIMO systems, we fully investigate the usefulness of the piecewise linear property between power allocations and sum power, and then derive a piecewise-defined algorithm to obtain the maximum EE in a closed form. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to present such a closed-form solution for the EE optimization in MIMO systems.", "paper_title": "Homotopy Algorithm for Energy-Efficient MIMO Systems with Joint Power Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681200001"}
