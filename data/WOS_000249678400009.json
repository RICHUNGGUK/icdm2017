The algorithm is therefore able to detect both convex and non-convex clusters. Kd-tree based nearest neighbor search is used to reduce the complexity of finding the closest symmetric point. Adaptive mutation and crossover probabilities are used. The proposed GA with point symmetry (GAPS) distance based clustering algorithm is able to detect any type of clusters, irrespective of their geometrical shape and overlapping nature, as long as they possess the characteristic of symmetry. GAPS is compared with existing symmetry-based clustering technique SBKM, its modified version, and the well-known K-means algorithm. Sixteen data sets with widely varying characteristics are used to demonstrate its superiority. For real-life data sets, ANOVA and MANOVA statistical analyses are performed.
