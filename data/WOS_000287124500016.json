An improved delay-dependent stability and stabilization conditions are established without using model transformation and bounding technique for cross terms. Linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based algorithm to design a state feedback control that stabilizes the system is provided for all admissible uncertainties. Numerical examples are solved to show the usefulness and validness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED DELAY-DEPENDENT ROBUST STABILIZATION OF SINGULAR SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500016"}
