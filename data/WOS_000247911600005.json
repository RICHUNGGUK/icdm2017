Some methods have been proposed in the literature to determine the adequate sample size. However, they are usually based on the line slope only. We propose a method based on the F statistic that involves both the intercept and the slope parameters of the model. The validation process is conducted by fitting a simple linear regression model and by testing a zero intercept and unity slope hypothesis. Compared to a traditional method and using Monte Carlo simulations, encouraging results attest for the clear superiority of the proposed method. The article ends with a real-life example showing the value of the new method in practice.", "paper_title": "Sample size calculation for method validation using linear regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000247911600005"}
