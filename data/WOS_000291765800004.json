In particular an operation slowing the whole computing process heavily is modular exponentiation. A previous method reduces the computation of vertical bar x(e) (m) to n simpler modular exponentiations vertical bar x(i)(ni)vertical bar(mi) at most, where mi is an element of the factorization of m, x(i) = vertical bar x vertical bar(mi) and eta(i) < m(i). A technique speeding up vertical bar x(i)(eta i)vertical bar(mi) is presented. The idea is to extend the discrete logarithm, reducing to a sole fixed base exponentiation, which can be tabulated. More precisely, depending on modulus value, specific expressions are devised leading to the definition of an extension of the discrete logarithm, Using these expressions a method based on tables is presented and evaluated in term of table size. An implementation of the method is also presented and its response time is derived; for moduli up to about 28 bits it amounts to 120-150 ns. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
