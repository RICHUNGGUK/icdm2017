Since data mining algorithms extracts a huge quantity of patterns it is therefore necessary to filter out those patterns using various measures. This paper presents IMAK, a part-way interestingness measure between objective and subjective measure, which evaluates patterns considering expert knowledge. Our main contribution is to improve interesting patterns extraction using relationships defined into an ontology.", "paper_title": "Interesting patterns extraction using prior knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000241631200030"}
