We introduce VISTA Region Viewer (RViewer), an interactive online tool that allows for efficient screening and prioritization of regions of the human genome for follow-up studies. The tool takes as input genetic variation data from different biomedical studies, determines a number of various functional parameters for both coding and non-coding sequences in each region and allows for sorting and searching the results of the analysis in multiple ways.", "paper_title": "VISTA Region Viewer (RViewer)-a computational system for prioritizing genomic intervals for biomedical studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000294755400016"}
