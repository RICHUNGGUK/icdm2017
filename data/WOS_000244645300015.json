A number of structural properties of the MQC problem in this new representation are characterized through formulating into answer set programming, a recent powerful logic programming tool for modeling and solving search problems. Using these properties, a number of optimization techniques are proposed to speed up the search process. The experimental results on a number of simulated data sets suggest that the new representation, combined with answer set programming, presents a unique perspective to the MQC problem.", "paper_title": "Quartet-based phylogeny reconstruction with answer set programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000244645300015"}
