This me works for simple diffusion and for flux-limited diffusion, with or without material con tion. A new method is developed that does not require the solution of an averaged transport equation. It is effective solving both the diffusion and P-1 forms of the tram equation. Two dimensional, multi-material test problems are used to compare the soli methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
