While meriting more in-depth research and development, deploying a practical WSN for surveillance is challenging due to the limited power and bandwidth of the battery-operated sensor nodes. In this paper, we first propose an energy-efficient image transportation strategy through motion detection. In case of data delivery over long distance, this paper further investigates the use of cooperative communications to design a reliable image transmission scheme over WSN, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving network reliability in wireless multimedia sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Enabling low bit-rate and reliable video surveillance over practical wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000319942000018"}
