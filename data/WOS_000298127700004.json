The complexity of innovative processes has been widely studied, yet the success rate is still low. The purpose of this paper is to identify by the dialectical systems approach how some concepts, important for development of inventions into innovations can better support requisitely holistic innovative behavior. Design/methodology/approach - System theory, theory of innovations and social responsibility are used to understand diffusion of innovations as part of the innovative processes. Findings - Many established theories, methods, procedures and standards support innovation management, but its economic success remains poor. Invention-innovation-diffusion processes (IMP) remain poorly managed, especially the non-technological. The usual approach is too one-sided. Invention and innovation phases received more attention than the requisitely holistic consideration of the diffusion phase. Social responsibility can help. Research limitations/implications - The paper adds to requisite holism of IIDP management. It focuses on diffusion and its link with social responsibility. Practical implications - The new approach to IIDP is widely applicable for requisitely holistic rather than one-sided political or strategic decisions and actions. ISO 26000 can increase success of IMP. Originality/value - The concepts presented here are not detected in literature and offer great value for further research and understanding, designing and managing of IIDP. The selected dialectical system of viewpoints is original.", "paper_title": "Diffusion of innovative behaviour with social responsibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000298127700004"}
