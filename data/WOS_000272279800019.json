However, risk managers typically have not been able to quantify how resource availability, the cost of acquiring those resources. and evacuation completion time are related. This paper proposes a deterministic optimization approach for identifying the staffing and vehicle transport requirements, as well as the scheduling of these requirements, within a pre-specified evacuation time period while minimizing cost. Moreover, we provide these managers with a modeling framework that can indicate if their current resource set is inadequate to evacuate the patient population within the specified time period. We suggest a tailored solution approach that relaxes certain complicating integer constraints in an effort to find feasible, quality solutions. Using this optimization-based heuristic, we then evaluate the hospital evacuation problem, providing insights into the period-by-period requirements of nurses and vehicles, as well as how resource restrictions would affect the evacuation. Finally, we provide a comparison of minimizing cost against minimizing evacuation completion time, where we have a budget restriction in the latter case. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
