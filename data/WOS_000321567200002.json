In particular, a complete simulation environment has been developed to analyse the system performance obtained by adopting the future European GNSSs when GALILEO will be fully operative. Moreover, this tool has been adopted in the development phase of a precise GNSS-based localization system and developed within the MOW-BY-SAT project, an FP7 project funded by the European Commission; this architecture relies on an innovative algorithm that allows for a Real Time Kinematic localization system, while requiring only a pair of low-cost GPS receivers. The results show the validity of the developed localization and control architecture and the potential of the future European GALILEO system.", "paper_title": "A Simulation Environment for an Augmented Global Navigation Satellite System Assisted Autonomous Robotic Lawn-Mower", "paper_id": "WOS:000321567200002"}
