Both fluid motion vectors as well as Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) are employed in the study. Region-based correlation method is used to initialize motion vectors field, after clustering fluid motion vector results can be obtained. Then the height geometry information of fluid surface can be calculated from fluid motion vector further. At last, the distribution of fluid particle is interpolated and the height field can be further refined. Reconstruction results are demonstrated with several challenge videos. The experimental results show that the method is convenient and efficient. The calculation results can reflect the characteristics of the fluid movement, and it is a valid method for reconstructing fluid surface.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of fluid surface using physical property", "paper_id": "WOS:000365771900007"}
