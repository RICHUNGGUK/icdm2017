When the contributed disc storage of a peer is full, to minimize the server load, which movie should be replaced is a key design problem for P2P VoD systems. This problem is a P2P replication problem. Previous studies on this problem mainly consider content availability, but fail to consider bandwidth availability of peers on the system level. In this paper, assuming that movie popularity is known, we first analyze bandwidth availability of peers on the system level, and then formulate the replication problem as a minimization problem. Based on the minimization problem, we derive two design guidelines. According to the two design guidelines, we propose a bandwidth-availability-based replication algorithm aiming at minimizing the server load, called BAB algorithm. BAB algorithm can make the replicas' distribution towards the optimal distribution in a distributed way. Furthermore, we consider some practical implementation issues of BAB algorithm. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that BAB algorithm outperforms the previously proposed algorithms in terms of reducing the server load and improving the streaming quality, in stable environment and dynamic environment, respectively.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth-Availability-Based Replication Strategy for P2P VoD Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342922900008"}
