However FS with a higher sampling rate requires the large amount of complexity in demodulation. In this paper a novel sampling point selection (SPS) scheme with MMSE equalization in FS OFDM receivers is proposed. On fast time varying multipath channels the proposed scheme selects the appropriate samples from the fractionally sampled signals. Through the computer simulation it is demonstrated that with the proposed scheme both path diversity gain and Doppler diversity gain can increase as compared to a conventional non SPS scheme.", "paper_title": "Sampling Point Selection Scheme for Fractional Sampling-OFDM Receivers on Fast Time-Varying Multipath Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000284448800034"}
