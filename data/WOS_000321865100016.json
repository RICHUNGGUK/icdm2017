These modal applications have to be executed in parallel on an MPSoC system in order to meet their real-time throughput constraints. However, no suitable approach exists that can automatically derive a temporal analysis model from a sequential specification containing while-loops with an unknown number of iterations. This paper introduces an approach to the automatic generation of a Structured Variable-rate Phased Dataflow (SVPDF) model from a sequential specification of a modal application. The real-time requirements of an application can be analyzed despite the presence of while-loops with an unknown number of iterations. It is shown that an algorithm that has a polynomial time computational complexity can be applied on the generated SVPDF model to determine whether a throughput constraint can be met. The enabler for the automatic generation of an SVPDF model is the decoupling of synchronization between tasks that contain different while-loops. A DVB-T radio transceiver illustrates the derivation of the SVPDF model.", "paper_title": "Automatic Dataflow Model Extraction from Modal Real-Time Stream Processing Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000321865100016"}
