The adoption of standardized systems such as WiMAX for emergency communications represents a significant advance in the off-the-shelf technologies for error detection and error correction. Since it is difficult to fully eliminate the Doppler effect under high speed moving environment, we propose an enhanced CRC-based error correction scheme that carries as much extra segmented frame Check Sequence (FCS) information as subblocks of emergency multicast/broadcast service (MBS) frame, called progressive and selective frame check sequence (PSFCS). In a mobile multihop relay (MMR) environment, a high-mobility mobile station might receive an emergency MBS frame more than once, so the PSFCS could be cross-referenced by duplicated frames received. Therefore the PSFCS achieves a significant performance improvement over the legacy FCS scheme in terms of error detection and correction of emergency MBS frames in a WiMAX MMR network operating in transparent mode. The experimental results show that the goodput and utilization of high-mobility mobile stations can be improved remarkably.", "paper_title": "PSFCS: Robust Emergency Communications Supporting High Mobility Based on WiMAX MMR Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000335325400001"}
