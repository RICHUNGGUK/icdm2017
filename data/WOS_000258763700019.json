The methodological basis of the calculations consists in discretization of the ST process through subdivision of the time axis in small segments. By this means, the process is converted into a binomial for which an algorithm, and a fast computer program have been developed; and most important of all, a tool is provided for searching for the optimal truncation. The influence of truncation by time on the Expected Test Time (ETT) characteristics was studied; and an improved truncation method, minimizing this influence, was developed. The distributions of the test times were determined. The type A plan characteristics in IEC 61124:2006 have substantial inconsistencies in the probabilities of types I & II errors (up to a factor of 2), and in the ETT (up to 17%). We checked these results by using the binomial-recursive method, and by simulation. The Type C plans, reproduced from GOST R27.402:2005, are consistent; but there is scope (and need) for substantial improvement of the search algorithm for the optimal parameters.", "paper_title": "Improvement on \"sequential testing\" in MIL-HDBK-781A and IEC 61124", "paper_id": "WOS:000258763700019"}
