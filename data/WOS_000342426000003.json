This fact leads to a poor tunability range and seriously degrades the usefulness of this class of filters. In order to address this issue, two methods are presented and detailed simulation results verifying the feasibility of the techniques are provided.", "paper_title": "MOS-only allpass filters with extended operating frequency range", "paper_id": "WOS:000342426000003"}
