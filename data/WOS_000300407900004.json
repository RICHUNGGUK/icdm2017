Consideration is also given to movement that is not taking place in parallel to the projection plane of the camera. The construction of the momentum template is followed by the application of an angular transform. Linear discriminant analysis is applied to angular coefficients for dimensionality reduction. Recognition is performed by comparing Euclidean distances in the resulting subspace. Experimental evaluation in comparison to other recent methods shows the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "VISUAL RECOGNITION OF EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES BASED ON MOMENTUM OF MOTION ENERGY MASS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300407900004"}
