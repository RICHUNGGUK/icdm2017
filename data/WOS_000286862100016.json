In this paper we give several generalizations of the theorem which are algebraic in nature. In our versions, a finiteness condition involving the action of a semigroup on a certain function plays the role of the finiteness of the index of similar to(L), while various algebraic structures including algebras, coalgebras, and bialgebras play the role of the finite automaton which accepts the language. We develop additional theory concerning the algebraic objects which so arise, and study the minimal ones. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
