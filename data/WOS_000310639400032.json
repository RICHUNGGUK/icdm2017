The negative voltage level shifter stabilizes its output voltage levels by a current compensation path. And the negative voltage doubler employs diode-connected PFETs for the substrate leakage current suppression. Designed in IBM 0.13-mu m CMOS technology and analyzed with BSIMv4.4 device models, the power consumption of the proposed negative voltage level shifter is just a few tens of nWs. And the substrate leakage current of the proposed PFET negative voltage doubler can be reduced to nA ranges from mu A ranges of its NFET counterparts.", "paper_title": "Negative voltage level shift in clamping circuits for passive wireless microsystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400032"}
