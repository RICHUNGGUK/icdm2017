Typically, these admission-controllers are based on sufficient (but not necessary) capacity bounds in order to maintain a low computational complexity. In this paper we present how exact admission-control for aperiodic tasks can be efficiently obtained. Our first result is an admission-controller for purely aperiodic task sets where the test has the same runtime complexity as utilization-based tests. Our second result is an extension of the previous controller for a baseload of periodic tasks. The runtime complexity of this test is lower than for any known exact admission-controller. In addition to presenting our main algorithm and evaluating its performance, we also discuss some general issues concerning admission-controllers and their implementation. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
