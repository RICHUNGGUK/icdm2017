In this paper, we deal with two must important factors, traffic load balancing and redundancy. The assigned weight for each link is dynamically computed according to the arrival and service rates via arrival rate dependent (ARD). By employing the adaptive-(A-ARD) mechanism, the network performance in terms of average waiting time was further improved. The simulation result showed that more than 20% performance improvement scheme of A-ARD, the reliability of the packet transmission was fulfilled. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
