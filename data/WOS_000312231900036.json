We used meta-analytical techniques to test if instructional support enhances learning in game-based learning (k = 107, N-adj = 3675). We found that instructional support in game-based learning environments improved learning (d = .34, p < .001). Additional moderator analyses revealed that the learning effect was largest when learning of skills was involved (d = .62, p < .001) and when the instructional support aimed at the selection of relevant new information (d = .46, p < .001). Furthermore, we found some evidence for a publication bias since the effect sizes for studies in peer-reviewed journals was significantly higher than for studies in proceedings and unpublished studies (journals: d = .44; proceedings: d = .08; unpublished: d = .14).
