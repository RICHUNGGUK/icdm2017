This paper investigates the use of an inexpensive passive method involving 3D surface reconstruction from video images taken at multiple views. The method that focuses on filling the reference model of an object to the target data is presented. For an upper dummy limb, the fitting of the model with the data shows a satisfactory result. The results of 15 measurements of different length between both reconstructed and actual dummy limb are highly correlate. The methodology developed is shown to be useful Jar prosthetic designers as an alternative to manual impression during the design.", "paper_title": "Multiviews Reconstruction for Prosthetic Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000298971400008"}
