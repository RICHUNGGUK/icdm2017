The signal path does not contain any switch, and fine-tuning of the filter parameters is implemented using programmable capacitors. A digital building block is implemented in the proposed band-pass filter to tune its central frequency as well as its bandwidth. The filter circuit is based on a biquad topology, which is designed and implemented with CMOS 0.18 mu m technology. Experimental results show a programming ability of the center frequency between 5.9 and 58 MHz, and the quality factor can be tuned from 0.36 to 10. These features are obtained for a total power consumption of less than 10.5 mW from a single 1.8 V power supply.", "paper_title": "Programmable monolithic Gm-C band-pass filter: design and experimental results", "paper_id": "WOS:000252481500003"}
