Mapping inter-domain traffic flows into existing service level agreements is, in general, a complex problem, for which some algorithms have recently been proposed in the literature. In this paper a modified version of a multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed, in order to optimize the utilization of domain resources from several perspectives: bandwidth, monetary cost, and routing trustworthiness. Results show trade-off solutions and \"optimal\" solutions for each perspective. The proposal is a useful tool in inter-domain management because it can assist and simplify the decision process.", "paper_title": "An approach to off-line inter-domain QoS-aware resource optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800021"}
