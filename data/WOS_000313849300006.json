Because of the limited projected field of view (PFOV) afforded by these displays, it was desirable to extend the virtual or geometric field of view (GFOV) beyond that natively afforded by the PFOV. In Study I, user feedback was gathered from our target user population on two display configurations: (1) a single large LCD; and (2) three smaller LCD screens. Participants were also exposed to four GFOV settings (65 degrees, 80 degrees, 95 degrees, 110 degrees) using either display. The majority of participants preferred and were most comfortable with the three-screen configuration with the highest GFOV setting tested (110 degrees). In order for driving simulation to produce realistic experiences, drivers' perception of speed should correspond with real world experiences. However, changing the PFOV/GFOV ratio has been shown to alter perceived speed. Therefore, the purpose of Study 2 was to better understand the relationship between speed perception and the GFOV/PFOV ratio in a way that would be useful to simulation practitioners using a small-footprint driving simulator. Using the DriveSafety CDS-250, participants performed a speed matching task using six different GFOV conditions while the PFOV was held constant. Target speeds were presented in three appropriate simulated environments: 25 mph in a residential area, 45 mph in a commercial area, and 65 mph on a freeway. In general, perceived speed was found to decrease with larger GFOVs. However, no GFOV tested produced accurate speed perception; on average, all participants underestimated their speeds using all GFOVs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
