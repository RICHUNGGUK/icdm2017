NFPR is domain independent, provides easy to use API for integration with other systems, and comes with specialized tool (wizard) for creation of NFPR software components. The most important feature of NFPR is its flexibility, that allows teachers to create their own set of pedagogical rules. The proposed model has been implemented and tested with simulated data. Our effort in bringing neuro-fuzzy recommender to the field of TEL (Technology Enhanced Learning) seems to be the first attempt of its kind. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
