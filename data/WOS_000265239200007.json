It is easily seen that these sets cannot be effectively computed in general. The Higman-Haines sets are the languages of all scattered subwords of a given language as well as the sets of all words that contain some word of a given language as a scattered subword. Recently, the exact level of unsolvability of Higman-Haines sets was studied in [8]. Here we focus on language families whose Higman-Haines sets are effectively constructible. In particular, we study the size of descriptions of Higman-Haines sets for the lower classes of the Chomsky hierarchy, namely for the family of regular, linear context-free, and context-free languages. We prove upper and lower bounds on the size of descriptions of these sets for general and unary languages.", "paper_title": "More on the Size of Higman-Haines Sets: Effective Constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000265239200007"}
