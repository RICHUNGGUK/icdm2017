To describe the system's ability for reaching consensus, a new concept about the generalized algebraic connectivity is defined for strongly connected networks and then extended to the strongly connected components of the directed network containing a spanning tree. Some sufficient conditions are derived for reaching second-order consensus in multiagent systems with nonlinear dynamics based on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and Lyapunov control approach. Finally, simulation examples are given to verify the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Second-Order Consensus for Multiagent Systems With Directed Topologies and Nonlinear Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000277774700029"}
