Concept maps that provide visual languages for organizing and representing knowledge may complement Web ontologies in several aspects to support efficient knowledge reuse. In this paper, we propose, on top of the Semantic Web technology, an interactive visual model that extends Web ontology with concept map for exploring Web ontologies. We propose several algorithms from the point of view of the graph theory to analyze and uncover some underlying characteristics, to enhance Web ontology exploration in some novel aspects.", "paper_title": "Concept map model for web ontology exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000048"}
