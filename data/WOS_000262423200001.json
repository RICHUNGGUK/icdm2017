However, existing instruction set customization methodologies do not lend well for mapping custom instructions on to commercial FPGA architectures. In this paper, we propose a design exploration framework that provides for rapid identification of a reduced set of profitable custom instructions and their area costs on commercial architectures without the need for time consuming hardware synthesis process. A novel clustering strategy is used to estimate the utilization of the LUT (Look-Up Table) based FPGAs for the chosen custom instructions. Our investigations show that the area costs computations using the proposed hardware estimation technique on 20 custom instructions are shown to be within 8% of those obtained using hardware synthesis. A systematic approach has been adopted to select the most profitable custom instruction candidates. Our investigations show that this leads to notable reduction in the number of custom instructions with only marginal degradation in performance. Simulations based on domain-specific application sets from the MiBench and MediaBench benchmark suites show that on average, more than 25% area utilization efficiency (performance/area) can be achieved with the proposed technique.
