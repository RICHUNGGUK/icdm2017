These techniques are justified by Kripke semantics and are the backbone of a tableau based theorem prover (PITP) implemented in C++. PITP and some known theorem provers are compared using the formulas of ILTP benchmark library. It turns out that PITP is, at the moment, the propositional prover that solves most formulas of the library. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
