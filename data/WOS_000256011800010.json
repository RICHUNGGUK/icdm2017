The compressed mode, with variable transmission gaps and power levels, is standardized to support the inter-frequency/system handover. In this article, a capacity-based compressed mode algorithm which considers potential impacts on the capacity and the priority of operating the compressed mode measurement is proposed to reduce the use of system resources while maintaining the UMTS-to-GSM border-cell handover quality. The performance of the proposed algorithm will be studied based on UMTS simulation platform.", "paper_title": "Capacity-based compressed mode control algorithm for inter-system measurements in UMTS system", "paper_id": "WOS:000256011800010"}
