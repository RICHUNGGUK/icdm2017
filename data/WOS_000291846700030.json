Compared with the original APSO, in our IAPSO, the maximum movement velocity of the particles changes dynamically, a modified replacement procedure with no introduced additional parameters is employed in constraint handling, and the state of the optimization run and the diversity in the population are taken into account in stopping criteria. It is shown that the proposed JOPRA algorithm can fast converge to the optimum and reach larger total data rate and utility while less total power is consumed. The efficiency of our approach is further illustrated via numerical comparison with the original APSO. This work is a beneficial attempt to integrate adaptive evolutionary algorithms with the resource allocation in wireless ad hoc networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
