Thermodynamical parameters were determined by hessian quantum calculations performed using a self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) method, taking into account solvent (dichloromethane) effects. The results allowed the estimation of dehydration enthalpies, entropies and free energies for the hydrated free b33 podand and its corresponding K+ cation complex in dichloromethane. The low absolute values found for the dehydration free energies as well as the structural features found for the optimized structures and the corresponding basis superposition calculated interaction energies, support the hypothesis of an interfacial complexation type mechanism governing the assisted extraction of K+ from an aqueous toward an organic phase, in liquid/liquid extraction.", "paper_title": "Dehydration of a polyether type extraction agent and of the corresponding K+ complex: insights into liquid-liquid extraction mechanisms by quantum chemical methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000310240800013"}
