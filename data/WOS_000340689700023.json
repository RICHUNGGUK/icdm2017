This paper proposes a new rating model based on a support vector machine with monotonicity constraints derived from the prior knowledge of financial experts. Experiments conducted on real-world data sets show that the proposed method, not only data driven but also domain knowledge oriented, can help correct the loss of monotonicity in data occurring during the collecting process, and performs better than the conventional counterpart.
