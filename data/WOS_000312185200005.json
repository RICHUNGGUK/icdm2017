For modelling purposes, formalisms with multi-way synchronisations are considered. For the modular verification technique to work, a specific type of synchronisation is required for which a sufficient and necessary condition is identified. It is a requirement on the semantics of the formalism, which is restricted to permit simultaneous execution only of component moves that make reference to each other. Implications for modular verification of several well-known formalisms for concurrent systems are investigated.", "paper_title": "On Conditions for Modular Verification in Systems of Synchronising Components", "paper_id": "WOS:000312185200005"}
