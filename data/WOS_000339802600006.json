It can enable efficient resource utilization and support heterogeneous bandwidth demands in cost-effective, highly available, and energy-effective manner. In case of aggregation elastic optical network node failure, to ensure a high-level quality of service for user request after the failure becomes a research focus. In this paper, we present a novel multi-stratum resources resilience (MSRR) architecture for the data center services in software defined data center interconnection based on IP over elastic optical networks. The MSRR can enable joint optimization of IP network, elastic optical network, and application stratum resources, and enhance the service resilience and the data center responsiveness to the dynamic end-to-end service demands. Additionally, a service-aware resource collaborative resilience strategy for MSRR is introduced based on the proposed architecture, which can provide the restoration using the multiple stratums resources in case of failure. The overall feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture are experimentally verified on our testbed. Moreover, the network performances are quantitatively evaluated through the simulation under heavy traffic load scenario in terms of path blocking probability, resource occupation rate, and path resilience latency.", "paper_title": "Multi-stratum resources resilience in software defined data center interconnection based on IP over elastic optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339802600006"}
