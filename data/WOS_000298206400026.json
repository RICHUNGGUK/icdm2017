We show that each can be solved as a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems with only box constraints. We propose relaxed SVM and relaxed LSSVM formulations that correspond to a single problem in the corresponding SUMT sequence. We also propose a SMO like algorithm to solve the relaxed formulations that works by updating individual Lagrange multipliers. The methods yield comparable or better results on large benchmark datasets than classical SVM and LSSVM formulations, at substantially higher speeds. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
