It is s-list colorable (or s-choosable) if for any assignment of a list of s colors to each of its vertices, there is a vertex coloring assigning to each vertex a color from its list, so that no edge is monochromatic. We prove that for every positive integer r, there is a function d(r)(s) such that no r-uniform simple hypergraph with average degree at least d(r)(s) is s-list-colorable. This extends a similar result for graphs, due to the first author, but does not give as good estimates of d(r)(s) as are known for d(2)(s), since our proof only shows that for each fixed r >= 2, d(r)(s) <= 2(crsr-1). We use the result to prove that for any finite set of points X in the plane, and for any finite integer s, one can assign a list of s distinct colors to each point of the plane so that any coloring of the plane that colors each point by a color from its list contains a monochromatic isometric copy of X.
