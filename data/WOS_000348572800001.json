It is proved that any such uninorm is determined by three unary functions and vice versa. As a by-product, we obtain the characterizations of smooth t-norms, smooth t-conorms through additive generators and show that on a finite chain, there exists no counterpart of the class of uninorms continuous in ]0, 1[(2).", "paper_title": "On Weakly Smooth Uninorms on Finite Chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000348572800001"}
