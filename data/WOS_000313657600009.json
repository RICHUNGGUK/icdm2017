Firstly, a variable weight combination load forecasting model for power load is proposed and discussed. Secondly, the training data are extracted from power load data through multiwavelet transform. Lastly, the obtained data are trained through a variable weight combination model. BP network, RBF network and wavelet neural network are adopted as the training network, and the trained data from three neural networks are input to a three-layer feedforward neural network for the load forecasting. Simulation results show that accuracy of the combination load forecasting model proposed in the paper is higher than any one single network model and the combination forecast model of three neural networks without preprocessing method of multiwavelet transform.", "paper_title": "A novel method of short-term load forecasting based on multiwavelet transform and multiple neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600009"}
