We study propagation rules for these point sets, which state how one can obtain (u, m, e, s)-nets and (u, e, s)-sequences with new parameter configurations from existing ones. In this way, we show generalizations and extensions of several well-known construction methods that have previously been shown for (t, m, s)-nets and (t, s)-sequences. We also develop a duality theory for digital (u, m, e, s)-nets and present a new construction of such nets based on global function fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
