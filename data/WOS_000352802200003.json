The PID method optimizes the lengths of the time windows over which proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is performed and can be highly effective in building reduced-order models for convective problems. The performance of these POD models with and without using the PID approach is investigated by applying these methods to the unsteady lock-exchange flow problem. This benchmark problem exhibits a strong shear flow induced by a temperature jump and results in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This problem is considered a challenging benchmark problem for the development of reduced-order models. The reference solutions are obtained by direct numerical simulations of the vorticity and temperature transport equations using a compact fourth-order-accurate scheme. We compare the accuracy of reduced-order models developed with different numbers of POD basis functions and different numbers of principal intervals. A linear interpolation model is constructed to obtain basis functions when varying physical parameters. The predictive performance of our models is then analyzed over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. It is shown that the PID approach provides a significant improvement in accuracy over the standard Galerkin POD reduced-order model. This numerical assessment of the PID shows that it may represent a reliable model reduction tool for convection-dominated, unsteady-flow problems.
