First, using a geometric construction, we prove that for every permutation pi there is at least one column-convex permutomino P such that pi(1) (P) = pi or pi(2) (P) = pi. In the second part of the paper, we show how, for any given permutation p, it is possible to define a set of logical implications F (pi) on the points of pi, and prove that there exists a column-convex permutomino P such that pi(1) (P) = pi if and only if F (pi) is satisfiable. This property can be then used to give a characterization of the set of column-convex permutominoes P such that pi(1) (P) = pi.", "paper_title": "Polygons Drawn from Permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000322028300008"}
