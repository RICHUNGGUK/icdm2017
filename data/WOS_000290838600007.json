In this paper neural networks with instantaneous electrical couplings and time-delayed excitatory/inhibitory chemical connections are considered and scaling of the spike phase synchronization with the unified time-delay in the network is investigated. The findings revealed that in both excitatory and inhibitory chemical connections, the phase synchronization could be enhanced by introducing time-delay. The role of the variability of the neuronal external current in the phase synchronization is also investigated. As individual neuron models, Hindmarsh-Rose model is adopted and the network structure of the electrical and chemical connections is considered to be Watts-Strogatz and directed random networks, respectively.
