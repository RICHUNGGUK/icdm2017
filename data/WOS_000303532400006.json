The design variables are section depth and steel reinforcement areas. State equations are those of equilibrium with compression depth as state variable. The Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions are solved analytically and formulas for nondimensional design and state variables are obtained in four cases: Two singly-reinforced solutions with either maximum allowable depth or smaller; Two doubly-reinforced with maximum allowable depth and either maximum compression depth or smaller. Each of the solutions is optimal in a region of the plane 'nondimensional bending moment'aEuro\"aEuro similar to cost-effectiveness ratio of concrete to steel'. The formulas are for an arbitrary concrete constitutive law with tension cut-off and are specialized for the parabola-rectangle law of Eurocode 2.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of rectangular RC sections for ultimate bending strength", "paper_id": "WOS:000303532400006"}
