Thus, website designers have to take an increasing number of criteria (cost, delay, quality, security, maintenance) into account during design process to satisfy the needs. Objective: The objective of this paper was to present our WISDOM method that: guides the designer through the website design process, proposes design solutions based on already existing solutions for online website design, facilitates the choice of software components to implement specific services, and speeds up website construction. Method: The originality of our method is that it links the design process to formalized experience and a software component characterization that allows both functional and non-functional aspects to be considered. Results: This method relies on the state-of-the-art strengths in the website design process, modeling dimensions, Model-Driven Engineering and the patterns approach. We propose an implementation of our method as a dedicated website which helps website design and provides a website analysis catalog and a software component analysis catalog. Conclusion: Our analysis of the method's use highlights that formalizing the steps of the design process helps designers, especially novice designers, to design a website: our analysis of the tool's use highlights its efficiency for rapid website development and its use of the \"website family\" concept. The results are so very encouraging for both method and tool: both facilitate website design by reusing existing solutions and components. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
