Using the maximum-likelihood estimation technique, we first derive an optimal decision rule, which is optimal in the viewpoint of probability of detection. Based on the derived optimal decision rule, a practical and simple decision rule is also developed, and its performance is assessed for both single dwell and double dwell acquisition systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed acquisition scheme significantly outperforms the previously proposed schemes in frequency-selective fading channels.", "paper_title": "Maximum-Likelihood Acquisition of Spread-Spectrum Signals in Frequency-Selective Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738700027"}
