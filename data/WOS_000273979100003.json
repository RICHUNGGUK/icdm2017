This paper introduces a novel visualization technique which preserves the basic properties of the boundary element methods. The proposed algorithm does not require any domain discretization and is based on the direct and automatic identification of isolines. Another critical aspect of the visualization of domain results in BE analysis is the effort required to evaluate results in interior points. In order to tackle this issue, the present article also provides a comparison between the performance of two different BE formulations (conventional and hybrid). In addition, this paper presents an overview of the most common post-processing and visualization techniques in BE analysis, such as the classical algorithms of scan line and the interpolation over a domain discretization. The results presented herein show that the proposed algorithm offers a very high performance compared with other visualization procedures.", "paper_title": "Post-processing and visualization techniques in 2D boundary element analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000273979100003"}
