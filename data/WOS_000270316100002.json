The basic idea is to formulate a finite volume method with an optimum spatial difference, using the Locally Exact Numerical Scheme (LENS), leading to a Finite Variable Difference Method as introduced by Sakai [Katsuhiro Sakai, A new finite variable difference method with application to locally exact numerical scheme, journal of Computational Physics, 124 (1996) pp. 301-308.], for the linear convection-diffusion equations obtained by using a relaxation system. Source terms are treated with the well-balanced scheme of Jin [Shi Jin, A steady-state capturing method for hyperbolic systems with geometrical source terms, Mathematical Modeling Numerical Analysis, 35 (4) (2001) pp. 631-645]. Bench-mark test problems for scalar and vector conservation laws in one and two dimensions are solved using this new algorithm and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme in capturing the flow features accurately.
