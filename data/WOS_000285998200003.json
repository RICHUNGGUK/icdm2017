We consider here the now common case in which each voter expresses some (binary) judgment regarding each of a multiplicity of independent issues and assume that each voter has some fixed (unknown) probability of making a correct judgment for any given issue. We leverage the fact that multiple votes by each voter are known in order to demonstrate, both analytically and empirically, that a method based on maximum likelihood estimation is superior to the simple majority rule for arriving at true collective judgments.", "paper_title": "Distilling the wisdom of crowds: weighted aggregation of decisions on multiple issues", "paper_id": "WOS:000285998200003"}
