In this paper, the graphs and digraphs of near-extreme min-ranks are studied. Those graphs and digraphs correspond to the ICSI instances having near-extreme transmission rates when using optimal scalar linear index codes. In particular, it is shown that the decision problem whether a digraph has min-rank two is NP-complete. By contrast, the same question for graphs can be answered in polynomial time. In addition, a circuit-packing bound is revisited, and several families of digraphs, optimal with respect to this bound, whose min-ranks can be found in polynomial time, are presented.", "paper_title": "Optimal Index Codes With Near-Extreme Rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000331902400011"}
