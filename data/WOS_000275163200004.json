The general idea behind offline foveation is to blur video regions where no or a small number of previewers look without decreasing the subjective quality for later viewers. It relies on the fact that peripheral vision is reduced compared to central vision, and the observation that during free-viewing humans' gaze positions generally coincide when watching video. In this article, we conduct two experiments to assess how offline foveation affects viewing behavior and subjective quality. In the first experiment, 15 subjects free-viewed six video clips before and after offline foveation whereas in the second experiment we had 17 subjects assessing the quality of these videos after one, two, and three consecutive viewings. Eye movements were measured during the experiments. Results showed that, although offline foveation prior to encoding with H. 264 yielded data reductions up to 52% (20% average) on the tested videos, it had little or no effect on where people looked, their intersubject dispersion, fixation duration, saccade amplitude, or the experienced quality during first-time viewing. However, seeing the videos more than once increased the intersubject dispersion and decreased the subjective quality. In view of these results, we discuss the usage of offline foveated video in practical applications.", "paper_title": "Effect of Compressed Offline Foveated Video on Viewing Behavior and Subjective Quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000275163200004"}
