The algorithms define a territory around each individual to prevent crowding in any region. This maintains diversity while facilitating the fast execution of the algorithm. We conducted extensive experiments on a variety of test problems and demonstrated that our algorithm performs well against the leading multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. We also developed a mechanism to incorporate preference information in order to focus on the regions that are appealing to the decision maker. Our experiments show that the algorithm approximates the Pareto-optimal solutions in the desired region very well when we incorporate the preference information.", "paper_title": "A Territory Defining Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms and Preference Incorporation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283535700011"}
