In order to handle this problem conveniently, a fast dynamic cloud method based on Delaunay graph mapping strategy is proposed in this paper. A dynamic cloud method makes use of algebraic mapping principles and therefore points can be accurately redistributed in the flow field without any iteration. In this way, the structure of the gridless clouds is not necessarily changed so that the clouds regeneration can be avoided successfully. The spatial derivatives of the mathematical modeling of the flow are directly determined by using weighted least-squares method in each cloud of points, and then numerical fluxes can be obtained. A dual time-stepping method is further implemented to advance the two-dimensional Euler equations in arbitrary Lagarangian-Eulerian formulation in time. Finally, unsteady transonic flows over two different oscillating airfoils are simulated with the above method and results obtained are in good agreement with the experimental data.
