The base station (BS) in such heterogeneous networks will play the role of bridge and router between the IEEE 802.16 subscriber stations (SSs) and MPLS networks. However, there is no such integrated solution so far and the switching efficiency of the BS should be considered as well. This paper, therefore, adopts a cross-layer fashion (from network layer to MAC layer) to design the end-to-end label switching protocol (ELSP) for filling this gap. ELSP provides the mechanism of end-to-end (SS-to-SS) and layer 2 switching transfer for switching performance enhancement by assigning the SS with the MPLS labels (M-labels). The M-label can be carried by the IEEE 802.16e extended subheader within the MAC protocol data unit (MPDU), which is fully compliant with the IEEE 802.16e standard. The security issue caused by M-label usage is also concerned and solved in this paper. This paper also reveals an extra advantage that the switching delay of the BS achieved by ELSP can be as low as hardware-accelerated IP lookup mechanism, e.g., ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). Simulation results show that ELSP efficiently improves the end-to-end transfer delay as well as the throughput for WiMPLS heterogeneous networks. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
