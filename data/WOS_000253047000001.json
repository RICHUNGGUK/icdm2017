Compared with the previous researches, the proposed algorithm is superior for implementing the modular exponentiation in RNS. Besides, the way to extend the proposed algorithm to fast modular exponentiation in RNS is also shown. Using the proposed extension technique, the algorithm can be easily and efficiently applied to any other square-and-multiply methods for fast modular exponentiation in RNS.", "paper_title": "Efficient residue number system iterative modular multiplication algorithm for fast modular exponentiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253047000001"}
