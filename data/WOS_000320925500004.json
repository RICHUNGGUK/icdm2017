We combine the forward-backward and descent direction ideas together, and thus present the unified algorithmic framework of forward-backward-based descent methods for solving the CVI. A new iterate of such a method is generated by a prediction-correction fashion, where the predictor is yielded by the forward-backward method and then the predictor is corrected by a descent step. We derive some implementable forward-backward-based descent algorithms for some concrete cases of the CVI, and verify their numerical efficiency via preliminary numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Forward-backward-based descent methods for composite variational inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000320925500004"}
