Due to the drastic fluctuation of the host load in the Cloud, accurately predicting the host load remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new prediction method that combines the Phase Space Reconstruction method and the Group Method of Data Handling based on an Evolutionary Algorithm. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated using two real-world load traces. The first is the load trace in a traditional distributed system, whereas the second is in a Google data center. The results show that the proposed method achieves a better prediction performance than some state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "A new method based on PSR and EA-GMDH for host load prediction in cloud computing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000337800400019"}
