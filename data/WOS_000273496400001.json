OBS has been proposed to couple the benefits of both circuit and packet switching for the \"on demand\" use of capacity in the future optical Internet. in such a case, QoS support imposes some important challenges before this technology is deployed. This paper takes a broader view on QoS, including QoS differentiation not only at the burst but also at the transport levels for OBS networks. A classification of existing QoS differentiation mechanisms for OBS is given and their efficiency and complexity are comparatively discussed. We provide numerical examples on how QoS differentiation with respect to burst loss rate and transport layer throughput can be achieved in OBS networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
