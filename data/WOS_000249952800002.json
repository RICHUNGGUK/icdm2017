Different methodologies have been proposed so far for the analysis and design of Multichannel Adaptive WISs, specifically focused on the front-end layer or the back-end layer, but no methodology has aimed to cover all the lifecycle and to design all the components that characterize Multichannel Adaptive WIS. This paper fills such a gap, by presenting UM-MAIS (Unified Methodology for Multichannel Adaptive Information Systems), a new methodology that capitalizes on well-established existing methods. It supports the analysis and design of the various components of Multichannel Adaptive WISs (including the user's experience) in a comprehensive and unified manner with special emphasis on context modeling, personalization, and adaptation.", "paper_title": "The UM-MAIS methodology for multi-channel adaptive web information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249952800002"}
