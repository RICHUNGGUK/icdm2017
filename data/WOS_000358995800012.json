Based on the group structure in group mobility, we propose two mobility control techniques; group formation enforcement and group purposeful movement. Both techniques can be used to increase the contact opportunities between groups by extending the group's reachability. In addition, they can be easily integrated into some existing DTN routing schemes under group mobility to effectively expedite the packet delivery. This paper is divided into 2 parts. First, we study how our proposed mobility control schemes reduce the packet delivery delay in DTNs by integrating them into one simple routing scheme called group-epidemic routing (G-ER). For each scheme, we analytically derive the cumulative density function of the packet delivery delay to show how it can effectively reduce the packet delivery delay. Then, based on our second proposed technique, the group purposeful movement, we design a new DTN routing scheme, called purposeful movement assisted routing (PMAR), to further reduce the packet delay. Extensive simulations in NS2 have been conducted to show the significant improvement of PMAR over G-ER under different practical network conditions.", "paper_title": "Performance Improvement of Delay-Tolerant Networks with Mobility Control under Group Mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000358995800012"}
