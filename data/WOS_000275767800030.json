Research findings indicated that: (1) AHP/DEA is successfully used to derive importance rankings of items of human resource practices to organizational performance; (2) participation is the most important item in human resource practices and employee relations in organizational performance for both the Taiwanese and Chinese samples in all types of culture; (3) employee relations in organizational performance is the less important item for both the Taiwanese and Chinese samples in common culture than in others; (4) motivation is the least important item in human resource practices for the development culture type, as is hiring for the common and stratum culture type, and compensation for the rational culture type in both the Taiwanese and Chinese samples; (5) hiring is the most important item in human resource practices for development culture as is motivation for rational culture in both the Taiwanese and Chinese samples; (6) innovation is the most important item in organizational performance for common culture, as are employee performance, productivity, and perceived market performance for rational culture in both the Taiwanese and Chinese samples.", "paper_title": "IMPACTS OF HUMAN RESOURCE PRACTICES ON ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE: PERSPECTIVES OF TAIWANESE AND CHINESE HIGH-TECH COMPANIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800030"}
