Fuzzy combiner harnesses the support values from classifiers to provide final response having no other restrictions on their structure. We compare proposed combination methods with ECOC and two variations of decision templates, based on Euclidean and symmetric distance. The effectiveness of the proposed combination method based on the fuzzy logic theory is also evaluated via computer experiments carried out on benchmark datasets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
