The authors developed it new looping scheme and a direct quadrilateral forming algorithm based on advanced front techniques. This generator overcomes the limitations of previous studies such as line constraint, unmeshed hole and mesh refinement. A qualitative test reveals that our algorithm is reliable and suitable at the field needed for very accurate results. The developed direct method to handle line-typed features automatically makes the multiple discretizations without any user interaction and modification. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
