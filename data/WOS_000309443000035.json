This provides functional localized information about the state of the retinal neurons. Analysis of multifocal electroretinography signals can be used for diagnosing different types of optic neuropathies (glaucomatous, demyelinating and ischemic ethiology). In order to obtain a reliable diagnosis, it is necessary to apply advanced processing algorithms (morphological, frequency and time-frequency analysis, etc.) to the multifocal electroretinography signal. This paper presents a software application developed in MATLAB (R) (MathWorks Inc., MA) designed to perform advanced multifocal electroretinography signal analysis and classification. This intuitive application, mfERG_LAB, is used to plot the signals, apply various algorithms to them and present the data in an appropriate format. The application's computational power and modular structure make it suitable for use in clinical settings as a powerful and innovative diagnostic tool, as well as in research and teaching settings as a means of assessing new algorithms.
