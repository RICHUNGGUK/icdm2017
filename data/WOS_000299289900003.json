With these advantages, this paper proposes an RWNN-based adaptive control (RBAC) system for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) uncertain nonlinear systems. The RBAC system is composed of a neural controller and a bounding compensator. The neural controller uses an RWNN to online mimic an ideal controller, and the bounding compensator can provide smooth and chattering-free stability compensation. From the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that all signals in the closed-loop RBAC system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the proposed RBAC system is applied to the MIMO uncertain nonlinear systems such as a mass-spring-damper mechanical system and a two-link robotic manipulator system. Simulation results verify that the proposed RBAC system can achieve favorable tracking performance with desired robustness without any chattering phenomenon in the control effort.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE CONTROL FOR MIMO UNCERTAIN NONLINEAR SYSTEMS USING RECURRENT WAVELET NEURAL NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000299289900003"}
