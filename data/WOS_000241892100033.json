And a new optimization algorithm, Small-World Optimization Algorithm (SWOA) is explored. Compared with the corresponding Genetic Algorithms (GAs), the simulation experiment results of some complex functions optimization indicate that SWOA can enhance the diversity of the population, avoid the prematurity and GA deceptive problem to some extent, and have the high convergence speed. SWOA is shown to be an effective strategy to solve complex tasks.", "paper_title": "Small-world optimization algorithm for function optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100033"}
