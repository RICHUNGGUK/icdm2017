For every node consider the shortest cycle containing this node and z in G. The cycle-radius of G is the maximum length of a cycle in this set. Let H be a directed graph obtained by directing the edges of C. The cycle-radius of H is similarly defined except that cycles are replaced by directed closed walks. We prove that there exists for every nonnegative edge weight function an orientation H of G whose cycle-radius equals that of G if and only if G is series-parallel. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
