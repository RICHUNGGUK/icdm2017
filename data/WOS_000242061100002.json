A heuristic algorithm-Difficult Reuse First (DRF) is used to sub-optimally solve the Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem. This algorithm can minimize the total wavelength mileage of a ring, while guaranteeing the required availability degree of each connection. The simulation results show that in the uniform traffic case, under different traffic proportion scenarios, the used wavelength mileage decreases while the reused wavelength mileage increases, as the required availability degree of connection decreases. This rule also fits in the nonuniform traffic case.", "paper_title": "Design for WDM rings based on differentiated path availability", "paper_id": "WOS:000242061100002"}
