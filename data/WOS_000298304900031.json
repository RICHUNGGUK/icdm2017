The model integrates the two parts of Bayes' equation to measure saliency, each part of which was considered separately in the previous models. The proposed model measures saliency by computing local kernel density estimation of features in the center-surround region and global kernel density estimation of features at each pixel across the whole image. Under the proposed model, a saliency detection method is presented that extracts DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) magnitude of local region around each pixel as the feature. Experiments show that the proposed model not only performs competitively on psychological patterns and better than the current state-of-the-art models on human visual fixation data, but also is robust against signal uncertainty.", "paper_title": "A Novel Bayes' Theorem-Based Saliency Detection Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304900031"}
