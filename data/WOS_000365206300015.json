Most of the nonrigid image registration algorithms are found to be unsuitable for hardware implementation because of their nonlinearity and computationally intensive nature. In this paper, an algorithm for nonrigid image registration based on Demons approximation is proposed. The algorithm has been simulated in MATLAB and results show a 15% improvement in peak-signal-to-noise-ratio with a 17% reduction in registration time for 256 x 256 image over the original Demons algorithm. The proposed algorithm is synthesized in Virtex6-xc6vlx760-2-ff1760 and maximum synthesized frequency is found to be 174 MHz. The proposed architecture provides the low cost, high-speed solution for the registration process, which is also helpful for making a portable system.", "paper_title": "VLSI-Assisted Nonrigid Registration Using Modified Demons Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300015"}
