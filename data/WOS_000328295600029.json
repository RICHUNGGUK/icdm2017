This paper presents an optimizing framework for localization based on barycentric coordinates. The framework consists of two components. The first component retains the structure revealed by the distances between pairs of nodes; the second component constrains the boundary nodes to maintain the distance with their neighbor nodes. A hybrid localization algorithm is derived on top of the optimizing framework. A part of the computation is performed collaboratively by nodes, whereas the rest is executed on the sink node. Experimental results show that the proposed localization algorithm obtains lower location errors without higher communication costs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
