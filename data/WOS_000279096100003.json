ACO-CF is a MAX-MIN ant system, which is implemented in the hyper-cube framework to automatically scale the objective functions of machine-part cell formation problems. As an intensification strategy, we integrate an iteratively local search into ACO-CF. Based on the assignment of the machines or parts, the local search can optimally reassign parts or machines to cells. We carry out a series of experiments to investigate the performance of ACO-CF on some standard benchmark problems. The comparison study between ACO-CF and other methods proposed in the literature indicates that ACO-CF is one of the best approaches for solving the machine-part cell formation problem.
