Due to the similarity between the transmembrane domains of the alpha(1)-AR sub-types, and the serotonin receptor subtype 1A (5-HT1A-R), currently used alpha(1)-AR subtype-selective drugs to treat BPH display considerable off-target affinity for the 5-HT1A-R, leading to side effects. We describe the construction and validation of pharmacophores for 5-HT1A-R agonists and antagonists. Through the structural diversity of the training sets used in their development, these pharmacophores define the properties of a compound needed to bind to 5-HT1A receptors. Using these and previously published pharmacophores in virtual screening and profiling, we have identified unique chemical compounds (hits) that fit the requirements to bind to our target, the alpha(1A)-AR, selectively over the off-target, the 5-HT1A-R. Selected hits have been obtained and their affinities for alpha(1A)-AR, alpha(1B)-AR and 5-HT1A-R determined in radioligand binding assays, using membrane preparations which contain human receptors expressed individually. Three of the tested hits demonstrate statistically significant selectivity for alpha(1A)-AR over 5-HT1A-R. All seven tested hits bind to alpha(1A)-AR, with two compounds displaying K-i values below 1 mu M, and a further two K-i values of around 10 mu M. The insights and knowledge gained through the development of the new 5-HT1A-R pharmacophores will greatly aid in the design and synthesis of derivatives of our lead compound, and allow the generation of more efficacious and selective ligands.", "paper_title": "5-HT1A receptor pharmacophores to screen for off-target activity of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists", "paper_id": "WOS:000320505600002"}
