Development of this model was triggered by the need to perform probabilistic reliability evaluations on the NEAREST (North East Asia Region Electric Systems Tied) interconnection. The TEAG is the basis for the newly developed interconnection systems reliability evaluation computer program, NEAREL. The model is capable of considering uncertainties associated with generators, tie lines, and the tied grids. Reliability evaluations for six interconnection scenarios involving the power systems of six countries in the Asian north eastern region were performed using NEAREL. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine reasonable tie line capacities for three interconnected country scenarios of the six countries. Test results and summarized comments on the scenarios are included in the paper.", "paper_title": "RELIABILITY EVALUATION FOR INTERCONNECTION PLANNING IN NORTH EAST ASIA", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700015"}
