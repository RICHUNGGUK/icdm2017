Then, a numerical filter is implemented that preserves positivity and non-oscillatory. The numerical results of both one-dimensional linear advection and two-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson simulations show that the numerical diffusion with the fourth-degree polynomial interpolation is suppressed more than with the cubic polynomial interpolation. It is also found that inherent conservation properties of the Vlasov equation can be improved by combining numerical fluxes of the upwind-biased and central fourth-degree polynomial interpolations.
