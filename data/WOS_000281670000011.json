This prediction model inherits the advantages of ER approach, which can deal with precise data, incomplete data and fuzzy data with nonlinear characteristic. In this model, the input signals transformed using rule based information transformation technique, are aggregated by analytical ER approach, and then the outputs of prediction model are constructed according to the types of system outputs. In addition, two fault decision criteria are defined to conduct fault identification. To overcome the difficulty in determining model parameters accurately and subjectively, a nonlinear optimization model is constructed and the optimal parameters are obtained. Two experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results show that the established prediction model and the presented parameters optimization methods can deal with fault prediction problem effectively.", "paper_title": "Fault prediction model based on evidential reasoning approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000281670000011"}
