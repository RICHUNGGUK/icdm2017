In this paper, we propose an efficient method for fast generation of a large number of blue noise samples using a small initial patch of Poisson-disk samples that can be generated with any existing approach. Our main idea is to convolve this set of samples with another to generate our final set of samples. We use the convolution theorem from signal processing to show that the spectrum of the resulting sample set preserves the blue noise properties. Since our method is approximate, we have error with respect to the true Poisson-disk samples, but we show both mathematically and practically that this error is only a function of the number of samples in the small initial patch and is therefore bounded. Our method is parallelizable and we demonstrate an implementation of it on a GPU, running more than 10 times faster than any previous method and generating more than 49 million 2D samples per second. We can also use the proposed approach to generate multidimensional blue noise samples.", "paper_title": "Fast Generation of Approximate Blue Noise Point Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000305993000018"}
