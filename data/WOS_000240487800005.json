A controlled, quantitative study with 28 medically naive participants using a task abstracted from clinical use of laboratory results found that both display formats supported rapid and accurate decision making. Distribution of the search targets significantly affected speed, with decisions in linear format made 13% faster (4.7 sec) when all targets could be viewed on a single screen than when targets required scrolling between several screens and in hierarchical format 15% faster (5.1 sec) when all the targets were confined within one category. Performance was equivalent regardless of the relative order of the target results and data in the laboratory report. In a qualitative study, 7 physicians used the displays to perform a realistic diagnosis. Physicians were comfortable with both display formats, but preference varied with clinical experience. The 5 less experienced clinicians favored hierarchy+elision, whereas the 2 highly experienced clinicians tended to prefer the linear display.", "paper_title": "Effective display of medical laboratory report results on small screens: Evaluation of linear and hierarchical displays", "paper_id": "WOS:000240487800005"}
