Recently, local discriminant embedding (LDE) method was proposed in order to tackle some limitations of the global linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method. LDE splits the graph Laplacian into two components: within-class adjacency graph and between-class adjacency graph to better characterize the discriminant property of the data. However, it is very difficult to set in advance the within- and between-class graphs. Our proposed LDE variant has two important characteristics: (i) while all graph-based manifold learning techniques (supervised and unsupervised) are depending on several parameters that require manual tuning, ours is parameter-free, and (ii) it adaptively estimates the local neighborhood surrounding each sample based on the data similarity. The resulting revisited LDE approach has been applied to the problem of model-less coarse 3D head pose estimation (person independent 3D pose estimation). It was tested on two large databases: FacePix and Pointing'04. It was conveniently compared with other linear techniques. The experimental results confirm that our method outperforms, in general, the existing ones.", "paper_title": "Parameterless Local Discriminant Embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000321890100004"}
