At the Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES) 2012, Gerard et al. proposed an optimized collision attack and break a practical implementation of AES. However, the attack needs at least 256 averaged power traces and has a high computational complexity because of its byte wise operation. In this paper, we propose a novel double sieve collision attack based on bitwise collision detection, and an improved version with an error-tolerant mechanism. Practical attacks are successfully conducted on a software implementation of AES in a low-power chip which can be used in wireless sensor node. Simulation results show that our attack needs 90% less time than the work published by Gerard et al. to reach a success rate of 0.9.", "paper_title": "Double Sieve Collision Attack Based on Bitwise Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000351719000017"}
