According to this mind. blue SSCL of ZnSe film which is not appeared in the traditional sandwich structure was observed. The relationship between spectra characterization and applied conditions were studied in detail. The luminescence mechanism of the device was discussed. This phenomenon can provide a new way to realize blue inorganic electroluminescence.
