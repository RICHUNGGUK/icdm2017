We use a layered approach in the shadow map and reproject samples along the average motion vector, and then perform lookups in this representation. Our results include substantially improved shadow quality compared to previous work and a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) implementation. In addition, we devise a set of scenes that are designed to bring out and show problematic cases for motion-blurred shadows. These scenes have difficult occlusion characteristics, and may be used in future research on this topic.", "paper_title": "Filtered Stochastic Shadow Mapping Using a Layered Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000368341800009"}
