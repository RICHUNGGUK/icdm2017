The problem seeks to simultaneously locate service facilities, equip them with appropriate capacities, and allocate user demand to these facilities such that the total cost, which consists of the fixed cost of opening facilities with sufficient capacities, the access cost of users' travel to facilities, and the queuing delay cost, is minimized. Under Poisson user demand arrivals and general service time distributions, the problem is set up as a network of independent M/G/1 queues, whose locations, capacities and service zones need to be determined. The resulting mathematical model is a non-linear integer program. Using simple transformation and piecewise linear approximation, the model is linearized and solved to epsilon-optimality using a constraint generation method. Computational results are presented for instances up to 400 users, 25 potential service facilities, and 5 capacity levels with different coefficients of variation of service times and average queueing delay costs per customer. The results indicate that the proposed solution method is efficient in solving a wide range of problem instances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
