In order to realize the equilibrium, two opposing players are selected for the model of stochastic cellular neural networks. One is the vector of external inputs and the other is the vector of internal noises. The design procedure follows the nonlinear H infinity optimal control methodology to accomplish the best rational stabilization in probability for stochastic cellular neural networks, and to attenuate noises to a predefined level with stability margins. Three numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
