Based on the mobile service acceptance model, this paper reports on the development of a survey instrument designed to measure user perception on mobile services acceptance. A survey instrument was developed by using some existing scales from prior instruments and by creating additional items which might appear to fit the construct definitions. In addition, a pilot study was conducted by distributing the survey to 25 users of a mobile service called Mobile Student Information Systems. As a result, a survey instrument containing 22 items were retained. Furthermore, the results showed that the reliabilities of all the scales in the survey instrument were above the target acceptance level.", "paper_title": "Developing an instrument to measure the adoption of mobile services", "paper_id": "WOS:000289273900003"}
