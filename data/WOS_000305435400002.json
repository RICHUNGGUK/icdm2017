Given a set of d genomic maps each containing the same n markers without duplicates, the problem MAXIMAL STRIP RECOVERY (MSR) aims at finding a decomposition of the genomic maps into synteny blocks (strips) of the maximum total length l, by deleting the minimum number k = n - l of markers which are probably noise and ambiguities. In this paper, we present a collection of new or improved FPT and approximation algorithms for MSR and its variants. Our main results include a 2(0(d delta l))poly(nd) time FPT algorithm for delta-gap-MSR-d, a 2.36(k) poly(nd) time FPT algorithm for both CMSR-d and delta-gap-CMSR-d, and a (d + 1.5)-approximation algorithm for both CMSR-d and delta-gap-CMSR-d.
