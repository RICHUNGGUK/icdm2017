Since the genes usually belong to multiple functional families, fuzzy clustering methods are more appropriate than the conventional hard clustering methods which assign a sample to only one group. In this paper, a Bayesian-like validation method selecting a fuzzy partition is proposed to evaluate the fuzzy partitions effectively. The theoretical interpretation of the obtained memberships is beyond the scope of this paper, and an empirical evaluation of the proposed method is conducted by comparing to the four representative conventional fuzzy cluster validity measures in four well-known datasets. Analysis of yeast cell-cycle data follows to evaluate the proposed method. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
