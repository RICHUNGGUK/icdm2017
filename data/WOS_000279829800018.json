It applies differentiated behaviors on data packets for different quality levels on a per hop basis (PHB). However, DiffServ cannot guarantee end to end service quality all alone as it does not have any control on the traffic entering then etwork and the paths which are traversed by data packets. A combination of an admission control and a route selection mechanism joint with the DiffServ can provide necessary bullets and nuts to provide controlled QoS. This topic has been extensively visited in the literature and various solutions have been proposed. In this paper, a new approach is studied which is aimed at improving the network utilization while keeping the service quality under control. This involves a distributed end-point admission control algorithm to engineer the traffic entering the network in which users are allowed to use lower service levels in the routers that do not have sufficient capacity in the requested service level. This local degradation preserves the end-to-end service quality in the acceptable level. In this way, we can increase data throughput and also the percentage of admitted calls, which result in higher network utilization.", "paper_title": "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF A NEW END-POINT ADMISSION CONTROL ALGORITHM IN NGN WITH IMPROVED NETWORK UTILIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800018"}
