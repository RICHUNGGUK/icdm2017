The starting point for the model was the solution of a partial differential equation of heat conduction for different boundary conditions using the finite-difference method. A numerical solution technique was implemented via the Pascal and C computer programs running under the GNU/Linux operating system, and their speeds of computation were compared. The model is capable of predicting temperature profiles and the solidi. cation front in continuously cast steel strand to make slabs and billets. The accuracy of the model was tested by obtaining approximate solutions with two different sets of mesh points, one with half the spacing of the other, and the temperatures at four representative spatial positions were compared. The ability of the mathematical model built to predict the temperature distribution and the shell thickness reliably was tested using a solidified shell from the mould of the continuous casting machine for steel billets situated at S. tore Steel, Slovenia.", "paper_title": "Development of a mathematical model for continuous casting of steel slabs and billets", "paper_id": "WOS:000244667500003"}
