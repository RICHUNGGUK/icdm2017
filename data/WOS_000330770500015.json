The projects have been applied for teaching in a third-year undergraduate subject of a computer engineering degree at the University of Granada (Spain). After the contextualization and development of the projects, we discuss the results, advantages, and drawbacks of our experience. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
