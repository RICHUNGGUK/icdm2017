Given a text t of length n and a pattern p of length m with don't care symbols in either p or t (but not both), and a bound k, our algorithm finds all the places that the pattern matches the text with at most k mismatches. The algorithm is deterministic and runs in Theta(nm(1/3)k(1/3) log(2/3) m) time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
