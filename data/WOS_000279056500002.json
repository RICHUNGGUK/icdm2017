Automatic guideline review tools help evaluating conformance with respect to these guidelines in a systematic way. Yet, a number of mobile web guidelines refer to specific device features such as screen size, support for particular picture formats or support for pointing device. Since mobile devices are very diverse, in order to address the greater number of devices, guidelines adopt a device profile that may be considered as the common denominator device which is able to provide a satisfactory experience. While this approach is useful to define guidelines and make them more understandable, it introduces critical inaccuracies that make tool effectiveness decrease. This paper presents an application that considers specific device features in the evaluation process to produce device-tailored reports. As a result, higher rates of evaluation tool completeness, correctness and specificity are obtained.", "paper_title": "Automatic device-tailored evaluation of mobile web guidelines", "paper_id": "WOS:000279056500002"}
