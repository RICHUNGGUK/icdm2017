This paper studies algebraic surfaces viewed from 2 cameras with known intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. It has been known for some time that for a degree d=2 (quadric) algebraic surface there is a 1-parameter family of surfaces that reproduce the outlines. When the algebraic surface has degree d>2, we prove a new result: that with known camera geometry it is possible to completely reconstruct an algebraic surface from 2 outlines i.e. the coefficients of its defining polynomial can be determined in a known coordinate frame. The proof exploits the existence of frontier points, which are calculable from the outlines. Examples and experiments are presented to demonstrate the theory and possible applications.", "paper_title": "Recognising algebraic surfaces from two outlines", "paper_id": "WOS:000252167900005"}
