The Lyapunov functional exponential estimation method is adopted to solve the problem of H-infinity control for such systems. The switching controller is designed to make the considered system exponentially stable with an H-infinity norm bound in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The obtained results are less conservative than existing ones. Finally, one example is given to illustrate the effectiveness and benefit of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "H-infinity control of networked control systems based on event-time-driven model", "paper_id": "WOS:000293842400013"}
