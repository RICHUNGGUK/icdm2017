Transformation of the tracking errors into new virtual error variables is used to recursively design a DSC controller, and a careful selection of the controller design parameters ensures that partial state tracking errors are confined at all times within the prescribed bounds. The stability and boundedness of all closed-loop signals were confirmed using the Lyapunov theorem. The simulation results highlight the efficacy and utility of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "Partial Tracking Error Constrained Fuzzy Dynamic Surface Control for a Strict Feedback Nonlinear Dynamic System", "paper_id": "WOS:000344751200001"}
