The set of original basis functions are generalized also for non-trigonometric functions, and essential properties, such as linear independence, nonnegativity and partition of unity are proved. The new curve-contrary to the original one-can be defined by arbitrary number of control points meanwhile it preserves the properties of the original curve.", "paper_title": "A control point based curve with two exponential shape parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000342210300007"}
