When a conventional sequential MTCMOS circuit transitions from the sleep mode to the active mode, significant bouncing noise is produced on the power and ground distribution networks. The reliability of the surrounding active circuitry is seriously degraded. A dynamic forward body bias technique is proposed in this paper to alleviate the ground bouncing noise in sequential MTCMOS circuits without sacrificing the data retention capability. With the new dynamic forward body bias technique, the peak ground bouncing noise is reduced by up to 91.70% as compared to the previously published sequential MTCMOS circuits in a UMC 80 nm CMOS technology. The design tradeoffs among important design metrics such as ground bouncing noise, leakage power consumption, active power consumption, data stability, and area are evaluated.", "paper_title": "NOISE-AWARE DATA PRESERVING SEQUENTIAL MTCMOS CIRCUITS WITH DYNAMIC FORWARD BODY BIAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286429800010"}
