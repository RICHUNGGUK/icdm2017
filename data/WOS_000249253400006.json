However, since the goal of the AAM fitting algorithm is to minimize the residual error between the model appearance and the input image, it often fails to accurately converge to the landmark points of the input image. To alleviate this weakness, we have combined Active Shape Models (ASM) into AAMs, in which ASMs try to find correct landmark points using the local profile model. Since the original objective function of the ASM search is not appropriate for combining these methods, we derive a gradient based iterative method by modifying the objective function of the ASM search. Then, we propose a new fitting method that combines the objective functions of both ASM and AAM into a single objective function in a gradient based optimization framework. Experimental results show that the proposed fitting method reduces the average fitting error when compared with existing fitting methods such as ASM, AAM, and Texture Constrained-ASM (TC-ASM) and improves the performance of facial expression recognition significantly.", "paper_title": "A unified gradient-based approach for combining ASM into AAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000249253400006"}
