These machines are frequently bottlenecks in the production. This is true especially in high-mix low-volume environments, where time consuming setup operations of the machines have to be done repeatedly. Therefore, one call improve productivity with a proper setup strategy. The most popular strategies are the so-called group setup strategy and minimum setup strategy. In this paper, we consider the machine setup problem as a combination of a job grouping problem and a minimum setup problem. We formulate this joint problem as all Integer Programming model, where the objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the number of setup occasions and the total number of component feeder changes. We also present and evaluate hybrid algorithms based on both grouping and minimum setup heuristics. The best results are achieved by a method which uses both these strategies simultaneously.
