The properties of having solutions and of having a unique solution are given mathematical characterizations. As decision problems, the former is NP-complete, while the latter is in co-RE and its decidability remains, in general, open. Uniqueness becomes decidable for a unary alphabet, where it is US-complete, and in the case of linear concatenation, where it is L-complete. The position of the languages defined by these equations in the hierarchy of language families is established.", "paper_title": "Language equations with complementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454100038"}
