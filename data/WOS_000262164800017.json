The verification time depends oil a selection of inter-FPGA signals to be time-multiplexed. In this paper, we propose a method that minimizes the verification time of multi-FPGA systems by finding an optimal selection of inter-FPGA signals to be time-multiplexed. In the experiments, it is shown that the estimated verification time is improved 38.2% on average compared with conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Optimal Time-Multiplexing in Inter-FPGA Connections for Accelerating Multi-FPGA Prototyping Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800017"}
