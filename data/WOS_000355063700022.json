While these techniques are being adopted and used in daily activities, new operational challenges are encountered concerning the steps following this adoption. In this paper, the problem of updating and improving an existing clustering model by adding relevant new variables is studied. A relevant variable is here defined as a feature which is highly correlated with the current structure of the data, since our main goal is to improve the model by adding new information to the current segmentation, but without modifying it significantly. For this purpose, a general framework is proposed, and subsequently applied in a real business context involving an event organizer facing this problem. Based on extensive experiments based on real data, the performance of the proposed approach is compared to existing methods using different evaluation metrics, leading to the conclusion that the proposed technique is performing better for this specific problem.
