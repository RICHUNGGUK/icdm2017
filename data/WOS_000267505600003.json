Procedures have usually been developed in a piecemeal fashion for a single mean, a single mean with excessive zeros, a difference between two means, and a difference between two differences (net health benefit). As an alternative, we present a general approach for all these cases that requires only confidence limits available in introductory texts. Simulation results confirm the validity of this approach. Examples arising from health economics are used to exemplify the methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
