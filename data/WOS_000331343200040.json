The related algorithms can be classified as either high quality computation or high speed performance. This letter presents an algorithm that ensures both benefits at the same time. The proposed algorithm intelligently segments input images into several sub-image, after which the sub-image binarization is performed independently. Experimental results reveal that our algorithm provides the appropriate quality with the medium speed.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Thresholding Algorithm: Efficient Computation Technique Based on 2-D Intelligent Block Detection for Degraded Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200040"}
