Czeizler and Popa proved the NP-completeness of PATS and Seki showed that the PATS problem is already NP-complete for patterns with 60 colors. In search for the minimal number of colors such that PATS remains NP-complete, we introduce multiple bound PATS (MBPATS) where we allow bounds for the numbers of tile types of each color. We show that MBPATS is NP-complete for patterns with just three colors and, as a byproduct of this result, we also obtain a novel proof for the NP-completeness of PATS which is more concise than the previous proofs.", "paper_title": "3-color bounded patterned self-assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000360156100007"}
