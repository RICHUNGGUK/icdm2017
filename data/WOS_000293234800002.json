The novelty in the design and analysis of our branching algorithms lies in the fact that the weights are redistributed over the graph by the algorithms. Our particular setting to make this idea work is a combination of a branching approach with a recharging mechanism. We call it Branch & Recharge. To demonstrate this approach we consider a generalized domination problem. Let sigma and I +/- be two nonempty sets of nonnegative integers. A vertex subset SaS dagger V of an undirected graph G=(V(G),E(G)) is called a (sigma,I +/-)-dominating set of G if |N(v)a (c) S|a sigma for all vaS and |N(v)a (c) S|aI +/- for all vaVa-S. This notion generalizes many domination-type graph invariants. We present Branch & Recharge algorithms enumerating all (sigma,I +/-)-dominating sets of an input graph G in time O (*)(c (n) ) for some c < 2, if sigma is successor-free, i.e., it does not contain two consecutive integers, and either both sigma and I +/- are finite, or one of them is finite and sigma a (c) I +/-=a.... Our algorithm implies a non trivial upper bound of O (*)(c (n) ) on the number of (sigma,I +/-)-dominating sets in an n-vertex graph under the above conditions on sigma and I +/-.", "paper_title": "Branch and Recharge: Exact Algorithms for Generalized Domination", "paper_id": "WOS:000293234800002"}
