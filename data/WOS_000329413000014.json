It is invariant to shape rotation, scaling, and translation. Invariance to translation is achieved by amplitude extraction on the radial coordinate. Rotation and scaling are log-mapped into two-dimensional translations and recovered with the phase-only correlation function. In addition, all transformation parameters (rotating angle, scaling factor, and position shift) can be determined also. The efficiency of the proposed descriptor compared to existing methods is shown experimentally on different kind of datasets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
