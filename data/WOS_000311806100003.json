It falls within the realm of reliability centered maintenance to enhance the cost effectiveness of power distribution maintenance policies. From a practical point of view, this paper devises a novel approach on the basis of the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) accompanied by fuzzy sets theory to determine the most critical component types of distribution power systems to be prioritized in maintenance scheduling. In the presence of many qualitative and quantitative attributes, fuzzy sets can effectively help to deal with the existent uncertainty and judgment vagueness. As demonstrated in a practical case study, the proposed fuzzy AHP method introduces its applicability and efficiency in the asset management procedure.", "paper_title": "Critical Component Identification in Reliability Centered Asset Management of Power Distribution Systems Via Fuzzy AHP", "paper_id": "WOS:000311806100003"}
