While most of the researchers focus on improving the speech recognition techniques to build a reliable evaluation system, another important aspect of this task has been ignored, i.e. the pronunciation evaluation model that integrates both the reliabilities of existing speech processing systems and the learner's pronunciation personalities. To take this aspect into consideration, a Sugeno integral-based evaluation model is introduced in this paper. At first, the English phonemes that are hard to be distinguished (HDP) for Chinese language learners are grouped into different HDP sets. Then, the system reliabilities for distinguishing the phonemes within a HDP set are computed from the standard speech corpus and are integrated with the phoneme recognition results under the Sugeno integral framework. The fuzzy measures are given for each subset of speech segments that contains n occurrences of phonemes within a HDP set. Rather than providing a quantity of scores, the linguistic descriptions of evaluation results are given by the model, which is more helpful for the users to improve their spoken language skills. To get a better performance, generic algorithm (GA)-based parameter optimization is also applied to optimize the model parameters. Experiments are conducted on the Sphinx-4 speech recognition platform. They show that, with 84.7% of average recognition rate of the SR system on standard speech corpus, our pronunciation evaluation model has got reasonable and reliable results for three kinds of test corpora.", "paper_title": "Auto adapted English pronunciation evaluation: A fuzzy integral approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000254194700012"}
