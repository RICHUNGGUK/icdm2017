In this work, we consider a special class of gene regulatory networks, called logical networks, where the \"links\" among genes are inferred by logic analysis of phylogenetic profiles. We provide a formalization of logic networks, and introduce a membrane computing model for reconstructing logical networks and reproducing their dynamics. An example logical network is simulated by using software P-Lingua and MeCoSim. The simulation result shows that membrane computing is a versatile framework for modeling different biological scenarios.", "paper_title": "Modeling Logic Gene Networks by Means of Probabilistic Dynamic P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324972400007"}
