As it evolves towards an information-centric operation, it records everything and forgets nothing, assuming that every online resource disclosed by people (photos, posts, multimedia files, etc.) is permanently valid and is to be stored forever. However, throughout their lives, people tend to change, both in their habits as well as in their views and opinions. In many situations, as the years go by, information released loses relevance or people may decide they no longer want others to access information they have previously published. The work presented in this paper strives for a new information persistence paradigm, whereby the enforcement of \"digital forgetting\" is implemented over an information-centric model for the Internet. The defined solution enables the definitive elimination of digital objects, either on-demand or on a pre-scheduled basis, and, hence, their \"forgetting.\" The solution, conceived within the framework of the European project CONVERGENCE, is based on the employment of metadata descriptions about resources, which unambiguously identify their rightful owners. This additional data is efficiently bound to the resource through the use of an extended version of the MPEG-21 Digital Item specification, and its prescriptions are enforced by CONVERGENCE's distributed provisions.", "paper_title": "Digital forgetting in information-centric networks-the CONVERGENCE perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000338987400005"}
