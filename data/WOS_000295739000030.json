Rather than passing messages consisting of symbol probabilities, this decoder passes lists of possible symbols and marks some lists as verified. The density evolution (DE) equations for this decoder are derived and used to compute decoding thresholds. If the maximum list size is unbounded, then one finds that any capacity-achieving LDPC code for the binary erasure channel can be used to achieve capacity on the q-SC for large q. The decoding thresholds are also computed via DE for the case where each list is truncated to satisfy a maximum list-size constraint. Simulation results are also presented to confirm the DE results. During the simulations, we observed differences between two verification-based decoding algorithms, introduced by Luby and Mitzenmacher, that were implicitly assumed to be identical. In this paper, the node-based algorithms are evaluated via analysis and simulation. The probability of false verification (FV) is also considered and techniques are discussed to mitigate the FV. Optimization of the degree distribution is also used to improve the threshold for a fixed maximum list size. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with a variety of other algorithms using both density evolution thresholds and simulation results.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Verification-Based Decoding on the q-ary Symmetric Channel for Large q", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000030"}
