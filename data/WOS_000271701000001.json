In database field, this development required methods to consider new query types like location-dependent queries (i.e. the query results depend on the query issuer location). Although several researches addressed problems related to location-dependent query processing, a few works considered timing requirements that may be associated with queries (i.e., the query results must be delivered to mobile clients on time). The main objective of this paper is to propose a solution for location-dependent query processing under soft real-time constraints. Hence, we propose methods to take into account client location-dependency and to maximize the percentage of queries respecting their deadlines. We validate our proposal by implementing a prototype based on Oracle DBMS. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed solution optimizes the percentage of queries meeting their deadlines and the communication cost.", "paper_title": "Location-dependent query processing under soft real-time constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000271701000001"}
