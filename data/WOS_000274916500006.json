However, implementation for hardwares, of this key generator is inefficient because secret key generators depend on mathematical problem to generate the high randomness quality. Cellular automata (CA) pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is more efficiently implemented rather than mathematical problem based PRNGs because a structure of CA PRNG is highly regular and simpler than the other PRNGs. In this paper, a virtual three-dimension (3D) CA PRNG based on the Moore neighborhood structure is proposed. The proposed PRNG uses new methods which are the rule numbering function that provides a high-quality randomness and cell position function that diminishes correlations between global states. In order to evaluate the quality of randomness, the ENT and DIEHARD test suites are used. The results of these tests show that the quality of randomness is superior to previous PRNGs.", "paper_title": "AN IMPROVED VIRTUAL 3D CA PRNG BASED ON MOORE NEIGHBORHOOD METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000274916500006"}
