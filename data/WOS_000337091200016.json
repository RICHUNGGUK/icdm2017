This would require capturing a set of reference images at an off-line imaging session, which employs a calibrating device that should be captured under the exact conditions as the main session. Similarly, the illumination vectors, on which photometric stereo relies, are typically precomputed based on another dedicated calibration session. In practice, implementing such off-line sessions is inconvenient and often infeasible. This work aims at enabling accurate photometric stereo reconstruction for the case of non-interactive on-line capturing of human faces. We propose unsupervised methodologies, which extract all information that is required for accurate face reconstruction from the images of interest themselves. Specifically, we propose an uncalibrated flatfielding and an uncalibrated illumination vector estimation methodology, and we assess their effect on photometric stereo face reconstruction. Results demonstrate that incorporating our methodologies into the photometric stereo framework halves the reconstruction error, while eliminating the need of off-line calibration.", "paper_title": "Uncalibrated flatfielding and illumination vector estimationfor photometric stereo face reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000337091200016"}
