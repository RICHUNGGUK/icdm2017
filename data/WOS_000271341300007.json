The design of such a recurrent neural network is based on a matrix-valued error function instead of a scalar-valued norm-based energy-function. In addition, it is depicted in an implicit dynamics instead of an explicit dynamics. This paper investigates the simulation and verification of such a Zhang neural network (ZNN). Four important simulation techniques are employed to simulate this system: (1) Kronecker product of matrices is introduced to transform a matrix-differential-equation (MDE) to a vector differential equation (VDE) [i.e., finally, there is a standard ordinary-differential-equation (ODE) formulation]. (2) MATLAB routine \"ode45\" with a mass-matrix property is introduced to Simulate the transformed initial-value implicit ODE system. (3) Matrix derivatives are obtained using the routine \"diff\" and symbolic math toolbox. (4) Various implementation errors and different types of activation functions are investigated, further demonstrating the advantages of the ZNN model. Three illustrative computer-simulation examples substantiate the theoretical results and efficacy of the ZNN model for online time-varying matrix inversion. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
