But, in this paper, we consider a coding problem to identify K objects at once among N objects in the both cases that K objects are ranked or not ranked. By combining Moulin-Koetter scheme with the epsilon-almost strongly universal class of hash functions used in Kurosawa-Yoshida scheme, an efficient and explicit coding scheme is proposed for K-multiple-object identification (K-MOID) coding. Furthermore, it is shown that the K-MOID capacity C-K-MOID, which is the maximum achievable coding rate in the K-MOID coding, is equal to the ordinary channel capacity, and the proposed scheme can attain C-K-MOID.", "paper_title": "Multiple Object Identification Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000357939400011"}
