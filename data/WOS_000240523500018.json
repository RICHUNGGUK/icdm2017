This algorithm has three advantages over the conventional non-uniform approach. First, to the best of our knowledge, this algorithm is original for uniformly sampling smaller areas of cones. Second, it is faster. Third, it always generates valid samples, which is not possible for the conventional approach.", "paper_title": "A novel algorithm for sampling uniformly in the directional space of a cone", "paper_id": "WOS:000240523500018"}
