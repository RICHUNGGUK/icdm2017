In this paper, we reveal two security weaknesses in their scheme, which could make the scheme either too inefficient or incapable of presenting the exact visiting number of a server. An improved scheme will be presented in this paper to avoid these weaknesses in the metering scheme. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
