We first derive the factor graph representation of a turbo coded system as a basic building block for developing the iterative receivers. Then, a new soft message passing schedule over the factor graph is proposed, resulting in the proposed dual-turbo receiver architecture (DTRA). In DTRA, the MIMO detector and the turbo decoder work concurrently, and the soft messages for both layers of iterations are updated instantaneously, instead of the block-based exchange of soft messages in the conventional iterative receivers. In so doing, the processing latency can be greatly reduced while low computational complexity can be achieved.", "paper_title": "Dual-turbo receiver architecture for turbo coded MIMO-OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299517500014"}
