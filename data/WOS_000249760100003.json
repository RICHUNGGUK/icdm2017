Under the proposed approach, ontologies are used to capture general, spatial, and contextual knowledge of a domain, and agenetic algorithm is applied to realize the final annotation. The employed domain knowledge considers high-level information in terms of the concepts of interest of the examined domain, contextual information in the form of fuzzy ontological relations, as well as low-level information in terms of prolotypical low-level visual descriptors. To account for the inherent ambiguity in visual information, uncertainty has been introduced in the spatial relations definition. First, an initial hypothesis set of graded annotations is produced for each image region, and then context is exploited to update appropriately the estimated degrees of confidence. Finally, a genetic algorithm is applied to decide the most plausible annotation by utilizing the visual and the spatial concepts definitions included in the domain ontology. Experiments with a collection of photographs belonging to two different domains demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Knowledge-assisted image analysis based on context and spatial optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000249760100003"}
