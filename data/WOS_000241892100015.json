Based on the Clonal operator, we propose immune Clonal Strategy Algorithm (ICSA); three different mutation mechanisms including Gaussian mutation, Cauthy mutation and Mean mutation are used in IMSA. IMSA based on these three methods are compared with Classical Evolutionary Strategy (CES) on a set of benchmark functions, the numerical results show that ICSA is capable of avoiding prematurity, increasing the converging speed and keeping the variety of solution. Additionally, we present a general evaluation of the complexity of ICSA.", "paper_title": "Immune clonal strategies based on three mutation methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100015"}
