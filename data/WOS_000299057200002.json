All known proofs of this theorem are topological. We present a geometric version of a recent beautiful proof by BlagojeviA double dagger, Matschke, and Ziegler, avoiding a direct use of topological methods. The purpose of this de-topologization is to make the proof more concrete and intuitive, and accessible to a wider audience.", "paper_title": "A Geometric Proof of the Colored Tverberg Theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000299057200002"}
