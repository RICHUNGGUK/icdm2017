In this paper, we consider the problem of ordering trees in T(n) by their Wiener indices. Some order relations of trees in T(n) are obtained. Based on the order relations, the trees in T(n) with the first up to fifteenth smallest Wiener indices are determined.", "paper_title": "Ordering Trees by Their Wiener Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000208094500011"}
