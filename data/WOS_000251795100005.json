In this case, it is impossible to construct a schedule that will meet all the requirements. In the paper, algorithms of automatic generation of recommendations for change in the requirements on the data exchange so that they were compatible are proposed. The results of experimental investigation of one of the considered algorithms are presented.", "paper_title": "Recommendation generation algorithms for scheduling of data exchange through a channel with centralized control", "paper_id": "WOS:000251795100005"}
