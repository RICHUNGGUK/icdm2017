For instance, we improved the Chomsky-Schutzenberger representation theorem and show that each context-free language L can be represented in the form L = h(D boolean AND R), where D is a Dyck language, R is a strictly 3-testable language, and h is a morphism. A similar representation for context-free languages can be obtained, using insertion systems of weight (3, 0) and strictly 4-testable languages.", "paper_title": "Refinement of Representation Theorems for Context-Free Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537600004"}
