Based on functional images, which are subject to noise and segmentation inaccuracies, heart wall motion analysis is acknowledged as a difficult problem, and as such, incorporation of prior knowledge is crucial for improving accuracy. Given incomplete, noisy data and a dynamic model, the Kalman filter, a well-known recursive Bayesian filter, is devised in this study to the estimation of the left ventricular (LV) cavity points. However, due to similarity between the statistical information of normal and abnormal heart motions, detecting and classifying abnormality is a challenging problem, which we investigate with a global measure based on the SDE. We further derive two other possible information theoretic abnormality detection criteria, one is based on Renyi entropy and the other on Fisher information. The proposed methods analyze wall motion quantitatively by constructing distributions of the normalized radial distance estimates of the LV cavity. Using 269 x 20 segmented LV cavities of short-axis MRI obtained from 30 subjects, the experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed SDE criterion can lead to a significant improvement over other features that are prevalent in the literature related to the LV cavity, namely, mean radial displacement and mean radial velocity.", "paper_title": "Detection of Left Ventricular Motion Abnormality Via Information Measures and Bayesian Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000280480700024"}
