It is an active area of research that is central to the development of intelligent agents and autonomous robots. In many real-world applications, a multitude of valid plans exist, and a user distinguishes plans of high qnality by how well they adhere to the user's preferences. To generate such high-quality plans automatically, a planning system must provide a means of specifying the user's preferences with respect to the planning task, as well as a means of generating plans that ideally optimize these preferences. In the last few years, there has been significant research in the area of planning with preferences. In this article we review current approaches to preference representation for planning as well as overviewing and contrasting the various approaches to generating preferred plans that have been developed to date.", "paper_title": "Planning with Preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000265659200003"}
