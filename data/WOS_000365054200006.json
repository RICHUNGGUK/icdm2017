A moderator analysis involving website type (retail or e-services), sample characteristics (respondent type and respondent origin) and the IQ categories used (representational and nonrepresentational) in articles revealed that whereas website type and IQ categories moderate the relationship between perceived online IQ and consumer satisfaction, sample characteristics do not. Implications of the results for researchers and practitioners and directions of future research are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
