In this article we discuss these challenges and propose a solution that aims to meet most of them. The proposed solution is completely distributed, and does not need dedicated spectrum resources for control purposes, but rather leverages on a virtual control channel that is implemented by having users exchange control information whenever they meet in a particular channel, using network coding techniques for better dissemination performance. Due to these aspects, our proposal represents a significant improvement over existing dynamic spectrum access and multichannel MAC solutions. We discuss the effectiveness of our scheme in multihop cognitive ad hoc networks, where secondary users need to opportunistically access the spectrum at those locations and times at which it is not used by primary users. Finally, we report the results of an evaluation study assessing the performance of the proposed scheme with respect to different system and scenario parameters.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Network Coded Control Channel for Multihop Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000268597800005"}
