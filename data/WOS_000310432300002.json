The characteristic values of weld image and arc voltage signals were accurately extracted by using proper processing algorithm, and the experiments have been done to verify the precision of processing algorithms. The results demonstrate that the error is very small, which is accurate enough to meet the requirements of the subsequent real-time tracking and controlling during the welding robot GTAW process.", "paper_title": "Research on the Real-time Tracking Information of Three-dimension Welding Seam in Robotic GTAW Process Based on Composite Sensor Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000310432300002"}
