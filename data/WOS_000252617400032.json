The greater the number of victims, the more time the identification tasks require, since a manual comparison between the dental radiograph records is done by forensic experts. Addressing this problem, this paper presents an efficient dental radiograph recognition system using Phase-Only Correlation (POC) for human identification. The use of phase components in 2D (two-dimensional) discrete Fourier transforms of dental radiograph images makes possible to achieve highly robust image registration and recognition. Experimental evaluation using a set of dental radiographs indicates that the proposed system exhibits efficient recognition performance for low-quality images.", "paper_title": "A dental radiograph recognition system using phase-only correlation for human identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400032"}
