We prove the strong normalization property for the term assignment which follows by soundly translating the let calculus into simply typed A calculus with pairings and projections. A new and simple proof of strong normalization for the latter is also provided.", "paper_title": "A term assignment for polarized bi-intuitionistic logic and its strong normalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000258037500003"}
