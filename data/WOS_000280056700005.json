A power law relationship of the form r = alpha N-beta is hypothesised to hold for the communication range (r) and the number of nodes (N), with alpha and beta being functions of the connectivity probability of the network. Unlike the different forms of log relationships derived for different network settings, this power law relationship will be shown to hold for both static and mobile ad hoc network of various settings using extensive simulation data. The comparison between the commonly known log law and our power law will be made using the published simulation data for stationary network and network with random waypoint model mobility. We further hypothesise that the power law relationship between the communication range and the number of nodes holds across different network models. We propose to simplify and unify the research of this connectivity probability problem by focusing on the effect of different network models on the parameters (alpha and beta) of the power law model.", "paper_title": "On the power law relationship of the critical transmitting range and the number of nodes of ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280056700005"}
