PTCA procedure requires physicians to have good skills of hand-eye coordination in performing the operation. Training of PTCA thus very much emphasizes skill building for hand-eye coordination. We have been developing virtual reality (VR) technology for medical simulation. In this paper, we will address the issue of VR-based simulation for the enhancement of hand-eye coordination for PTCA operation. Starting from the characterization of PTCA procedure, we examine what roles VR can play in training of PTCA physicians. We then describe a computerized PTCA training system we have developed which is composed of a tactile interface and a visual interface. The system is designed in such a way that real PTCA devices (including catheters and guide-wires) can be used to mimic the requirements of the CathLab. The backend computational engine supporting the real-time and realistic PTCA simulation is also presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
