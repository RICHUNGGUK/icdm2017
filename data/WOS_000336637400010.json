One important aspect is the regulatory mechanism of IDE by ATP, which is an IDE activator in degrading small peptides and an inhibitor in degrading larger peptides, such as A beta 42. This relationship was investigated in this study. We present molecular dynamics simulations of A beta 42 complexed with IDE, in the absence or presence of either ATP or excess Na+ and Cl- ions. Results suggest a previously unreported inhibition mechanism that depends on charge-induced structural modifications in the active site and interactions simultaneously involving ATP, A beta 42, and IDE. Such interactions exist only when both ATP and A beta 42 are simultaneously present in the catalytic chamber. This mechanism results in allosteric, noncompetitive inhibition with apparent decrease of substrate affinity, in accordance with experiment.", "paper_title": "Molecular Dynamics Simulations Reveal a Novel Mechanism for ATP Inhibition of Insulin Degrading Enzyme", "paper_id": "WOS:000336637400010"}
