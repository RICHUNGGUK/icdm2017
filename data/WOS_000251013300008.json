Design/methodology/approach - The generalized force method is explained in a form to illustrate the par-allelism of this method and the variation theorem approaches. The inter-relation between the variation theorems and the force method is then established. Findings - Examples are presented to illustrate the above-mentioned parallelism. Originality/value - The paper shows the power of the force method as a basis of variation theorems.", "paper_title": "Inter-relation of the structural variation theorems and the force method", "paper_id": "WOS:000251013300008"}
