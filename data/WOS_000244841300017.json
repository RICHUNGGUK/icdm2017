In this paper, we investigate using the RKDG finite element method for compressible two-medium flow simulation with conservative treatment of the moving material interfaces. Numerical results for both gas-gas and gas-water flows in one-dimension are provided to demonstrate the characteristic behavior of this approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
