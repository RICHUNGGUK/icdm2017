These storage systems cost a lot of energy for their high performance. In this paper, we propose an EEVS, a deduplication-based energy efficiency storage system for VM storage. We firstly investigate some VM image files with general operating systems. With the analysis result, we find there are many redundant data blocks that bring extra energy cost VM storage. Therefore, in the EEVS, we design an online-deduplication mechanism to reduce these redundant data without service interruption, while traditional deduplication technology is used for offline backup. Based on the system design, we implement an EEVS with the existing cloud platform. Since this mechanism needs considerable computing resources, we design a deduplication selection algorithm such that the storage energy consumption is minimized for a given set of VMs with limited resources for deduplication. Experiment results in a para-virtualization environments of the EEVS show that energy consumption is reduced by even up to 66% with negligible performance", "paper_title": "Deduplication-Based Energy Efficient Storage System in Cloud Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000359139700013"}
