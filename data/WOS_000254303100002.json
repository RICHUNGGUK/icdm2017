Here we have a Poisson arrival stream of rate lambda feeding two parallel queues, each having an exponential server that works at rate mu. An arrival joins the shorter of the two queues; if both are of equal length the arrival joins either with probability 1/2. We consider the first passage time until one of the queues reaches the value m(0), and also the time until both reach this level. We give explicit expressions for the first two first passage moments, conditioned on the initial queue lengths, and also the full first passage distribution. We also give some asymptotic results for m(0) -> infinity and various values of rho = lambda/mu.", "paper_title": "Some first passage time problems for the shortest queue model", "paper_id": "WOS:000254303100002"}
