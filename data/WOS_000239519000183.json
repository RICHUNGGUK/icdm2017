We have created a \"virtual 3D acoustic environment\" in which subjects feel a car passing in front of them to help them cross a road safely. The system is theoretically based on acoustic \"time-to-contact\" information, which is the most important concept in Ecological Psychology. Experimental results suggest that blind people tend to estimate the acoustic \"time-to-contact\" significantly longer than did sighted people. However, there are no significant differences between their sensitivities toward the speed of a moving sound source and the gain level of indirect sounds.", "paper_title": "Identification of acoustic factors for perception of crossability common to blind and sighted pedestrians", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000183"}
