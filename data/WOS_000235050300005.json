This is even more true for imaging applications. This work is the first dowel in a rather wide mosaic, aimed at construction of a PSE (Problem Solving Environment) oriented to imaging applications. We discuss computational efforts towards the development of a distributed software environment, enabling the transparent use of high performance computers and storage systems for 3-D Echocardiographic sequences denoising via non-linear diffusion filtering. More precisely, we describe a component-based approach for the development of an integrated software environment relying on the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientfic Computation (PETSc). Our approach uses a distributed memory model where we hide, within the PETSc parallel objects, the details of internode communications while intranode communications have been handled at a higher level. We report some experiences we made on an in vivo acquired 3-D Echocardio graphic sequence obtained by means of a rotational acquisition technique using Tomtec Imaging system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
