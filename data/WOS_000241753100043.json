For the scene interpretation, it is desirable to separate between the target response and the speckle. For this purpose, we proposed a new speckle reduction approach using independent component analysis (ICA) based on statistical formulation of PSAR image. In addition, we apply four ICA algorithms on real PSAR images and compare their performances. The comparison reveals characteristic differences between the studied neural ICA algorithms, complementing the results obtained earlier.", "paper_title": "Speckle reduction of polarimetric SAR images based on neural ICA", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100043"}
