We characterize this as the initial free algebra for an appropriate set of operations and equations in the enriched Lawvere theories of Plotkin and Power. Thus we obtain a novel algebraic description for models of the pi-calculus, and validate an existing construction as the universal such model. The algebraic operations are intuitive, covering name creation, communication of names over channels, and nondeterministic choice; the equations then combine these features in a modular fashion. We work in an enriched setting, over a \"possible worlds\" category of sets indexed by available names. This expands significantly on the classical notion of algebraic theories: we can specify operations that act only on fresh names, or have arities that vary as processes evolve. Based on our algebraic theory of pi we describe a category of models for the pi-calculus, and show that they all preserve bisimulation congruence. We develop a direct construction of free models in this category; and generalise previous results to prove that all free-algebra models are fully abstract. We show how local modifications to the theory can give alternative models for pi I and the early pi-calculus. From the theory of pi we also obtain a Moggi-style computational monad, suitable for a programming language semantics of mobile communicating systems. This addresses the challenging area of correctly combining computational monads: in this case those for concurrency, name generation, and communication. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
