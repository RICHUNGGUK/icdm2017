The procedure extends current Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and threshold modelling by employing a general double threshold GARCH model that allows for an explosive, non-stationary regime. Posterior credible intervals on model parameters are used to detect and specify threshold nonlinearity in the mean and/or volatility equations. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the method works favorably in identifying model specifications varying in complexity from the conventional GARCH up to the full double-threshold nonlinear GARCH model with an explosive regime, and is robust to over-specification in model orders.
