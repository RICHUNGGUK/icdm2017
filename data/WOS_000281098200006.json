A model of the muscle that has been learned by a NNARX ( Neural Network Auto Regressive eXogenous) structure is used. The PID parameters are tuned by an MLP Network with a special indirect online learning algorithm. The calculation of the learning algorithm is performed based on a mathematical equation of the DC motor or with a Neural Network identification of the motor. For each of the two algorithms, the output of the muscle model is used as a reference for the DC motor control loop. The results show that we succeeded in forcing the physical system to behave in the same way as the muscle model with acceptable margin of error. An implementation in the knees of a simulated biped robot is realized. Simulation compares articular trajectories with and without the muscle emulator and shows that with muscle emulator, articular trajectories become closer to the human being ones and that total power consumption is reduced.", "paper_title": "MUSCLE EMULATION WITH DC MOTOR AND NEURAL NETWORKS FOR BIPED ROBOTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281098200006"}
