The research presented in the paper has been centered around ExPlanTech-a specific implementation of a production-planning multiagent system. Suitability of ExPlanTech for mass-oriented and project-driven manufacturing is also discussed in the paper. Applicability of multiagent concepts is demonstrated on a multiagent planning architecture and production-planning case study at a Skoda Auto Engine Plant.", "paper_title": "Agent-based approach to mass-oriented production planning: Case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000246090900008"}
