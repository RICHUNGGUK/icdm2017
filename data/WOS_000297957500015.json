An interval type-2 fuzzy controller is developed to improve controller robustness against system uncertainties and unknown disturbances. Proposed controller is able to damp the complicated chaotic oscillations of art interconnected power system, when such oscillations can be made by load perturbation of a power system working on its stability edges. Lyapunov functions are used to prove stability of proposed controller and simulation results are implemented on a 2-machine interconnected power system, illustrating the effectiveness of proposed method even in comparison with other previous methods.", "paper_title": "INTERVAL TYPE-2 FUZZY FINITE-TIME CONTROL APPROACH FOR CHAOTIC OSCILLATION DAMPING OF POWER SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500015"}
