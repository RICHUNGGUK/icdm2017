We focus on calibration aspects, and propose a calibration strategy that uses quality measures to model the calibration parameters. We carry out the proposed calibration by using simple Quality Measure Functions (QMFs) of duration and measured signal-to-noise-ratio from speech segments. We test the effectiveness of the approach using two databases, the development set of the I4U collaboration for the NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) 2012, and the evaluation test material of NIST SRE 2012 itself. In comparison with conventional linear calibration, results show that the proposed QMF approach successfully improves the system performance in terms of both discrimination and calibration.
