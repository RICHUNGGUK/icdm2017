Since the integrand of the Nuttall Q-function is characterized by an exponential kernel function, the semi-infinite Gauss-Hermite quadrature is employed to efficiently calculate the tail probability involved. As such, with the help of the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, the Nuttall Q-function with arbitrary real orders can be accurately approximated in closed form. This methodology is then extended to provide closed-form approximations for other related semi-infinite integrals encountered in performance analysis of energy detection in fading channels.", "paper_title": "An Intuitive Methodology for Efficient Evaluation of the Nuttall Q-Function and Performance Analysis of Energy Detection in Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000016"}
