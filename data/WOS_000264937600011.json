We prove that if this protocol is zero knowledge with a black-box, quantum simulator S, then L is an element of BQP. Our result also applies to any language having a three-round quantum interactive proof (QIP), with all but possibly the last message being classical, with negligible soundness error and a black-box quantum simulator. These results in particular make it unlikely that; certain protocols can be composed ill parallel in order to reduce soundness error, while maintaining zero knowledge with a black-box quantum simulator. They generalize analogous classical results of Goldreich and Krawczyk (1990). Our proof goes via a reduction to quantum black-box search. We show that the existence of a black-box quantum simulator for such protocols when L is not an element of BQP would imply all impossibly-good quantum search algorithm.", "paper_title": "ON PARALLEL COMPOSITION OF ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS WITH BLACK-BOX QUANTUM SIMULATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264937600011"}
