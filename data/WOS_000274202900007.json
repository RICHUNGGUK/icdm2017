The MTPSO model can be dealt with two main factors easily and accurately, which are the lengths of intervals and the content of forecast rules. The experimental results of the temperature prediction and the TAIFEX forecasting show that the proposed model is better than any existing models and it can get better quality solutions based on the high-order fuzzy time series, respectively.
