In particular, this methodology helps design an adequate security information feedback based on User Interface Patterns. the resulting feedback is then evaluated against a set of design/evaluation criteria called Human-Computer Interaction for Security (HCI-S). In case of a security issue the security information feedback is generally presented using the visual and auditory channels required to achieve an effective notifications, and it is explicitly specified in the design of user interfaces for secure web system.
