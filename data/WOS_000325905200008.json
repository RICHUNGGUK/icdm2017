We first prove that any symmetric Boolean function f of n variables can be computed by a logic circuit of energy e = O(n/l) and fan-in l, and then provide an almost tight lower bound e >= inverted right perpendicular(n - m(f))/linverted left perpendicular where m(f) is the maximum numbers of consecutive \"0\"s or \"1\"s in the value vector off. Our results imply that there exists a tradeoff between the energy and fan-in of logic circuits computing a symmetric Boolean function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
