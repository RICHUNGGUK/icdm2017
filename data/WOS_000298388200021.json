The algorithm is an extension of our earlier method for extraspecial groups in Ivanyos et al. (Proceedings of the 24th Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS), vol. 4393, pp. 586-597, 2007), but it has several additional features. It contains a powerful classical reduction for the hidden subgroup problem in nilpotent groups of constant nilpotency class to the specific case where the group is a p-group of exponent p and the subgroup is either trivial or cyclic. This reduction might also be useful for dealing with groups of higher nilpotency class. The quantum part of the algorithm uses well chosen group actions based on some automorphisms of nil-2 groups. The right choice of the actions requires the solution of a system of quadratic and linear equations. The existence of a solution is guaranteed by the Chevalley-Warning theorem, and we prove that it can also be found efficiently.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Quantum Algorithm for the Hidden Subgroup Problem in Nil-2 Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000298388200021"}
