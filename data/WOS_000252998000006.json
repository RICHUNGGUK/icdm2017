The product codes from the Harmonized System (HS codes) are the essential elements of the system's integration, automation and intelligence. The identified HS codes are well-accepted and precise product references used by customs authorities, to match applicable policies to the products being inspected and taxed. Domain ontology for importing and exporting industry can be used to acquire HS codes for given products, and is a prerequisite for an integrated and intelligent automated inspection system. The authors have proposed and implemented an importing and exporting domain ontology. The ontology is composed of an integrated and comprehensive knowledge base derived from static dictionaries and the HS specification, and dynamic processing data. Based on this ontology, a reasoning engine is developed to generate HS codes intelligently for the given product names. Information systems can use the engine to get HS codes for submitted products and find applicable policies automatically. The ontology and the engine have been implemented in a Java-based platform and published as a HS Web service. In this paper, knowledge structure, reasoning mechanism and implementation details for the domain ontology and reasoning engine are presented. A test bed in the application environment has been conducted and experimental results have been obtained. The ontology and the service have the potential to be widely used by authorities and international traders of importing and exporting industry around the world. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
