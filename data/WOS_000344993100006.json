The system is capable of recording both mechanical PW contours with sensors made of a low-cost polypropylene-based material called electromechanical film (EMFi) and volume pulse signal with photoplethysmographic transducers. By using both types of sensors, the PW contours can be recorded from various locations. The system combined with automatic analysis methods enables to easily analyze the PW contours in order to obtain a more comprehensive view on the vascular health. To demonstrate this, two parameters used in literature, reflection index and radial augmentation index were calculated for the test subjects as a function of time. The results show that these parameter values may vary more than 20% in a period of 100 s, which suggests that a large number of PWs should be analyzed before making conclusions based on the calculated indices. In addition, the effects of the static bias force to the mechanical PW signal recorded with the EMFi sensors were studied. The PW signal with the maximum amplitude is obtained when the pressure caused by the static bias force corresponds to the contact pressure between typical systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The EMFi sensors used in the proposed system are a potential low-cost alternative for tonometric sensors in collecting data in the PW analysis for arterial screening.", "paper_title": "Monitoring Arterial Pulse Waves With Synchronous Body Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000344993100006"}
