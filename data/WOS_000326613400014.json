Although cloud monitoring is nowadays an active research field, a comprehensive study covering all its aspects has not been presented yet. This paper provides a deep insight into cloud monitoring. It proposes a unified cloud monitoring taxonomy, based on which it defines a layered cloud monitoring architecture. To illustrate it, we have implemented GMonE, a general-purpose cloud monitoring tool which covers all aspects of cloud monitoring by specifically addressing the needs of modern cloud infrastructures. Furthermore, we have evaluated the performance, scalability and overhead of GMonE with Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB), by using the OpenNebula cloud middleware on the Grid'5000 experimental testbed. The results of this evaluation demonstrate the benefits of our approach, surpassing the monitoring performance and capabilities of cloud monitoring alternatives such as those present in state-of-the-art systems such as Amazon EC2 and OpenNebula.
