These effects are more significant in Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs), and, particularly, in those based on the IEEE 802.15.5 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN mesh) standard, a promising solution for enabling low-power WMSNs. The first contribution of this paper is a quantitative evaluation of these problems under the IEEE 802.15.5 Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode, which is intended for asynchronous data-collection applications. The results obtained show a sharp deterioration of the network performance. Therefore, this paper also reviews the most relevant approaches that cope with these problems and are compatible with ASES. Finally, a set of these proposals is assessed to find out those more suitable for their potential integration with ASES, which constitutes the second major contribution of the paper.
