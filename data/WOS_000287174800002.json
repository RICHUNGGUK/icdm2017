The estimation task is carried out by maximizing a symmetric similarity function, which is the product of the square roots of correspondences and a kernel correlation. The local mean square error analysis and robustness analysis are provided to show our method's superior performance to the kernel correlation method.", "paper_title": "A Novel Kernel Correlation Model with the Correspondence Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000287174800002"}
