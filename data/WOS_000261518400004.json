It is well established that human-machine interactions are more believable and memorable when a physical entity is present, provided that the machine behaves in a realistic manner. It is desirable to adopt face-to-face communication, because it is the most natural and efficient way of exchanging information, and does not require users to alter their habits. In this context, this paper describes a process for animating a robot head, based on video input of a human head. We map from the 2D coordinates of feature points into the robot's servo space, using Partial Least Squares (PLS). Learning is done using a small set of keyframes manually created by an animator. The method is efficient, robust to tracking errors and independent of the scale of the face being tracked. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
