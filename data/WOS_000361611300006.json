Considering that each method has its strengths and weaknesses, a novel adaptive segmentation framework based on multi-classification model is proposed for dermoscopy images. Firstly, five patterns of images are summarized according to the factors influencing segmentation. Then the matching relation is established between each image pattern and its optimal segmentationmethod. Next, the given image is classified into one of the five patterns by the multi-classification model based on BP neural network. Finally, the optimal segmentation method for this image is selected according to the matching relation, and then the image is effectively segmented. Experiments show that the proposed method delivers better accuracy and more robust segmentation results compared with the other seven state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Adaptive segmentation based on multi-classification model for dermoscopy images", "paper_id": "WOS:000361611300006"}
