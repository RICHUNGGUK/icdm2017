However, none of these studies considered the multi-core architecture feature for emerging grid systems. Although there have been many studies proposed to employ the hybrid MPI and OpenMP programming model to exploit different levels of parallelism for a distributed system with multi-core computers, none of them were aimed at parallel loop self-scheduling. Therefore, this paper investigates how to employ the hybrid MPI and OpenMP model to design a parallel loop self-scheduling scheme adapted to the multi-core architecture for emerging grid systems. Three different featured applications are implemented and evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous work for the three applications and the speedups range from 1.13 to 1.75.", "paper_title": "Designing parallel loop self-scheduling schemes using the hybrid MPI and OpenMP programming model for multi-core grid systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297359600003"}
