These systems are of couplings in every equation of each subsystem, and different subsystems may have different orders. To avoid the noncausal problem in the control design, the system is transformed into a predictor form by rigorous derivation. By exploring the properties of the block triangular form, implicit controls are developed for each subsystem such that the couplings of inputs and states among subsystems have been completely decoupled. The radial basis function NN is employed to approximate the unknown control. Each subsystem achieves a semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded stability with the proposed control, and simulation results are presented to demonstrate its efficiency.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Output Feedback NN Control of a Class of Discrete-Time MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Control Directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000288454300016"}
