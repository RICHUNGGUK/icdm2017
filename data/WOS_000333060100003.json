The procedure is based on a modular approach that scales from basic modal logic with eventualities to hybrid PDL. The approach is designed so that nominals and eventualities are treated orthogonally. To deal with the complex programs of PDL, the approach employs a novel disjunctive program decomposition. In arguing the correctness of our approach, we employ the novel notion of support generalizing the standard notion of Hintikka sets.", "paper_title": "A Goal-Directed Decision Procedure for Hybrid PDL", "paper_id": "WOS:000333060100003"}
