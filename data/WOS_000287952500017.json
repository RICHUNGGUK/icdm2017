In the multiple decrement life table (MDLT), an individual can exit the table through differentiated causes of death. Because of its structure, numerous calculations of demographic importance can be produced from the data in the MDLT, including estimates of the probability of death in the presence or absence of a combination of causes. Producing these life tables using manual calculations can be tedious and time consuming. Therefore, we present here a spreadsheet program, M-DEC, which automatically calculates many of the demographic variables in the MDLT for use with insects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
