In this paper, we present conditions that are sufficient for a test suite to be complete. We demonstrate that the existing conditions are special cases of the proposed ones. An algorithm that checks whether a given test suite is complete is given. The experimental results show that the algorithm can be used for relatively large FSMs and test suites.", "paper_title": "Checking Completeness of Tests for Finite State Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000279059300002"}
