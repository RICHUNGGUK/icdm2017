We show that. under certain operating conditions, our proposed policy can significantly increase the revenues generated by the delivery of the Multimedia services to mobile users. The primary objective of the proposed policy is to guarantee the users' service level agreements (SLAs) while enhancing the utilization of the networks' assets (i.e., links' capacities. switching nodes and ports). Two important results stem from this objective: (1) a service provider will be able to gain additional revenues via accommodating more users without offering any new services. and without making any new additional investments to the set network's assets. (2) A service provider can gain new revenues by offering a new set of multimedia delivery services with nominal capital expenditures (CAPEX). Results show that it is possible to attain an average increase in the revenues Of Lip to 21% by admitting LIP to 50% of additional users. The filtering policy includes the installation of filters at the Output ports of each node of public land mobile networks Such as 3G-UMTS (Third Generation Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems) network. The filters are controlled by a multi-objective optimization function that attempts to adapt both the rate and format of the multimedia services. We assume that the provider offers two different grades of services to which users call subscribe: Premium and Economy. Premium class users pay a higher tariff because the filters provide I preferential treatment to their media streams over those directed to Economy class users. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
