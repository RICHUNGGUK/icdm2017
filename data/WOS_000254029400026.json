This correspondence presents further extensions of those results, allowing for a richer description of the membership uncertainty, in terms of affine inequalities.", "paper_title": "Extensions to \"Stability Analysis of Fuzzy Control Systems Subject to Uncertain Grades of Membership\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029400026"}
