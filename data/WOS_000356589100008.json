Coarse-grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) is a very promising processor; it is a parallel computing platform which provides high performance of hardware, high flexibility of software, and dynamical reconfiguration ability. In this paper we propose an implementation of TBVU on CGRA. We fully exploit the characters of TBVU and utilize several techniques to reduce memory I/O operation and total execution time. Experimental results show that our work can greatly reduce the I/O operation and the execution time compared with the non-optimized ones. We also compare our work with other platforms and find great advantage in execution time and resource utilization rate.", "paper_title": "The Implementation of Texture-Based Video Up-Scaling on Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589100008"}
