In particular we examined the differences in cortical response when the looming and binocular cues were congruent or incongruent in the collision information they provided. A stereoscopic goggle system was used within the fMRI environment and allowed us to present looming and disparity cues in isolation, or in congruent or incongruent combinations. Comparison across conditions showed that incongruent cues elicited additional activation in cortical areas know to both process error and locate objects in spatio-topic coordinates. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive and motor responses to seeing incongruent cues. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
