Using the Bayesian approach, the predictive and survival functions are derived and then the point and interval predictions are obtained. Finally, two numerical examples are presented for illustration.", "paper_title": "Two-sample Bayesian prediction for sequential order statistics from exponential distribution based on multiply Type-II censored samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000327422900005"}
