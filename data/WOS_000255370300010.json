The system is composed of two subsystems: human face detection subsystem and human face recognition subsystem. The face detection subsystem includes two modules: face finding and face verification. The human face finding module determines the face regions of a number of subjects from color image series using skin color analysis and motion analysis. The human face verification module is developed to verify the detected human faces by judging of eclipse and support vector machine (SVM), and precisely localize human faces by locating eyes and mouths based on Generalized Symmetry Transform. The features characterizing the relation between face patterns can be extracted and selected by Principal Component Analysis. Using these selected features to train multiple SVMs, we can finally classify human faces. Moreover, in these modules, several simple and complex methods are used to reduce the searching space. So the system can work at a high speed and high detection and recognition rate. Human face detection accuracy of the system is 97.2% under controllable lightning condition. Human face recognition accuracy of the system for 70 persons is 96.5% (with 20 eigenvectors) and 98.3% (with 30 eigenvectors). (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
