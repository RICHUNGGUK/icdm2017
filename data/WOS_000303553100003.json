Algorithms for establishing the possible assembly sequences of machine parts and sets, on the basis of mathematical product model created with graph theory, as well as the selection of the most advantageous assembly sequence based on the Yager optimisation model are discussed. Also the algorithm of simulation and visualisation of the connection process using CAD systems and virtual environment (VE) are presented.
