We identify from this several subfamilies in which the PPT criterion is both necessary and sufficient. A sufficient criterion of separability is obtained, which is fundamental for the discussion. We show how several examples of states known to be classifiable by the PPT criterion indeed belong to this general set. Possible uses of these states in numerical analysis of entanglement and in the search of PPT bound entangled states are briefly discussed.", "paper_title": "FAMILIES OF BIPARTITE STATES CLASSIFIABLE BY THE POSITIVE PARTIAL TRANSPOSITION CRITERION", "paper_id": "WOS:000276215200010"}
