It is based on embedding online simulations into a sensor network and adding communication and synchronization among the simulators. While prior work focused on this approach in the context of online management of transportation systems, this paper describes a generalization of the methodology and shows how it can be applied to embedded simulations of systems that can be modeled as open networks of queues. An implementation of an ad hoc queueing network simulation is described. The flows of units across links connecting nodes in different simulators are approximated by renewal processes whose parameters are updated dynamically. The synchronization mechanism uses random sampling to update flow rates across the ad hoc components. Preliminary results show that the ad hoc queueing network simulation can provide predictions comparable to sequential simulations.", "paper_title": "Ad hoc distributed simulation methodology for open queueing networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000305969800003"}
