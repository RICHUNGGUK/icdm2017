Compared to previous works in this area our framework has the advantage that it can reason about temporal rules. We show that for rule-based cognitive agents deliberation is more than just deriving conclusions in terms of their mental components. Our paper is an extension of [5,6] in the area of cognitive agent programming.", "paper_title": "Rule-based agents in temporalised defeasible logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500006"}
