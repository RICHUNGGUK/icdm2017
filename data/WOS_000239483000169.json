A learning strategy and robust adaptive neural networks are combined into a hybrid robust control scheme. The proposed controller deals mainly with external disturbances and nonlinear uncertainty in motion control. A neural network (NN) is used to approximate the uncertainties in a robotic system. Then the disadvantageous effects on tracking performance, due to the approximating error of the NN in robotic system, are attenuated to a prescribed level by an adaptive robust controller. The learning techniques of NN will improve robustness with respect to uncertainty of system, as a result, improving the dynamic performance of robot system. A simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.", "paper_title": "Robust adaptive neural networks with an online learning technique for robot control", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000169"}
