One of the reasons behind this is that AT-free graphs are not necessarily perfect unlike many popular subclasses of AT-free graphs such as interval graphs or co-comparability graphs. In this paper, we resolve the smallest open case of this problem, and present the first polynomial time algorithm for the 3-colouring problem on AT-free graphs.", "paper_title": "3-Colouring AT-Free Graphs in Polynomial Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000308228400004"}
