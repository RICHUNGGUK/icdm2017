The statistical dependence of local estimation errors is first discussed, and then the concept of correlation coefficient is introduced to model the cross-correlation approximately. Two algorithms are proposed. One is based on min-max technique, which minimizes the maximal Mahalanobis distance between two fused estimates. The other one uses the prior distribution of the correlation coefficient and obtains a closed form of estimation fusion with the help of a series of matrix manipulations. Compared with some available algorithms in literature, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
