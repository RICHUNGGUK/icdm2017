The necessity of rapid fault clearing results in fast developing of protection equipments. Moreover, need for reliable supplying of loads, lead to improvements in single-phase autoreclosure (SPAR) equipments. An ADAptive LInear NEuron (ADALINE) is suitable for important applications such as protection of power systems and digital relays. In this paper, a novel simple adaptive SPAR algorithm is introduced. This algorithm is based on learning error function of an ADALINE. It can be distinguished by fault type (transient fault or a permanent fault), and if the fault is permanent, autoreclosure should be blocked. This leads to improve the performance and efficiency of SPAR. Electromagnetic transients program-based simulation results show that the autoreclosure scheme based on learning error function of ADALINE on a typical 400 kV circuit for various system and fault conditions improves the reliability of fault discrimination.", "paper_title": "A Novel Approach to Adaptive Single Phase Autoreclosure Scheme for EHV Power Transmission Lines Based on Learning Error Function of ADALINE", "paper_id": "WOS:000261110600003"}
