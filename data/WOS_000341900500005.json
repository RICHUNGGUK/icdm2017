Our TRAMMA (Topology Recognition and Aggregation of Mesh Models of Architecture) program is developed as an application of the method. The segmentation includes the recognition of floors, stairs, and walls out of the mesh models. The aggregation process recombines the building segments according to the user-defined topology. The topology representation of multi-story buildings and the spatial synthesis of 3D building models are integrated in the program. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
