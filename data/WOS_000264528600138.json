For the purpose of enhancing the performance of the AMB system, we replace the conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with a self-tuning fuzzy PID-type controller (FPIDC). The shaft displacement and the unbalanced forces of the rotor are evaluated by model-based observation. If there are model uncertainties in the rotor system or nonlinearities in the magnetic bearing system, this observer may not work well at any operating speed. A fuzzy gain tuner is added to adjust the actuating signal of the self-tuning FPIDC in order to overcome the disturbances and suppress the unbalancing vibration. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme allows for a remarkable improvement in reducing vibration in an unbalanced AMB system as well as demonstrate an efficient reduction in the shaft displacement of the rotor.
