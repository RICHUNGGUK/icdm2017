However, there is still a lack of general methodologies for ontology automatic learning and population, i.e. the generation of domain ontologies from various kinds of resources by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques In this paper, the authors present an ontology learning and population system that combines both statistical and semantic methodologies. Several experiments have been carried out, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
