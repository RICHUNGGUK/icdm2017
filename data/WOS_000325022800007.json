A previously proposed algorithm known as Switchable Address Translation (SAT) enhances the performance of multimedia storage devices; however, it exhibits low space utilization and executes intense monitoring. In this paper, we propose the Random Data-Aware Flash Translation Layer (RDA), which enhances the performance and durability of smart devices. RDA improves low space utilization using the state transition. Furthermore, RDA prolongs the durability of the flash memory by spreading out the random data. According to our experiment results, RDA reduces the total number of erase operations and narrows the deviation of erase operations between the physical blocks, when compared to SAT.", "paper_title": "Random data-aware flash translation layer for NAND flash-based smart devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000325022800007"}
