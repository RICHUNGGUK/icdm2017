Language composability is a property of language descriptions, which can be further classified into informal (language syntax and semantics are hard-coded in compiler/interpreter) and formal language descriptions (syntax and semantics are formally specified with one of several formal methods for language definition). However, language composition is much easier to achieve with declarative formal language descriptions into which the notion of inheritance is introduced. Multiple attribute grammar inheritance, as implemented in the language implementation system LISA, can assist in realizing all of the different types of language compositions identified in Erdweg et al. (2012). Different examples are given throughout the paper using an easy to understand domain-specific language that describes simple robot movement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
