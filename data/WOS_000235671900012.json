This paper presents a novel IP3 boosting technique using Feedforward Distortion Cancellation (FDC) method, that is, use an additional path to generate distortion and then cancel with the original LNA's distortion at its output. Through this technique, the IIP3 of LNA can be boosted from about 0 dBm, which is reported in most public literature to date, to +21 dBm, which is firstly reported to this day, with negligible noise degradation.", "paper_title": "A novel IP3 boosting technique using feedforward distortion cancellation method for 5 GHz CMOS LNA", "paper_id": "WOS:000235671900012"}
