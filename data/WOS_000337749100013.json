Broadband amplitude characteristics of the proposed networks are ensured with the use of coupled-line couplers, whereas the required phase characteristics have been achieved by the appropriate selection of right-and left-handed transmission line sections. To analyze the properties of the proposed networks, a model of an ideal left-handed transmission line has been utilized. The presented concept has been verified by two designs of broadband magic-Ts operating in 2.5-3.5 GHz and 0.8-2.3 GHz, respectively. The obtained results proved that the proposed magic-T networks allows one to obtain broadband amplitude and phase responses together with its compact structure.
