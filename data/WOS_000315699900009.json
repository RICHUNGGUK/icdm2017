By using the resolvent operator technique associated with A-maximal m-relaxed eta-accretive mappings due to Lan et al., the existence and uniqueness, of solution for this system of generalized nonlinear variational inclusions is verified and a new perturbed iterative algorithm with mixed errors for solving the aforementioned system is constructed. Also the convergence of the sequences generated by the our algorithm in q-uniformly smooth Banach spaces is proved. The results presented in this paper extend and improve some known results in the literature.", "paper_title": "A New Perturbed Iterative Algorithm with Mixed Errors for Solving System of Generalized Nonlinear Variational Inclusions", "paper_id": "WOS:000315699900009"}
