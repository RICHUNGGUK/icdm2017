Approaches that use software to support the prevention of PU are presented in the literature to make it more effective. Objectives: Identify the state of art of the approaches that use software to support the prevention of PUs. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to analyze approaches that use software to support the prevention of PU. ACM, IEEE, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and Embase databases have been searched with a predetermined search string to identify primary studies. We selected the ones that met the established inclusion criteria. Results: Thirty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. To support prevention, most approaches monitor the patient to provide information about exposure to pressure, temperature level, humidity level and estimated body position in bed providing risk factor intensity charts and intensity maps. The main method to perform patient's monitoring is using sensors installed on the mattress, but recently, alternative methods have been proposed such as electronic sensors and tactile sensory coils. Part of the approaches performs automated management of the risk factors using ventilation tubes and mattresses with porous cells to decrease body's temperature and movable cells to automatically redistribute the pressure over the body. Matters as cost of the approach, patient comfort and hygiene of the monitoring equipment is only briefly discussed in the selected articles. No experiments have been conducted to evidence the approached may reduce PU incidence. Discussion and conclusion: Currently, approaches that use software to support the prevention of PU provide relevant information to health professionals such as risk factor intensity charts and intensity maps. Some of them can even automatically manage risk factors in a limited way. Yet, the approaches are based on risk factor monitoring methods that require patient's contact with the monitoring equipment. Therefore, some matters need to be considered such as patient's comfort and the hygiene or replacement of the equipment due to the risk of infection. With the emergence of new alternative methods of monitoring, new technologies that do not require contact could be explored by new researches. Randomized Control Trials could also be conducted to verify which approaches are really effective to reduce PU incidence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
