Roboticists have recently developed an interest in social learning, since it might represent an effective strategy to enhance the adaptivity of a team of autonomous robots. In this study, we show that a methodological approach based on artifcial neural networks shaped by evolutionary computation techniques can be successfully employed to synthesise the individual and social learning mechanisms for robots required to learn a desired action (i.e. phototaxis or antiphototaxis).", "paper_title": "On the design of neuro-controllers for individual and social learning behaviour in autonomous robots: an evolutionary approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000257068700009"}
