These techniques provide interference suppression, capability for simultaneous communication with several nodes and transmission with higher data rates, respectively, through multiple antennas. By integrating different combinations of the multi-antenna techniques in physical layer with various constraints from MAC and network layers, three Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models are presented to minimize the system activation time. Since these optimization problems are complex combinatorial, the optimal solution is approached by a Column Generation decomposition method. The numerical results for different network scenarios with various node densities, number of antennas, transmission ranges and number of sessions are provided. It is shown that the resulted directive, multiple access and multiplexing gains combined with scheduling, effectively increase both the spectrum spatial reuse and the capacity of the links and therefore, enhance the achievable system throughput. Our cross-layer approach is also extended to consider heterogeneous networks and we present a multi-criteria optimization framework to model the design problem where the objective is to jointly minimize the cost of deployment and the system activation time. Our results reveal the benefits of joint design in terms of reducing the cost of deployment while achieving higher system performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
