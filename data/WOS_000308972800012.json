Various tests have been carried out on a node prototype powered by Lithium batteries in order to determine the lifetime of this network element, in several cases including 802.15.4 coordinator or end device configurations but also non-802.15.4 protocols. The results show that the lifetime is clearly dependent on the node receiving state time, which has a big impact on not only the network performance like throughput and latency but also the energy budget of the battery. The paper also illustrates the non-linear characteristic of the battery capacity. Finally, it identifies drawbacks which may be avoided in the future design of MAC (Medium Access Control) protocols in order to maximize node lifetime. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
