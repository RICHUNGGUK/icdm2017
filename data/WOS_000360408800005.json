As the effective focal lengths of the lens are wavelength dependent, the blurriness levels of the images at individual channels are different. This paper proposes a multispectral image deblurring framework to restore out-of-focus spectral images based on the characteristic of interchannel correlation (ICC). The ICC is investigated based on the fact that a high-dimensional color spectrum can be linearly approximated using rather a few number of intrinsic spectra. In the method, the spectral images are classified into an out-of-focus set and a well-focused set via blurriness computation. For each out-of-focus image, a guiding image is derived from the well-focused spectral images and is used as the image prior in the deblurring framework. The out-of-focus blur is modeled as a Gaussian point spread function, which is further employed as the blur kernel prior. The regularization parameters in the image deblurring framework are determined using generalized cross validation, and thus the proposed method does not need any parameter tuning. The experimental results validate that the method performs well on multispectral image deblurring and outperforms the state of the arts.", "paper_title": "Multispectral Image Out-of-Focus Deblurring Using Interchannel Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000360408800005"}
