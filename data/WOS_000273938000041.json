After they are matched for the least intercell moves, a refining process runs on the initial cell formation to decrease the number of intercell moves. A simple modification of this main approach can deal with some practical constraints, such as the popular constraint of bounding the maximum number of machines in a cell. Our approach makes a big improvement in the computational time. More importantly, improvement is seen in the number of intercell moves when the computational results were compared with best known solutions from the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
