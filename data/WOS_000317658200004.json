The proposed control method is based on parallel distributed control. The parameters of T-S controller are improved by distributed population genetic algorithm (GA) with chaos GA. Using Hermite-Biehler theorem in distributed population, GA is made to have a fast convergence. Dividing search space into several sub-spaces causes a better response, and chaos disturbance helps the whole algorithm to reach a best answer. The stability of the controller is analysed via the sum of squares programming, and finally, it is implemented on the plant.", "paper_title": "Modelling and control of flexible joint robot based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy approach and its stability analysis via sum of squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000317658200004"}
