Furthermore, we report suitable irreducible polynomials that lead to efficient implementations of both T and T-1, thus showing that our algorithm can be effectively applied on all the NIST-recommended curves. We also present design details of software and hardware implementations of our procedure. In a two-processor workstation software implementation, we report experimental data showing that our parallel algorithm is able to achieve a speedup factor of almost 2 when compared with the standard sequential point multiplication. In our hardware implementation, the parallel version yields a more modest acceleration of 17% when compared with the traditional point multiplication algorithm. Although the focus is on Koblitz curves, analogous strategies are discussed for other curves, in particular for random curves over binary fields.", "paper_title": "Parallel formulations of scalar multiplication on koblitz curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000254398900009"}
