The smart meter rollout in Great Britain provides such an example. Previous models of workforce planning are numerous, but extensions for large-scale technology installation schemes have been paid less attention. This paper provides three contributions to the field: (i) a novel formulation of the aggregate planning model which accounts for learning rates of the workforce when executing a new task, (ii) an enhanced process of employing uncertainty analysis using Sobol sampling, and (iii) a numerical example supplying an illustrative instance of the modelling and uncertainty analysis in practice. The proposed modelling framework can be used as a tool to further the planning capabilities and strategic decision-making tool-kits of the utility sector. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
