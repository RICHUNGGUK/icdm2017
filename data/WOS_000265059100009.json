This scheme has the computational cost of the standard one-way paraxial wave equation but has the accuracy of the full wave equation in a regime beyond the classical paraxial regime. More precisely, it accurately predicts the statistics of the reflected wave field. The accuracy depends on two parameters: the order of the iterative scheme and the ratio of the random backscattering intensity over the random forward-scattering intensity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
