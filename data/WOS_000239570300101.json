After an introduction to the scenario, we describe our approach to estimate the Quality of Projection that each individual projection system can achieve. After that we describe how we compared these estimates to the perception of human beings. Finally we present the results, which includes a new estimation function.", "paper_title": "Finding the perfect projection system - Human perception of projection quality depending on distance and projection angle", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300101"}
