The DR formulation was derived by error minimizations between two successive iterations to deduce an optimum fictitious mass and viscous damping with the aid of the Stodola iterative process. The efficiency of the new method was verified by its application to a wide range of typical structures with strong nonlinearity. The results show that compared to the conventional DR algorithm such as kinetic approach, the new method improves the convergence rate considerably. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
