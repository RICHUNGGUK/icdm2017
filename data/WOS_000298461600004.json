A transformation of the temperature values allows the isolation of the nonlinear material characteristics into a single coefficient of the heat conduction equation. The Galerkin method is utilized for spatial discretization of the problem and integration of the time domain is done by constraining the boundary heat fluxes to piecewise linear, discontinuous signals. The radiative heat exchange is computed with the help of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, such that the ambient temperatures serve as system inputs. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated by means of an example of heat treatment of a steel slab, where numerical results are compared to the finite difference method.
