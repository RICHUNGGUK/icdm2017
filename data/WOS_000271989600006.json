The main objective is to obtain a more complete understanding of the external factors affecting the publicly fund basic research in a country. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least Squares (PLS) is used to test the conceptual model with empirical data collected from WCY (World Competitiveness Yearbook) and ESI (Essential Science Indicators) database. Interrelationships among the research output and outcome, together with three external factors (resource, impetus, accumulative advantage) have been successfully explored and the conceptual model of journal evaluation has been examined.", "paper_title": "Structural equation model with PLS path modeling for an integrated system of publicly funded basic research", "paper_id": "WOS:000271989600006"}
