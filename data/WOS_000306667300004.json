The apparent bone density change as a function of the mechanical stimulus was the base of the applied remodelling model that describes disuse and overload bone resorption. The simulation was tested in a finite element model of a screw-shaped dental implant in an idealised bone segment. The sensitivity of the simulation to different mechanical parameters was investigated; these included element edge length, boundary conditions, as well as direction and magnitude of the implant loads. The alteration in the mechanical parameters had a significant influence on density distribution and model stability, in particular at the cortical bone region. The remodelling model could succeed to achieve trabeculae-like structure around osseointegrated dental implants. The validation of this model to a real clinical case is required.", "paper_title": "Computational simulation of internal bone remodelling around dental implants: a sensitivity analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000306667300004"}
