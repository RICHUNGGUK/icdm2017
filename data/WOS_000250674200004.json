A widely used too in Multicriteria Decision Making is the pairwise comparison matrix A = (a(ij)), where aij is a positive number expressing how much the alternative xi is preferred to the alternative x(j). Under a suitable hypothesis of no indifference and transitivity over the matrix A = (a(ij)), the actual qualitative ranking on the set X is achievable. Then a vector w may represent the actual ranking at two different levels: as an ordinal evaluation vector, or as an intensity vector encoding information about the intensities of the preferences. In this article we focus on the properties of a pairwise comparison matrix A = (a(ij)) linked to the existence of intensity vectors.
