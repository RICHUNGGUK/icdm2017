We found surprisingly good haptic performance and cross-modal transfer for both modalities. Interestingly, transfer was asymmetric depending on which modality was learned first. These findings are discussed in relation to haptic object processing and face processing.", "paper_title": "Short Contributions Cross-Modal Transfer in Visual and Haptic Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000207898400006"}
