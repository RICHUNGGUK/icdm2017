However, since density-ratio functions often possess high fluctuation, divergence estimation is a challenging task in practice. In this letter, we use relative divergences for distribution comparison, which involves approximation of relative density ratios. Since relative density ratios are always smoother than corresponding ordinary density ratios, our proposed method is favorable in terms of nonparametric convergence speed. Furthermore, we show that the proposed divergence estimator has asymptotic variance independent of the model complexity under a parametric setup, implying that the proposed estimator hardly overfits even with complex models. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Relative Density-Ratio Estimation for Robust Distribution Comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000316992800008"}
