To contribute to this goal, an empirical generator of sub-catchment wastewater outputs, for use as flow and water quality inputs to dynamic simulations of the larger sewerage system, is developed and evaluated. The deterministic part of the model is represented by means of Fourier series to generate diurnal profiles and a linear regression to generalise between sites, while a novel application of a multivariate error model with a lag-one autoregression term provides a stochastic component. Using a case study of Bogota (Colombia), the validities of model assumptions are analysed and model results are compared with available dry weather measurements. The transferability of the methodology to other drainage systems is partially assessed using Linz (Austria) as a case study. It is concluded that the stochastic generator is a useful tool for generating flow and water quality at gauged and ungauged sub-catchment outlets in Bogota and potentially other catchments.
