In this paper, we focus on an useful searching type in LBS, forecasting search, which provides search result for a future time based on the current information of moving objects. To deal with such kind of searches, a PV-graph is proposed for analyzing the possible situations of the moving objects. By using PV-graph, forecasting queries in LBS applications can be responded efficiently.", "paper_title": "Forecasting region search of moving objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000124"}
