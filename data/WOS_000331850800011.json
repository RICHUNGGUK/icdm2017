In this paper, we suggest a method for computing the Harary index of the Cartesian product of graphs. Then as our main purpose of this paper, we apply this result to compute the Harary index of some molecular graphs related to polyomino structures and nanostructures.", "paper_title": "Harary Index of Some Nano-Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000331850800011"}
