This paper presents the classification of these measures into five families. In addition, 18 measures based on robust statistics, previously proposed in order to deal with the problem of occlusions, are studied and compared to the state of the art. A new evaluation protocol and new analyses are proposed and the results highlight the most efficient measures, first, near occlusions, the smooth median powered deviation, and second, near discontinuities, a non-parametric transform-based measure, CENSUS.
