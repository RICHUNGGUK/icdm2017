Motivated by Hoang and Rogaway's analysis of generalized Feistel networks, we use the coupling technology from Markov chain theory and prove that for any epsilon > 0, with enough rounds, the Lai-Massey scheme is indistinguishable from a uniform random permutation by any computationally unbounded distinguisher making at most q similar to N1-epsilon combined chosen plaintext/ciphertext (CCA) queries, where N is the range size of the round function. Previous works by Vaudenay et al. and Yun et al. only proved the birthday-bound CCA security of Lai-Massey scheme.", "paper_title": "The Pseudorandomness of Many-Round Lai-Massey Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000355962400017"}
