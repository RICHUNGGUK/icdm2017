This yields an (expensive) algorithm to solve the max-plus minimal realization problem. These results are derived from general facts on rational expressions over idempotent commutative semirings: we show more generally that the set of values of the coefficients of a commutative rational expression in one letter that yield a given max-plus linear sequence is a finite union of polyhedral sets.
