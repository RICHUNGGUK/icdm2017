However, since the algorithm employs the steepest descent technique to adjust the network weights, it suffers from a slow convergence rate and often produces suboptimal solutions, which are the two major drawbacks of BP. This paper proposes a modified BP algorithm which can remarkably alleviate the problem of local minima confronted with by the standard BP (SBP). As one output of the modified training procedure, a bucket of all the possible solutions of weights matrices found during training is acquired, among which the best solution is chosen competitively based upon their performances on a validation dataset. Simulations are conducted on four benchmark classification tasks to compare and evaluate the classification performances and generalization capabilities of the proposed modified BP and SBP.
