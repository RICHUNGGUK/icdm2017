However, businesses operate in different industry, geopolitical, and regulatory contexts and have different rules and requirements for the information they exchange. So, several trading communities are tailoring UBL schemas to their needs, requiring that these schemas translate to each other. In this article, the authors describe how to enhance UBL with semantics-based translation mechanisms to maintain interoperability between documents conforming to different schema versions.", "paper_title": "A Semantic-Based Solution for UBL Schema Interoperability", "paper_id": "WOS:000265688800010"}
