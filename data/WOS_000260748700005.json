The primary focus is oil the development of a neural network-based system that could be implemented and integrated into the open architecture control system of an actual machine. A number of neural network architect tires were examined for applicability to the problem and one was selected and implemented on the actual machine. Positioning error compensation capabilities were evaluated using industry standard equipment and procedures, and the results obtained were compared with the capabilities of standard error compensation routines in machine tool controls.
