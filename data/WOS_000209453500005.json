Unlike other approaches to this task, we (1) employ sophisticated linguistic knowledge derived from semantic and discourse relations, rather than focus on morpho-syntactic knowledge; and (2) leverage a novel combination of rule-based and learning-based approaches, rather than rely solely on one or the other. Experiments show that our knowledge-rich, hybrid approach yields an F-score of 69.3, which is the best result reported to date on this dataset. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
