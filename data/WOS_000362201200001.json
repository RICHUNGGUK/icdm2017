As reported by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), energy consumption has become one of the most dominant issues for the semiconductor industry when the size of transistors scales down from 22 to 11 nm nodes. In this regard, current existing techniques such as dynamic voltage scaling, clock gating, and the Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology have shown their physical limits; therefore, scaling will no longer be a valid strategy for achieving power-performance improvement. To overcome this critical issue in energy-efficient processor design, there is a clear demand for alternative solution. In this paper, an approach that provides a promising solution for energy reduction is proposed, by using a micro-architectural technique referred to as variable stage pipelining, which can be further validated and extended to different application domains such as mobile and desktop. An analytical model for evaluating the relationship between the number of cores and the pipeline stage depth in a chip multi-processor is also proposed, based on which the optimal pipeline depth for various metrics are calculated.", "paper_title": "An energy-delay product study on chip multi-processors for variable stage pipelining", "paper_id": "WOS:000362201200001"}
