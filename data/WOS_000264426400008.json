After a brief introduction of the basic features of EEG biofeedback, the most important scenarios where such simulator enhancement can be successfully used are described. The system is introduced with the use of an analysis of the major technical and construction aspects, such as the software design, hardware realization and its incorporation into the driving simulator system. Finally, the paper sketches pilot experiments which were performed using EEG biofeedback incorporated into the driving simulator.", "paper_title": "DRIVER'S ATTENTION LEVEL IMPROVEMENT WITH USE OF BIOFEEDBACK STIMULATION INCORPORATED INTO DRIVING SIMULATOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000264426400008"}
