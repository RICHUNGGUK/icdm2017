The key drivers for this application are the benefits of agent-based industrial systems, namely in terms of robustness, scalability, reconfigurability and productivity, all of which translate to a greater competitive advantage. This manuscript monitors the chronology of research and development of the industrial applications of multiagent and holonic systems. It provides the comprehensive overview of methodologies, architectures and applications of agents in industrial domain from early nineties up to present. It also gives an outlook of the current trends as well as challenges and possible future application domains of industrial agents.", "paper_title": "Past, Present, and Future of Industrial Agent Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700056"}
