In this paper, we design an IEEE 802.11-compliant medium access control (MAC) protocol, named M-HCCA, that fully takes advantage of multi-beam smart antennas equipped at the access point (AP) to not only boost the overall capacity of a WLAN, but also support quality-of-service (QoS) and power conservation for individual mobile users. Specifically, M-HCCA has the following attractive features: (i) since being a polling-based MAC scheme, M-HCCA can innately conquer the problems induced by carrier sensing or directional signals, including beam-synchronization constraint, receiver blocking problem, and unnecessary defer problem; (ii) M-HCCA achieves high real-time throughput by adaptively adjusting the sector configuration to quickly resolve contention/collision and to increase data transmission parallelism; (iii) M-HCCA employs beam-location-aware polling scheduling to not only solve the beam-overlapping problem and back/side-lobe problem, but also let real-time stations save as much energy as possible; (iv) M-HCCA adopts the mobile-assisted admission control technique such that the AP can admit as many newly streams as possible while not violating QoS guarantees made to already-admitted streams; (v) M-HCCA offers a location updating mechanism to promptly renew the beam-location information of a non-responsive station such that the miss-hit problem can be effectively alleviated. Extensive simulation results show that, in terms of throughput, real-time throughput, and energy throughput, M-HCCA significantly outperforms existing protocols even in uneven station distribution, imperfect beam-forming, and high mobility environments.", "paper_title": "QoS Provisioning for Wireless LANs With Multi-Beam Access Point", "paper_id": "WOS:000342162100016"}
