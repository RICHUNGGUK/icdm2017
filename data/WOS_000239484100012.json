Our schemes, called Traversal & Jumping, assign to vertices of the tree distinct labels of log(2) n + O(1) bits, and support constant time adjacency queries between any two vertices by using only their labels. Moreover, all the labels can be constructed in O(n) time.", "paper_title": "Short labels by traversal and jumping", "paper_id": "WOS:000239484100012"}
