This paper presents a biologically inspired task oriented gist model (BT-Gist) that attempts to emulate two important attributes of biological gist: holistic scene centered spatial layout representation and task oriented resolution determination. For the first attribute, we enrich the model of Oliva and Torralba by refining the low-level features in several biological plausible ways, extending the spatial layout to multiple resolution and followed by perceptually meaningful manifold analysis for a set of multi-resolution biologically inspired intrinsic manifold spatial layouts (BMSLs). Since the optimal resolution that best represents the spatial layout varies from task to task, we embody the second attribute as learning the combination of BMSLs of multiple resolution with respect to their optimal discriminative invariance trade-off for the task at hand, and then cast it in the SVM based localized multiple kernel learning (LMKL) framework, by which the kernel of each scene gist is approximated as a local combination of kernels associated to multi-resolution BMSLs. By exploring the task specific category distribution pattern over BMSL, we define the local model as a category distribution sensitive (CDS) kernel, which can accommodate both the diverse individuality of specific BMSL and the universality shared within the whole category space. Via CDS-LMKL, both the optimal resolution for spatial layouts and the final classifier can be efficiently obtained in a joint manner. We evaluate BT-Gist on four natural scene databases and one cluttered indoor scene database with a range of comparison: From different MKL methods, to various biologically inspired models and BoF based computer vision models. CDS-LMKL leads to better results compared to several existing MKL algorithms. Given the two biological attributes that the framework has to follow, BT-Gist, despite its holistic nature, outperforms existing biologically inspired models and BoF based computer vision models in natural scene classification, and competes with the object segmentation based ROI-Gist in cluttered indoor scene classification.
