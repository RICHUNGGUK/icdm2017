The encoder observes a stream of source packets and outputs the channel packets in a causal fashion, which are broadcast to two receivers over burst-erasure channels. Each receiver must decode the source packets sequentially with a deadline of T-i, while its channel can introduce an erasure burst of maximum length B-i, where i is an element of {1, 2} and w.l.o.g. B-2 > B-1. We study the associated capacity as a function of the burst lengths and decoding deadlines. We observe that the operation of the system can be divided into two main regimes. The so-called large-delay regime corresponds to the case when either T-1 >= B-2 or T-2 >= B-1 + B-2. We show that for these parameters, the optimal code is obtained through simple modifications of previously proposed single-user codes by Martinian et al. and the diversity embedded streaming codes proposed by Badr et al. When both T-1 < B-2 and T-2 < B-1 + B-2, the system is said to be in the low-delay regime. We propose a new code construction and establish its optimality when T-2 >= T-1 + B-1. In the case when T-2 < T-1 + B-1, we establish upper and lower bounds on the capacity and characterize the exact capacity when either T-1 = B-1 or T-2 = B-2. Our upper bounds in the low-delay regime are based on novel information theoretic arguments that capture the tension between the decoding constraints at the two receivers.", "paper_title": "Streaming Codes for Multicast Over Burst Erasure Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000357939400004"}
