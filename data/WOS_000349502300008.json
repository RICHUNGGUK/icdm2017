These events occur in specific geographical locations, therefore the geography of the network determines the effect of failure events on the network's connectivity and capacity. In this paper we consider a generalization of the min-cut and max-flow problems under a geographic failure model. Specifically, we consider the problem of finding the minimum number of failures, modeled as circular disks, to disconnect a pair of nodes and the maximum number of failure disjoint paths between pairs of nodes. This model applies to the scenario where an adversary is attacking the network multiple times with intention to reduce its connectivity. We present a polynomial time algorithm to solve the geographic min-cut problem and develop an ILP formulation, an exact algorithm, and a heuristic algorithm for the geographic max-flow problem.
