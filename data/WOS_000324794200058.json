That is, each L-closure system is a complete L-lattice under the fuzzy inclusion order, and each complete L-lattice is isomorphic to an L-closure system. Next, we focus on information systems in fuzzy setting and propose the concept of L-information systems from the viewpoint of fuzzy logic. The cheerful result that L-information systems are a representation of complete L-lattices is presented. Furthermore, we define appropriate morphisms on L-information systems and complete L-lattices, respectively, and prove that they are categorically equivalent.", "paper_title": "L-information systems and complete L-lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200058"}
