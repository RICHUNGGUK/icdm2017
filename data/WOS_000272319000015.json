The systems consist of J discrete-time interconnected Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy subsystems, and a decentralized H-infinity filter is designed for each subsystem. It is shown that the stability of the overall filtering-error system with H-infinity performance can be established if a piecewise-quadratic Lyapunov function can be constructed. Moreover, the parameters of filters can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities that are numerically feasible. Two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Decentralized H-infinity Filter Design for Discrete-Time Interconnected Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272319000015"}
