RRS is a sample selection technique based on a modified nearest neighbor rule. It is used in order to choose the best samples to represent each class of a given database. After that, LS-SVM uses the samples selected by RRS as support vectors to find the decision surface between the classes, by solving a system of linear equations. This hybrid classifier is considered as a sparse one because it is able to detect support vectors, what is not possible when using LS-SVM separately. Some experiments are presented to compare the proposed approach with two existent methods that also aim to impose sparseness in LS-SVMs, called LS2-SVM and Ada-Pinv.", "paper_title": "RRS plus LS-SVM: a new strategy for \"a priori\" sample selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000247004800003"}
