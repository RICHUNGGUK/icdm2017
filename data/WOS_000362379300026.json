The vibrations take the form of travelling waves of arbitrary profile. The algorithm uses a fixed computational domain with the flow domain immersed in its interior. Boundary conditions enter the algorithm in the form of constraints. The spatial discretization uses a Fourier expansion in the stream-wise direction and a Chebyshev expansion in the wall-normal direction. Use of the Galileo transformation converts the unsteady problem into a steady one. An efficient solver which takes advantage of the structure of the coefficient matrix has been used. It is demonstrated that the method can be extended to more extreme geometries using the overdetermined formulation. Various tests confirm the spectral accuracy of the algorithm.
