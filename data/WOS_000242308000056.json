It is well known that finding the minimum volume covering ellipsoid (MVCE) reduces to a convex optimisation problem. We propose a regularised version of the MVCE problem, and derive its dual formulation. This makes it possible to apply the MVCE problem in kernel-defined feature spaces. The solution is generally sparse, in the sense that the solution depends on a limited set of points. We argue that the MVCE is a valuable alternative to the minimum volume enclosing hypersphere for novelty detection. It is clearly a less conservative method. Besides this, we can show using statistical learning theory that the probability of a typical point being misidentified as a novelty is generally small. We illustrate our results on real data.", "paper_title": "The minimum volume covering ellipsoid estimation in kernel-defined feature spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000056"}
