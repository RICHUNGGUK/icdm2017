H.264/AVC is a prominent video coding standard that has been used in a variety of applications due to its high efficiency comes from several new coding techniques. However, the extremely high encoding complexity hinders itself from real-time applications. This paper presents a new encoding algorithm that makes use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to train discriminant functions for classification based fast mode decision. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can successfully reduce encoding time at the expense of negligible quality degradation and bitrate increases.", "paper_title": "A Novel Fast Mode Decision Algorithm for H.264/AVC Using Particle Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400012"}
