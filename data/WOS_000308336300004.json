The purpose of this study is to investigate the adoption of innovation management applications (IMAs). Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on qualitative and quantitative evidence sourced from innovation development and commercialization functions including R&D, marketing, and administration at a university and technology transfer office. Findings - The paper contributes to literature by isolating determinants that affect the adoption of IMAs and their link to innovation process performance, confirming the importance of perceived usefulness and compatibility of IMAs to user's work styles. Originality/value - There is paucity of research concerning the adoption of IMAs which present unique challenges due to their idiosyncrasies. This study contributes by proposing an adoption model and validating it. It also links IMA adoption to innovation process performance, thereby filling a gap in extant technology adoption research.", "paper_title": "Technology adoption and performance impact in innovation domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000308336300004"}
