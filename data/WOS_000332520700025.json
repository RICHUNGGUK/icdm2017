An accurate reliability analysis of a PMS must consider statistical dependence of component states across phases, as well as dynamics in system configurations, success criteria, and component behavior. This paper proposes a new method based on multiple-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) for the reliability analysis of a non-repairable binary-state PMS. Due to its multi-valued logic nature, the MDD model has recently been applied to the reliability analysis of multistate systems. In this work, we present a novel way to adapt MDDs for the reliability analysis of systems with multiple phases. Examples show how the MDD models are generated and evaluated to obtain the mission reliability measures. Performance of the MDD-based method is compared with an existing binary decision diagram (BDD)-based method for PMS analysis. Empirical results show that the MDD-based method can offer lower computational complexity as well as a simpler model construction and improved evaluation algorithms over those used in the BDD-based method.", "paper_title": "A Multiple-Valued Decision Diagram Based Method for Efficient Reliability Analysis of Non-Repairable Phased-Mission Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000332520700025"}
