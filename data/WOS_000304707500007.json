To reduce the complexity, this paper presents an efficient block type decision algorithm for intra prediction. In H.264/AVC high profile, three kinds of block types are supported. This algorithm determines the optimal block type by two steps. The first step is based on the fact that the block type of intra prediction is highly dependent on the smoothness of macroblock. An edge-based feature is introduced to characterize the smoothness, by comparing it with two thresholds impossible block type is firstly filtered out. Then the second step is based on the correlation of block type chosen for different chroma modes. Experimental results show that the proposed fast algorithm can achieve 72.8% time saving on average for encoding the all intra-frame sequence with average 0.75% bit rate increase and 0.05dB PSNR degradation when comparing with the reference software.", "paper_title": "A fast two-step block type decision algorithm for intra prediction in H.264/AVC high profile", "paper_id": "WOS:000304707500007"}
