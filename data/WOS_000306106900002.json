This paper explores the digital forensic investigation infrastructure of India and in particular explores the judicial statutes, police/law enforcement structures and academic structures. The paper concludes to find that whilst there is a state of advancement and progression in terms of establishing guidelines for digital forensic investigation, these guidelines do not seem to carry the same status as the NIST or ACPO guidelines in the UK and US respectively, there is scope for further international collaboration on the investigation of borderless cyber crimes, there are opportunities for private firms to provide independent investigative and training services to the law enforcement agencies. Furthermore, there is an opportunity for academia in the US/UK to develop collaborative links with HE (Higher Education) institutes in India to develop and strengthen the digital forensic investigation discipline.
