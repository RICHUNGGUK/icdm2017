In dense environments, femtocell users are typically exposed to severe interference and thus not all of them can be guaranteed data rate requirements. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel and efficient scheme for maximum users with guaranteed performance, with relatively scarce resources available in femtocell networks. First, we analyze the relationship between the optimization objective, the location of users and their data rate requirements, finding that the former one is inverse proportional to the latter two. Then, based on the relationship, we propose a subchannel reuse criterion among femtocells. Finally, we formulate this subchannel reuse criterion and develop a corresponding simple resource allocation scheme, performed both at the central node-level and the coordinated femtocell base stations (FBSs)-level. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional ones in terms of the success rate and spectrum spatial reuse (SSR).", "paper_title": "Coordinated resource allocation to maximize the number of guaranteed users in OFDMA femtocell networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358135700003"}
