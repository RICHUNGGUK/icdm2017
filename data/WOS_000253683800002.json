This paper offers a new perspective and proposes a corresponding method for solving MDO problems. The proposed method, named the boundary search and simplex decomposition method (BSSDM), geometrically captures the relation among coupled state parameters with a feasible state parameter region. Given the feasible state parameter region, the SA can be avoided during the optimization of the system objective function. To identify the feasible state parameter region, a search strategy is developed to find boundary points of the region. In the boundary search process, a collaboration model (CM) is applied to maintain the feasibility of samples with respect to the SA. In search of the system optimum in the feasible region, a robust simplex decomposition algorithm is developed for convex and star-like feasible state parameter regions. The BSSDM is tested with two numerical cases, one of which is an MDO problem constrained by a convex state parameter region, and the other is a SA problem with a star-like state parameter region. All results are then validated, and the results show the promising capability of the proposed BSSDM.", "paper_title": "Boundary search and simplex decomposition method for MDO problems with a convex or star-like state parameter region", "paper_id": "WOS:000253683800002"}
