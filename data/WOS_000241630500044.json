The material is the result of the work of a so called design cluster. The cluster has, through a series of workshops, defined what it believes are the salient areas in which further research is needed. The work has a strong people centred approach as it is believed that, for the near future, it is only through a combination of man and machine that acceptable designs will be achieved. The cluster has identified 5 key areas and 39 sub-classes. The discussion focuses on the key areas and how these link to future research requirements in people centred computation for conceptual design.", "paper_title": "A forward look at computational support for conceptual design", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630500044"}
