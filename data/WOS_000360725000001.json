Based on the software ANSYS, structural analysis and thermal analysis were carried out to determine the distribution of sensors and the early warning threshold value in monitoring process. SHM system was developed for damage sensing in real-time using FBG sensors. Eight FBG sensor clusters consisting of a strain sensor and a temperature sensor were welded on the steel beam surface. Using these FBG sensors, the real-time strains in key positions during the cutting process of steel beam were measured. The monitoring data provided the early warnings and effective reference for analyzing the stability of steel beam in real-time.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Monitoring and Early Warning Method Utilizing FBG Sensors in the Retrofitting Process of Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000360725000001"}
