We show how such algebras can be introduced in an arbitrary category A by employing a base, i.e., an operation interpreting objects of A as monads on A. For every base we prove that free base algebras and free iterative base algebras exist. The main result is a coalgebraic construction of the latter: all equation morphisms form a diagram whose colimit is proved to be a free iterative base algebra. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
