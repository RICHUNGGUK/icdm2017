However, when applied to classification problem, SPP only focuses on the sparse structure but ignores the label information of samples. To enhance the classification performance, a new algorithm termed discriminative learning by sparse representation projections or DLSP for short is proposed in this paper. DLSP algorithm incorporates the merits of both local interclass geometrical structure and sparsity property. That makes it possess the advantages of the sparse reconstruction, and more importantly, it has better capacity of discrimination, especially when the size of the training set is small. Extensive experimental results on serval publicly available data sets show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
