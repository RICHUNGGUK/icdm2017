Although the addition of this physical process to the equations of hydrodynamics is straightforward, it does create numerical challenges that have to be overcome in order to ensure the physical correctness of the simulation. First, the cooling has to be treated (semi-)implicitly, owing to the discrepancies between the cooling timescale and the typical timesteps of the simulation. Secondly, because of its dependence on a tabulated cooling curve, the introduction of radiative cooling creates the necessity for an interpolation scheme. In particular, we will argue that the addition of radiative cooling to a numerical simulation creates the need for extremely high resolution, which can only be fully met through the use of adaptive mesh refinement.
