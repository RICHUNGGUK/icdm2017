The span of an L(h, k)-labeling is the difference between the largest and the smallest assigned label. We study L(h, k)-labelings of cellular, squared and hexagonal grids, seeking those with minimum span for each value of k and h >= k. The L(h, k)-labeling problem has been intensively studied in some special cases, i.e. when k = 0 (vertex coloring), h = k (vertex coloring the square of the graph) and h = 2k (radio- or lambda - coloring) but no results are known in the general case for regular grids. In this paper, we completely solve the L(h, k)-labeling problem on cellular grids, finding exact values of the span for each value of h and k; only in a small interval we provide different upper and lower bounds. For the sake of completeness, we study also hexagonal and squared grids.", "paper_title": "Optimal L(h, k)-labeling of regular grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000202967200009"}
