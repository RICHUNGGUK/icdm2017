AHP evaluates the technical factors using pairwise comparisons, and QFD categorizes the relationship between the criteria and subcriteria using expert knowledge. Based on a questionnaire given to aviation professionals, the model shows that the importance weightings of technical factors \"Extensive engine failure, uncontained engine fire,\" \"Design, manufacture,\" and \"Engine overheat, propeller failure'' are most significant. The result also shows that the overvalued and/or undervalued factors predicted by the conventional AHP model can be better described by the integrated fuzzy AHP and QFD models.", "paper_title": "A model integrating fuzzy AHP with QFD for assessing technical factors in aviation safety", "paper_id": "WOS:000348040800010"}
