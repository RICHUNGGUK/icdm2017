In this paper, we consider the feature selection problem in the scenario of wideband radar target clustering. Inspired by manifold learning, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm, called Local Reconstruction Error Alignment (LREA), to select the features that can best preserve the underlying manifold structure. We first select the features that minimize the reconstruction error in every neighborhood. Then, we apply the alignment technique to extend the local optimal feature sequence to a global unique feature sequence. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Local Reconstruction Error Alignment: A Fast Unsupervised Feature Selection Algorithm for Radar Target Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100024"}
