First, we examine the effect of using different solution representations (S-new and S-old) while applying Tabu-search algorithm. Experimental results reveal that Tabu_S-new outperforms Tabu_S-old. The rationale why Tabu_S-new is superior is further examined by characterizing the intermediate outcomes of the evolutionary processes in these two algorithms. We find that the superiority of Snew is due to its relatively higher degree of freedom in modeling Tabu neighborhood. Second, we propose a new algorithm GA_Tabu_S-new, which empirically outperforms the state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms in solving the PMFS problem. This research highlights the importance of solution representation in the application of meta-heuristic algorithm, and establishes a significant milestone in solving the PMFS problem.
