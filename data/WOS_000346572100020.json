The TM programming model supports most C/C++ programming constructs using a best-effort HTM and the help of a complete software stack including the compiler, the kernel, and the TM runtime. An extensive evaluation of the STAMP and the RMS-TM benchmark suites on BG/Q is the first of its kind in understanding characteristics of running TM workloads on real hardware TM. The study reveals several interesting insights on the overhead and the scalability of BG/Q HTM with respect to sequential execution, coarse-grain locking, and software TM.", "paper_title": "Software Support and Evaluation of Hardware Transactional Memory on Blue Gene/Q", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100020"}
