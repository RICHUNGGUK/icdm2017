Dahlquist, [13], has had a wide-ranging impact on our understanding of numerical methods for the solution of stiff differential equation systems. The present paper surveys some of the work of Dahlquist in this area. It also shows how this has led to contributions by other authors. In particular, the paper contains a review of non-linear stability for Runge-Kutta and general linear methods.", "paper_title": "Thirty years of G-stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000240721800003"}
