Orthogonal space time block coding (OSTBC) is employed at the source and the best relay. The source communicates with the destination through a relay with the maximum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in the first hop. We assume non-identically distributed Nakagami-m fading channels. The closed form expressions of outage probability, the symbol error rate (SER), and the generalized higher moments of instantaneous end-to-end signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) are provided. A tight approximation of ergodic capacity is evaluated and an asymptotic approximation is provided to obtain the diversity order. Analytical results are validated with Monte-Carlo simulations using Mathematica and MATLAB programs.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of OSTBC for Partial Relay Selection with Correlated Antennas over Nakagami-m Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700028"}
