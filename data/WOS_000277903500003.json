Nonetheless the OR methods, whose use in statistics and economics are considered superior in most cases to LS, relying on the minimization of the sum or quadratic orthogonal distances offer an interesting alternative method for obtaining a graphical 'symmetric' representation, which is not rendered by the LS method.", "paper_title": "Ordinary and Orthogonal Regressions in QSAR/QSPR and Chemistry-Related Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000277903500003"}
