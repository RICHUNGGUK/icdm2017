The bench mark configuration retained corresponds to a case of relatively simple dynamics: a two-dimensional flow around a cylinder for a Reynolds number of 200. We generalize to the first and second-order the method of calibration based on Tikhonov regularization recently used in (Physica D: Nonlinear Phenom. 2009; 238:416-427). Finally, we show that for this flow configuration this procedure is the most effective in terms of reduction of errors.
