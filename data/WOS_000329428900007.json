The software is concerned with the main concepts underlying instrumentation systems. It is based on Java applets and organized as a tutorial. It acts as a visual tool for interactive simulations. The tool covers, in a practical manner, all the stages of a basic electronic instrumentation system, the sensor, the signal conditioning, and the analog to digital conversion. It must be meant as a complement to classical teaching methodologies based on lectures, not as a substitute of such pedagogical strategies. The software helps students in learning principles of measurement systems, to improve the teaching-learning process in the discipline. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
