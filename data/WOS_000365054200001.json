OSN privacy controls now offer users more choices in this arena. We assess motivations that may override a user's concept of privacy, and we present four key motivations for OSN use: ability (1) to seek information, (2) to socialize, (3) to express oneself to others, and (4) to meet social expectations or to please others. We find that the privacy calculus constructs influence the manner in which OSN users handle different informational categories. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
