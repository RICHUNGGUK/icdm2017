This challenge can lead to unsatisfactory or even unstable DFLT performance. This work focuses on developing a new RSS model, called Exponential-Rayleigh (ER) model, for addressing this challenge. Based on data from our extensive experiments, we first develop the ER model of the received signal strength. This model consists of two parts: the large-scale exponential attenuation part and the small-scale Rayleigh enhancement part. The new consideration on using the Rayleigh model is to depict the target-induced multipath components. We then explore the use of the ER model with a particle filter in the context of multi-target localization and tracking. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our ER model outperforms the existing models. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using the Rayleigh model in mitigating the multipath interferences thus improving the DFLT performance.", "paper_title": "An Exponential-Rayleigh Model for RSS-Based Device-Free Localization and Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000349626100003"}
