Design/methodology/approach - The paper's aim is to present the applications in Boolean algebra and 0-1 integer programming of a new method based on alpha-dense curves first developed at the beginning of the 1980s by Yves Cherruault and Arthur Guillez. The alpha-dense curves generalize the space filling curves (Peanocurves,. . .) and fractal curves. The main idea consists in expressing n variables by means of a single one. Findings - Apply the method to Boolean algebra and 0-1 integer programming. Originality/value - The paper presents a new method based on alpha-dense curves for solving Boolean equations and 0-1 integer programming problems.", "paper_title": "Global optimization with alpha-dense curves: resolution of Boolean equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000304024000008"}
