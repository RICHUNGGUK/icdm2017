Hence, it takes long time to train a large dataset. In this paper, we propose a pattern selection method to reduce the training time of SVR. With multiple bootstrap samples, we estimate epsilon-tube. Probabilities are computed for each pattern to fall inside epsilon-tube. Those patterns with higher probabilities are selected stochastically. To evaluate the new method, the experiments for 4 datasets have been done. The proposed method resulted in the best performance among all methods, and even its performance was found stable.", "paper_title": "epsilon-tube based pattern selection for support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600026"}
