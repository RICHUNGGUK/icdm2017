However, when GF(2(n)) elements are represented using a polynomial basis or its generalization-shifted polynomial basis-this approach is currently appliable only to fields GF(2(n)) generated by an irreducible trinomial or a special type of irreducible pentanomials, but not to a general irreducible pentanomial. The reason is that no transformation matrix, which transforms the Mastrovito matrix into a Toeplitz matrix, has been found. In this article, we propose such a transformation matrix and its inverse matrix for an arbitrary irreducible pentanomial.", "paper_title": "GF(2(n)) Shifted Polynomial Basis Multipliers Based on Subquadratic Toeplitz Matrix-Vector Product Approach for All Irreducible Pentanomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000349672000020"}
