In order to accommodate for changes in the environment or in the requirements, and anticipate to a component failure, applications are often dynamically adapted by means of a reconfiguration. In this paper, we target the visual channel-based coordination language Reo and introduce a combined structural and behavioral model for graph-based component connectors in Reo. Exploiting concepts from category theory, we model reconfigurations of connectors as transformations of the underlying connector graphs. We show that our connector model has a compositional semantics and lift structural reconfigurations to the semantical level. As a concrete application of our framework, we introduce a notion of behavior-preserving reconfiguration for Reo and provide a sufficient condition to ensure behavior-preservation statically.
