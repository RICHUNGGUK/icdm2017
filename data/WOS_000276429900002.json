The regularity alpha gives a measure of the local regularity of the intensity function associated to an image. Known wavelet methods provide an efficient computation of alpha at contour points of the image. From a theoretical point of view, we study the effect of geometric deformations and other specific transformations applied to the image, showing invariance properties. From a practical point of view, we assess the robustness of the regularity alpha when the image undergoes various transformations. The results we obtain show the Lipschitz regularity alpha is a suitable feature for applications in computer vision.", "paper_title": "Study of a Robust Feature: The Pointwise Lipschitz Regularity", "paper_id": "WOS:000276429900002"}
