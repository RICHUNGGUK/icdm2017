By careful combination, the 64-term summation can be approximated by a four-term one. Therefore, the computational cost can be reduced. The approximation is effective for contact pairs small compared to their separations. This article also studies quantitatively how small the contact should be in order for approximation to be applicable. Numerical results show that a speed-up of over 6X could be achieved by adopting the new approach.
