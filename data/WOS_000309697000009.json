However, due to the limited bandwidth and error-prone character of the transmission channel of current wireless network, smooth real-time data transmission for mobile terminals is challenging, especially for the object which has amount of data, such as video signal. In this paper, an efficient multiple-layer scalable video coding (MLSVC) algorithm for wireless communications is proposed to avoid whole MB information loss due to the packet loss of the error-prone transmission channel. Different with the conventional scalable video coding (SVC) method, the proposed method segments the video signal in Macroblock Level (ML) during the encoding period according to the requirement of the bandwidth of the appointed wireless transmission channels to generate multiple sub-bitstreams which could be transmitted from the sender to the destination trough various channels of the wireless network. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed ML-MLSVC algorithm can achieve excellent performance in terms of encoding processing, bandwidth occupancy, transmission time and video quality. One typical potential application for our work is that it could be employed for video signal transmission through bandwidth-limited wireless transmission channels, such as sensor and wifi network.
