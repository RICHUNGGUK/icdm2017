Moreover, there are different neural mechanisms that correspond to each emotion degrees. Science lacks knowledge on the operation of such mechanisms, despite being notorious that some regions are related to particular emotions. Modern studies generally enumerate the relationship < mental process, activation region >, while it would be much more interesting if they explain the brain engine aspects. This article intends to present a technique for modeling human brain as a computable object by using Computer Theory and Digital Image Processing. A pattern cerebral activation recognizer automaton was constructed from functional magnetic resonance images in order to systemize the cerebral activation human process for a limited set of emotional stimulations.", "paper_title": "Computer theory and digital image processing applied to brain activation recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000288894000004"}
