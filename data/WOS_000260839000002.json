The problem is analyzed in a general setting which covers non-additive heteroscedastic noise under non-iid sampling. To address the estimation problem, we suggest a method based on nearest neighbor graphs and we discuss its convergence properties under the assumption of a Hadder continuous regression function. The universality of the estimator makes it an ideal tool in problems with only little prior knowledge available.", "paper_title": "On Nonparametric Residual Variance Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260839000002"}
