The motor primitive modules output motor commands based on sensory information. Complicated behavior is generated by sequentially switching the modules. The model also has a prediction unit. This unit predicts which module will be used for current action generation. We have confirmed the effectiveness of the model by applying it to a robot navigation task simulation, and have investigated the influence of the prediction on the action generation.", "paper_title": "AN ACTION GENERATION MODEL BY USING TIME SERIES PREDICTION AND ITS APPLICATION TO ROBOT NAVIGATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000266614300003"}
