So it is important to make the best use of the batteries to prolong the lifetime of the networks. With this objective in mind, a cooperative automatic retransmission request (CARQ) protocol is introduced for WSNs and a generalized discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) model is proposed for analyzing the throughput and energy efficiency of the protocol. Numerical results show that the energy efficiency of the scheme is much better than that of the traditional ARQ scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
