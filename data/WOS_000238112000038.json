Detailed discussions are also given to the relation and difference of absolute stabilities between neural networks and Lurie systems with multiple nonlinear controls. Although the basic idea of the absolute stability of neural networks comes from that of Lurie control systems, it provides a very useful practical model for the study of Lurie control systems.", "paper_title": "Absolute stability of Hopfield neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000038"}
