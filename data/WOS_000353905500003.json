We first validate the model with a two-dimensional (2D) layered flow, and find that the numerical results agree well with the corresponding analytical solutions. Then, we perform some numerical simulations to study the immiscible displacements in the cavities, and focus on the effects of the surface wettability, capillary number and density ratio on the displacement efficiency. The numerical results show that the displacement efficiency increases with the increase of the capillary number at first and then presents a decrease with the capillary number when it is large enough. The increase of the contact angle 81 or decrease of the density ratio increases the displacement efficiency but decreases the critical capillary number. Finally, it is also found that both the size and geometry of cavity have a significant influence on the displacement efficiency.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulations of immiscible displacement in the cavities via lattice Boltzmann method", "paper_id": "WOS:000353905500003"}
