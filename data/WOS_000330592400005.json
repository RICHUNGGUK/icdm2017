In reaction to these attacks, the definition of security policies is an effective way to protect information systems from further damages, but it requires a great expertise and knowledge. If stronger security policies can constitute powerful countermeasures, inappropriate policies, on the other hand, may result in disastrous consequences for the organization. The implementation of stronger security policies requires in many cases the evaluation and analysis of multiple countermeasures. Current research promotes the implementation of multiple countermeasures as a strategy to react over complex attacks; however, the methodology is either hardly explained or very complicated to implement. This paper introduces a well-structured approach to evaluate and select optimal countermeasures based on the return on response investment (RORI) index. An implementation of a real case study is provided at the end of the document to show the applicability of the model over a mobile money transfer service. The service, security policies and countermeasures are expressed using the OrBAC formalism.", "paper_title": "RORI-based countermeasure selection using the OrBAC formalism", "paper_id": "WOS:000330592400005"}
