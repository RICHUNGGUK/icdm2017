It is well-known that the projection G (g chi(S), a, b) of a frame G (g, a, b) in L-2 (R) onto L-2 (S) is a frame for L-2 (S). However, when ab > 1 and S not equal R, G (g, a, b) cannot be a frame in L-2 (R) for any g is an element of L-2 (R), while it is possible that there exists some g such that G (g, a, b) is a frame for L-2(S). So the projections of Gabor frames in L-2 (R) onto L-2 (S) cannot cover all Gabor frames in L-2 (S). This paper considers Gabor systems in L-2 ( S). In order to use the Zak transform, we only consider the case where the product ab is a rational number. With the help of a suitable Zak transform matrix, we characterize Gabor frames for L-2 (S) of the form G (g, a, b), and obtain an expression for the canonical dual of a Gabor frame. We also characterize the uniqueness of Gabor duals of type I (respectively, type II).", "paper_title": "RATIONAL TIME-FREQUENCY GABOR FRAMES ASSOCIATED WITH PERIODIC SUBSETS OF THE REAL LINE", "paper_id": "WOS:000336656900003"}
