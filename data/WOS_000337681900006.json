We present several new and existing models for this problem, provide a hierarchy with respect to the quality of the lower bounds yielded by their linear programming relaxations, and compare their computational performance on a set of benchmark instances. We conclude that three of the models are superior from a computational point of view, two of which are introduced in this article.
