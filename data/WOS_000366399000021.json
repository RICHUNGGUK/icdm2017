This study used the popular application Bitstrips as the experiment tool. Facebook was used as the Wedia platform for publishing designed comics, then used the three elements of Goffman's dramaturgy model-role, scene and dialog-to analyze 265 comics created by 3 researchers and observe the audience's responses within 9 months. The results showed that people want to see a good story with positive dialogue, and prefer scene is school more than work. As all these elements are controllable, Wedia communication has the potential for more applications. We also found that including the elements of news, gambling and gift-giving tended to trigger greater response.
