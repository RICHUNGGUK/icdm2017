The units were simulated, synthesized, and optimized using Mentor(R) design tools. The final design was verified with VHDL test benches and Matlab image processing tools. Results of the decomposition for color images validate the design. Utilizing a clock frequency of 25 MHz, a time period of 45 ms was estimated for the decomposition process of a 640 x 480 color image, which makes it feasible for real time video compression. The size of the layout was found to be within 2.5 x 2.5 mm, which suggests a 40 pin-package tiny frame.", "paper_title": "VHDL implementation of the fast Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000237327100002"}
