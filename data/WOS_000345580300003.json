However, it is a great challenge to treat 5G wireless backhaul traffic in an effective way. In this article, we analyze the wireless backhaul traffic in two typical network architectures adopting small cell and millimeter wave communication technologies. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of wireless backhaul networks is compared for different network architectures and frequency bands. Numerical comparison results provide some guidelines for deploying future 5G wireless backhaul networks in economical and highly energy-efficient ways.", "paper_title": "5G Wireless Backhaul Networks: Challenges and Research Advances", "paper_id": "WOS:000345580300003"}
