A subset S subset of V(G) is an m-tuple dominating set if S dominates every vertex of G at least m times, and an m-dominating set if S dominates every vertex of G - S at least m times. The minimum cardinality of a dominating set is gamma, of an m-dominating set is gamma(m), and of an m-tuple dominating set is. x m. For a property p of subsets of V( G), with associated parameter f(pi), the k-restricted pi-number r(k) (G, f(pi)) is the smallest integer r such that given any subset K of ( at most) k vertices of G, there exists a pi set containing K of (at most) cardinality r. We show that for 1 <= k <= n where n is the order of G: ( a) if G has minimum degree m, then r(k) (G,gamma(m)) <= (mn + k)/(m + 1); ( b) if G has minimum degree 3, then r(k) (G, gamma) <= (3n + 5k)/ 8; and ( c) if G is connected with minimum degree at least 2, then r(k) (G, gamma x 2) <= 3n/4 + 2k/7. These bounds are sharp.", "paper_title": "Restricted domination parameters in graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000245430900004"}
