High order schemes are therefore seen as the remedy for reducing the discretization errors. In the modeling of various applications, an open,boundary is necessary for simulating vacuum extending beyond the computational box, for which algorithms based on - or derived from - Berenger's Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) have demonstrated high efficiency over a wide range of wavelength and angle of incidence. The amount of numerical reflection of PMLs has been studied numerically and analytically for low order stencils but not systematically at higher order, nor for the pseudo-spectral scheme. In this paper, we extend the theoretical and numerical analysis of the coefficient of reflection of PML layers to solvers of any order of accuracy. Results show that the PML efficiency is preserved at any order, including at the infinite order limit that is attained by the pseudo-spectral formulation.
