Currently, our knowledge about the functions of transporters is limited due to the paucity of their 3D structures. Hence, computational techniques are necessary to annotate the functions of transporters. In this work, we focused on an important functional aspect of transporters, namely annotation of targets for transport proteins. We have systematically analyzed four major classes of transporters with different transporter targets: (i) electron, (ii) protein/mRNA, (iii) ion and (iv) others, using amino acid properties. We have developed a radial basis function network-based method for predicting transport targets with amino acid properties and position specific scoring matrix profiles. Our method showed a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 90.1, 80.1, 70.3 and 82.3% for electron transporters, protein/mRNA transporters, ion transporters and others, respectively, in a dataset of 543 transporters. We have also evaluated the performance of the method with an independent dataset of 108 proteins and we obtained similar accuracy. We suggest that our method could be an effective tool for functional annotation of transport proteins.", "paper_title": "Prediction of transporter targets using efficient RBF networks with PSSM profiles and biochemical properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000292778700006"}
