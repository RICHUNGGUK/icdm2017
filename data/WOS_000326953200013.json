Firstly, epsilon-limit bisimulation is defined for reflecting the dynamic relation between software specification and implementation. Some special epsilon-limit bisimulations are showed. Secondly, epsilon-bisimulation limit is proposed, which states the specification is the limit of implementation under epsilon-bisimulation. The uniqueness of epsilon-bisimulation limit and consistence with epsilon-bisimulation are presented. Finally, the substitutivity laws of epsilon-bisimulation limit with various combinators are proved.", "paper_title": "The Infinite Evolution Mechanism of epsilon-Bisimilarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000326953200013"}
