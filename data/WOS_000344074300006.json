Subject-specific hemodynamic conditions were simulated using a developed finite element solver. Individual structured meshing of the common carotid artery (CCA) bifurcation was built from segmented longitudinal and cross-sectional US images; imposed boundary velocities were based on Doppler US measurements. Simulated hemodynamic parameters such as velocities, wall shear stress (WSS) and derived descriptors were able to predict disturbed flow conditions which play an important role in the development of local atherosclerotic plaques. Hemodynamic features from six individual CCA bifurcations were analyzed. High values of time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) were found at stenosis site. Low values of TAWSS were found at the bulb and at the carotid internal and external branches depending on the particular features of each patient. High oscillating shear index and relative residence time values assigned highly disturbed flows at the same artery surface regions that correlate only moderately with low TAWSS results. Based on clinic US examinations, results provide estimates of flow changes and forces at the carotid artery wall toward the link between hemodynamic behavior and stenosis pathophysiology.", "paper_title": "Toward hemodynamic diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis based on ultrasound image data and computational modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000344074300006"}
