Specifically, the first policy aims at maximizing the system throughput while fulfilling the delay QoS and average power constraints, and the second policy is devised as an effort to minimize the total average power subject to individual delay QoS constraints. Convex optimization problems associated with the resource allocation policies are formulated based on a cross-layer framework, where the queue at the data link layer is served by the resource allocation policy. By employing the Lagrangian duality theory and the dual decomposition theory, two subgradient iteration algorithms are developed to obtain the globally optimal solutions. The aforementioned resource allocation policies have been shown to be deterministic functions of delay QoS requirements and channel fading states. Moreover, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed resource allocation policies.
