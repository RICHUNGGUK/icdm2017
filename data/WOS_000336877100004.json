Akiyama, Exoo and Harary conjectured that [GRAPHICS] <= la(G) <= [GRAPHICS] for any simple graph G, where Delta is the maximum degree of G. In this paper, it is proved that this conjecture is true for any graph G which can be embedded in a surface of nonnegative Euler characteristic, and furthermore, la(G) = [GRAPHICS] if Delta >= 9.
