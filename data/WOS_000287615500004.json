Characterizing classes of programs that are first-order definable on finite structures is theoretically challenging and of practical relevance to answer set programming. In this paper, we identify a non-trivial class of answer set programs called loop-separable programs and show that they are first-order definable on finite structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
