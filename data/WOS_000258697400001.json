The method is based on an evolutionary algorithm and reduced graphs and aims to evolve a reduced graph query (subgraph) that is present within the active compounds and absent from the inactives. The reduced graph representation enables heterogeneous Compounds, such as those found in high-throughput screening data, to be captured in a single representation with the resulting query encoding structure-activity information in a form that is readily interpretable by a chemist. The application of the method is illustrated using data sets extracted from the well-known MDDR data set and GSK in-house screening data. Queries are evolved that are consistent with the known SARs, and they are also shown to be robust when applied to independent sets that were not used in training.", "paper_title": "Evolving interpretable structure - Activity relationships. 1.
