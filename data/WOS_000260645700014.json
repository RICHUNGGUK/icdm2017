The approach is illustrated on the problem of finding a closed curve whose arclength is as small as possible while the area enclosed by the curve is fixed. This problem exemplifies a class of optimization and inverse problems that arise in diverse applications. In our approach, we assume that the surface is given parametrically. A level set formulation for the curve is developed in the surface parameter space. We show how to obtain a formal gradient for the optimization objective, and derive a gradient-type algorithm which minimizes the objective while respecting the constraint. The algorithm is a projection method which has a PDE interpretation. We demonstrate and verify the method in numerical examples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
