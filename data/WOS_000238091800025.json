A characterization of a VMU formula F is that every variable of F is used in every resolution refutation of F. We show that the class of VMU formulas is D-P-complete. For fixed deficiency (the difference of the number of clauses and the number of variables), the VMU formulas can be solved in polynomial time. Furthermore, we investigate more subclasses of VMU formulas. Although the theoretic results on VMU and MU are similar, some observations are shown that the extraction of VMU may be more practical than MU in some cases.", "paper_title": "Variable minimal unsatisfiability", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800025"}
