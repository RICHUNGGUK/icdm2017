Unlike previous works, the proposed method can keep all the secrets inside and provide high test quality and fault diagnosis ability as well. Furthermore, the proposed DFST technique can significantly reduce test application time, test data volume, and test generation effort as additional benefits.", "paper_title": "A secure test technique for pipelined advanced encryption standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000254606100047"}
