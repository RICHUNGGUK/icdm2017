In addition, the parallelized algorithms for the automatic facial expression exaggeration system are developed to reduce the execution time on a multi-core embedded system. The experimental results show satisfactory expression exaggeration results and computational efficiency of the automatic facial expression exaggeration system under cluttered environments. The quantitative experimental comparisons show that the proposed parallelization strategies provide significant computational speedup compared to the single-processor implementation on a multi-core embedded platform.", "paper_title": "Automatic Facial Expression Exaggeration System with Parallelized Implementation on a Multi-Core Embedded Computing Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000334506000006"}
