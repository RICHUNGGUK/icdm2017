Each character which comprises slab identification numbers may be corrupted severely before it is captured by network cameras. Therefore, proper processing is required to localize the target texts successfully. In this paper, we propose (1) a method to evaluate the closeness of an edge patch to the form of a closed contour, (2) an edge inspection method to determine character colors and estimate font thickness, and (3) three reasonable binarization methods to increase the performance of the algorithm for the detection of the left and right boundaries of the text rectangle. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are reliable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
