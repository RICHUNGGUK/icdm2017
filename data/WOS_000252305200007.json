For this purpose, we consider around 20 such optimization problems, as well as their parametric duals, that deal with various fundamental relations among vertices and edges in graphs. We have almost completely settled their parameterized complexity by giving either FPT algorithms or W[1]-hardness proofs. Furthermore, we obtain faster exact algorithms for several cardinality constrained optimization problems by transforming them into problems of finding maximum (minimum) weight triangles in weighted graphs.", "paper_title": "Parameterized complexity of cardinality constrained optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000252305200007"}
