The most common form of trade credit policy that is used to encourage retailers to buy larger quantities is order-size dependent. When the number of ordered units exceeds the capacity of the own warehouse, an additional rented warehouse is required to store the excess units. Therefore, to incorporate the concept of order-size dependent trade credit and limited storage capacity, we proposed an integrated inventory model with capacity constraint and a permissible delay payment period that is order-size dependent. In addition, the unit production cost, which is a function of the production rate, is considered. Three theorems and an algorithm are developed to determine the optimal production and replenishment policies for both the supplier and the retailer. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the solution procedure and the sensitivity analyses of some key parameters are provided to demonstrate the proposed model.
