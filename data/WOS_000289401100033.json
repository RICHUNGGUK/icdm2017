The experimental results for three benchmark problems indicated that such, integration can have better performance. In addition, using tie proposed ISGP algorithm to exercise oil price forecasting also showed that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve more promising accuracy than the auto-regressive integrated moving average (A RIMA) model and four evolutionary algorithms (EAs) proposed in literatures.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATION OF SOM NETWORK AND EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS TO TRAIN RBF NETWORK FOR FORECASTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000289401100033"}
