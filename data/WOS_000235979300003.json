If a numerical scheme shall capture such flows efficiently, it should be able to preserve the unperturbed equilibrium state at the discrete level. Here, we present a class of schemes of any desired order of accuracy which preserve the lake at rest perfectly. These schemes should have an impact for studying important classes of lake and ocean flows. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
