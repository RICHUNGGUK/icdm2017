Second-order rays however, as, for example, those resulting from specular reflections, are challenging for the feed-forward approach. We propose an extension of the feed-forward pipeline to handle second-order rays resulting from specular and glossy reflections. The coherence of second-order rays is leveraged through clustering, the geometry reflected by a cluster is approximated with a depth image, and the color samples captured by the second-order rays of a cluster are computed by intersection with the depth image. We achieve quality specular and glossy reflections at interactive rates in fully dynamic scenes.", "paper_title": "Second-Order Feed-Forward Rendering for Specular and Glossy Reflections", "paper_id": "WOS:000341566500009"}
