The present article introduces an immunological algorithm for continuous global optimization problems, called OPT-IA. Several biologically inspired algorithms have been designed during the last few years and have shown to have very good performance on standard test bed for numerical optimization. In this paper we assess and evaluate the performance of OPT-IA, FEP, IFEP, DIRECT, CEP, PSO, and EO with respect to their general applicability as numerical optimization algorithms. The experimental protocol has been performed on a suite of 23 widely used benchmarks problems. The experimental results show that OPT-IA is a suitable numerical optimization technique that, in terms of accuracy, generally outperforms the other algorithms analyzed in this comparative study. The OPT-IA is also shown to be able to solve large-scale problems.", "paper_title": "An immunological algorithm for global numerical optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238246200025"}
