Finding the set of the \"worst-best\" (lowest scores for basic attributes that lead to the highest score for the root attribute) and \"best-worst\" (highest scores for basic attributes that lead to the lowest score for the root attribute) options are of interest for improving current cropping systems. As DEXi-type models revealed a monotonicity property, we used a genetic algorithm to find these two sets. These sets are small and show that only a few attributes need to have low scores to reach the best-worst options or high scores to reach the worst-best options. These attributes are those with a high sensitivity index. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
