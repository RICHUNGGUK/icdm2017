Weighted System of Simple Sequential Processes with Resources ((WSPR)-P-3) is an important subclass of Petri nets that can model many resource allocation systems in which 1) multiple processes may run in parallel and 2) each execution step of each process. may use multiple units from a single resource type but cannot use multiple resource types. We first prove that the liveness problem of (WSPR)-P-3 is co-NP-hard on the basis of the partition problem. Furthermore, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the liveness of (WSPR)-P-3 based on two new concepts called Structurally Circular Wait (SCW) and Blocking Marking (BM), i.e., a (WSPR)-P-3 is live if each SCW has no BM. A sufficient condition is also proposed to guarantee that an SCW has no BM. Additionally, we show some advantages of using SCW to analyze the deadlock problem compared to other siphon-based ones, and discuss the relation between SCW and siphon. These results are valuable to the further research on the deadlock prevention or avoidance for (WSPR)-P-3.", "paper_title": "The Liveness of (WSPR)-P-3: Complexity and Decision", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236400013"}
