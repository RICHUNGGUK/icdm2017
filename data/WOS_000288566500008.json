To investigate the effect of bicycles going in the wrong direction, a Bi-Directional Adaptive EBCA model is developed in this paper. The phase transition F-J as well as the phase transition F-S-F are suggested by observing the spatial-temporal pattern. The deterministic case that the linear relationship between the average flow rate and the bicycle number disappears when the average density exceeds a particular value is shown. Under the stochastic case, the impacts of the avoiding probability Ps and the returning probability Pr on the traffic system are analyzed. The results of the simulation are in good agreement with the realistic bicycle flow.", "paper_title": "AN ADAPTIVE EBCA MODEL PROBING THE PROBLEM OF RIDING AGAINST THE TRAFFIC FLOW", "paper_id": "WOS:000288566500008"}
