This model can be viewed as an extension of the highly successful paper of (Paun and Paun 2002) describing P systems based on symport/antiport. The previous model represented an important change of direction from strings to objects in the area of P systems. The main drawback of the model from 2002 was the massive parallelism that is not seen in real life. The 2006 model was a step in controlling the parallelism the same way it is done in nature in symporters and antiporters: these processes take place through protein channels embedded at the level of the membrane which can only be used by a molecule at a time, thus yielding a sequentiality with respect to the number of such proteins embedded in the membrane.", "paper_title": "P SYSTEMS WITH PROTEINS ON MEMBRANES: A SURVEY", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200004"}
