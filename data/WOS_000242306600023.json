A major shortcoming of existing EISs is that their database schema and data content are predetermined, fixed, and hard-coded, which leads to predefined data analysis patterns. In this paper, we propose a new EIS architecture that takes advantage of a knowledge-based mechanism known as the Metadatabase. The architecture enables executives to discover new informational structures, such as critical successful factors and perspectives from which to analyze these factors, that are useful for the analysis of an enterprise's business performance. The novel and on-demand data analysis needs of executives are supported by the online capability of the new EIS architecture, and we argue that the new architecture has better system flexibility and adaptability compared to existing EISs.
