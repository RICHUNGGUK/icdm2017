The integer a(n) appears as the main term in a weighted average of the number of orbits in a particular quasihyperbolic automorphism of a 2n-torus, which has applications to ergodic and analytic number theory. The combinatorial structure of a(n) is also of interest, as the 'signed' number of ways in which 0 can be represented as the sum of epsilon(j) j for -n <= j <= n (with j not equal 0), with epsilon(j) is an element of{0, 1}. Our result answers a question of Thomas Ward (no relation to the fourth author) and confirms a conjecture of Robert Israel and Steven Finch.", "paper_title": "Resolution of T.
