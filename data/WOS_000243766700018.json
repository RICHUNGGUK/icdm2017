By the term associative watermarking we refer to this new technique that combines the traditional idea of digital watermarking with the concept of association rules widely applied in the field of data mining. As our experimental results, after the similarity diagram test, the new digital watermarking technique proves to be capable of guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of the extracted watermark even when the embedded image has gone through various kinds of image processing procedures.
