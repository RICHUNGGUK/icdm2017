One FE scheme in particular, the P - P1 pair, combined with the primitive equations may be advantageously compared with the wave equation formulations and both schemes have similar data structures. Our focus here is on comparing these two approaches for a number of measures including stability, accuracy, efficiency, conservation properties, and consistency. The main part of the analysis centres on stability and accuracy results via Fourier-based dispersion analyses in the context of the linear SW equations. The numerical solutions of test problems are found to be in good agreement with the analytical results.
