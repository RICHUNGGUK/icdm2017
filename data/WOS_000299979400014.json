The problems of clustering categorical data have attracted much attention from the data mining research community recently. As the extension of the k-Means algorithm, the k-Modes algorithm has been widely applied to categorical data clustering by replacing means with modes. In this paper, the limitations of the simple matching dissimilarity measure and Ng's dissimilarity measure are analyzed using some illustrative examples. Based on the idea of biological and genetic taxonomy and rough membership function, a new dissimilarity measure for the k-Modes algorithm is defined. A distinct characteristic of the new dissimilarity measure is to take account of the distribution of attribute values on the whole universe. A convergence study and time complexity of the k-Modes algorithm based on new dissimilarity measure indicates that it can be effectively used for large data sets. The results of comparative experiments on synthetic data sets and five real data sets from UCI show the effectiveness of the new dissimilarity measure, especially on data sets with biological and genetic taxonomy information.
