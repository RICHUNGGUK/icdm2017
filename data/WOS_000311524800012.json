The key idea is to describe any spoken language with a common set of fundamental units that can be defined \"universally\" across all spoken languages. In this study, speech attributes, such as manner and place of articulation, are chosen to form this unit inventory and used to build a set of language-universal attribute models with data-driven modeling techniques. The vector space modeling approach to LRE is adopted, where a spoken utterance is first decoded into a sequence of attributes independently of its language. Then, a feature vector is generated by using co-occurrence statistics of manner or place units, and the final LRE decision is implemented with a vector space language classifier. Several architectural configurations will be studied, and it will be shown that best performance is attained using a maximal figure-of-merit language classifier. Experimental evidence not only demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed techniques, but it also shows that the proposed technique attains comparable performance to standard approaches on the LRE tasks investigated in this work when the same experimental conditions are adopted.
