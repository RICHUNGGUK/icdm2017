A self-calibrated block is proposed to compensate the non-linearities of the on-chip oscillator due to PVT variations. In this manner, this on-chip oscillator-based temperature sensor has superior performance over the conventional inverterchain-based types. In order to generalize the application, no highly linear temperature coefficient resistors are being utilized. The entire circuit is simple and easy to be scaled down. According to the verifications in 65 nm CMOS process, with one-point calibration, this temperature sensor can achieve an inaccuracy within +/- 1 degrees C in the temperature range from -55 degrees C to 125 degrees C, with a power consumption of only 0.6 mu A under 1.2V supply voltages.", "paper_title": "A New Time-Mode On-Chip Oscillator-Based High Linearity and Low Power Temperature Sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000363784800011"}
