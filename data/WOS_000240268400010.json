Previously we have shown that classification can be an effective and robust tool for selecting appropriate in-domain responses. In this paper, we consider the problem of dealing with out-of-domain user questions. We introduce a taxonomy of out-of-domain response types. We consider three classification architectures for selecting the most appropriate out-of-domain responses. We evaluate these architectures and show that they significantly improve the quality of the response selection making the user's interaction with the virtual character more natural and engaging.", "paper_title": "Dealing with out of domain questions in virtual characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000240268400010"}
