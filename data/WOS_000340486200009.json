The search for the optimum parameters is conducted over several markets, in the hope of exposing the GA to differing conditions, increasing the robustness of the solutions produced. Our results show an improvement in terms of performance for the solutions generated under this robust method when compared to those offered by single-market optimization.", "paper_title": "On the quest for robust technical trading strategies using multi-objective optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000340486200009"}
