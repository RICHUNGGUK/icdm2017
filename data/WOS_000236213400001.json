This weighting function determines a weighted average aggregation of the cuts of the fuzzy number according to the preference of a decision-maker. Some properties of the weighting function are provided and a preference index that qualifies this aggregation and can serve as a parameter for the definition of interval approximation of a fuzzy number is proposed. A special class of parameterized weighting functions satisfying the maximal entropy principle is proposed. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
