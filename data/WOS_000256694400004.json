Mainly, we compute the rates of A-statistical convergence of these operators, which are observed to be stronger than that of the operators used commonly in Approximation Theory. Furthermore, we present an rth order generalization of our sequence of Kantorovich-type operators. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
