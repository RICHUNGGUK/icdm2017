Also, the proposed security model for IBPS is not enough complete according to Boldyreva's work. Cao and Cao proposed an IBPS scheme in the standard model. However, their scheme is not secure because of not resisting the attack of delegator and requires more computation cost. In this paper, we present a framework for IBPS and show a detailed security model for IBPS. Under our framework, we present an efficient IBPS scheme in the standard model. Compared with other IBPS schemes, the proposed scheme has more complete security and is more efficient.", "paper_title": "Efficient Identity-Based Proxy Signature in the Standard Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000359137500022"}
