Due to broad CPU diversity and shrinking time- to- market, HDS development can neither rely on hand-retargeting binary tools, nor can it rely on pre-existent tools within standard packages. As a consequence, binary utilities which can be easily adapted to new CPU targets are of increasing interest. We present in this article a framework for automatic generation of binary utilities. It relies on two innovative ideas: platform-aware modeling and more inclusive relocation handling. Generated assemblers, linkers, disassemblers and debuggers were validated for MIPS, SPARC, PowerPC, i8051 and PIC16F84. An open- source prototype generator is available for download.", "paper_title": "An open-source binary utility generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000255367500005"}
