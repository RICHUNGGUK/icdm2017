Although Ajax allows developers to create rich Web applications, Ajax applications can be difficult to comprehend and thus to maintain. For this reason, we have created FireDetective, a tool that uses dynamic analysis at both the client (browser) and server-side to facilitate the understanding of Ajax applications. We evaluate FireDetective using (1) a pretest-posttest user study and (2) a field user study. Preliminary evidence shows that the FireDetective tool is an effective aid for Web developers striving to understand Ajax applications.", "paper_title": "Understanding Ajax applications by connecting client and server-side execution traces", "paper_id": "WOS:000314067000002"}
