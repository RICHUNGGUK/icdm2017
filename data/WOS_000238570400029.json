In this paper, some constructions are provided. In particular, the Theorem 3 in [7] is improved. As e-almost (n, 1, k)-resilient functions play an important role in the secondary constructions, we concluded some properties and constructions. Specially we presented a spectral characterization of almost (n, 1, k)-resilient functions, which can be used to identify an almost (n, 1, k)-resilient function by computing its walsh spectra.", "paper_title": "Results on almost resilient functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238570400029"}
