This paper studies some multistability properties for a class of bidirectional associative memory recurrent neural networks with unsaturating piecewise linear transfer functions. Based on local inhibition, conditions for globally exponential attractivity are established. These conditions allow coexistence of stable and unstable equilibrium points. By constructing some energy-like functions, complete convergence is studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
