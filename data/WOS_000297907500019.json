FA mimics the social behavior of fireflies based on their flashing characteristics. The results of a trade study carried out on six classical structural optimization problems taken from literature confirm the validity of the proposed algorithm. The unique search features implemented in FA are analyzed, and their implications for future research work are discussed in detail in the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
