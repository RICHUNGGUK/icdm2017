Like many other technologies, the uptake of personalization has been rapid, with inadequate consideration given to its effects. Personalization in e-learning systems also has potential for both harmful and beneficial outcomes, but less is known about its effects. The ethical and social hazards include privacy compromise, lack of control, reduced individual capability, and the commodification of education. Personalization is appearing in many systems already; thus, these hazards may already be occurring. Solutions, more research and community discussion of the issues are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
