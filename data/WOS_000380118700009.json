Assisted with nitrogen vacancy centers, we propose several schemes to teleport the quantum CNOT gate. Deterministic CNOT gate may be implemented on a remote two-photon system, remote two electron-spin system, hybrid photon-spin system or hybrid spin-photon system. Each photon only interacts with one spin each time. Moreover, quantum channel may be constructed by all combinations of the photon or electron-spin entanglement, or their hybrid entanglement. Since these electron-spin systems have experimentally shown a long coherence time even at the room temperature, our schemes provide useful ways for long-distance quantum applications.", "paper_title": "TELEPORTATION OF A CONTROLLED-NOT GATE FOR PHOTON AND ELECTRON-SPIN QUBITS ASSISTED BY THE NITROGEN-VACANCY CENTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000380118700009"}
