Ab initio quantum chemical studies of aggregates were performed for these strong acids. Structures were calculated using DFT methods with the B3LYP hybrid functional and aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. As an initial constraint, an H2SO4 moiety was placed in all candidate structures. A total of 11 optimized structures was found: a global minimum (CSN-a) plus ten local minima on the Potential Energy Surface (PES). The global minimum aggregate gave four hydrogen bonds, yielding a hexagonal ring in its structure. HNO3 acts as proton donor in all clusters; nevertheless, using trans-H2SO4 as the proton donor yielded the most stable structures, whereas HCl acts mainly as a proton donor/acceptor. Real harmonic frequencies, IR spectra, and inter-monomeric parameters were obtained. CSN-a symmetric stretching modes were shifted to 2805.56 cm(-1) and 3520.00 cm(-1) for H-Cl modes, while O-H modes shifted to 3256.87 cm(-1) and 3362.47 cm(-1). On the other hand, relative stabilities improved for 5 of the 11 aggregates when the temperature decreased from 298 K to 210 K, 195 K and 188 K. The aggregate CSN-f remained unstable only at 210 K. Moreover, the relative Gibbs free energy, Delta G((0-298K)) was-9.26 kcalmol(-1) with respect to CSN-a; relative reaction Gibbs free energy [Delta(Delta G)] values ranged from 0.0 at 298 K, to -6.9 kcalmol(-1) at 188 K. It seems that CSN aggregates remain slightly more stable than CNS aggregates with a HNO3 moiety when the temperature decreases from 298 to 188 K. Five structures remained relatively stable under both study conditions.", "paper_title": "Relative stabilities of HCl center dot H2SO4 center dot HNO3 aggregates in polar stratospheric clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000351477800012"}
