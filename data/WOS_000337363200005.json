The nonlinearities are included to describe the phenomena of nonlinear disturbances which exist in the network and may occur in a probabilistic way. Considering the fact that probabilistic data missing may occur in the process of information transmission, we introduce the randomly data missing into the sensor measurements. The aim of this paper is to design a state estimator to estimate the true states of the considered complex network through the available output measurements. By using a Lyapunov functional and some stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient criteria are obtained in the form of linear matrix inequalities under which the estimation error dynamics is globally asymptotically stable in the mean square. Furthermore, the state estimator gain is also obtained. Finally, a numerical example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation conditions.", "paper_title": "State estimation for complex systems with randomly occurring nonlinearities and randomly missing measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363200005"}
