Inspired by the principles of Hierarchical Fair Competition, we propose Tribe-PSO, a multi-layered and multi-phased hybrid particle swarm optimization model, in this article. With benchmarks on several widely used multimodal test functions, Tribe-PSO proved to be a powerful global optimization algorithm. Tribe-PSO is then incorporated with the scoring functions in AutoDock 3.05 to perform molecular docking simulations of 100 receptor-ligand complexes from the Protein Data Bank. The simulation results show that the docking procedures using Tribe-PSO method generally find out the stable conformation as well as the native-like complexes more efficiently and accurately than GA-LS combination which is used in AutoDock 3.05 as the optimizer. All the tests demonstrate that Tribe-PSO is a promising search algorithm for molecular docking problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
