This paper describes the development of the enabling technology developed for a machine vision-based process monitoring system. One of the key factors affecting the performance of a machine vision system is the quality of the lighting. In the application described in this paper the available lighting was severely limited by the confined space in which the system had to operate. The problem was also compounded by the reflective nature of the objects to be examined. The initial images obtained were not suitable for further processing due to the presence of significant shadows and specular reflections. A novel solution to this problem based on multiple wavelength illumination and signal processing is presented along with results from experimental trials of the approach.", "paper_title": "The development and application of a multiple wavelength illumination technique for the vision-based process monitoring of aero-structure riveting", "paper_id": "WOS:000246153200002"}
