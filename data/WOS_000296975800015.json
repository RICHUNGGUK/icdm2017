For the assumed linear dynamic system, based on the newly constructed measurements whose measurement noises are uncorrelated, we derive a distributed Kalman filtering fusion algorithm without feedback, and prove that it is an optimal distributed Kalman filtering fusion algorithm. Then, for the same linear dynamic system, also based on the newly constructed measurements, a distributed Kalman filtering fusion algorithm with feedback is proposed. A rigorous performance analysis is dedicated to the distributed fusion algorithm with feedback, which shows that the distributed fusion algorithm with feedback is also an optimal distributed Kalman filtering fusion algorithm; the P matrices are still the estimate error covariance matrices for local filters; the feedback does reduce the estimate error covariance of each local filter. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the validity of the newly proposed fusion algorithms and the performance analysis.", "paper_title": "Optimal distributed Kalman filtering fusion for a linear dynamic system with cross-correlated noises", "paper_id": "WOS:000296975800015"}
