Whereas typesate expresses a temporal specification of one object, a tracematch state may change due to operations on any of a set of related objects bound by the tracematch. The paper proposes a lattice-based operational semantics equivalent to the original tracematch semantics but better suited to static analysis. The paper defines a static analysis that computes precise local points-to sets and tracks the flow of individual objects, thereby enabling strong updates of the tracematch state. The analysis has been proved sound with respect to the semantics. A context-sensitive version of the analysis has been implemented as instances of the IFDS and IDE algorithms. The analysis was evaluated on tracematches used in earlier work and found to be very precise. Remaining imprecisions could be eliminated with more precise modeling of references from the heap and of exceptional control flow.", "paper_title": "Typestate-like Analysis of Multiple Interacting Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000262035900021"}
