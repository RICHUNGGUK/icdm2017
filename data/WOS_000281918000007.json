Because of inherent difficulties, many of these solutions scale poorly in either time or space as rule sets grow in size. Recursive Flow Classification (RFC) is an algorithm with a very high classifying speed. However, its preprocessing complexity and memory requirement are rather high. In this paper, we propose an enhanced RFC (ERFC) algorithm, in which a hash-based aggregated bit vector scheme is exploited to speed up its preprocessing procedure. A compressed and cacheable data structure is also introduced to decrease total memory requirement and imp rove its searching performance. Evaluation results show that ERFC provides a great improvement over RFC in both space requirement and preprocessing time. The search time complexity of ERFC is equivalent to that of RFC in the worst case; and its average classifying speed is improved by about 100%.", "paper_title": "ERFC: An Enhanced Recursive Flow Classification Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000281918000007"}
