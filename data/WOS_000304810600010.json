Recent methods based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), applicable for high-order systems, are presented and compared. Particular attention is paid to the link between the choice of the projection and the efficiency of the reduced model. A stabilizing projection is introduced to induce a stable reduced-order model at finite time even if the energy of the physical model is growing. The proposed method is particularly well adapted for time-dependent hyperbolic systems and intrinsically skew-symmetric models. This paper also provides a common methodology to reliably reduce very large nonsymmetric physical problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
