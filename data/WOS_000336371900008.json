Manifold learning-based researches have been considered as one of the most promising directions. In this paper, by analyzing traditional methods, we summarized a new framework for high-dimensional correspondence learning. Within this framework, we also presented a new approach, Local Approximation Maximum Variance Unfolding. Compared with other machine learning-based methods, it could achieve higher accuracy. Besides, we also introduce how to use the proposed framework and methods in a concrete application, cross-system personalization (CSP). Promising experimental results on image alignment and CSP applications are proposed for demonstration.", "paper_title": "Learning high-dimensional correspondence via manifold learning and local approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336371900008"}
