Each cluster has a clusterhead such that all nodes within unit distance and some nodes within distance m of the clusterhead belong to the cluster. We show that, by asserting a stretch factor m >= 2, FLOC achieves locality of clustering and fault-local self-stabilization: The effects of cluster formation and faults/changes at any part of the network are contained within at most m + 1 units. Through simulations and experiments with actual deployments, we analyze the trade-offs between clustering time and the quality of clustering and suggest suitable parameters for FLOC to achieve a fast completion time without compromising the quality of the resulting clustering.", "paper_title": "A fault-local self-stabilizing clustering service for wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239249800003"}
