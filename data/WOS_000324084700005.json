To reduce the negative impact on the environment, global manufacturers need to take responsibility for designing sustainable products and implementing cleaner production systems for 3R operations (3R-Reuse/Remanufacture/Recycle). Nevertheless, there is still a lack of comprehensive measures for assessing product returns with recovery settings. In this paper, a framework for performance evaluation using design for six sigma methodology is developed to estimate utilisation value of a manufactured product with recovery settings, which accounts for total recovery cost, manufacturing lead-time, minimisation for landfill waste and quality characteristic. Finally, a numerical example based on these performance attributes to assess product utilisation value is presented. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
