An experiment was conducted on a college campus using 94 student subjects. Communication outcomes were collected using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using MANCOVA (multivariate analysis of covariance) and discriminant analysis. Playfulness was used as a covariate, The analysis showed that the e-mail group appeared to have higher communication quality and effectiveness. A significant relationship was found to exist between flow and communication outcomes when the communication medium was e-mail; but no significant relationship was found to exist when the communication medium was instant messaging. Playfulness, a covariate, affected the relationship between the media type and communication outcomes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
