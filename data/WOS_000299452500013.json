In this paper, the similarities between traffic flow objects with spatial temporal characteristics were measured by introducing the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the shortest path analysis method. We proposed a new fuzzy clustering algorithm for road network traffic flow data. So that traffic flow data objects with similar properties and space correlation are clustered into a group, which find the spatial distribution pattern of road traffic flow. The experimental results show that the method was valid and effective. The road network was classified reasonably, and classification results could provide traffic zone division with decision auxiliary support.", "paper_title": "Traffic Flow Data Mining and Evaluation Based on Fuzzy Clustering Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000299452500013"}
