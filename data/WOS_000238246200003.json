The performance of Ant-Miner with the new pruning procedure is evaluated and compared with the performance of the original Ant-Miner across several datasets. The results show that the new pruning procedure has a mixed effect on the performance of Ant-Miner. On one hand, overall it tends to decrease the classification accuracy more often than it improves it. On the other hand, the new pruning procedure in general leads to the discovery of classification rules that are considerably shorter, and so simpler (more easily interpretable by the users) than the rules discovered by the original Ant-Miner.", "paper_title": "A new classification-rule pruning procedure for an ant colony algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000238246200003"}
