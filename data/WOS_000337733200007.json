By assuming that each actuator fault takes values randomly in a finite set, a new actuator-failure-mode is proposed. Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with the input delay approach as well as the free-weighting matrix approach are employed to establish the H-infinity performance, and the controller design is cast into a convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. The designed reliable controller can guarantee that the output of the closed-loop sampled-data system tracks the reference signal without steady-state error. An airship model is considered in this paper and its simulation results are given.", "paper_title": "Reliable Robust Sampled-Data H-infinity Output Tracking Control with Application to Flight Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000337733200007"}
