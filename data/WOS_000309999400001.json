Our counterexample is based on Burling's construction from 1965 of 3-dimensional box hypergraphs with clique number 2 and arbitrarily large chromatic numbers and the bijection between domains of event structures and median graphs established by Barthelemy and Constantin in 1993.", "paper_title": "NICE LABELING PROBLEM FOR EVENT STRUCTURES: A COUNTEREXAMPLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000309999400001"}
