Moreover, we show that these words cannot contain more than one hole and the only hole must Occur either in the first or in the second position. We define that a partial word is k-overlap-free if it does not contain a factor of the form xyxyx where the length of x is at least k. We prove that there exist infinitely many 2-overlap-free binary partial words containing an infinite number of holes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
