The experimental data considered are provided by cruciform tests and digital image correlation. A simplified version of the constitutive model proposed by Xia et al. (Int J Solids Struct 39:4053-4071, 2002) is adopted. The inverse analysis is comparatively performed by the following alternative computational methodologies: (a) mathematical programming by a trust-region algorithm; (b) proper orthogonal decomposition and artificial neural network. The second procedure rests on preparatory once-for-all computations and turns out to be applicable economically and routinely in industrial environments.", "paper_title": "On calibration of orthotropic elastic-plastic constitutive models for paper foils by biaxial tests and inverse analyses", "paper_id": "WOS:000305134600009"}
