The new method finds the underlying geometric structure information hiding in HRRP target and uses it to overcome the HRRP target-aspect sensitivity. The relaxing of constraint in the membership matrix improves anti-noise performance and robustness of the algorithm. Finally, experiments on three kinds of ground HRRP target under different SNRs and four UCI datasets demonstrate the proposed method not only has better recognition accuracy but also more robust than the other three comparison methods.", "paper_title": "Radar HRRP Target Recognition Based on the Improved Kernel Distance Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422200009"}
