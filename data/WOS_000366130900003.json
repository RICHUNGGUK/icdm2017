In this paper, the multimedia multicast scheduling design problem for multi-hop vehicular networks is studied. Many previous works on multimedia scheduling problem focused on the design for one-hop networks or multi-hop networks with fixed relay stations. However, for multi-hop vehicular networks, with the possibility that each vehicle can be selected as relay and various channel conditions etc., the optimal scheduling scheme is hard to obtain. We develop a heuristic scheduling algorithm to approach the performance of the intractable optimal scheduling scheme. Simulation results show that performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm approaches the optimal results and shows some good properties against other algorithms, which verifies the contribution of our work.", "paper_title": "MMS-MVN: a multimedia multicast scheduling method for multi-hop vehicular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000366130900003"}
