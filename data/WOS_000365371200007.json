This paper is devoted to the study of the discrete counterpart of semi-t-operators on a finite totally ordered set. A characterization of semi-t-operators on a finite totally ordered set is given. Moreover, The relations among nullnorms, t-operators, semi-t-operators and pseudo-t-operators (i.e., commutative semi-t-operators) on a finite totally ordered set are shown.", "paper_title": "SEMI-T-OPERATORS ON A FINITE TOTALLY ORDERED SET", "paper_id": "WOS:000365371200007"}
