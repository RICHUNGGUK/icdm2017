To save die area compared to conventional parallel LNAs, the authors have employed an alternative circuit configuration. It consists of sharing the most die consuming elements (inductances) in both operation standards, enabling a more compact solution. The standard selection is performed through a bias scheme (MOS switches) that allows alternating between the two involved standards. The LNA die area is 1.0 x 1.2 mm(2) and it consumes 6.8 mW (3.8 mA under 1.8 V), including bias circuitry. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
