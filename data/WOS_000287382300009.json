We consider AHNEPs with all the nodes specialized in only one evolutionary operation (substitution, insertion, or deletion) or in two operations out of these three. The considered variants differ in two respects: filters that are used to control the exchange of information (we use random context conditions and regular languages as filters) and the way of accepting the input word (at least one output node or all output nodes are non-empty at some moment in the computation). The computational power of all these variants is studied.
