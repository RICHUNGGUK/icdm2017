The implementation of null LDA method is, however, computationally very expensive. In this paper, we theoretically derive the null LDA method from a different perspective and present a computationally efficient implementation of this method. Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of ST+SB (where S-B is the between-class scatter matrix and S-T(+) is the pseudoinverse of the total scatter matrix S-T) is shown here to be a sufficient condition for the null LDA method. As EVD of ST+SB is computationally expensive, we show that the utilization of random matrix together with ST+SB is also a sufficient condition for null LDA method. This condition is used here to derive a computationally fast implementation of the null LDA method. We show that the computational complexity of the proposed implementation is significantly lower than the other implementations of the null LDA method reported in the literature. This result is also confirmed by conducting classification experiments on several datasets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
