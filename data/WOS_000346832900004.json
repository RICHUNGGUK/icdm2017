In the outsourcing computation paradigm, the clients with resource-constrained abilities can outsource the heavy computation workloads into the cloud server and enjoy unlimited computing resources in a pay-per-use manner. One of the most critical functionalities in outsourcing computation is the verifiability of the result. That is, the client should efficiently verify the validity of the result returned by the cloud servers. In this paper, we solve the problem of verifiable outsourcing computation of sequence comparisons by integrating the technique of Yao's garbled circuit with homomorphic encryption. Compared with the existing schemes, our proposed solution enables clients to efficiently detect the misbehavior of dishonest servers. Furthermore, our construction re-garbles the circuit only for malformed responses and thus is very efficient for real-world applications. Besides, we also present the formal analysis for our proposed construction.", "paper_title": "Efficient and Verifiable Outsourcing Scheme of Sequence Comparisons", "paper_id": "WOS:000346832900004"}
