Cell-centred finite volume methods (CC-FV), typical of most commercial CFD tools, are computationally efficient, but can lead to convergence problems on meshes that feature cells with highly non-orthogonal shapes. The control volume-finite element method (CVFE) uses a vertex-based approach and handles distorted meshes with relative ease. but is computationally expensive. A combined vertex-based-cell-centre technique (CFVM), detailed in this paper, allows solutions on distorted meshes where purely cell-centred solutions procedures fail. The method utilizes the ability of the vertex-based approach to resolve the flow field on a distorted mesh, enabling well established cell-centred physical models to be employed in the solution of other transported quantities. The vertex-based flow code is verified against a manufactured 3D solution and error norms are compared on meshes with various degrees of distortion. The CFVM method is validated with benchmark solutions for thermally driven flow and turbulent flow. Finally, the method is illustrated on three-dimensional turbulent flow over an aircraft wing on a distorted mesh where purely cell-centred techniques fail. The CFVM is relatively straightforward to embed within generic CC based CFD tools allowing it to be employed in a wide variety of processing applications.
