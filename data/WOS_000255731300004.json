Our proposal involves cooperation between the routing and the wavelength assignment tasks. The main idea is to classify each wavelength at an output link of a node as suited either to sending or to relaying data bursts. Furthermore, burst retransmission management is important to realize OBS networks. We propose the cooperation method considering retransmission. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the burst loss probability, particularly for long-distance transmissions. As a result, unfairness in the treatment of short and long hop bursts can be alleviated.
