We argue that workflow provenance data should be automatically generated by the enactment engine and managed over time by an underlying storage service. We briefly describe our layered model for workflow execution provenance, which allows navigation from the conceptual model of an experiment to instance data collected during a specific experiment run, and back.", "paper_title": "Automatic generation of workflow provenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241462000001"}
