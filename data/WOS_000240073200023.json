LSTOP is a truthful and scalable routing protocol. It incurs an overhead of O(n(2)) in the worst case and only O(n) on the average, a substantial improvement over a recently proposed truthful routing protocol, which incurs an overhead of O(n(3)). LSTOP encourages nodes' cooperation by rewarding nodes for their forwarding service according to their cost and provides near-least-cost paths and even least paths with high probability in dense networks. We show the truthfulness of LSTOP and present results from an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of our protocol. Simulation results show that LSTOP approaches optimal (cost) routing, provides significantly higher packet delivery ratio, generates significantly lower control overhead, lower end-to-end delay and has better overpayment ratio compared to ad hoc-VCG.", "paper_title": "LSTOP: A light-weight scalable truthful routing protocol in MANETS with selfish nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240073200023"}
