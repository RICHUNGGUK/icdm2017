Our results show that CO and O-2 are adsorbed more stably on AuPd dimers than on AuAg dimers with corresponding charge state. O-2 is favorable to be adsorbed on Pd atom in AuPd+, AuPd and AuPd-dimers. CO is adsorbed on Pd in AuPd and AuPd-, while it is favorable to be adsorbed on Au in AuPd+. For AuAg dimers, O-2 is adsorbed on Ag in AuAg and AuAg-, and it is adsorbed on Au in AuAg+. CO is adsorbed on Ag in AuPd-, while it is adsorbed on Au in AuAg and AuAg+. The CO oxidation reaction is explored along two possible pathways: path-1 involves CO attacking the initial complexes of AuM dimers and O-2, and path-2 is related to O-2 interacting with the complexes of AuM dimers and CO. The charge state of AuM dimers has a substantial effect on CO oxidation. The reaction on AuPd-prefers path-1, and AuPd+ mediated reaction proceeds along path-2, while CO oxidation on AuPd is difficult along both paths. For AuAg, both pathways are viable for AuAg-mediated reactions, while AuAg and AuAg+ mediated reactions prefer path-2. Moreover, the energy barriers of CO oxidation on neutral AuAg is comparable with those on AuPd in all charge states while the energy barriers for AuAg- and AuAg+ are considerably lower than those for all AuPd dimmers, indicating the impurity atom also plays a significant role in the catalytic activity. Furthermore, AuAg- is proposed to be the most active species due to the lowest barrier involved in the reaction.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of CO oxidation on cationic, neutral, and anionic AuM dimers (M = Pd and Ag)", "paper_id": "WOS:000338632200055"}
