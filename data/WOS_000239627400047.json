The main point of this article is to illustrate that for this kind of filtering problem, it is not needed to have a positive hidden Markov realization of the joint process, but it suffices to have a quasi-realization. We also present an approximate quasi-realization algorithm. We perform a simulation comparing the behavior of the exact, experimental and approximate quasi-realizations and checking the performance of the estimator.", "paper_title": "Recursive filtering using quasi-realizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400047"}
