Over half a century, K-means remains the most popular clustering algorithm because of its simplicity. Recently, as data volume continues to rise, some researchers turn to MapReduce to get high performance. However, MapReduce is unsuitable for iterated algorithms owing to repeated times of restarting jobs, big data reading and shuffling. In this paper, we address the problems of processing large-scale data using K-means clustering algorithm and propose a novel processing model in MapReduce to eliminate the iteration dependence and obtain high performance. We analyze and implement our idea. Extensive experiments on our cluster demonstrate that our proposed methods are efficient, robust and scalable.", "paper_title": "Optimized big data K-means clustering using MapReduce", "paper_id": "WOS:000344813000012"}
