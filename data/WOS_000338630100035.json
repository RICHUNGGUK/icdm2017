Easier than general electrodynamics, quasistatics exhibits interesting physics and more important applications than statics for electromagnetic phenomena modeling. We introduce quasi-static models in a very simple way relying on a dimensional analysis of Maxwell's equations and present their application to study electromagnetic phenomena in transmission lines.", "paper_title": "Electromagnetic quasi-static models applied to transmission lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100035"}
