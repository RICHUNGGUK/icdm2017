In this work, a modified step-by-step algorithm for decoding the Golay code is presented. Logical analysis yielded a simple rule for directly determining whether a bit in the received word is correct. The computational complexity can be reduced significantly using this scheme.", "paper_title": "Decoding the (23,12,7) Golay code using a low-complexity scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000239577400018"}
