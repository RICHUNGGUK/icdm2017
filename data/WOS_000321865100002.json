However, it also makes them more susceptible to transient hardware faults. Transient faults due to high energy particle strikes or circuit crosstalk can corrupt the output of a program or cause it to crash. Previous studies have reported that as much as 70% of the transient faults disturb program control flow, making it critical to protect control flow. Traditional approaches employ signatures to check that every control flow transfer in a program is valid. While having high fault coverage, large performance overheads are introduced by such detailed checking. We propose a coarse-grain control flow checking method to detect transient faults in a cost effective way. Our software-only approach is centered on the principle of abstraction: control flow that exhibits simple run-time properties (e.g., proper path length) is almost always completely correct. Our solution targets off-the-shelf commodity embedded systems to provide a low cost protection against transient faults. The proposed technique achieves its efficiency by simplifying signature calculations in each basic block and by performing checking at a coarse-grain level. The coarse-grain signature comparison points are obtained by the use of a region based analysis. In addition, we propose a technique to protect control flow transfers via call and return instructions to ensure all control flow is covered by our technique. Overall, our proposed technique has an average of 11% performance overhead in comparison to 75% performance overhead of previously proposed signature based techniques while maintaining approximately the same degree of fault coverage.", "paper_title": "Low Cost Control Flow Protection Using Abstract Control Signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000321865100002"}
