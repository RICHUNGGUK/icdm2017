The approach is based on parametric characterization of the traffic processes (arrival and departure) in the network and uses two-moment approximations to estimate performance measures at individual stations. We derive traffic flow constraints that are particular to closed queuing networks with synchronization stations and use these to establish relationships between the parameters characterizing arrival and departure processes at the stations in the network. The resultant set of non-linear equations is solved to estimate network performance measures. Numerical studies show that the approach is not only fast but also reasonably accurate when compared to simulation. These studies also provide insights with respect to the impact of different types of variability on the performance of a kanban system. This work also provides a fundamental building block that can be used in the analysis of multi-stage kanban systems.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of single stage kanban controlled production systems using parametric decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240913500005"}
