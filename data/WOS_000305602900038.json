The two models that are introduced in this study depend on the number of water molecules involved at the base catalyzed hydrolysis. Solution equilibrium geometries of the molecules involved in the transition states, reactants and product complexes of the two chemical pathways were fully optimized at B3LYP level of theory with the standard 6-31+G(d) basis set, modeling solvent effects using a polarizable continuum solvation model (PCM). Both models predict relative low activation energies. However, the model with two water molecules seems to be more adequate to describe the basic hydrolysis. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis seems to show that the proton transfer from water to ethoxy group would occur through a large hyperconjugative interaction, LPO ->sigma*(O-H), which is related to the nonbonding oxygen lone pair orbital from ethoxy group with the vicinal sigma*(O-H) anti bonding orbital O-H of a water molecule.", "paper_title": "Tetraethylorthosilicate as molecular precursor to the formation of amorphous silica networks.
