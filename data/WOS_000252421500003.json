However, some systems are better modeled by self-reconfigurable formalisms. We have developed the Discrete Flow System Specification (DFSS) to exploit dynamic structure, component-based and hierarchical model construction. Due to structural similarity, dynamic self-configuring DFSS models offer a good description of systems, like adaptive algorithms and reconfigurable computer architectures. In this paper, we present the modeling and simulation of a parallel adaptive divide-and-conquer integration algorithm in the CAOSTALK modeling and simulation framework, a realization of the DFSS formalism.", "paper_title": "Modeling and simulation of parallel adaptive divide-and-conquer algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000252421500003"}
