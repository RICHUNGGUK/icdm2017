This paper presents the development of a computer aided program designated as \"CADSLIPFORM\" for slipforming operations. The program incorporates maturity methods for the prediction of initial setting times of slipform concrete layers using laboratory data (time-temperature histories and setting times of concrete mixtures at different temperatures) and generates slipform mock-up times. The performance of CADSLIPFORM is validated by comparing simulated mock-up times with those estimated in the field through conventional hard front by rod (R) method. Moreover, the program versatility is demonstrated by illustrating mock-up simulations for different cases with variable slipform parameters such as: number and thickness of concrete layers, concrete temperature (simulating variable setting times) and slipform speed. The program also incorporates the choice of Freiesleben Hansen & Pederson (FHP) and Carino & Tank (CT) maturity functions. CADSLIPFORM can assist user to develop reliable schedule of slipforming operation suitable for a specific project by optimizing various slipform parameters.", "paper_title": "Development of a computer aided program for slipforming operations incorporating maturity approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000238928200007"}
