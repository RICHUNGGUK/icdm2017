The proposed teaching approach helps students to reach a deeper level of understanding in first order logic representation, computational logic procedures and automated theorem proving. The article includes the description of SLI, a theorem prover with a graphical output and the results of a survey to assess the acceptance of the tool. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
