In this study, we investigate measures for increasing the efficiency of the RPC-based countermeasures and construct a method that provides an efficient RPC-based countermeasure against side channel attacks. We then apply our method to the well-known eta(T) pairing algorithm over binary fields and obtain an RPC-based countermeasure for the eta(T), pairing; our method is more efficient than the RPC method applied to the original eta(T) pairing algorithm.", "paper_title": "Construction of Efficient and Secure Pairing Algorithm and Its Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000262763400009"}
