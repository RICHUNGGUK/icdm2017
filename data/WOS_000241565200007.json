This paper presents a novel and robust pose-expression invariant face recognition method in order to improve the existing face recognition techniques. First, we apply the TSL color model for detecting facial region and estimate the vector X-Y-Z of face using connected components analysis. Second, the input face is mapped by a deformable 3D facial model. Third, the mapped face is transformed to the frontal face which appropriates for face recognition by the estimated pose vector and action unit of expression. Finally, the damaged regions which occur during the process of normalization are reconstructed using PCA. Several empirical tests are used to validate the application of face detection model and the method for estimating facial poses and expression. In addition, the tests suggest that recognition rate is greatly boosted through the normalization of the poses and expression.", "paper_title": "Pose-expression normalization for face recognition using connected components analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241565200007"}
