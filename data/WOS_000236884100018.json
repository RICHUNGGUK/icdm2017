Some of the problems raising in enterprise model integration, transformation, translation are related to the usage of distinct languages and to the distinct usage of languages. To address these problems, it is possible to try to characterise and to represent respectively, (i) relationships between constructs in several relevant languages, (ii) a unique language \"UEML core language\" (Unified Enterprise Modelling Language core language) and (iii) precise relationships between this unique language and these relevant languages. To this aim, this paper summarises and justifies the approaches undertaken in UEML 1.0 and UEML 2.0, tries to compare them alongside their strengths and benefits, and presents some related works.", "paper_title": "UEML 1.0 and UEML 2.0: Benefits, problems and comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100018"}
