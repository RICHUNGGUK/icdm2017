Haralick texture feature subset and Zemike polynomial moment subset are used respectively or combined together as extracted digital feature set for original cellular images. Feature reduction is done by support vector machine based recursive feature elimination algorithm on these feature sets. With optimal feature subset selected, fuzzy support vector machine are adopted to judge the cellular phenotype. The results indicate Haralick texture feature subset is complementary with Zernike polynomial moment subset, when these two feature subsets are combined together; the cellular phase identification system achieved 99.17% accuracy, which is better than only one feature subset of them is used. The recognition accuracy with feature reduction is better than that achieved when no feature reduction done or using PCA as feature recombination tool on these datasets.", "paper_title": "Automated recognition of cellular phenotypes by support vector machines with feature reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000021"}
