Equalization and background segmentation are used to facilitate background spot removal. To enhance colors, the overall document degradation is regarded as an illumination problem, thereby allowing the use of color constancy algorithms. The methodology was applied to a set of postcards dating from the end of the nineteenth century, and satisfactory visual results were achieved.", "paper_title": "Restoring images of ancient color postcards", "paper_id": "WOS:000353831400010"}
