An innovation is that the methodology is based on bi-dimensional finite element techniques, in which the model's value consists of a finite number of points, making it possible to obtain its value at any point. Its application permits obtaining representational models of the relation. A computational algorithm is presented; its program has been called Finit Trap 2D, which generates families of models. It has defined criteria for model selection based on information parameters. This scientific research technique complements those existing in scientific literature for generating mathematical models based on experimental data [Cortes M, Villacampa Y, Mateu J, Uso, JL A new methodology for modelling highly structured systems.

It should be emphasised that representational models have been generated from bi-dimensional finite element models. This will naturally lead to their future application in processes described by partial differential equation whose coefficients are functions, A(x,y) for which only experimental data are known.
