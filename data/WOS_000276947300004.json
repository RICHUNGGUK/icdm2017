Metamodels proposed for use in SME are evaluated as well as high-level process models for method construction. Method fragments and method chunks are then described formally followed by their identification and creation (from existing methods, from scratch or from past usage). Method creation is then analyzed in terms of various processes for constructing a full methodology from the method fragments/chunks. In particular, we contrast the use of the \"map\" technique and of the \"deontic matrix\" technique. The survey is concluded with an evaluation of some ideas on method tailoring and the emerging research on quality evaluation applied to SME.", "paper_title": "Situational Method Engineering: State-of-the-Art Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000276947300004"}
