First, we develop three concealment modes: temporal bilateral error concealment (TBEC), inter-view bilateral error concealment (IBEC), and multi-hypothesis error concealment (MHEC). TBEC and IBEC, respectively, exploit intra-view and inter-view correlations in multi-view video sequences to reconstruct an erroneous block. MHEC finds a few candidate blocks based on the block matching principle and combines them for the concealment. We then propose a mode selection scheme, which chooses one of the three modes adaptively to provide reliable and accurate concealment results. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can protect the quality of reconstructed videos effectively even in severe error conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
