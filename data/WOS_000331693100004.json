This method can support rapid grouping and fitting of overtraced polylines or conic curves based on the classified characteristics of each stroke during its preprocessing stage. The orientation and its endpoints of a classified stroke are used in the stroke grouping process. The grouped strokes are then fitted with 2D geometry. This method can deal with overtraced sketch strokes in both solid and dash linestyles, fit grouped polylines as a whole polyline and simply fit conic strokes without computing the direction of a stroke. It avoids losing joint information due to segmentation of a polyline into line-segments. The proposed method has been tested with our freehand sketch recognition system (FSR), which is robust and easier to use by removing some limitations embedded with most existing sketching systems which only accept non-overtraced stroke drawing. The test results showed that the proposed method can support freehand sketching based conceptual design with no limitations on drawing sequence, directions and overtraced cases while achieving a satisfactory interpretation rate.", "paper_title": "New grouping and fitting methods for interactive overtraced sketches", "paper_id": "WOS:000331693100004"}
