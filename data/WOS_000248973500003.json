These techniques are used to categorise the levels of deterioration experienced by the engine in order to improve the diagnosis of any measurement bias. This work illustrates that principal component analysis can provide a good estimation of fuel pump measurement bias in a gas turbine engine and improve efficiency of flight by more accurate measurement of fuel. Different methods are investigated to find the best adaptation of principal component analysis for diagnosis of fuel pump measurement bias, which provides robust estimation of engine deterioration and expected fuel flow to the engine.", "paper_title": "Diagnosis of fuel pump measurement bias in gas turbine engines", "paper_id": "WOS:000248973500003"}
