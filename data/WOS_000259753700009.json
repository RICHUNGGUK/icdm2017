The method is an extension of the optimal grid approach for elliptic problems, based on optimal rational approximation of the associated Neumann-to-Dirichlet map in Fourier space. It is shown that, using certain types of boundary discretization, one can go from second-order accurate schemes to essentially spectrally accurate schemes in two-dimensional problems, and to fourth-order accurate schemes in three-dimensional problems without any increase in the computational complexity. The main idea of the method is to modify the impedance function being approximated to compensate for the numerical dispersion introduced by a small finite-difference stencil discretizing the differential operator on the boundary. We illustrate how the method can be efficiently applied to nonlinear problems arising in modeling of cell communication. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
