However, the existing k-clique-detection approaches are not applicable to signed social networks directly because of positive and negative links. The authors' approach to detecting k-balanced trusted cliques in such networks bases the detection algorithm on formal context analysis. It constructs formal contexts using the modified adjacency matrix after converting a signed social network into an unweighted one. Experimental results demonstrate that their algorithm can efficiently identify the trusted cliques.", "paper_title": "Detecting k-Balanced Trusted Cliques in Signed Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337169700005"}
