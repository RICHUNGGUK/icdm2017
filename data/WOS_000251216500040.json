First, a chemical similarity search on the Maybridge library was performed using known NNRTIs as reference structures. The top-ranked molecules obtained from this procedure plus 26 known NNRTIs were then docked into the binding sites of the wild-type reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) and its K103N variant (K103N-RT) using Glide 3.5. The top-ranked 100 compounds from the docking for both proteins were post-scored with a procedure using molecular mechanics and continuum solvation (MM-GB/SA). The validity of the virtual screening protocol was supported by (i) testing of the MM-GB/SA procedure, (ii) agreement between predicted and crystallographic binding poses, (iii) recovery of known potent NNRTIs at the top of both rankings, and (iv) identification of top-scoring library compounds that are close in structure to recently reported NNRTI HTS hits. However, purchase and assaying of selected top-scoring compounds from the library failed to yield active anti-HIV agents. Nevertheless, the highest-ranked database compound, S 10087, was pursued as containing a potentially viable core. Subsequent synthesis and assaying of S10087 analogues proposed by further computational analysis yielded anti-HIV agents with EC50 values as low as 310 nM. Thus, with the aid of computational tools, it was possible to evolve a false positive into a true active.", "paper_title": "Search for non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using chemical similarity, molecular docking, and MM-GB/SA scoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000251216500040"}
