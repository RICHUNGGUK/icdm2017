The unit undergoes minimal repairs at failures and is replaced at a planned time T or at a number N of working times, whichever occurs first. The expected cost rate is obtained, and air optimal policy which minimizes it is derived analytically. Tire imperfect preventive maintenance (PM) model, where the unit is improved by PM after the completion of each working time, is analyzed. Furthermore, when the work of a job incurs some damage to the unit, the replacement model with number N is proposed. The expected cost rate is obtained by using theory of cumulative processes. Two modified models, where the unit is replaced at number N or at the first completion of the working time over time T. and it is replaced at T or number N. whichever occurs last, are also proposed. Finally, when the unit is replaced at time T, number N or Kth failure, whichever occurs first, the expected cost rate is also obtained.", "paper_title": "Replacement and Preventive Maintenance Models with Random Working Times", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537100018"}
