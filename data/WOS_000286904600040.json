As an outcome, learning content adaptation has been the subject of many research projects lately. This paper suggests a framework for building an adaptive Learning Management System (LMS). The proposed architecture is based upon multi-agent systems and uses both Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004 and semantic Web ontology for learning content storage, sequencing and adaptation. This system has been implemented upon a well known open-source LMS and its functionalities are demonstrated through the simulation of a scenario mimicing the real life conditions. The result reveals the system effectiveness for which it appears that the proposed approach may be very promising. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
