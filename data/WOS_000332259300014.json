Hierarchical models have been advocated as a way to integrate SNP and pathway effects in the same model, but their computational complexity has prevented them being applied on a genome-wide scale to date. Methods: We present two novel methods for identifying associated pathways. In the proposed hierarchical model, the SNP effects are analytically integrated out of the analysis, allowing computationally tractable model fitting to genome-wide data. The first method uses Bayes factors for calculating the effect of the pathways, whereas the second method uses a machine learning algorithm and adaptive lasso for finding a sparse solution of associated pathways. Results: The performance of the proposed methods was explored on both simulated and real data. The results of the simulation study showed that the methods outperformed some well-established association methods: the commonly used Fisher's method for combining P-values and also the recently published BGSA. The methods were applied to two genome-wide association study datasets that aimed to find the genetic structure of platelet function and body mass index, respectively. The results of the analyses replicated the results of previously published pathway analysis of these phenotypes but also identified novel pathways that are potentially involved.", "paper_title": "Two novel pathway analysis methods based on a hierarchical model", "paper_id": "WOS:000332259300014"}
