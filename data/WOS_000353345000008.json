Two transmission paths, that is, one half-wavelength transmission line and one MBLS, are used to realize signal transmission from Port 1 to Port 2. Then, two transmission zeros are introduced at both lower and upper sides of the passband, which are used to improve the passband selectivity greatly. The filter bandwidth can be easily controlled by reasonable adjusting the coupling coefficient of the coupled lines. Furthermore, with four stubs connected at the input/output ports, the stopband attenuation level is improved greatly. Finally, one prototype filter having 69.1% of 3 dB fractional bandwidth is fabricated with advantages of sharp selectivity and high out-of-band rejection. The EM simulated and measured results are presented, and an excellent agreement can be obtained. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
