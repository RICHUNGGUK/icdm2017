The convective motion in the fluid layer was visualized using reflecting particles (Kalliroscope). Cell dilatation was confirmed in the improved experimental apparatus and then investigated quantitatively by extracting the pattern wavenumber from Fourier analysis of the images recorded by a digital camera. The pattern wavenumber was found to decrease with increasing Rayleigh number. We compare our results with earlier investigations and discuss the influence of the thermal boundary condition at the bottom of the fluid layer on the variation of the wavenumber. Two different structures were observed in the same fluid layer at a relatively high Rayleigh number; an additional cell appears in the original cell (Double cell structure) and the descending flow region around the center of the cell expands laterally like a spoke of wheels (Spoke-like structure). Factors for the formation of such complex structures are discussed.", "paper_title": "Dilatation and pattern formation of cells in internally heated convection", "paper_id": "WOS:000257137800009"}
