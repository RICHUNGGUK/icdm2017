For this purpose, certain important tasks including spectrum sensing, spectrum analysis, and spectrum decision are required to be performed. Spectrum sensing is the crucial step as it is not only responsible for fast and reliable detection of primary users (PU) but also evades disturbance to their transmission. Different methods of enhancements in local sensing scheme have been proposed in the literature. However, cooperative spectrum sensing schemes are preferred as they provide significant gains in CRN performance by countering shading effects. In this paper, an efficient distributed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme is proposed for mobile ad hoc cognitive radio networks. The consensus-based distributed cooperative spectrum sensing (CDCSS) scheme relies on energy detection for local sensing. Random walk mobility model (RWMM) is used for the movement pattern of nodes. Mobility model is employed as movement of nodes results in reduced fading effects and efficient detection. Simulation results were compared with the existing consensus algorithm and equal gain combining (EGC) rule, and the results showed improvement in sensing phenomenon.", "paper_title": "Consensus-Based Distributive Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Mobile Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328754900001"}
