However, this transition leads to costly end-to-end network upgrades and poses new challenges of managing a large number of devices with a variety of transitioning protocols. Recognizing these difficulties, we propose an software defined approach to unifying the deployment of IPv6 in a cost-effective, flexible manner. Our deployment and experiments demonstrate significant benefits of this approach, including low complexity, low cost and high flexibility of adopting different existing transition mechanisms.", "paper_title": "A Software Defined Approach to Unified IPv6 Transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900090"}
