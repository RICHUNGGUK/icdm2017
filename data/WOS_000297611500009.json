Traditionally, VQ applies the full search algorithm to search for the codeword that best matches each image vector in the encoding procedure. However, matching in this manner consumes a lot of computation time and leads to a heavy burden for the VQ method. Therefore, Torres and Huguet proposed a double test algorithm to improve the matching efficiency. However, their scheme does not include an initiation strategy to choose an initially searched codeword for each image vector, and, as a result, matching efficiency may be affected significantly. To overcome this drawback, we propose an improved double test scheme with a fine initialization as well as a suitable search order. Our experimental results indicate that the computation time of the double test algorithm can be significantly reduced by the proposed method. In addition, the proposed method is more flexible than existing schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
