Convex approximations may however not be very efficient if the true objective function and/or the constraints are concave. Using diagonal quadratic approximations, we show that non-convex approximations may indeed require significantly fewer iterations than their convex counterparts. The nonconvex subproblems are solved using an augmented Lagrangian (AL) strategy, rather than the Falk-dual, which is the norm in SAO based on convex subproblems. The results suggest that transformation of large-scale optimization problems with only a few constraints to a dual form via convexification need sometimes not be required, since this may equally well be done using an AL formulation.", "paper_title": "An augmented Lagrangian approach to non-convex SAO using diagonal quadratic approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000265046700007"}
