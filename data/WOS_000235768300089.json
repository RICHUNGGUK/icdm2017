The performance of biometric systems highly depends on the distinctive information in the biometrics. However, identical twins having the closest genetics-based relationship are expected to have maximum similarity between their biometrics. Classifying identical twins is a challenging problem for some automatic biometric systems. In this paper, we summarize the exiting experimental results about identical twins' biometrics including face, iris, fingerprint and voice. Then, we systemically examine identical twins' palmprints. The experimental results show that we can employ low-resolution palmprint images to distinguish identical twins.", "paper_title": "A study of identical twins' palmprints for personal authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300089"}
