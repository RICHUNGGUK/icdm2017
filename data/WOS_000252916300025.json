Design/methodology/approach - The studied dynamic model lumps together all dynamic effects in the circuit by considering a single dynamic parameter. A physical meaning of this parameter as well as rules of use of the model are elaborated from analyses performed on several samples. A systematic comparison between experimental and calculated results allows to argue the conclusions. Findings - The model gives accurate results when a weak heterogeneity of magnetic data exists, nevertheless, the saturation phenomenon enlarges the validity domain. By considering the losses separation assumption, the model allows to obtain separately an estimation of losses due to classical eddy currents and due to the wall motion effects. Research limitations/implications - The estimation of the model's parameter value is still empiric, a work is in progress on this subject. Practical implications - The model's implementation in a flux tubes network allows to simulate the dynamic behaviour of industrial actuators having massive cores. Originality/value - A physical interpretation of the parameter associated to the dynamic flux tube model is given. Rules of use of the model are also defined.", "paper_title": "Limits and rules of use of a dynamic flux tube model", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300025"}
