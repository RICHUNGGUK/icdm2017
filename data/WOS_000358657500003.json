The main result is a protocol for securer cloud computing over private data in a model with supplementary cryptoservers. As a result, one gets a system that does not require a public key and replaces a sophisticated and costly bootstrapping by a more efficient reencryption protocol run by the cryptoservers.", "paper_title": "Secure cloud computing based on threshold homomorphic encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000358657500003"}
