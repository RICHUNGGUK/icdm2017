Frequency-domain conditions were established for global convergence and convergence of bounded solutions. The effects of the input and output interconnections can be studied through a nonsingular inner coupling matrix and nonzero scales, representing the interconnection, which takes values according to the eigenvalues of the nonsingular outer coupling matrix. Then, the design method based on linear matrix inequality was presented by using the KYP Lemma and Schur complement.", "paper_title": "The global convergence analysis of a class of nonlinear network systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329903700010"}
