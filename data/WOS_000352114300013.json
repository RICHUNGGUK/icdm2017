In this paper a new heuristic algorithm for solving large scale instances of the SSP is presented, which outperforms the natural greedy algorithm in the majority of the tested instances. The proposed method is able to provide multiple near-optimum solutions and admits a natural parallel implementation. Extended computational experiments on a set of SSP instances with known optimum solutions indicate that the new method finds the optimum solution in most of the cases, and its average error relative to the optimum is close to zero.", "paper_title": "A greedy randomized adaptive search procedure with path relinking for the shortest superstring problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000352114300013"}
