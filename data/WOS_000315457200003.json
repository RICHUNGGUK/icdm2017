This article presents circuit architectures that can exploit such fluctuations, if signals have a particle-like (discrete, token-based) character. We define an abstract circuit primitive that, though lacking functionality when used with fluctuation-free signals, becomes universal when fluctuations are allowed. Key to the power of a signal's fluctuations is the ability to explore the state space of a circuit. This ability is used to resolve deadlock situations, which could otherwise only be averted by increased design complexity. The results in this article suggest that in the design of future computers, signal fluctuations, rather than being an impediment to be avoided at any cost, may be an important ingredient to achieve efficient operation.", "paper_title": "Brownian Circuits: Fundamentals", "paper_id": "WOS:000315457200003"}
