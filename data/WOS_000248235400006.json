The concept of minimum guaranteed multiplexing gain in the forward link is introduced and shown to significantly influence the optimal D-M tradeoff. It is demonstrated that power control based on the feedback is instrumental in achieving the D-M tradeoff, and that rate adaptation is important in obtaining a high diversity gain even at high rates. A criterion to determine finite-length codes to be tradeoff optimal is presented, leading to a useful geometric characterization of the class of extended approximately universal codes. With codes from this class, the optimal D-M tradeoff is achievable by the combination of a feedback-dependent power controller and a single codebook for single-rate or two codebooks; for adaptive-rate transmission. Finally, lower bounds to the optimal D-M tradeoffs based on Gaussian coding arguments are also studied. In contrast to the no-feedback case, these random coding bounds are only asymptotically tight, but can quickly approach the optimal tradeoff even with moderate codeword lengths.", "paper_title": "Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in MIMO channels with partial CSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235400006"}
