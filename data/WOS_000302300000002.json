We propose a security solution for this scenario. While previous works have provided security support for various communication patterns in sensor networks, such as among nodes, from nodes to a base station, and from users to nodes, the security of communication from sensor nodes to multiple users has not been sufficiently addressed. Specifically, we explore this design space and develop a security solution, named Secure Tiny Web Service, for efficient authentication of data sent by a resource-constrained sensor node to multiple users, using digital signatures. We investigate the resource overheads in communication and computation of four suitable signature schemes-the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, the (elliptic curve) Schnorr signature, and the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham and Zhang-Safavi-Naini-Susilo short signature schemes. We implement these schemes on two popular sensor node architectures (based on AVR ATmega128L and MSP430 processors with 802.15.4 radios) and experimentally characterize relevant trade-offs.", "paper_title": "Secure-TWS: Authenticating Node to Multi-user Communication in Shared Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000302300000002"}
