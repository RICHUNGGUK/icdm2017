Since sensor nodes do not have good computational ability, it is hard to be applied in complex computations, such, as exponential computation, to design a key management schemed Therefore, the existing key management schemes in sensor networks usually employ the method of random key pre-distribution to achieve the security of communications and reduce the overheads of computations and storage. However, random key pm-distribution method has a drawback that any pair of sensor nodes cannot guarantee to hold the same shared key to construct a secure channel in between. In this paper, we air going to propose a novel key agreement scheme which can ensure that any pair of node can securely negotiate one session key. Furthermore, the required computational overheads are acceptable because the scheme is based on Bilinear Pairing and Cap Diffie-Hellman Group. As a result, our scheme is more suitable for being applied in wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "A KEY MANAGEMENT SCHEME FOR SENSOR NETWORKS USING BILINEAR PAIRINGS AND GAP DIFFIE-HELLMAN GROUP", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222300034"}
