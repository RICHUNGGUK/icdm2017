The algorithm detects any byte error and over 99% of word errors affecting the data being encrypted. It is also capable of correcting all bit errors of odd multiplicity that are inducted into not more then four bytes of the data. Consequently the immunity of the AES to the fault analysis is improved.", "paper_title": "Error detection and error correction procedures for the advanced encryption standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000258933600017"}
