By using the Choquet integral, some new aggregation operators are introduced, including the 2-tuple correlated averaging operator, the 2-tuple correlated geometric operator and the generalized 2-tuple correlated averaging operator. The proposed operators can better reflect the correlations among the elements. After investigating properties of these operators, a new multiple attribute decision making method based on the new operators is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
