In this paper, a novel blur identification algorithm based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) is proposed. In this method, blur identification is considered as a multiclassification problem. First, Sobel operator and local variance are used to extract feature vectors that contain information about the Point Spread Functions (PSF). Then SVM is used to classify these feature vectors. The acquired mapping between the vectors and corresponding blur parameter provides the identification of the blur. Meanwhile, extension of this method to blind super-resolution image restoration is achieved. After blur identification, a super-resolution image is reconstructed from several low-resolution images obtained by different foci. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the method.", "paper_title": "A SVM-based blur identification algorithm for image restoration and resolution enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600004"}
