Using this expression closed-form expressions are obtained for the DC and the amplitudes of the fundamental, second- and third-harmonic and intermodulation components of the gate-to-source voltage resulting from exciting the diode-connected NMOSFET by a DC biasing current plus a superimposed multisinusoidal EMI. Comparison between calculated and simulated results is included.", "paper_title": "Effect of Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) on the DC Shift, Harmonic and Intermodulation Performance of Diode-Connected NMOSFET", "paper_id": "WOS:000288165500014"}
