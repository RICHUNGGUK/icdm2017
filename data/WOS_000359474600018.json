The algorithm is designed to exploit Dynamic Power Management and generates a new event called event-s to render longer idle intervals, which increases the chances of switching a processor to the sleep mode. We compare the proposed algorithm with previous work and show that it is effective for energy management.", "paper_title": "T-L Plane Based Real-Time Scheduling Using Dynamic Power Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000359474600018"}
