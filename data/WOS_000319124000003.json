Our upper bound on the size s almost matches the known lower bound s = Omega(e(n/m)(1/e)). We also consider an extreme case where threshold circuits have energy 1, and prove that such circuits need at least 2((n-m)/2) gates to compute MODm of n variables.", "paper_title": "ENERGY-EFFICIENT THRESHOLD CIRCUITS COMPUTING MOD FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000319124000003"}
