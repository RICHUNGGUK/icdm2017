The experimental results obtained show that evolutionary algorithms are more robust and effective in terms of the quality of the solutions and computational effort than classical methods. In particular, the observed Pareto fronts determined by evolutionary algorithms has a better spread of solutions with a larger number of nondominated solutions when compared to the classical multi-objective techniques.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and pattern search methods for circuit design problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239789600005"}
