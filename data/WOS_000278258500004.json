The results show that the carcinogenic mutation R2495 affects the flexibility of L3 loop region in p53, inducing the loss of important hydrogen bonds observed at interaction in the wild-type with DNA, on the other hand the suppressor mutation Hi 68R on the R249S assists in maintaining the wild-type like flexibility of the U region in p53 and thus recover the interaction terms lost in the carcinogenic mutation alone. The present study sets a new direction in the development of new drugs that may restore the interactions that lost as a consequence of the carcinogenic mutations in p53. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
