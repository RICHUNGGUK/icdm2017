To approximate reality much more closely, we take into account the concepts of testing compression factor and the quantified ratio of faults to failures in the modeling. Numerical examples based on real failure data show that the proposed framework has a fairly good prediction capability. Further, we also address the optimal software release time problem and conduct a detailed sensitivity analysis through the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Software Reliability Modeling Considering Testing Compression Factor and Failure-to-Fault Relationship", "paper_id": "WOS:000272986800011"}
