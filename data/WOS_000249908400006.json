The algorithm objective is to optimize the profits given an investment on a wind farm. Net present value will be used as a figure of the revenue. To work out this figure, several economic factors such as the initial capital investment, the discount rate, the value of the generated energy and the number of the years spanned by the investment are considered. All this factors depends on the preliminary design of the wind park (number, type, tower height and layout situation of wind generators), which are the variables to set. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
