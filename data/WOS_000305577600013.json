Existing simple graph-based transductive learning methods only model the pairwise relationship of images, however, and they are sensitive to the radius parameter used in similarity calculation. Hypergraph learning has been investigated to solve both difficulties. It models the high-order relationship of samples by using a hyperedge to link multiple samples. Nevertheless, the existing hypergraph learning methods face two problems, i.e., how to generate hyperedges and how to handle a large set of hyperedges. This paper proposes an adaptive hypergraph learning method for transductive image classification. In our method, we generate hyperedges by linking images and their nearest neighbors. By varying the size of the neighborhood, we are able to generate a set of hyperedges for each image and its visual neighbors. Our method simultaneously learns the labels of unlabeled images and the weights of hyperedges. In this way, we can automatically modulate the effects of different hyperedges. Thorough empirical studies show the effectiveness of our approach when compared with representative baselines.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Hypergraph Learning and its Application in Image Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000305577600013"}
