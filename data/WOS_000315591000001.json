The generalization/performance of FAM is affected by two important factors which are network parameters and presentation order of training data. In this paper we introduce a genetic algorithm to find a better presentation order of training data for FAM. The proposed method which is the combination of genetic algorithm with Fuzzy ARTMAP is called Genetic Ordered Fuzzy ARTMAP (GOFAM). To illustrate the effectiveness of GOFAM, several standard datasets from UCI repository of machine learning databases are experimented. The results are analyzed and compared with those from FAM and Ordered FAM which is used to determine a fixed order of training pattern presentation to FAM. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of GOFAM is much better than performance of Fuzzy ARTMAP and Ordered Fuzzy ARTMAP. In term of network size, GOFAM performs significantly better than FAM and Ordered FAM.", "paper_title": "GOFAM: a hybrid neural network classifier combining fuzzy ARTMAP and genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000315591000001"}
