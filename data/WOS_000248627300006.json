Stress components are introduced as independent variables to make the system first order. Continuity equation becomes an algebraic equation and is eliminated from the system with suitable modifications. The h and p convergence are verified using the exact solution of Kovasznay flow. Steady flow past a large circular cylinder in a channel is solved to test mass conservation. Transient flow over a backward-facing step problem is solved on several meshes. Results are compared with that obtained using vorticity-based first-order formulation for both benchmark problems.
