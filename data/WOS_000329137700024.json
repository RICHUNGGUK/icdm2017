In recent years, methods that combine CYP binding site features with CYP/ligand binding information have been sought in order to increase the prediction accuracy of such hybrid models over those that use only one representation. Two challenges that any hybrid ligand/structure-based method must overcome are (1) identification of the best binding pose for a specific ligand with a given CYP and (2) appropriately incorporating the results of docking with ligand reactivity. To address these challenges we have created Docking-Regioselectivity-Predictor (DR-Predictor) a method that incorporates flexible docking-derived information with specialized electronic reactivity and multiple-instance-learning methods to predict CYP-mediated SOMs. In this study, the hybrid ligand-structure-based DR-Predictor method was tested on substrate sets for CYP 1A2 and CYP 2A6. For these data, the DR-Predictor model was found to identify the experimentally observed SOM within the top two predicted rank-positions for 86% of the 261 1A2 substrates and 83% of the 100 2A6 substrates. Given the accuracy and extendibility of the DR-Predictor method, we anticipate that it will further facilitate the prediction of CYP metabolism liabilities and aid in in-silico ADMET assessment of novel structures.", "paper_title": "DR-Predictor: Incorporating Flexible Docking with Specialized Electronic Reactivity and Machine Learning Techniques to Predict CYP-Mediated Sites of Metabolism", "paper_id": "WOS:000329137700024"}
