Recent breakthroughs in wireless energy transfer and rechargeable lithium batteries provide a promising alternative to power WSNs: mobile vehicles/robots carrying high volume batteries serve as mobile chargers to periodically deliver energy to sensor nodes. In this paper, we consider how to schedule multiple mobile chargers to optimize energy usage effectiveness, such that every sensor will not run out of energy. We introduce a novel charging paradigm, collaborative mobile charging, where mobile chargers are allowed to intentionally transfer energy between themselves. To provide some intuitive insights into the problem structure, we first consider a scenario that satisfies three conditions, and propose a scheduling algorithm, PushWait, which is proven to be optimal and can cover a one-dimensional WSN of infinite length. Then, we remove the conditions one by one, investigating chargers' scheduling in a series of scenarios ranging from the most restricted one to a general 2D WSN. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms in energy usage effectiveness and charging coverage.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Mobile Charging", "paper_id": "WOS:000349672000005"}
