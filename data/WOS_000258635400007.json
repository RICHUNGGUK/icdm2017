The technique called description comes first (DCF) consists of identification of related document clusters, selection of salient phrases relevant to these clusters and reallocation of documents matching the selected phrases to form final document groups. The advantages of this technique include more comprehensive cluster labels and clearer (more transparent') relationship between cluster labels and their content. We demonstrate the DCF by taking a standard k-means algorithm as a baseline and weaving DCF elements into it; the outcome is the descriptive k-means (DKM) algorithm. The paper goes through technical background explaining how to implement, DKM efficiently and ends with the description of an experiment measuring clustering quality on a benchmark document collection 20-newsgroups. Short fragment's of this paper appeared at the poster session of the RIAO 2007 conference, Pittsburgh, PA, USA (electronic proceedings only).", "paper_title": "Extending k-means with the description comes first approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000258635400007"}
