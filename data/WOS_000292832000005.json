The idea of this work is to develop and realize a simulator tool for dynamic analysis of human-or-humanoid behavior under disturbances. To show the potentials and verify this tool, we comparatively analyze the robustness of some postures to external disturbance. At this stage of research we do not conduct real experiments with humans/humanoids but try to verify our simulation tool by relying on available experience. Therefore, the postures for comparison are taken from everyday life and from sports: upright standing, squat posture, and three karate postures. As the external disturbance we choose an impulse and a permanent force, both with variable direction and magnitude.", "paper_title": "Human-and-Humanoid Postures Under External Disturbances: Modeling, Simulation, and Robustness.
