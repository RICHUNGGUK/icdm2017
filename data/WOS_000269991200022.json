The methodology is an effort to integrate various exertions of many researchers as well as stakeholders in the biomass field including process technologies, local area classification and renewable energy mechanisms to design and evaluate B-NETs. The proposed design methodology has three steps: classification, problem formulation and suggesting solution methods. The core part of planning the B-NETs utilization methodology is the superstructure that is a superclass model for the processes of biomass utilization networks that has to be built for the local area. The biomass utilization superstructure (BUSS) relates the biomass resources to their products, available processes, and possible future processes of utilization in static manner. Although the local area BUSS is static in nature, it shows the decision makers what kinds of B-NETs are, or can be, available in their area. It is important to note that for each super class process there exists a number of elemental technologies, or what we call unit process (UP), that can perform the job under the same condition with different processing constraint. To support the design and operation process a technological information infrastructure (TII) needs to be built to work as an information pool and simulation tool With the support of TII and the BUSS different scenarios can be synthesized, analyzed and compared. Scenarios development enables the designer to check processing alternatives as well as biomass promotion mechanisms that fit the concerns of various stakeholders. The results of the methodology application can be given in the form of suggestions of a specific network class(es) or scenarios that can be applied in a class of localities with the same characteristics. Following to methodology configuration, a proposal for optimization methods is discussed and a case study for comparing biomass network scenarios in mountainous city is introduced.
