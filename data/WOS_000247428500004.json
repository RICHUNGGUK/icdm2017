These indices are in close relation with tensorial interpretation of bond that among others allows discriminating covalent bonds using spindle structure concept. The real three-dimensional space representation of new interaction energy density utilized in this study contribute to better understanding of interaction phenomena between atoms and molecules. The differences in reactivity and stabilities of molecules have their root in the redistribution of interaction energy density.", "paper_title": "The field theoretical study of chemical interaction in terms of the Rigged QED: new reactivity indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000247428500004"}
