Many methods exist to reduce feature set dimensionality and construct improved features from an initial set; however, there are few general approaches for the design of features from numeric sequences. Any information lost in preprocessing or feature measurement cannot be recreated during pattern recognition. General approaches are needed to extend pattern recognition to include feature design and selection for numeric sequences, such as time series, within the learning process itself. This paper proposes a novel genetic programming (GP) approach to automated feature design called Autofead. In this method, a GP variant evolves a population of candidate features built from a library of sequence-handling functions. Numerical optimization methods, included through a hybrid approach, ensure that the fitness of candidate algorithms is measured using optimal parameter values. Autofead represents the first automated feature design system for numeric sequences to leverage the power and efficiency of both numerical optimization and standard pattern recognition algorithms. Potential applications include the monitoring of electrocardiogram signals for indications of heart failure, network traffic analysis for intrusion detection systems, vibration measurement for bearing condition determination in rotating machinery, and credit card activity for fraud detection.", "paper_title": "Automated Feature Design for Numeric Sequence Classification by Genetic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000358883500002"}
