A simple way of determining the bias without estimating higher order derivatives is formulated. A variance estimator is developed that works well in the homoscedastic and heteroscedastic case. In order to produce simultaneous confidence intervals, a simple. Sidak correction and a more involved correction (based on upcrossing theory) are used. The obtained confidence intervals are compared to a state-of-the-art bootstrap-based method. Simulations show that the proposed method obtains similar intervals compared to the bootstrap at a lower computational cost.", "paper_title": "Approximate Confidence and Prediction Intervals for Least Squares Support Vector Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000286010000010"}
