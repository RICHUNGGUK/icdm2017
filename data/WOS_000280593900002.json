The redundancy removes the need to control comparator offsets, allowing the large process-variation induced mismatch of small devices in nanometer technologies. This enables the use of small-sized, ultra-low-power comparators with clock-gating capabilities in order to reduce the power dissipation. The chosen calibration method enables an overall low-power solution and measurement results show that the ADC dissipates 30 mW at 1.2 V. With 63 comparators, the ADC achieves 3.9 effective number of bits.", "paper_title": "A 6-bit 2.5-GS/s flash ADC using comparator redundancy for low power in 90 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280593900002"}
