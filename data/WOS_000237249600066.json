The algorithm generates reasonable outlier results by taking both local and global features of a dataset into consideration. Experiments are conducted using both synthetic datasets and a real life construction equipment dataset from a large building contractor. Comparison with the current outlier mining algorithms indicates that the proposed algorithm is more effective.", "paper_title": "A nonparametric outlier detection for effectively discovering top-N outliers from engineering data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600066"}
