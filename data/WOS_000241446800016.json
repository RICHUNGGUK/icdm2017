For that purpose, it is important to extract social networks that reflect actual social networks which users have already had. Providing a simple means for users to register their social relations is also important. We propose a method that combines various approaches to extract social networks. Especially, three kinds of networks are extracted: user-registered Know-link networks; Web-mined Web-link networks; and face-to-face Touch-link networks. This paper describes the combination of social network extraction for an event-participant community. Analyses on the extracted social networks are also presented.", "paper_title": "Community focused social network extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800016"}
