It is very important to insure the consistency and non-redundancy of knowledge in a knowledge base. Due to the variety of exterior knowledge sources, it is necessary to eliminate incompatible knowledge and equivalence knowledge in the process of knowledge integration. In this paper, we research a strategy to eliminate incompatible knowledge and equivalence knowledge in knowledge integration based on equivalence classification, and so present a new knowledge integration algorithm which is effective in improving the efficiency of knowledge integration.", "paper_title": "A method to eliminate incompatible knowledge and equivalence knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100030"}
