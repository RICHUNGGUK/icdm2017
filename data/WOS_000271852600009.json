This system is a tool for communication, among a small number of people around a 3D image. It is a flatbed-type autostereoscopic bidirectional 3D display system consisting of a fiat panel display and a bidirectional holographic lens array sheet. Its notable feature is the ability to display natural 3D images which are visible to multiple viewers at the same time. Because 3D real images float in the display area of the proposed display, it allows two or more people surrounding it to simultaneously observe 3D images from their own viewpoints. This paper describes the system and also gives experimental results.", "paper_title": "FLATBED-TYPE BIDIRECTIONAL THREE-DIMENSIONAL DISPLAY SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852600009"}
