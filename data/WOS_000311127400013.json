In LTE, the Mobility Management Entity (MME) is responsible for the mobility management function. The MME is connected to a large number of evolved Node Bs (cells) that are grouped into the Tracking Areas (TAs). The TAs are further grouped into TA Lists (TALs). When a User Equipment (UE) moves out of the current TAL, it reports its new location to the MME. If the LTE network attempts to connect to the UE, the MME asks the cells in the TAL to page the UE. In LTE paging, the MME may sequentially page a cell, the TA of the cell, and/or the TAL of the cell. This paper investigates the performance of LTE paging, and provides the guidelines for the best paging sequence of cells.", "paper_title": "An Investigation on LTE Mobility Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000311127400013"}
