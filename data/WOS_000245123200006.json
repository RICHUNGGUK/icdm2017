Like its cousin the Erdos - Renyi random graph, G has a connectivity threshold: an asymptotic value for. in terms of n, above which G is connected and below which G is disconnected. In the connected zone we determine upper and lower bounds for the graph diameter of G. Specifically, almost always, diam(p)(B)(1-( o(1))/lambda <= diam(G) <= diam(p)(B)( 1 + O((ln ln n/ln n)(1/d)))/lambda, where diamp(B) is the l(p)-diameter of the unit ball B. We employ a combination of methods from probabilistic combinatorics and stochastic geometry.", "paper_title": "Random geometric graph diameter in the unit ball", "paper_id": "WOS:000245123200006"}
