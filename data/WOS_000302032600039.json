This research proposed a novel multiple classifier ensemble model based on firm life cycle and Choquet integral for FDP, named MCELCCh-FDP, as a new approach to tackle with financial distress. Empirical study based on Chinese listed companies' real data is conducted, and the results show that the proposed MCELCCh-FDP model has higher prediction accuracy than single classifiers. In order to verify the prediction capability of firm life cycle and Choquet integral in FDP model, comparative analysis is conducted. The experiment results indicate that the introduction of firm life cycle and Choquet integral in ;FOP can greatly enhance prediction accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
