In this context, application for object recognition and tracking using image and video information is one the attractive approaches that can be applied for event detection and localization, security processes, following of the rare animal species and control of road traffic, and so forth. However, the implementation of such approach with WMSN requires a specific image processing scheme and efficient transmission protocol. In fact, because of the limited energy of the batteries embedded in motes, the power consumption is the major constraint facing network life time and reliability in WMSN. The efficiency and the validity of these multimedia applications over wireless sensor networks are then dependent on the capabilities of the designer to provide low-power scheme for data processing and energy-aware transmission protocols. This paper presents a contribution to the design of low complexity scheme based on object identification for efficient sensing of multimedia information in wireless multimedia sensor networks. It proposes a new solution and explores the associated performances of this scheme. The presented results in this paper attest the high efficiency to achieve low-power objects identification when implemented in wireless motes.", "paper_title": "Image-Based Object Identification for Efficient Event-Driven Sensing in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000354297300001"}
