Each element e is an element of U is associated with a profit p(e), whereas each subset S is an element of S has a cost c(S). The objective is to find a minimum cost subcollection S' subset of S such that the combined profit of the elements covered by S' is at least P, a specified profit bound. In the prize-collecting version of this problem, there is no strict requirement to cover any element; however, if the subsets we pick leave an element e is an element of U uncovered, we incur a penalty of pi(e). The goal is to identify a subcollection S' subset of S that minimizes the cost of S' plus the penalties of uncovered elements.", "paper_title": "A unified approach to approximating partial covering problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200041"}
