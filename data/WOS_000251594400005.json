Augmented Reality (AR), enables 3D computer-generated entities to coexist in users' view of their real workspace. In this paper, the AR methodology is combined with custom-built 3D simulators of two nonlinear systems that show different motion characteristics: robot and spacecraft. The target systems are modeled on the basis of system parametric datasets, and their motions are specified and graphically represented according to characteristics of applied control algorithms. In our proposed system architecture, an AR process is incorporated with a 3D graphic engine and other functional modules for system analysis, simulation and control. Experiments demonstrate a feasibility study as well as intuitive 3D simulation performance and interactive AR interface features. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
