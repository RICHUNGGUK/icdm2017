A finite element method is applied for the spatial approximation of the velocity and pressure. The time discretization is based on the Crank-Nicolson scheme for the linear term and the explicit Adams-Bashforth scheme for the nonlinear term. Comparison with other methods, through a series of numerical experiments, shows that this method is almost Unconditionally stable and convergent, i.e. stable and convergent when the time step is smaller than a given constant.
