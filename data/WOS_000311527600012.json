We consider joint end-to-end flow control/distribution at the transport and network layers and opportunistic scheduling at the data link and physical layers. We formulate a single stochastic optimization problem and solve it by using a dual approach and a stochastic sub-gradient algorithm. The developed algorithm can be implemented in a distributed way, vertically among communication layers and horizontally among all entities in the network, clearly showing what should be done at each layer and each entity and what parameters should be exchanged between layers and between entities. Numerical results show that our cross-layer and end-to-end optimization approach provides more efficient resource allocation than the conventional layered and separated optimization approach.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer and End-to-End Optimization for the Integrated Wireless and Wireline Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000311527600012"}
