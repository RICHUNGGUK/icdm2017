Our aim was to track a person's indoor position using dead-reckoning, while limiting position error without depending on extensive wireless network infrastructure. The Indoor People Tracker used wearable motion sensors, a floor-plan map and a limited wireless sensor network for proximity ranging. We evaluated how the position accuracy of the Indoor People Tracker was affected by floor-plan map features, wireless proximity range and motion information. The advantage of the Indoor People Tracker was found; it was able to achieve accurate position resolution with minimal error, while not depending on wireless proximity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
