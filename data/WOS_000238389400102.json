In this problem one is given an undirected graph G with non-negative vertex weights and a color function that assigns to each edge one or more of n given colors, and the goal is to find a minimum weight set of vertices inducing edges of all n colors. We obtain improved approximation algorithms and hardness results for MWMCSP and its variant in which the goal is to find a minimum number of vertices inducing edges of at least k colors for a given integer k <= n.", "paper_title": "Minimum multicolored subgraph problem in multiplex PCR primer set selection and population haplotyping", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400102"}
