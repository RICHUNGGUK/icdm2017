Van Benthem's sabotage modal logic consists of modal logic with a cross-model modality referring to submodels from which a transition has been removed. We add constructors for forming least and greatest monadic fixed-points to that logic and obtain the sabotage A-calculus. We introduce backup parity games as an extension of standard parity games where in addition, both players are able to delete edges of the arena and to store, resp., restore the current appearance of the arena by use of a fixed number of registers. We show that these games serve as model checking games for the sabotage A-calculus, even if the access to registers follows a stack discipline. The problem of solving the games with restricted register access turns out to be PSPACE-complete while the more general games without a limited access become EXPTIME-complete (for at least three registers).", "paper_title": "On the mu-calculus augmented with sabotage", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082000010"}
