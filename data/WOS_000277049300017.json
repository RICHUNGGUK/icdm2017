In this paper, low-power and high-throughput error-correction circuits have been developed for multilevel cell (MLC) NAND Flash memories. The developed circuits employ the Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem code to correct multiple random bit errors. The error-correcting codes for them are designed based on the bit-error characteristics of MLC NAND Flash memories for solid-state drives. To trade the code rate, circuit complexity, and power consumption, three error-correcting architectures, named as whole-page, sector-pipelined, and multistrip ones, are proposed. The VLSI design applies both algorithmic and architectural-level optimizations that include parallel algorithm transformation, resource sharing, and time multiplexing. The chip area, power consumption, and throughput results for these three architectures are presented.", "paper_title": "VLSI Implementation of BCH Error Correction for Multilevel Cell NAND Flash Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000277049300017"}
