The user loads a flat-file dataset into Filtergraph which automatically generates an interactive data portal that can be easily shared with others. From this portal, the user can immediately generate scatter plots of up to five dimensions as well as histograms and tables based on the dataset. Key features of the portal include intuitive controls with auto-completed variable names, the ability to filter the data in real time through user-specified criteria, the ability to select data by dragging on the screen, and the ability to perform arithmetic operations on the data in real time. To enable seamless data visualization and exploration, changes are quickly rendered on screen and visualizations can be exported as high quality graphics files. The application is optimized for speed in the context of large datasets: for instance, a plot generated from a stellar database of 3.1 million entries renders in less than 2s on a standard web server platform. This web application has been created-using the Web2py web framework based on the Python programming language. Filtergraph is free to use at http://filtergraph.vanderbilt.edu/. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
