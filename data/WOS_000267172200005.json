Assume that, given a key sharing graph which contains a spanning tree, any designated player wishes to broadcast a message to all the other players securely against an eavesdropper. This can be easily done by flooding the message on the tree using the one-time pad scheme. However, the number of communication rounds in such a protocol is equal to the height of the tree. This paper provides another efficient protocol, which has exactly one communication round, i.e., we give a non-interactive protocol. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
