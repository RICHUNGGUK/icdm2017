As the most significant component of SOA, the decision engine is to create a workflow, defined as a sequence of individual data processing entities, for providing end-to-end QoS of a given task. Although the workflow of video transmission is generally known, existing solutions are often monolithic. Furthermore, there is no decision engine to select a workflow based on the best user-perceived quality. In this article we propose a service-oriented decision engine framework, which consists of a decision engine, a performance evaluation component, and other major SOA components to support real-time video transmission over wireless multihop networks, aiming to provide the best user-perceived video quality under application-centric QoS constraints. Based on the investigation of the state-of-the-art research efforts on SOA, some key issues for wireless live video transmission are discussed, and a case study for live video transmission is given to illustrate the proposed scheme. The superior performance of the proposed service-oriented decision engine is validated by experimental results.", "paper_title": "A QUALITY-DRIVEN DECISION ENGINE FOR LIVE VIDEO TRANSMISSION UNDER SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000269217600010"}
