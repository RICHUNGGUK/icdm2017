First outlined the status of the power system development and technical discussion, followed by test cases from the literature are used to evaluate the accuracy and validity of the algorithm. The HPSO algorithm combines genetic algorithm-specific mutation factor (MF) characteristics and the disturbance mechanism (DM), then used the exponential function to control the MF. A generating capacity adjustment mechanism (GCAM) is designed help the algorithm effectively identify the global optimum, effectively enhance the performance of the algorithm, the advantages of reducing computation time and the search range is reached.", "paper_title": "Using Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Based on the Generating Capacity Adjustment Mechanism to Solve Economic Dispatch Problems of Cogeneration Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000350569400003"}
