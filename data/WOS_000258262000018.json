To achieve this Goal, we propose a novel, surface-based deformable model that can interactively emulate the dynamics of both low- and high-frequency volumetric effects. Given a surface mesh and a few sample sequences of its physical behavior, a set of motion parameters of the material are learned during an off-line preprocessing step. The deformable, model is then applicable to any given skeleton-driven animation of the surface mesh. Additionally, our dynamic skinning technique can be entirely implemented on GPUs and executed with great efficiency. Thus, with minimal changes to the conventional graphics pipeline, our approach can drastically enhance the visual experience of skeleton-driven animations by adding secondary deformation in real time.", "paper_title": "Example-based dynamic skinning in real time", "paper_id": "WOS:000258262000018"}
