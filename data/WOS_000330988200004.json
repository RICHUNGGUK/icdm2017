Roughly, update operators can be considered as pointwise revision, whereas revision operators can be considered as special case of merging operators. Confluence operators are to merging operators what update operators are to revision operators. Similarly, update operators can be considered as special case of confluence operators just as revision can be considered as special case of merging operators. Confluence operators gives all possible agreement situations from a set of belief bases.", "paper_title": "Confluence operators and their relationships with revision, update and merging", "paper_id": "WOS:000330988200004"}
