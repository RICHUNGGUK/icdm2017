Libraries are identified as key players in building an inclusive knowledge economy (KE) for a country. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical study of the initiatives taken by Government of India as well as premier institutions and non-governmental organisations in the area of information literacy, lifelong learning and knowledge repository development was under-taken. These are reviewed to report on the contribution each of them has made in the development of KE in India. Findings - The practice-based examples of how information and communication technology (ICT) projects are influencing contemporary Indian society and an account of government policies in regard to ICT implementation and development towards a KE are presented. The impediments in the process of KE in India are identified and recommendations are made. Originality/value - This is an attempt to bring together initiatives and projects initiated by the Government of India as well as other agencies aimed at developing a knowledge-based society which will ultimately lead to a KE in India.", "paper_title": "ICT and information strategies for a knowledge economy: the Indian experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000266525300005"}
