To examine the, size of proofs we employ atomic flows, diagrams that trace structural changes through a proof but ignore logical information. As results we obtain a polynomial simulation of versions of Resolution, along with some extensions. We also show that these systems, as well as bounded-depth Frege systems, cannot polynomially simulate KS, by giving polynomial-size proofs of certain variants of the propositional pigeonhole principle in KS.", "paper_title": "ON THE RELATIVE PROOF COMPLEXITY OF DEEP INFERENCE VIA ATOMIC FLOWS", "paper_id": "WOS:000353193000017"}
