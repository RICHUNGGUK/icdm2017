With a parse tree and an entity pair, we first construct a rich semantic relation tree structure to integrate both syntactic and semantic information. And then we propose a context-sensitive convolution tree kernel, which enumerates both context-free and context-sensitive sub-trees by considering the paths of their ancestor nodes as their contexts to capture structural information in the tree structure. An evaluation on the Automatic Content Extraction/Relation Detection and Characterization (ACE RDC) corpora shows that the proposed tree kernel-based method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
