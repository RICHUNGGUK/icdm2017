This article presents the application of the turning bands (TB) method to discover knowledge about the client-perceived spatiotemporal web performance. The TB method is used to study spatial or spatiotemporal phenomena. We conducted an experimental study to apply this technique. The MWING system was used to collect performance measurement for four clients, each monitoring the same group of web servers during several weeks of observations. In this article we present TB-based web performance prediction for an agent localized in Wroclaw, Poland, and monitoring European web servers. The results of the spatial prediction of the total download web page times within a forecast of a two-week period showed that the TB simulation is efficient.", "paper_title": "Client-Perceived Web Performance Knowledge Discovery through Turning Bands Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000304453800008"}
