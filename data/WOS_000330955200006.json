Grid-convergence studies in 1-D and 3-D corroborate the analysis. The method is applied to time-resolved quantum tunneling where a comparison with the solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in 1-D illustrates the differences between the two equations. In contrast to the conventional tunneling probability decay predicted by the Schrodinger equation, the Dirac equation exhibits Klein tunneling. Solving the time-dependent Dirac equation with a step potential in 3-D reveals that particle spin affects the tunneling process. The observed spin-dependent reflection allows for a new type of spin-selective measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
