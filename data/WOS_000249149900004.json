This paper proposes a method of automatically acquiring semantic annotations (AASA). In the AASA method, we employ a combination of data mining and optimization to acquire semantic annotations. Key features of AASA include combining association rules, inference mechanism, genetic algorithm and self-organizing map to create semantic annotations, and using the k-nearest-neighbor query combined with simulated annealing to maintain semantic annotations.", "paper_title": "AASA: a method of automatically acquiring semantic annotations", "paper_id": "WOS:000249149900004"}
