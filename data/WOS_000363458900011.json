The survey focuses mainly on the connections between MV-algebras and other theories that such a semiring-based approach enabled, and on an application of such a framework to Digital Image Processing. We also give some suggestions for further developments by stating several open problems and possible research lines. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
