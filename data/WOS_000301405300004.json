Taking advantage of the characteristics of the Internal Model Control structure, a robustness test is presented and analyzed using only the available data taken in an open-loop experiment. Examples are provided to show the application of this technique using a non-linear plant.", "paper_title": "DATA-DRIVEN BASED IMC CONTROL", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405300004"}
