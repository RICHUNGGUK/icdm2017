It is proved that limsup(n ->infinity)C(n) = infinity, and the conjecture liminf(n ->infinity)C(n) = 0 is discussed. A Costas array of order n is known to be equivalent to a permutation of {1, 2, ... n} for which the difference triangle contains no repeated elements in any row. A generalized Costas array of order n = q - 1 (or n = q - 2) is defined as a permutation of the nonzero elements (or also excluding 1) of the q-element field for which the difference triangle contains no repeated elements in any row. Two new constructions for these generalized Costas arrays are described and illustrated.", "paper_title": "The status of costas Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800031"}
