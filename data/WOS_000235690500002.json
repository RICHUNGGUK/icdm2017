The main drawbacks of these methods are long forecasting time due to time-consuming nature, individual knowledge, lack of communication, absence of experts, etc. A Web-based flood forecasting system (WFFS), which includes five main modules: real-time rainfall data conversion, model-driven hydrologic forecasting, model calibration, precipitation forecasting, and flood analysis, is presented in this paper. The WFFS brings significant convenience to personnel engaged in flood forecasting and control and allows real-time contribution of a wide range of experts at other spatial locations in times of emergency. The conceptual framework and detailed components of the proposed WFFS, which employs a multi-tiered architecture, are illustrated. Multi-tiered architecture offers great flexibility, portability, reusability and reliability. The prototype WFFS has been developed in Java programming language and applied in Shuangpai region with a satisfactory result. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
