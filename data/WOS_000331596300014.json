In this study, a feature-based simplification method of boundary representation (B-rep) models using sequential iterative volume decomposition is proposed. This method generates a feature-based model from a B-rep model by sequentially and iteratively applying the four volume decomposition methods (fillet, round, and chamfer decomposition; wraparound decomposition; volume split decomposition; and cell-based decomposition). Then, feature-based simplification is applied to the generated feature-based model. To demonstrate the proposed method, a prototype system is implemented, and experiments with test cases are performed. Based on the experimental results, we verified that the proposed method successfully simplified B-rep models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
