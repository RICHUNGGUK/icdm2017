Therefore, Tim Berners-Lee proposed the Semantic Web as the new web paradigm to solve this problem. But there is always a security problem in Semantic Web such as WWW and the study about this is insufficient. Therefore, the authors of this paper propose that the Security Intelligence system should be used to present semantic information using ontology and prevents that users flow out the information. This system is an ACM(Access Control Matrix) based access control model basically, and It is a system that prevent information leakage by user's deliberation and by user's mistake. It can be also used for WWW.", "paper_title": "Security intelligence: Web contents security system for Semantic Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600104"}
