In this article, the point and interval maximum-likelihood estimations of Weibull distribution parameters and the acceleration factor are considered. The estimation process is performed under Type-I progressively hybrid censored data for a step-stress partially accelerated test model. The biases and mean square errors of the maximum-likelihood estimators are computed to assess their performances in the presence of censoring developed in this article through a Monte Carlo simulation study.", "paper_title": "Likelihood inference for a step-stress partially accelerated life test model with Type-I progressively hybrid censored data from Weibull distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000340102000015"}
