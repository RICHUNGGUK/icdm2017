The data from a Web-based survey of 359 purchasing professionals in the United States suggests that buyers with more experience in using information technology, the Internet to facilitate purchasing, and information systems for enhancing supply chain management would more likely use electronic marketplaces for purchasing. This study has significant theoretical implications because it confirms the important role of e-readiness in the electronic marketplace usage model. The practical implications of this study are also discussed.", "paper_title": "An empirical study of business-to-business electronic marketplace usage: The impact of buyers' e-readiness", "paper_id": "WOS:000255901800002"}
