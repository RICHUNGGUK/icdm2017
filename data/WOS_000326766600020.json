A new estimation method is proposed based on minimizing the conditional least squares (CLS) with the conditional mean function computed approximately via the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Conditions are derived for the UKF CLS estimator to preserve the limiting properties of the exact CLS estimator, namely, consistency and asymptotic normality, under the framework of infill asymptotics, i.e. sampling is increasingly dense over a fixed domain. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation and a real application. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
