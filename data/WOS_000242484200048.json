First, conditions for orthogonally blocked experiments are derived. Next, an algorithmic approach to compute D-optimal designs is presented. Finally, the relationships between design optimality and orthogonality in the context of response surface experiments are discussed in detail. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
