We have recently released a new version (3.0.5), which is a major update to the code base that greatly extends its functionality. Results: BioJava now consists of several independent modules that provide state-of-the-art tools for protein structure comparison, pairwise and multiple sequence alignments, working with DNA and protein sequences, analysis of amino acid properties, detection of protein modifications and prediction of disordered regions in proteins as well as parsers for common file formats using a biologically meaningful data model.", "paper_title": "BioJava: an open-source framework for bioinformatics in 2012", "paper_id": "WOS:000309881200023"}
