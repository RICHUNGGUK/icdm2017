It also introduces some concepts of scenario and scenario patterns, and formalizes the embedded software with scenario model ACDATE. The verification patterns are built with embedded system, and are tested with the samples of basic scenario pattern. This paper shows the process about how to verify the embedded software.", "paper_title": "A new method for testing embedded software with scenario pattern", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300021"}
