While previous work in this area has focused on a simple real signal model, in this paper, a baseband complex representation of the data is used so as to properly take into account the I and Q components of the received signal. For the case in which the received signal is improper, a widely linear reception structure, processing separately the data and their complex conjugates, is considered. Several noncooperative resource allocation games are considered for this new scenario, and the performance gains granted by the use of widely linear detection are assessed through theoretical analysis. Numerical results confirm the validity of the theoretical findings and show that exploiting the improper nature of the data in noncooperative resource allocation brings remarkable performance improvements in multiuser wireless systems.", "paper_title": "Transmitter Waveform and Widely Linear Receiver Design: Noncooperative Games for Wireless Multiple-Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283260900009"}
