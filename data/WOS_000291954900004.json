Our algorithm can take as input either a single lattice, or multiple lattices for system combination. It has similar functionality to the widely used Consensus method, but has a clearer theoretical basis and appears to give better results both for MBR decoding and system combination. Many different approximations have been described to solve the M BR decoding problem, which is very difficult from an optimization point of view. Our proposed method solves the problem through a novel forward backward recursion on the lattice, not requiring time markings. We prove that our algorithm iteratively improves a bound on the Bayes risk. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
