It is known that there are joints formed by . We say that a point is a multijoint formed by the finite collections of lines in if there exist at least n lines through x, one from each collection, spanning . We show that there are such points for any field and , as well as for and any . Moreover, we say that a point is a generic joint formed by a finite collection of lines in if each n lines of through x form a joint there. We show that, for and any , there are less than or similar to n vertical bar L vertical bar(n/n-1)/k(n+1/n-1) + vertical bar L vertical bar/k generic joints formed by L, each lying in similar to k lines of L. This result generalises, to all dimensions, a (very small) part of the main point-line incidence theorem in R-3 by Guth and Katz (http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4105v3, 2010). Finally, we generalise our results in to the case of multijoints and generic joints formed by real algebraic curves.", "paper_title": "Incidence Bounds on Multijoints and Generic Joints", "paper_id": "WOS:000358372000010"}
