With a so-generated binary sequences representation of neurocan gene, we associate two 2x2 matrices whose elements are independent of the lengths of neurocan, the elements of which are given by the frequency of occurrence of all (0, 1) triplets in the binary sequences. Also, we define an information entropy for the amino-acid sequence of neurocan gene. The eigenvalues of the so-constructed matrices and the information entropies are used to characterize individual neurocan sequences.", "paper_title": "Numerical characterization and similarity analysis of neurocan gene", "paper_id": "WOS:000244490600007"}
