The development is axiom-free and fully constructive. Three substantive parts that could be used also in other developments are the formalizations of the simply-typed lambda calculus, of finite multisets and of the multiset ordering. The Coq code consists of more than 1000 lemmas and 300 definitions.", "paper_title": "Certified higher-order recursive path ordering", "paper_id": "WOS:000240072100017"}
