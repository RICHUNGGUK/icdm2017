The models can easily provide closed-form expressions, in terms of the ordinary Bessel functions, for the amplitudes of the second-harmonic and second-order intermodulation components at the output of the nonlinear circuit/system excited by a multisinusoidal input signal. Moreover, by combining the proposed models with the previously published models for instantaneous characteristics exhibiting odd-symmetry nonlinearities, a new method and apparatus are proposed for characterizing nonlinear circuits/systems exhibiting both even-and odd-symmetry nonlinearities. The proposed method and apparatus use the amplitudes of the measured output second-and third-order intermodulation components resulting from a two-tone equal-amplitude input signal.", "paper_title": "New single-parameter models for electronic circuits with even symmetry nonlinearity", "paper_id": "WOS:000326453400020"}
