The vanishing of isolated nodes is not only a prerequisite but also a good indication of network connectivity. Most of the known works on network connectivity under such a shadowing model were obtained only based on simulation studies or ignoring the important boundary effect to avoid the challenging technical analysis, and thus hardly applied to practical wireless networks. It is extremely challenging to take the complicated boundary effect into consideration under such a realistic shadowing model because the transmission area of each node is an irregular region other than a circular area. Assume the wireless nodes are represented by a Poisson point process with density over a unit-area disk. With the boundary effect taken into consideration, we first obtain an explicit formula for the expected number of isolated nodes, we then derive an upper and a lower bounds of the critical transmission power for asymptotic vanishing of the isolated nodes. The tightness of the upper and lower bounds for the critical transmission power are analyzed via numerical analysis by using the software engineering approach. When a wireless network consists of nodes distributed independently and uniformly over a unit-area disk, we derive the precise distribution of the number of the isolated nodes under such a realistic shadowing model with the linear power assignment, taking the boundary effect into consideration.", "paper_title": "Connectivity of multihop wireless networks with log-normal shadowing", "paper_id": "WOS:000361822000013"}
