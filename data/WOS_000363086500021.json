However, most of them focus only on authentication and fail to satisfy many practical security requirements such as user anonymity and untraceability. To address this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving authentication scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography. The proposed scheme is provably secure under a formal model that satisfies all practical security requirements. Compared with existing authentication schemes, ours enjoys better performance in terms of computation cost and security.
