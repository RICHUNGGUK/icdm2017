This paper discusses the specification of the connection management and synchronization procedures of DCCP using Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs). After introducing the protocol, we describe how the CPN model evolved as DCCP was being developed. We focus on our experience of incremental enhancement in the hope that this will provide guidance to those attempting to build complex protocol models. In particular, we discuss how the architecture, data structures and specification style of the model evolved as DCCP was developed. We finally recommend a procedure-based style once the standard is stable. The impact of this work on the DCCP standard and our interaction with IETF is also briefly discussed.", "paper_title": "Coloured Petri Net Modelling of an Evolving Internet Standard: the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000262452900007"}
