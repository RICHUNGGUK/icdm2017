COAT provides a framework for the development of information pipelines to transform clinical data from its original structured, semi-structured, and unstructured forms to a standardized format amenable to statistical analysis. This system includes a collection of clinical data structures, reusable utilities for information analysis and transformation, and a graphical user interface through which pipelines can be controlled and their results audited by nontechnical users. The COAT architecture is presented, as well as two case studies of current implementations in the domain of prostate cancer outcomes assessment.", "paper_title": "The Clinical Outcomes Assessment Toolkit: A framework to support automated clinical records-based outcomes assessment and performance measurement research", "paper_id": "WOS:000255965500012"}
