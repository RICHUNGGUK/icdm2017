To suppress these spurious oscillations and to provide an edge-preserving regularization, we use a multiplicative regularizer which improves the reconstruction results significantly while adding little computational complexity to the inversion algorithm. We show the inversion results for a real human forearm assuming the 2-D transverse magnetic illumination and a cylindrical object assuming the 2-D transverse electric illumination.", "paper_title": "Enhancement of the Krylov Subspace Regularization for Microwave Biomedical Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000272242100015"}
