Also, its practicability gets confirmed by further verifications in structure's angle invariance, oblique incidence transmission efficiency and polarized incidence independence. The 0.2 x 0.2 mm(2) tiny fabrication scale and as more than 360 periods array dense qualify for UVGA (1600 x 1200) resolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
