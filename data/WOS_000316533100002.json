Both of the Leray-alpha and NS-alpha subgrid scale models are under current investigation. For an accurate assessment of these differential models developed on the basis of regularizing the nonlinear convective terms, a dispersively very accurate upwinding scheme is proposed to approximate the regularized convective terms in non-staggered grids. These models are assessed through the calculation of the lid-driven cavity and backward facing step problems. We conclude from this study that application of the NS-alpha model can get a solution having a better agreement with the classical Navier-Stokes solution which is computed in a four-time finer grids.
