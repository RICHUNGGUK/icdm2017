It employs a new Background-Weighted similarity measure which can greatly reduce the influence from the pixels shared by the target template and background on localization. Experiments demonstrated the Background-Weighted measure performs much better than the other similarity measures like Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bhattacharyya coefficient and so on. It has been proved that this measure can compute the similarity value contribution of each pixel in the target candidate, based on which, a new target search method called Centroid Iteration is constructed. The convergence of the method has been demonstrated. Theory analysis and visual experiments both validated the new algorithm.", "paper_title": "Centroid Iteration algorithm for image tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000303384000006"}
