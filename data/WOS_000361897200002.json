Depending on the type of application dealing with, when trying to deliver a certain service in a specific time and with a limited budget, a sequential application may be redesigned in a convenient way so that it will become scalable and able to run on multiple resources. Many task computing model brings together loosely coupled applications, composed of many dependent/independent tasks, which will work together for a common result. When asking for a certain service, the most frequently constraints addressed by the user are deadline and budget. This paper elaborates on a multi-objective scheduling algorithm of many tasks in Hadoop for big data processing, named MOMTH. We consider objective functions related to users and resources in the same time with constraints like deadline (scheduling in due time) and budget. The algorithm evaluation was realized in scheduling load simulator, a tool integrated in Hadoop. MobiWay, a collaboration platform that expose interoperability between a large number of sensing mobile devices and a wide-range of mobility applications, was chosen for performance analysis of MOMTH. We compared the proposed algorithm with first in first out and fair schedulers and we obtained similar performance for our approach.", "paper_title": "MOMTH: multi-objective scheduling algorithm of many tasks in Hadoop", "paper_id": "WOS:000361897200002"}
