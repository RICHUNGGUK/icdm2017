Secret messages are encoded by two-qubit unitary operations and exchanged by the two communication parties directly. We discussed the security of the protocol under intercept-resend attack and individual attack. We found that the protocols are secure against eavesdropping attacks.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM DIRECT COMMUNICATION BASED ON QUANTUM SEARCH ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194800003"}
