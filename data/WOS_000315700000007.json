We deduce that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by minimizing cost functions is a clarke stationary point of the nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem and the proposed method possesses at least superlinear convergence property. Four image restoration problems with different pixels and different regularization terms are used to implement numerical tests. Experimental results and comparison with the two methods in [M. Nikolova et al., IEEE Trans.Image Process., Vol.19, NO.12 (2010), pp.3073-3088] show the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "On l(2) data fitting and modified nonconvex nonsmooth regularization for image recovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000315700000007"}
