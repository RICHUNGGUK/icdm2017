It is possible to make this model faster by inhibiting computation of features or scales, which are less important for detection of an object. To this end, we revise this model by implementing a new scale-wise surround inhibition. Each feature channel and scale is associated with a weight and a processing cost. Then a global optimization algorithm is used to find a weight vector with maximum detection rate and minimum processing cost. This allows achieving maximum object detection rate for real time tasks when maximum processing time is limited. A heuristic is also proposed for learning top-down spatial attention control to further limit the saliency computation. Comparing over five objects, our approach has 85.4 and 92.2% average detection rates with and without cost, respectively, which are above 80% of the basic saliency model. Our approach has 33.3 average processing cost compared with 52 processing cost of the basic model. We achieved lower average hit numbers compared with NVT but slightly higher than VOCUS attentional systems.", "paper_title": "Cost-sensitive learning of top-down modulation for attentional control", "paper_id": "WOS:000285973700005"}
