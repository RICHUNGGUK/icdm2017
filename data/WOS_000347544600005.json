Four methods of obtaining random subsamples are described. Several estimators of the mean of the population based on random subsamples in ranked set sampling are proposed. These estimators are compared with the mean of a simple random sample for estimating the mean of symmetric and skew distributions. Extensive simulation under several subsampling distributions, sample sizes, and symmetric and skew distributions shows that the estimators of the mean based on random subsamples are more accurate than existing methods.", "paper_title": "Ranked set sampling with random subsamples", "paper_id": "WOS:000347544600005"}
