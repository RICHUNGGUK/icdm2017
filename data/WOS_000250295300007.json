Therefore, to facilitate efficient course design and management for lecturers, automatic course generation is an important issue in e-Learning research and development. A complete standardized course, however, usually needs some auxiliary materials which are determined by the students' behavior. This makes the course design process more complex and more challenging. In this investigation, a complete course generation platform was developed. The platform was made up of MEAT (Mobile E-learning Authoring Tool), LRMS (Learning Resource Management System), ANTS (Agent-based Navigational Training System), and a material arrangement agent. The material arrangement agent adopts DFPN (Dynamic Fuzzy Petri Nets) and the proposed extended model to introduce a process called SCGP (Standardized Course Generation Process). By means of this automatic process, standardized courses not only correspond to the SCORM standard but also arrange adaptive auxiliary materials dynamically. The generated multimedia course is interoperable, reusable, and standardized. Furthermore, the automatic process enables lecturers to efficiently generate courses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
