Interference-aware gossiping scheduling (IAGS) aims to find an interference-free scheduling for gossiping with the minimum latency. Previous work on IAGS mostly assumes that nodes are always active, and thus is not suitable for duty-cycled scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the IAGS problem in uncoordinated duty-cycled multi-hop wireless networks (IAGS-UDC problem) under protocol interference model and unbounded-size message model. We prove that the IAGS-UDC problem is NP-hard. We propose two novel algorithms, called MILD and MILD-R, for this problem with an approximation ratio of at most 3 beta(2)(Delta + 6)vertical bar T vertical bar, where beta is [2/3 (alpha + 2)], alpha denotes the ratio of the interference radius to the transmission radius, A denotes the maximum node degree of the network, and vertical bar T vertical bar denotes the number of time slots in a scheduling period. The total numbers of transmissions scheduled by both two algorithms are at most three times as large as the minimum total number of transmissions. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of our algorithms. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
