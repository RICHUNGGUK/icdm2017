Yet, cloud resources do not come for free: a careful orchestration is needed to minimize the economical cost. This paper proposes a novel architecture for MMOGs that combines an elastic cloud infrastructure with user-provided resources, to boost both the scalability and the economical sustainability provided by cloud computing. Our system dynamically reconfigures the platform while managing the trade-off between economical cost and quality of service, exploiting user-provided resources whenever possible. Simulation results show that a negligible reduction in the quality of service can reduce the cost of the platform up to 60 % percent.", "paper_title": "Integrating peer-to-peer and cloud computing for massively multiuser online games", "paper_id": "WOS:000348938300009"}
