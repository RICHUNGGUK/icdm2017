The effects of linear and nonlinear coefficients of a quartic-bistable system on the system's response to feeble input signals in noisy background are investigated. Genetic Algorithm is applied to search for the optimal system parameters in the given noise. The success probability of obtaining desired logic output is used as the fitness function. Experimental results show that the system can achieve robust logic operation in a wide range of noise intensity by adjusting the parameters. The study might provide an example of the application of parameter-induced LSR in engineering practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
