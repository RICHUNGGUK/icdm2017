Literature on material characterisation of the CC is limited. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been extremely successful in characterising the elastic properties of soft biomaterials such as articular cartilage and hydrogels, which are often the material of choice for cartilage models. But AFM data on CC are absent in the literature. In this study, AFM indentations using spherical beaded tips were performed on human CC to isolate the mechanical properties. A novel method was developed for modelling the relaxation indentation experiments based on Fung's quasi-linear viscoelasticity and a continuous relaxation spectrum. This particular model has been popular for uniaxial compression test data analysis. Using the model, the mean Young's modulus of CC was found to be about 2.17, 4.11 and 5.49 MPa for three specimens. A large variation of modulus was observed over the tissue. Also, the modulus values decreased with distance from the costochondral junction.", "paper_title": "Quasi-linear viscoelastic properties of costal cartilage using atomic force microscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000303561200004"}
