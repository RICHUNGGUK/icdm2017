For this purpose, regional Moment Tensor Inversion (MTI) method that calculates faulting parameters using three-dimensional broad-band waveform seismic data was used. FPS application is composed of two main software components: the first one is Time Domain Moment Tensor Inverse Code (TDMT_INVC with synthetic seismogram calculation) and the second one is Seismic Data Server Application Service (SDSAS) that is used for retrieving waveform data from storage elements. The most time consuming part of the FPS application involves the calculation of Green's functions. Therefore, we parallelized calculation of the Greens functions. A Job Description Language (JDL) workflow is automatically created based on the initial parameters of individual crustal models that are necessary for producing Green functions. Timing results obtained show that our FPS application did achieve speed-up as a result of parallelization.", "paper_title": "Gridification of regional Fault Plain Solution (FPS)", "paper_id": "WOS:000286014500006"}
