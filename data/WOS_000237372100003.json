In this case. the joint density function for the variables in the network does not exist. Conditional linear Gaussian (CLG) distributions can handle such cases when all variables are normally distributed. In this paper, we develop operations required for performing inference with linear conditionally deterministic variables in continuous Bayesian networks using relationships derived from joint cumulative distribution functions. These methods allow inference in networks with linear deterministic variables and non-Gaussian distributions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
