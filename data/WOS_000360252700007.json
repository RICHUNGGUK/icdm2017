However, CTA is prone to artifacts that reduce the diagnostic accuracy to identify stenoses. Further, CTA does not allow for determination of the physiologic significance of the visualized stenoses. In this paper, we propose a new system to determine the physiologic manifestation of coronary stenoses by assessment of myocardial perfusion from typically acquired CTA images at rest. As a first step, we develop an automated segmentation method to delineate the left ventricle. Both endocardium and epicardium are compactly modeled with subdivision surfaces and coupled by explicit thickness representation. After initialization with five anatomical landmarks, the model is adapted to a target image by deformation increments including control vertex displacements and thickness variations guided by trained AdaBoost classifiers, and regularized by a prior of deformation increments from principal component analysis (PCA). The evaluation using a 5-fold cross-validation demonstrates the overall segmentation error to be 1.00 +/- 0.39 mm for endocardium and 1.06 +/- 0.43 mm for epicardium, with a boundary contour alignment error of 2.79 +/- 0.52. Based on our LV model, two types of myocardial perfusion analyzes have been performed. One is a perfusion network analysis, which explores the correlation (as network edges) pattern of perfusion between all pairs of myocardial segments (as network nodes) defined in AHA 17-segment model. We find perfusion network display different patterns in the normal and disease groups, as divided by whether significant coronary stenosis is present in quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). The other analysis is a clinical validation assessment of the ability of the developed algorithm to predict whether a patient has significant coronary stenosis when referenced to an invasive QCA ground truth standard. By training three machine learning techniques using three features of normalized perfusion intensity, transmural perfusion ratio, and myocardial wall thickness, we demonstrate AdaBoost to be slightly better than Naive Bayes and Random Forest by the area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. For the AdaBoost algorithm, an optimal cut-point reveals an accuracy of 0.70, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.79 and 0.64, respectively. Our study shows perfusion analysis from CTA images acquired at rest is useful for providing physiologic information in diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery stenoses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
