Real-time computations of the flow velocity field allow the experimentalist to have instantaneous access to quantitative features of the flow. This can be very useful in many situations: fast evaluation of the performances and characteristics of a new setup, design optimization, easier and faster parametric studies, etc. It can also be used as a visual sensor for an input in closed-loop flow control experiments where fast estimation of the state of the flow is needed. The algorithm is implemented on a graphics processor unit. The accuracy of the computation is demonstrated. Computation speed and scalability of the processing are highlighted along with guidelines for further improvements. The system architecture is flexible, scalable and can be adapted on the fly in order to process higher resolutions or achieve higher precision. The setup is applied on a backward-facing step flow in a hydrodynamic channel. For validation purposes, classical particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used to compare with instantaneous optical flow measurements. The important flow characteristics like the dynamics of the recirculation bubble, computed in real time for the first time, are well recovered. The accuracy of real-time optical flow measurements is comparable to off-line PIV computations.", "paper_title": "Real-time planar flow velocity measurements using an optical flow algorithm implemented on GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000353409400013"}
