The equation, relevant to this physical problem, is derived by a first principle approach. The electron-phonon interaction is described on a quantum-kinetic level by the Levinson equation, but the evolution problem becomes inhomogeneous due to the spatial dependence of the initial condition. The initial carrier distribution is assumed Gaussian both in energy and space coordinates, an electric field can be applied along the wire. A stochastic method, described in Part 11 of the work, is used for solving the equation. The obtained simulation results characterize the space and energy dependence of the evolution in the zero field case. Quantum effects introduced by the early time electron-phonon interaction are analyzed.", "paper_title": "Fuu-rntosecond evolution of spatially inhornogeneous carrier excitations - Part I: Kinetic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000236456400015"}
