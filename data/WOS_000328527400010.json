The aim is to automatically achieve the best parameters according to the work point and the dynamics of the plant. To this end, several typical expressions and systems were taken into account to build the model for this multidisciplinary study. Each of these expressions is appropriated for a particular system. The novel method is empirically verified under a real case study based on an auxiliary steam system of a combined cycle plant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
