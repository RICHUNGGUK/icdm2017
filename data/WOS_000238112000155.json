The algorithm is applied to face recognition problems in the paper. Simulation experiments are conducted for different SVM-based classification algorithms using both PCA and Fisherface features as input vectors respectively to represent the images with dimensional reduction, and performance analysis is made among different approaches. Experiment results show that the error correction SVM classifier of the paper outperforms other commonly used SVM-based classifiers both in recognition rate and error tolerance.", "paper_title": "An SVM classification algorithm with error correction ability applied to face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000155"}
