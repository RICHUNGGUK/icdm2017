This has led to discussions in the standards communities of possible collaborative development, interoperability and harmonization of their existing standards. Here, I assess how such harmonization efforts may be aided by recent research results to create better quality standards to replace the status quo.", "paper_title": "Standards harmonization: theory and practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000303457300002"}
