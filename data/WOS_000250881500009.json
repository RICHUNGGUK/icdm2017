The notion of weakest liberal precondition semantics, introduced by Dijkstra for classical deterministic programs and by McIver and Morgan for probabilistic programs, is generalized to our quantum programs. To help reasoning about the correctness of quantum programs, we extend the proof rules presented by Morgan for classical probabilistic loops to quantum loops. These rules are shown to be complete in the sense that any correct assertion about the quantum loops can be proved using them. Some illustrative examples are also given to demonstrate the practicality of our proof rules. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
