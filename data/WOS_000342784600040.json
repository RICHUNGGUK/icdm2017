Although multiple-directional predictions are among the features contributing to the improved compression efficiency, its high computational complexity keeps it from being used widely. This paper presents an algorithm to skip backward and bi-directional predictions when merge or forward prediction modes are likely to be determined as the best mode. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the fact that there is a cost relationship among multi-directional predictions and that the results of backward and bi-directional predictions are therefore predictable before the actual operations. After merge and forward predictions, if the expected results of backward and bi-directional predictions are worse than the results up to that point, then additional backward and bi-directional predictions to search for more accurate motion vectors are not performed. A simulation shows that the encoding time is reduced by about 15.18% with a marginal degradation in compression efficiency.", "paper_title": "Skipping Prediction Directions Based on the Cost Relationship between Multi-Directional Predictions for an HEVC Encoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784600040"}
