The algorithms are used to locate rather the hip joint centre than the glenohumeral joint centre. The choice of the most suitable method depends especially on the intra- and inter-session repeatability of these methods. This paper aims at evaluating the intra- and inter-session repeatability of functional methods with which the glenohumeral joint rotation centre (GHRC) can be estimated in vivo. It also estimates the most suitable amplitude of functional movements. Five functional methods were tested: the algorithms of Gamage and Lasenby, bias compensation, symmetrical CoR estimation, normalisation method and helical axis. Ten subjects performed three cycles of three different movements (flexionextension, abductionadduction and circumduction). These movements were repeated three times with three different ranges of motion. Six subjects came back in order to evaluate the inter-session repeatability. For each test, the location of the GHRC was estimated by the five methods. The method to solve the functional problem and the range of functional movement affected the GHRC location. The results showed a good to excellent intra-session repeatability. The lowest repeatability error was found for the high amplitude whatever the methods used. The inter-session reliability was moderate. Finally, we suggest the use of functional methods with high amplitude movement in order to locate the GHRC with the best reliability.", "paper_title": "Repeatability assessment of functional methods to estimate the glenohumeral joint centre", "paper_id": "WOS:000316056100001"}
