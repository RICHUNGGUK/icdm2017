We also discuss the experience gathered in the contest. In spring 2009 the course \"Artificial Intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems\" was held for the first time on the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). A part of this course was a short introduction to the multi-agent framework Jason, which is an interpreter for AgentSpeak, an agent-oriented programming language. As the final project in this course a solution to the Multi-Agent Programming Contest from 2007, the Gold Miners scenario, was implemented. Finally we decided to participate in this year's contest with an implementation made in Jason as well.", "paper_title": "Building multi-agent systems using Jason", "paper_id": "WOS:000289728100006"}
