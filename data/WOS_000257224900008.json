It is well known that matrices of morphisms preserving Sturmian words (i.e. words coding 2-interval exchange transformations with the maximal possibel factor complexity) form the monoid {M is an element of N-2x2 vertical bar det m=+/- 1}={M is an element of N-2x2 vertical bar MEMT=+/- E}, where [GRAPHICS] We prove that in the case of exchange of three intervals, the matrices preserving words coding these transformations and having the maximal possible subword complexity belong to the monoid {M is an element of N-3x3 vertical bar MEMT=+/- E, det M=+/- 1}, where [GRAPHICS] (c) 2008 Elsevier B.
