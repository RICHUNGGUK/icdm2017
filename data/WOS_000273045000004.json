This proof uses existence argument of a positive definite solution of a standard algebraic Riccati equation. Moreover, we will show that this algorithm is well defined and converges to a unique pair of stabilizing solutions of the coupled algebraic equations under study. A mean result of this work is that the existence of this stabilizing solution does not depend on the detectability assumption. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
