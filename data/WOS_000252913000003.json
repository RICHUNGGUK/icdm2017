Research assessing reported symptoms and side effects of using VR systems indicates that these factors combine to influence user experiences of virtual reality induced symptoms and effects (VRISE). Three experiments were conducted to assess prevalence and severity of sickness symptoms experienced in each of four VR display conditions; head mounted display (HMD), desktop, projection screen and reality theatre, with controlled examination of two additional aspects of viewing (active vs. passive viewing and light vs. dark conditions). Results indicate 60-70% participants experience an increase in symptoms pre-post exposure for HMD, projection screen and reality theatre viewing and found higher reported symptoms in HMD compared with desktop viewing (nausea symptoms) and in HMD compared with reality theatre viewing (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation symptoms). No effect of lighting condition was found. Higher levels of symptoms were reported in passive viewing compared to active control over movement in the VE. However, the most notable finding was that of high inter- and intra-participant variability. As this supports other findings of individual susceptibility to VRISE, recommendations are offered concerning design and use of VR systems in order to minimise VRISE. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
