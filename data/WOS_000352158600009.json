For high-resourced, international languages this data is widely available, while for under-resourced languages the lack of data poses serious problems. Unsupervised acoustic modeling can offer a cost and time effective way of creating a solid acoustic model for any under-resourced language. This study describes a novel unsupervised acoustic model training method and evaluates it on speech data in an under-resourced language: Romanian. The key novel factor of the method is the usage of two complementary seed ASR systems to produce high quality transcriptions, with a Character Error Rate (ChER) < 5%, for initially untranscribed speech data. The methodology leads to a relative Word Error Rate (WER) improvement of more than 10% when 100 hours of untranscribed speech are used.", "paper_title": "Enhancing ASR Systems for Under-Resourced Languages through a Novel Unsupervised Acoustic Model Training Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000352158600009"}
