They are in a continuous state of improvement due to their significant role in traffic microsimulations, intelligent transportation systems, and safety engineering models. This article uses the local linear model tree (LOLIMOT) approach to model driver's CF behavior to incorporate human perceptual imperfections into a CF model. This model defines some localities in the input space. These localities are fuzzy and have overlaps with each other. Specific models for each of the localities are then defined and combined in a fuzzy manner to predict the final output. The model was developed using real world dynamic data sets. Three different data sets were used for training, testing, and validating the model. The performance of the model was compared to a number of existing CF models. The results showed very close agreement between the real data and the LOLIMOT outputs.", "paper_title": "Exploring a Local Linear Model Tree Approach to Car-Following", "paper_id": "WOS:000322003300003"}
