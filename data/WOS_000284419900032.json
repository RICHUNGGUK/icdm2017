In this paper, sequence families constructed from the shift and addition of the polyphase sequences are revisited. Initially, psi(0) = 1 is assumed for multiplicative characters psi to represent power residue and Sidelnikov sequences in a simple form. The Weil bound on multiplicative character sums is refined for the assumption, where the character sums are equivalent to the correlations of sequences represented by multiplicative characters. General constructions of polyphase sequence families that produce some of known families as the special cases are then presented. The refined Weil bound enables the efficient proofs on the maximum correlation magnitudes of the sequence families. From the constructions, it is shown that M-ary known sequence families with large size can be partitioned into (M + 1) disjoint subsequence families with smaller maximum correlation magnitudes. More generalized constructions are also considered by the addition of multiple cyclic shifts of power residue and Sidelnikov sequences.", "paper_title": "Multiplicative Characters, the Weil Bound, and Polyphase Sequence Families With Low Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000284419900032"}
