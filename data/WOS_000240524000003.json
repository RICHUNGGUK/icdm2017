The novelty of our method is the distributed evaluation of resources for rapidly selecting the appropriate idle resources. We integrate our method with a widely used resource management system, namely the Monitoring and Discovery System 2 (MDS2), and compare our method with the original MDS2 in terms of the performance and the scalability. The performance is measured using a 64-node cluster of PCs and the scalability is analyzed using a theoretical model and the measured performance. The experimental results show that our method reduces the resource selection time by 82%, as compared with the original MDS2. The scalability analysis also indicates that our method can keep the resource selection time within I second. up to 500 nodes in local-area-network (LAN) environments. In addition, some simulation results are presented to estimate the impact of our method for wide-area-network (WAN) environments.", "paper_title": "Grid resource monitoring and selection for rapid turnaround applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000240524000003"}
