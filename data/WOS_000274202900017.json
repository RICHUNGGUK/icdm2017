In this study, an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methodology for MHESP is proposed. The proposed approach is utilized from fuzzy sets, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) approaches. Evaluation criteria for the MHESP is weighted by fuzzy-ANP (F-ANP) approach, then, alternative material handling equipments are evaluated by fuzzy-PROMETHEE (F-PROMETHEE) approach. The methodology is applied for a manufacturing company to prove its effectiveness. Finally, some sensitivity analyses are conducted to show the results' sensitiveness to the changes of the weights of the evaluation criteria. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
