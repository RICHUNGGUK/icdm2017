The recursion can be easily implemented in a symbolic algebra package and requires much less computational effort, both in time and memory resources, than previous algorithms. In addition, by bounding appropriately each term in the recursion, it is possible to get a larger convergence domain of the Zassenhaus formula when it is formulated in a Banach algebra.
