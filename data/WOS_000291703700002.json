A new dimensionality reduction approach called maximal local interclass embedding (MLIE) is developed in this paper. MLIE can be viewed as a linear approach of a multimanifolds-based learning framework, in which the information of neighborhood is integrated with the local interclass relationships. In MLIE, the local interclass graph and the intrinsic graph are constructed to find a set of projections that maximize the local interclass scatter and the local intraclass compactness simultaneously. This characteristic makes MLIE more powerful than marginal Fisher analysis (MFA). MLIE maintains all the advantages of MFA. Moreover, the computational complexity of MLIE is less than that of MFA. The proposed algorithm is applied to face recognition. Experiments have been performed on the Yale, AR and ORL face image databases. The experimental results show that owing to the locally discriminating property, MLIE consistently outperforms up-to-date MFA, Smooth MFA, neighborhood preserving embedding and locality preserving projection in face recognition.", "paper_title": "Maximal local interclass embedding with application to face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000291703700002"}
