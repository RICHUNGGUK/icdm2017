It consists of three main components: Art Recommender, Tour Wizard, and Mobile Tour Guide. Based on the semantically enriched Rijksmuseum Amsterdam(2) collection, we show how Semantic Web technologies can be deployed to (partially) solve three important challenges for recommender systems applied in an open Web context: (1) to deal with the complexity of various types of relationships for recommendation inferencing, where we take a content-based approach to recommend both artworks and art-history topics; (2) to cope with the typical user modeling problems, such as cold-start for first-time users, sparsity in terms of user ratings, and the efficiency of user feedback collection; and (3) to support the presentation of recommendations by combining different views like a historical timeline, museum map and faceted browser. Following a user-centered design cycle, we have performed two evaluations with users to test the effectiveness of the recommendation strategy and to compare the different ways for building an optimal user pro. le for efficient recommendations.
