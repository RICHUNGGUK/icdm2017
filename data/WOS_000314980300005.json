Spatial derivatives are approximated using a least squares method on clouds of points. The system of equations is linearised, and solved implicitly using approximate, analytical Jacobian matrices and a preconditioned Krylov subspace iterative method. The details of the spatial discretisation, linear solver and construction of the Jacobian matrix are discussed; and results that demonstrate the performance of the scheme are presented for steady and unsteady two dimensional fluid flows.
