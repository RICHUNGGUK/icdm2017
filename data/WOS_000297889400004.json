In this research, we perform a comprehensive review of existing online product classification methods. An in-depth analysis of the rationale behind each method was studied, and important product characteristics were determined for integrating different approaches. Grounded on the theory of the components of perceived risk in product purchase and the recently emerged service science, the integrated classification will help companies to better understand the online consumer purchasing behavior and to design their e-commerce strategies accordingly. Survey results indicate that the integrated classification is an effective way to classify products and services marketed on the Internet. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
