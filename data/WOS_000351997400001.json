Mobile cloud computing brings new types of services and facilities for mobile users to take full advantage of cloud computing. The paper considers batch processing applications for mobile cloud computing environment. The mobile device's user requirements arrive in batches into the mobile cloud systems. For example, mobile device's users submit batch jobs (e.g., financial analytics, scientific simulations) to mobile cloud system for fast processing. The paper proposes a multistage scheduling for batch processing applications in mobile cloud. The multistage scheduling optimization is involved with mobile cloud provider's optimization, mobile device application's optimization and mobile device job's optimization, respectively. Multimedia search as an example in mobile cloud environment is presented, and the proposed multistage scheduling method is applied to mobile cloud environment. In the simulations, our proposed mobile cloud multistage scheduling algorithms are compared with two related works. Our algorithm combines the perspectives of mobile cloud providers and mobile device users; it outperforms better than other related works.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Scheduling Strategy for Batch Processing Applications in Mobile and AlgorithmCloud: Model and Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000351997400001"}
