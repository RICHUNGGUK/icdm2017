Moreover, time-delays are usually unavoidable in control systems due to the sensoring and communication delays. This paper presents an alternative repetitive control design for systems with constant time-delays in both forward and feedback control channels, which are dedicated to track/reject periodic signals. An additional delay is introduced together with the plant delays to construct an internal model for periodic signals, and a simple compensator based on the plant model inverse is utilized to stabilize the closed-loop system. Sufficient stability conditions of the closed-loop system and the robustness analysis against modeling uncertainties are studied. The proposed idea is further extended for general time-delay systems with only a delay term in the forward control channel. The \"plug-in\" structure used in conventional repetitive control designs is avoided, so that it leads to a simpler control configuration, i.e. only a proportional parameter and the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter are required to be selected. Simulations based on a hard disk drive system and practical experiments on a rotary robotic servo system are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
