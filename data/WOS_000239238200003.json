The identification is based on the expansion of all time functions in the state equations by Haar wavelets. The unknown time function can thus be identified in terms of Haar wavelets. A Haar wavelet is a set of complete, orthogonal basis and is easy to use computations. Several good properties of Haar wavelets are utilized in the algorithm. Both numerical and experimental results verify the analysis.", "paper_title": "Identification of linear time varying systems by Haar wavelet", "paper_id": "WOS:000239238200003"}
