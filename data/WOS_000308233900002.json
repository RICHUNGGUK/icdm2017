However, in a case where the corresponding imaged points cannot induce distinguished measures, the performance of the methods deteriorates. For this reason, we propose a new view-invariant measure for human action recognition by enforcing tri-view constraints in this paper. This new measurement method can be tolerant to different rates of human actions and the anthropometric proportions. We apply our approach to video synchronization by imposing both the similarity ratio and the consistency in the trifocal tensor over entire video sequences. By testing on both synthetic and real data, our method has achieved higher tolerance to noise levels, as well as higher identification accuracy than the traditional two-view method. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can identify human pose transitions, in spite of dynamic time-lines, different viewpoints and unknown camera parameters.", "paper_title": "Human Action Recognition from Video Sequences by Enforcing Tri-view Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000308233900002"}
