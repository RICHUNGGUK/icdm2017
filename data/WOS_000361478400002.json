In this paper, a novel efficient interval twin support vector regression (ITSVR) is proposed to handle such interval data. This ITSVR employs two nonparallel functions to identify the upper and lower sides of the interval output data, respectively, in which the Hausdorff distance is incorporated into the Gaussian kernel as the interval kernel for interval input data. Compared with other support vector regression (SVR)-based interval regression methods, such as the interval support vector interval regression networks (ISVIRN), this ITSVR algorithm is more efficient since only two smaller-sized QPPs are solved, respectively. The experimental results on several artificial datasets and three stock index datasets show the validity of ITSVR.", "paper_title": "Interval twin support vector regression algorithm for interval input-output data", "paper_id": "WOS:000361478400002"}
