We also summarize what in our opinion are the main wireless- and mobility-related technical challenges that lie ahead, and outline some initial ideas on how such challenges can be addressed in order to facilitate the IoT's development and acceptance in the next few years. We also describe a case study on the IoT protocol architecture.", "paper_title": "FROM TODAY'S INTRANET OF THINGS TO A FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS: A WIRELESS- AND MOBILITY-RELATED VIEW", "paper_id": "WOS:000285846600008"}
