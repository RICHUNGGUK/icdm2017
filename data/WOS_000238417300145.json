The model is constructed by a local interaction between vertices, as is in the spin dynamics. Several numerical experiments on network models are performed systematically under various initial conditions. The results strongly depend on the network structures, also on the initial conditions, while most conventional measures of the networks are almost same. It may be shown that the difference of dynamics induced by such interaction reveals a new characteristic feature of the network structure.", "paper_title": "A new analysis method for complex network based on dynamics of spin diffusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300145"}
