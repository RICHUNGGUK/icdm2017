The ability to delegate complex negotiation processes and obtain similar or better results than their human counterparts has generated a great interest in agent-based markets. More recently, such a paradigm has been applied in the field of knowledge management and, more specifically, to knowledge sharing and exchange; however, most of the knowledge market proposals in the literature fail to give details on a key component of their models: knowledge quality. This article presents a new proposal for an agent-based market environment that aims at filling the previously mentioned gap in research. The main contribution of our research is the integration of formal mechanisms for knowledge quality and quantity measurement and the use of these values to set a price for knowledge and select the most suitable agent for negotiation.", "paper_title": "A PROPOSAL FOR A KNOWLEDGE MARKET BASED ON QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF KNOWLEDGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000316075800003"}
