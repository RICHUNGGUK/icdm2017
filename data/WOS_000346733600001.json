In this paper, a cooperative and active sensing framework is developed to enable scalar field mapping using multiple mobile sensor nodes. The cooperative and active controller is designed via the real-time feedback of the sensing performance to steer the mobile sensors to new locations in order to improve the sensing quality. During the movement of the mobile sensors, the measurements from each sensor node and its neighbors are fused with the corresponding confidences using distributed consensus filters. As a result, an online map of the scalar field is built while achieving a certain level of confidence of the estimates. We conducted computer simulations to validate and evaluate our proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Cooperative and Active Sensing in Mobile Sensor Networks for Scalar Field Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000346733600001"}
