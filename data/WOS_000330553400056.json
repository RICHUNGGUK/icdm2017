After initial estimation of multiple CFOs by using the properties of the ZC sequence, accurate estimates are obtained in the proposed technique by an iterative procedure. The proposed technique can be applied to LTE-based CoMP systems where ZC sequences are used to generate synchronization signals in downlink and random access preambles in uplink.", "paper_title": "Multiple CFO Estimation Using the Properties of Zadoff-Chu Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000330553400056"}
