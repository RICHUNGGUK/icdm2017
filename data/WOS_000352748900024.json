These systems also suffer from information overload, often providing offers to a user that are neither valid nor interesting because they do not match his/her context. Moreover, these offering strategies are not interoperable among different systems. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an innovative web-mapping context-aware system called \"SPLIS\" (Semantic Personalized Location Information System) that utilizes Semantic Web technologies for delivering group-targeted offers from POI owners to users/potential customers. The presented system (a) adopts the schema.org ontology, (b) uses RuleML-compatible rules to represent group-targeted POI offers, (c) combines at run-time the above to match user context with suitable offers, and finally, (d) visualizes offers in an intuitive way. The paper also reports on a user evaluation of the system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
