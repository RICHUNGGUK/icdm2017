In this model, we used higher-order moment method, multi-scale technique and Chapman-Enskog expansion, and multi-energy-level to obtain wave equation and energy conservation equation. As numerical examples, the interference and diffraction of wave are simulated. The numerical results show this model can be used to simulate two-dimensional wave propagation.
