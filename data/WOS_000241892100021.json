A flatten 3dB loss spectrum LPG is designed as an example to show the effectiveness of the PSO algorithm. This 3dB LPG is a key component of multi-channel filter in optical communications and optical sensors. The results showed that the intelligent PSO algorithm is very powerful and can be used for complex optimization problem.", "paper_title": "Intelligent particle swarm optimization algorithm and its application in optimal designing of LPG devices for optical communications fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100021"}
