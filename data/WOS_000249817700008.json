It has been found that Differential evolution performs best followed by the Particle swarm optimization. Both DE and PSO can perform well even with very small population size whereas GA needs a reasonably large population size. Thus, the computational efforts needed by both DE and PSO are less than that of GA.", "paper_title": "Reactive power optimization through evolutionary techniques: A comparative study of the Ga, De and PSO", "paper_id": "WOS:000249817700008"}
