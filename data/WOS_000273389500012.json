The algorithm is based on a factorization of the Multi-Static Response (MSR) matrix collected in the far-field at a single, nonzero frequency in either Transverse Magnetic (TM) mode (Dirichlet boundary condition) or Transverse Electric (TE) mode (Neumann boundary condition), followed by the calculation of a MUSIC cost functional expected to exhibit peaks along the crack curves each half a wavelength. Numerical experimentation from exact, noiseless and noisy data shows that this is indeed the case and that the proposed algorithm behaves in robust manner, with better results in the TM mode than in the TE mode for which one would have to estimate the normal to the crack to get the most optimal results.
