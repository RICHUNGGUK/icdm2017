It focuses in particular on two crucial issues, for such calculations: very low CFL number at the implosion center and approximation error on the initial geometry. Thus, we propose an exceptional points method, which is translation invariant and suitable to curved meshes. This method is designed for cell-centered Lagrangian schemes (GLACE [8,13,14], EUCCLHYD [25-29]). Several numerical examples on significant test cases are presented to show the relevance of our approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
