The Euclidean algorithm for arbitrary n Laurent polynomials and the factorization theorem of polyphase matrices of wavelet bi-frames are proposed. We prove that any wavelet bi-frame with arbitrary generators can be factorized into a finite number of alternating lifting and dual lifting steps. Based on this concept, we present a new idea for constructing hi-frames by lifting. For the construction, by using generalized Bernstein basis functions, we realize a lifting scheme of wavelet bi-frames with arbitrary prediction and update filters and establish explicit formulas for wavelet hi-frame transforms. By combining the different designed filters for the prediction and update steps, we can devise practically unlimited forms of wavelet bi-frames. Furthermore, we present an algorithm for increasing the number of vanishing moments of wavelet bi-frames to arbitrary order by the presented lifting scheme, which adopts an iterative algorithm. Several examples are constructed to illustrate the conclusion.
