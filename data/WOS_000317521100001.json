The aim is to describe and to evaluate this platform, which exhibits some interesting peculiarities w.r.t. the mainstream literature: real-time support over the Internet, capacity to handle loss/disorder of packets, and varying delays. Practical tests are given to show its capabilities to telecontrol different systems. The evaluation is carried out comparing the performance of some controllers for position coordination of a pair of localremote Internet-connected systems. Besides, an assessment of platform usage and learning effectiveness was developed to conclude on its pedagogical viability in engineering education. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
