This class of converters is extremely relevant in applications where there is a need for non-uniform quantization characteristic, for example, some specific applications in the areas of light detection, hearing aid, nuclear physics, image acquisition, communication systems, etc. This survey outlines the state-of-the-art Nonlinear ADC topologies, such as, floating point, logarithmic, piecewise linear and oversampled nonlinear converters, and discusses their performance and advantages in terms of their applications.
