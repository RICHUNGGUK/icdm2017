In this article, we propose two new lower bounds based on QPB. The first dominates QPB at a high computational cost, which is shown equivalent to the recent second-order cone programming bound. The second is strictly tighter than QPB in most cases, while it is solved as easily as QPB.", "paper_title": "On improving convex quadratic programming relaxation for the quadratic assignment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000360388300015"}
