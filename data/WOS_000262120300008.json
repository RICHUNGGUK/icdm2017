It provides an integer programming formulation of the problem. It also describes five operators for improving a feasible solution, and two heuristics that utilize these operators: a probabilistic tabu search algorithm, and an iterated local search algorithm. The heuristics are evaluated on data adapted from TSPLIB instances. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
