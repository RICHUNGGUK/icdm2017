The model is based oil a polynomial architecture that is the product of linear functions in different dimensions of the space. Particle swarm optimization (PSO), a global optimization method, is proposed to train the single neuron model in this paper. An improved version of the original PSO, cooperative random learning particle swarm optimization (CRPSO), is put forward to enhance the performance of the conventional PSO. The proposed CRPSO, PSO, back-propagation algorithm and genetic algorithm are employed to train the model for three well-known time series prediction problems. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CRPSO-based neuron model in efficiency and robustness over the other three algorithms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
