All of them have certain key processes in common such as scoring, ranking, rewarding, punishing or gathering behavioral information. However, there is not a standardization effort for these kinds of models. Such effort would be beneficial for distributed systems such as P2P, ad-hoc networks, multi-agent systems or Wireless Sensor Networks. In this paper we present a pre-standardization approach for trust and/or reputation models in distributed systems. A wide review of them has been carried out, extracting common properties and providing some pre-standardization recommendations. A global comparison has been done for the most relevant models against these conditions, and an interface proposal for trust and/or reputation models has been proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.
