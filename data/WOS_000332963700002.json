In order to recommend a product to a user and predict that user's preference, CF utilizes product evaluation ratings of like-minded users. The process of finding like-minded users forms a social network among all users and each link between two users represents an implicit connection between them. Users having more connections with others are the most influential users. Attacking recommender systems is a new issue for these systems. Here, an attacker tries to manipulate a recommender system in order to change the recommendation output according to her wish. If an attacker succeeds, her profile is used over and over again by the recommender system, making her an influential user. In this study, we applied the established attack detection methods to the influential users, instead of the whole user set, to improve their attack detection performance. Experiments were conducted using the same settings previously used to test the established methods. The results showed that the proposed influence-based method had better detection performance and improved the stability of a recommender system for most attack scenarios. It performed considerably better than established detection methods for attacks that inserted low numbers of attack profiles (20-25 %).", "paper_title": "Defending recommender systems by influence analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000332963700002"}
