It is stated as a generalized pseudo-spectral method which performs exact differentiation by using simultaneously several approximation spaces generated by polynomials bases and suitable choices of port-variables. The symplecticity of this spatial reduction method is proved when used for the reduction of both closed and open systems of conservation laws, for any choice of collocation points (i.e. for any polynomial bases). The symplecticity of some more usual collocation schemes is discussed and finally their accuracy on approximation of the spectrum, on the example of the ideal transmission line, is discussed in comparison with the suggested reduction scheme.
