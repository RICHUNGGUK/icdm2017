We present a comprehensive dynamic hair capture system for reconstructing realistic hair motions from multiple synchronized video sequences. To recover hair strands' temporal correspondence, we propose a motion-path analysis algorithm that can robustly track local hair motions in input videos. To ensure the spatial and temporal coherence of the dynamic capture, we formulate the global hair reconstruction as a spacetime optimization problem solved iteratively. Demonstrated using a range of real-world hairstyles driven by different wind conditions and head motions, our approach is able to reconstruct complex hair dynamics matching closely with video recordings both in terms of geometry and motion details.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Hair Capture using Spacetime Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000345855600053"}
