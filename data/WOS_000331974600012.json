The proposed method provides a number of distinctive features beyond previous works on interposer wire testing. First, we target not only catastrophic types of faults (such as stuck-at faults or hard bridging faults), but also parametric types of faults (including both resistive open faults and resistive bridging faults between interposer wires). Second, our method can also be used to characterize the propagation delay across each fault-free interposer wire.", "paper_title": "Parametric Fault Testing and Performance Characterization of Post-Bond Interposer Wires in 2.5-D ICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000331974600012"}
