Differential power analysis (DPA) has been shown to be particularly effective at retrieving secret information stored within an implementation. The design of DPA-resistant systems that are efficient in terms of speed and area poses a significant challenge. All-or-Nothing Transforms are cryptographic transforms, which are currently employed in numerous applications. We examine All-or-Nothing Encryption systems from the DPA perspective. This paper shows that All-or-Nothing cryptosystems, whilst not preventing side-channel leakage, do fundamentally inhibit DPA attacks. Furthermore, we develop extensions to the All-or-Nothing protocol to strengthen the DPA resistance of the cryptosystem, providing a practical alternative to masking countermeasures for symmetric ciphers.", "paper_title": "All-or-Nothing Transforms as a countermeasure to differential side-channel analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000336024300006"}
