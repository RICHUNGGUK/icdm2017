A lack of adequate and sufficient interpretation for content in current methods impedes access to content. This study regards Web content as any content described and published in the format of a markup language such as HTML or XML. In this paper, we will present our Content Model, combining subjective information from the content itself with objective information from people's perceptions of this content, providing an integrated interpretation of a content item. During accessing, a search engine examines the description of a content item, as found in the Content Model, to find matching files. An ontology-based Content Model is developed and applied to the Web environment to enhance Web content accessibility. Results of this study demonstrate that the proposed Content Model provides essential content descriptions for locating, accessing, and interacting with content providers.", "paper_title": "An ontology-based content model for intelligent Web content access services", "paper_id": "WOS:000240951700004"}
