The present model is a more general description of the real world in nature, where both discrete delays and distributed delays are taken into consideration. The parameter uncertainties are assumed to be bounded and laid in a certain interval. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, together with some inequality techniques and stochastic stability theory, some sufficient criteria are driven in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI), which are easily to verify and can be solved by MATLAB. Furthermore, the results obtained in this paper are less conservative and cover more situations compared with the ones published in the literature.", "paper_title": "Stochastic robust stability for neutral-type impulsive interval neural networks with distributed time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000309878400014"}
