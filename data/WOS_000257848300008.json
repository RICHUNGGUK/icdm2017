Based on the fuzzy models of chaotic systems, a fuzzy controller is designed to realize chaotic synchronization. A design criterion of the membership functions of fuzzy controller is proposed to facilitate the stability design towards chaotic synchronization when parameter uncertainties are under consideration. LMI-based stability conditions are derived to guarantee the system stability using Lyapunov-based approach. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the merits of the proposed fuzzy-model-based control approach.", "paper_title": "Chaotic synchronization using fuzzy control approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000257848300008"}
