Computer simulations are promising tools for calculating electron states. Real-space density functional theory (RSDFT) code performs first-principles electronic structure calculations. To obtain higher performance, we applied various optimization techniques to the code: multi-level parallelization, load balance management, sub-mesh/torus allocation, and a message-passing interface library tuned for the K computer. We measured and evaluated the performance of the modified RSDFT code on the K computer. A 5.48 petaflops (PFLOPS) sustained performance was measured for an iteration of a self-consistent field calculation for a 107,292-atom Si nanowire simulation using 82,944 compute nodes, which is 51.67% of the K computer's peak performance of 10.62 PFLOPS. This scale of simulation enables analysis of the behavior of a silicon nanowire with a diameter of 10-20 nm.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of ultra-large-scale first-principles electronic structure calculation code on the K computer", "paper_id": "WOS:000342387600007"}
