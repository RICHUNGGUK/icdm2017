Conventional binary labeling scheme in relevance feedback requires a crisp decision to be made on the relevance of the retrieved images. However, it is inflexible as user interpretation of visual content varies with respect to different information needs and perceptual subjectivity. In addition, users tend to learn from the retrieval results to further refine their information requests. It is, therefore, inadequate to describe the user's fuzzy perception of image similarity with crisp logic. In view of this, we propose a fuzzy relevance feedback approach which enables the user to make a fuzzy judgement. It integrates the user's fuzzy interpretation of visual content into the notion of relevance feedback. An efficient learning approach is proposed using a fuzzy radial basis function (FRBF) network. The network is constructed based on the user's feedbacks. The underlying network parameters are optimized by adopting a gradient-descent training strategy due to its computational efficiency. Experimental results using a database of 10,000 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Content-based image retrieval using fuzzy perceptual feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000244314900001"}
