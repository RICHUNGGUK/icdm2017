We introduce a parameter, called the quantified star size of a query I center dot, which measures how the free variables are spread in I center dot. As usual in database theory, we associate a hypergraph to a query I center dot. We show that for classes of queries for which these associated hypergraphs admit good decompositions, e.g., bounded width generalized hypertree decompositions, bounded quantified star size exactly characterizes the subclasses of hypergraphs for which counting the number of solutions is tractable. In the case of bounded arity, this allows us to fully characterize the classes of hypergraphs for which counting the solutions is tractable. Finally, we also analyze the complexity of computing the quantified star size of a conjunctive query.", "paper_title": "Structural Tractability of Counting of Solutions to Conjunctive Queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000365792200012"}
