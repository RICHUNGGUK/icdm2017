However it is, in practice, employed today in 3G networks to enable also a variety of multimedia services including messaging, streaming video chat and portals. The unification of this variety of services under the same umbrella standard has significance for the design of the Supporting architectures and the applications that run Such services. In this paper we will discuss the current advantages and limitations of the 3G-324M standard in Supporting Such services.", "paper_title": "Beyond 3G video mobile video telephony: The role of 3G-324M in mobile video services", "paper_id": "WOS:000237531600005"}
