This hardware design is based on a heuristic genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed design is more efficient than non-evolutionary designs even for arbitrary response filters. As a byproduct, the paper also presents a novel flow for the complete hardware design of what is termed as an Evolutionary System on Chip (ESoC). With the inclusion of an evolutionary process, the ESoC is a new paradigm in modern System on Chip (SoC) designs. The ESoC methodology could be a very useful structured FPGA/ASIC implementation alternative in many practical applications of FIR filters. (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
