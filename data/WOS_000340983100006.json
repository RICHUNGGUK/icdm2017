Random network coding has been proved to be capable of decreasing the transmission delay in wireless networks. In this paper, we exploit the advancements of integrating network coding technology into the on-demand data dissemination applications. We first consider the adoption of the traditional linear network coding in on-demand data multicast, we then propose a new network coding algorithm which utilizes the correlation exists between received and request data items, and thus reduces the completion delay. The proposed algorithm considers the different receivers' demands roundly in the multicast process. The fairness between different receivers is well considered. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the completion delay for each receiver, and thus reduces the total completion delay of the whole system.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Multicast Strategy for On-Demand Data Dissemination in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000340983100006"}
