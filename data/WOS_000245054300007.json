The neural network was trained using the backpropagation technique. The small structure reduces off line training and processing times. The overall algorithm based on a conventional DTC close loop is simple, and the results are validated through simulation and implementation.", "paper_title": "Application of small neural network based speed estimator in direct torque control of induction motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000245054300007"}
