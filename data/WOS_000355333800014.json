A cost-efficient current-shaping technique for the SC DAC is proposed to relax the OTA slewing requirement. The DAC static and dynamic mismatches are eliminated by a look-up table based digital calibration. With a 1.2 V power supply and a 960 MHz clock, 73.6 dB peak SNR and 76.3 dB DR are measured for a 40 MHz bandwidth. After calibration, the modulator achieves an excellent SFDR of 84.2 dB and a 72.9 dB peak SNDR, with IM3 better than 85 dB. The modulator consumes 69.6 mW power, and occupies 0.28 mm(2) area in 90 nm CMOS.", "paper_title": "A 40 MHz-BW 12-bit continuous-time a dagger I pound modulator with digital calibration and 84.2 dB-SFDR in 90 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000355333800014"}
