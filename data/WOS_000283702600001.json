In this paper, we investigate the growth of size and complexity of connected components of a random hypergraph process. We prove that the expected number of creations of l-components during a random hypergraph process tends to 1 as b is fixed and l tends to infinity with the total number of vertices n while remaining l = o(n(1/3)). We also show that the expected number of vertices that ever belong to an l-component is similar to 12(1/3)l(1/3)n(2/3)(b - 1)(-1/3). We prove that the expected number of times hypertrees are swallowed by l-components is similar to 2(1/3)3(-1/3)n(1/3)l(-1/3)(b - 1)(-5/3). It follows that with high probability the largest l-component during the process is of size of order O(l(1/3)n(2/3)(b - 1)(-1/3)). Our results give insight into the size of giant components inside the phase transition of random hypergraphs and generalize previous results about graphs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
