In the approach, the morphological shared-weight neural network (MSNN) is used to classify image pixels on roads into vehicle targets and non-vehicle targets, and a morphological preprocessing algorithm is developed to identify candidate vehicle pixels. Experiments on 0.6 meter resolution QuickBird panchromatic data are reported in this paper. The experimental results show that the MSNN has a good detection performance.", "paper_title": "Morphological neural network approach for vehicle detection from high resolution satellite imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100011"}
