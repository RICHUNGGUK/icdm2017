Both system modes can improve the bandwidth efficiency by loading more data bits per symbol block. The first system mode is the hybrid CSOK (HCSOK) mode, which combines phase shift keying (PSK) or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulation symbol with the CSOK symbol, for example, the important hybrid quadrature PSK (QPSK)-CSOK case. The second is the quadrature CSOK (QCSOK) mode that transmits two parallel binary phase shift keying (BPSK)-CSOK branches at the same time. For both modes, maximum likelihood receivers are derived and simplified, leading to efficient fast Fourier transform-based structures for maximum ratio combining and cyclic-code correlation. Theoretical bit error rate (BER) analysis is conducted for the hybrid QPSK-CSOK case. Simulation results demonstrate that both the two system modes considerably outperforms the traditional Walsh-coded MCSS system in terms of bandwidth efficiency, PAPR, BER, and antijamming capability. Furthermore, in indoor channel, QCSOK performs slightly worse than QPSK-CSOK, but it has almost twice the data rate when the code length is large.
