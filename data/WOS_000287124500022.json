However, due to the variations of electrical parameters, the inaccuracy of estimated fluxes will cause the performance degradation of speed control. In this paper, a gain-scheduled flux observer is provided subject to parameter variations. As for the speed and flux tracking, an input-output linearization controller is proposed in the presence of flux estimation error and unknown load torque. To further improve the control performance, both the H(infinity) performance index and pole assignment are considered as the design specifications. The derivations of the observer and controllers are in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a DSP/FPGA based experimental platform is set up to evaluate the feasibility of proposed control scheme. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed scheme works well in a wide speed-range. It also shows that the gain-scheduled flux estimation and input-output linearization controller can provide better tracking performance and robustness.", "paper_title": "ROBUST PERFORMANCE CONTROL OF VECTOR-CONTROLLED INDUCTION MOTORS WITH GAIN-SCHEDULED ESTIMATION AND INPUT-OUTPUT LINEARIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500022"}
