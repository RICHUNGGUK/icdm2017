Healthcare professionals need to utilize intensive care resources effectively. Mortality prediction models help physicians decide which patients require intensive care the most and which do not. The Simplified Acute Physiology System 2nd version (SAPS II) is one of the most popular mortality scoring systems currently available. This study retrospectively collected data on 496 patients admitted to intensive care units from year 2000 to 2001. The average patient age was 59.96 +/- 1.83 years old and 23.8% of patients died before discharge. We used these data as training data and constructed an exponential Bayesian mortality prediction model by combining BSM (Bayesian statistical model) and GA (genetic algorithm). The optimal weights and the parameters were determined with GA. Furthermore, we prospectively collected data on 142 patients for testing the new model. The average patient age for this group was 57.80 +/- 3.33 years old and 21.8% patients died before discharge. The mortality prediction power of the new model was better than SAPS II (p < 0.001). The new model combining BSM and GA can manage both binary data and continuous data. The mortality rate is predicted to be high if the patient's Glasgow coma score is less than 5.
