This method first obtains an approximate representation of the test sample by solving a linear system in which the test sample is assumed to be a linear combination of all the original training samples. Then it replaces the test sample by its approximate representation and decomposes the approximate representation as a weighted sum of all the training samples. The proposed method calculates the reconstruction error of the approximate representation from the weighted sum of the training samples from each class. The method also computes the normalized distance between the test sample and each class. Finally, the method integrates the reconstruction error and normalized distance between the test sample and a class to form the matching score and assigns the test sample into the class that has the smallest matching score. Experimental results on the palmprint databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "A novel classification method for palmprint recognition based on reconstruction error and normalized distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000323278500006"}
