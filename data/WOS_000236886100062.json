Equality was previously known when forbidding K-4 as a minor, while an infinite number of weighted digraphs show that planarity does not guarantee equality. The result also improves upon results known for Woodall's Conjecture and the Edmonds-Giles Conjecture for packing dijoins. Our proof uses Wagner's characterization of planar 3-connected graphs that do not have K-5 - e as a minor.", "paper_title": "Packing dicycle covers in planar graphs with no K-5-e minor", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100062"}
