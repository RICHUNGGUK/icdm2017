By applying the concept of entropy power, a lower bound of signal-to-noise ratio has been achieved which is necessary for stabilisation of a system with the limited channel input power constraint. Moreover, the problem of minimising the influence of a stochastic disturbance on the output has also been investigated, and the controller design method has been obtained by using Youla parameterisation and H-2 theory. It is shown that the minimum variance of the system output depends not only on the disturbance variance, noise variance and unstable poles, but also on the non-minimum phase zeros and channel parameter. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "Disturbance attenuation over a first-order moving average Gaussian noise channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000357938700001"}
