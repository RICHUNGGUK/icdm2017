We pursue one possible approach to this question. We show that (i) cutfree consistency for finitely axiomatized theories can be uniquely characterized modulo EA-provable equivalence and (ii) consistency for finitely axiomatized sequential theories can be uniquely characterized modulo EA-provable equivalence. The case of infinitely axiomatized RE theories is more delicate. We carefully discuss this in the article.", "paper_title": "Can We Make the Second Incompleteness Theorem Coordinate Free?", "paper_id": "WOS:000293303900002"}
