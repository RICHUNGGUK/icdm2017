In this paper, we present a novel approach based on fuzzy logic systems to analyze the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. We demonstrate that a type-2 fuzzy membership function (MF), i.e., a Gaussian MF with uncertain standard deviation (std) is most appropriate to model a single node lifetime in wireless sensor networks. In our research, we study two basic sensor placement schemes: square-grid and hex-grid. Two fuzzy logic systems (FLSs): a singleton type-1 FLS and an interval type-2 FLS are designed to perform lifetime estimation of the sensor network. We compare our fuzzy approach with other nonfuzzy schemes in previous papers. Simulation results show that FLS offers a feasible method to analyze and estimate the sensor network lifetime and the interval type-2 FLS in which the antecedent and the consequent membership functions are modeled as Gaussian with uncertain std outperforms the singleton type-1 FLS and the nonfuzzy schemes.", "paper_title": "Wireless sensor network lifetime analysis using interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500012"}
