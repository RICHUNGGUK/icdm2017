It contains information collected from studies in the literature that report the use of biochemical methods for the determination of the topology of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins. Transmembrane protein topology is highly important in order to understand their function and ExTopoDB provides an up to date, complete and comprehensive dataset of experimentally determined topologies of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins. Topological information is combined with transmembrane topology prediction resulting in more reliable topological models.", "paper_title": "ExTopoDB: a database of experimentally derived topological models of transmembrane proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000282170000030"}
