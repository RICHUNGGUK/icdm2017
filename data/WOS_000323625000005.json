There is growing evidence that there may be fundamental differences between the expressions depicted in such stimuli and the emotional expressions present in everyday life. Affective computing, with its pragmatic emphasis on realism, needs examples of natural emotion. This paper describes a unique database containing recordings of mild to moderate emotionally colored responses to a series of laboratory-based emotion induction tasks. The recordings are accompanied by information on self-report of emotion and intensity, continuous trace-style ratings of valence and intensity, the sex of the participant, the sex of the experimenter, the active or passive nature of the induction task, and it gives researchers the opportunity to compare expressions from people from more than one culture.", "paper_title": "The Belfast Induced Natural Emotion Database", "paper_id": "WOS:000323625000005"}
