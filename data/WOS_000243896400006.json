Two three-party QKDPs, one with implicit user authentication and the other with explicit mutual authentication, are proposed to demonstrate the merits of the new combination, which include the following: 1) security against such attacks as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping and replay, 2) efficiency is improved as the proposed protocols contain the fewest number of communication rounds among existing QKDPs, and 3) two parties can share and use a long-term secret ( repeatedly). To prove the security of the proposed schemes, this work also presents a new primitive called the Unbiased-Chosen Basis (UCB) assumption.", "paper_title": "Provably secure three-party authenticated quantum key distribution protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000243896400006"}
