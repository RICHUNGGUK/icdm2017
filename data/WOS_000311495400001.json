Its complexity is shown to be lower than that of standard techniques, when the degree of the polynomial is large enough compared to the field characteristic. Specifically, if n is the degree of the polynomiaI, the asymptotic complexity is shown to be O(root n), versus O(n) of classical algorithms. Applications to the syndrome computation in the decoding of Reed-Solomon codes are highlighted.", "paper_title": "Polynomial evaluation over finite fields: new algorithms and complexity bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000311495400001"}
