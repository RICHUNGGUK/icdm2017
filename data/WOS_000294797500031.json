A closed-form expression of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) has been derived to illustrate the impact of carrier frequency offset (CFO) on the MOE detector. It shows that the performance degradation of the MOE detector may result from an inaccurate constraint vector. The major idea in this paper is to perform adaptive data processing for amending the impaired constraint vector so as to enhance the tolerance of the MOE detector toward the CFO effect, and thus provide the system robustness. Besides this, the subspace technique is further employed to eliminate the inter-carrier interference (ICI). It is shown that the ameliorated MOE detectors diminish not only the system sensitivity to CFO but also the finite sample effect significantly. Theoretical and numerical results have been presented to verify that the proposed detector substantially outperforms the conventional MC-CDMA detectors.", "paper_title": "MELIORATED MOE DETECTORS WITH CFO ESTIMATION FOR MC-CDMA SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500031"}
