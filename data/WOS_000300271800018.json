Studying two real-world traces, we find that the pairwise contact patterns have three characteristics. First, human contact patterns are influenced by daily and weekly cycles of activity. Second short time intervals with intensive contact event (bursts) are separated by long periods with few contact events. Third, the pairwise contact process exhibits long range dependence. We introduce a Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP) as a flexible model for pairwise contact process exhibiting both regular structure and irregular bursts of activity. Using standard statistical techniques, we demonstrate that the proposed model is consistent with the empirical data. Our work has significant implication for mobility modeling and performance analysis in human contact networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
