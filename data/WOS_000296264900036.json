These programming models have historically targeted coarse-grained applications with natural locality such as those found in a variety of scientific simulations of the physical world. Fine-grained, irregular, and unstructured applications such as those found in biology, social network analysis, and graph theory are less well supported. We propose Active Pebbles, a programming model which allows these applications to be expressed naturally; an accompanying execution model ensures performance and scalability.", "paper_title": "Active Pebbles: A Programming Model For Highly Parallel Fine-Grained Data-Driven Computations", "paper_id": "WOS:000296264900036"}
