The numerical model is based upon the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured meshes using the artificial compressibility approach. An ALE formulation is adopted and the equations are discretized using a cell vertex finite volume method. The formulation ensures the satisfaction of the geometric conservation law when the mesh is allowed to move. An implicit time discretization is adopted and a dual time approach is employed. Explicit relaxation is used for the sub-iterations, with multigrid acceleration. For moving geometries, the mesh is deformed by adopting a spring analogy, combined with a wall distance function approach. The numerical procedure is validated on a standard problem and is then used for the simulation of flow over a flexible fish-like body.
