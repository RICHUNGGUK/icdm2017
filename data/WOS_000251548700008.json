It possesses two parameters, and each equation of it has one quadratic cross product term. Some basic properties of it are studied. The dynamic behaviors of it are analyzed by the Lyapunov exponent (LE) spectrum, bifurcation diagrams, phase portraits, and Poincare sections. The system has larger hyperchaotic region. When it is hyperchaotic, the two positive LE are both large and they are both larger than I if the system parameters are taken appropriately.", "paper_title": "The generation and analysis of a new four-dimensional hyperchaotic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000251548700008"}
