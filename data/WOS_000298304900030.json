First we introduce a denoising module, where the edge-preserving filter is adopted. This strategy not only filters off the noise but also preserves most of the original image signal. A confidence-weighted optimization module is then proposed to fit the linear phase plane discriminately and to achieve sub-pixel shifts. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of our modules and improvements of the accuracy and robustness against noise compared to other sub-pixel phase correlation methods in the Fourier domain.", "paper_title": "High-Accuracy Sub-Pixel Registration for Noisy Images Based on Phase Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304900030"}
