LOCHDET generates a density tree for each potential cluster according to its local density distribution. Each cluster is regarded as a tight coupling structure. Those \"closer\" clusters are merged if some conditions are satisfied. In order to reduce the cost time, a local computing technology is introduced. LOCHDET has a wide range of parameter settings, preferable accuracy in discovering clusters with arbitrary shape, good ability of processing noise data sets and weak sensitivity to input parameters by generalizing density-based, hierarchical, and locality-based methods. The results of our experiments confirm these mentioned above.", "paper_title": "A Local Computing-based Hierarchical clustering algorithm building Density Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400080"}
