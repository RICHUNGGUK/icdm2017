Retrieving desired files efficiently and trustworthily is critical in such a large and jumbled system. However, the issues of efficient searching and trustworthy searching have only been studied separately. Simply combining the methods to achieve the two goals doubles system overhead. In this paper, we first study trace data from Facebook and BitTorrent. Guided by the observations, we propose a system that integrates a social network into a P2P network, named Social-P2P, for simultaneous efficient and trustworthy file sharing. It incorporates three mechanisms: (1) interest/trust-based structure, (2) interest/trust-based file searching, and (3) trust relationship adjustment. By exploiting the social interests and relationships in the social network, the interest/trust-based structure groups common-multi-interest nodes into a cluster and further connects socially close nodes within a cluster. The comparably stable nodes in each cluster form a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for inter-cluster file searching. In the interest/trust-based file searching mechanism, a file query is forwarded to the cluster of the file by the DHT routing first. Then, it is forwarded along constructed connections within a cluster, which achieves high hit rate and reliable routing. Moreover, sharing files among socially close friends discourages nodes from providing faulty files because people are unlikely to risk their reputation in the real-world. In the trust relationship adjustment mechanism, each node in a routing path adaptively decreases its trust on the node that has forwarded a faulty file in order to avoid routing queries towards misbehaving nodes later on. We conducted extensive trace-driven simulations and implemented a prototype on PlanetLab. Experimental results show that Social-P2P achieves highly efficient and trustworthy file sharing compared to current file sharing systems and trust management systems.", "paper_title": "Social-P2P: An Online Social Network Based P2P File Sharing System", "paper_id": "WOS:000362791400020"}
