A graph G is k-edge-fault Hamiltonian-connected if it remains Hamiltonian-connected after deleting at most k edges. This study shows that the conditional edge-fault Hamiltonicity of the Cartesian product network G x H can be efficiently evaluated given two graphs G and H that are edge-fault Hamilton-connected and conditional edge-fault Hamiltonian. This study uses the result to evaluate the conditional edge-fault Hamiltonicity of two multiprocessor systems, the generalized hypercubes and the nearest neighbor mesh hypercubes, both of which belong to Cartesian product networks.", "paper_title": "Conditional Edge-Fault Hamiltonicity of Cartesian Product Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000323503500004"}
