Aim of the CLEF track is to explore the use of both text and content-based retrieval methods for cross-language image retrieval. Four tasks were offered in ImageCLEF: ad-hoe retrieval from an historic photographic collection, ad-hoc retrieval from a medical collection, an automatic image annotation task, and a user-centered (interactive) evaluation task. 24 research groups from a variety of backgrounds and nationalities (14 countries) participated in ImageCLEF. This paper presents the ImageCLEF tasks, submissions from participating groups and a summary of the main findings.", "paper_title": "The CLEF 2005 cross-language image retrieval track", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000060"}
