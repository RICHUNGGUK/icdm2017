The optimal velocity function was improved more realistically in describing the motion process of vehicles moving on a road with signals. Based on the improved model, we derived the mathematical expression for energy dissipation. Simulations are conducted to verify the energy dissipation laws in traffic flow with signals. Numerical results show that energy dissipation (rate) can be affected not only by traffic density, but also traffic signal control parameters: split and cycle.", "paper_title": "An original traffic flow model with signal effect for energy dissipation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336487700003"}
