The procedure uses block combined approximations with shifting to simultaneously calculate some eigenpairs of modified structures. The triangular factorizations of shifted stiffness matrices generated in initial vibration analysis are utilized to calculate the higher modes. The proposed method is based on matrix-matrix operations with Level-3 BIAS and can provide very fast development of approximate solutions of high quality for frequencies and associated modal shapes of the modified structure. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the vibration reanalysis algorithm and the accuracy of the approximate solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
