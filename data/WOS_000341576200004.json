We apply a combinatorial preprocessing, based on the Frank Tardos algorithm for k-outconnectivity, to transform any input into an instance such that the iterative rounding method gives a 2-approximation guarantee. This is the first constant factor approximation algorithm even in the asymptotic setting of the problem, that is, the restriction to instances where the number of nodes is lower bounded by a function of k.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATING MINIMUM-COST k-NODE CONNECTED SUBGRAPHS VIA INDEPENDENCE-FREE GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000341576200004"}
