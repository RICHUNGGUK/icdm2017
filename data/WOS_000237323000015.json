The controller stabilizes the plant in the presence of delays, sampling, and packet dropouts in the (sensor) measurement and actuation channels. We consider two types of control units: anticipative and non-anticipative. In both cases the closed-loop system with delays, sampling, and packet dropouts can be modeled as delay differential equations. Our method of designing the controller parameters is based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem and a linear cone complementarity algorithm. Numerical examples show that the proposed design method is significantly better than the existing ones.", "paper_title": "Anticipative and non-anticipative controller design for network control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237323000015"}
