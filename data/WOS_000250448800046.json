This correspondence introduces the notion of fountain capacity for arbitrary channels. In contrast to the conventional definition of rate, in the fountain setup the definition of rate penalizes the reception of symbols by the receiver rather than their transmission. Fountain capacity measures the maximum rate compatible with reliable reception regardless of the erasure pattern. We show that fountain capacity and Shannon capacity are equal for stationary memoryless; channels. In contrast, Shannon capacity may exceed fountain capacity if the channel has memory or is not stationary.", "paper_title": "Fountain capacity", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800046"}
