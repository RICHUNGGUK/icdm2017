Such an objective may be considered as a way to lead learners to consider building and maintaining a shared organization, and/or as a way to provide a basis for monitoring learners' organizational process. Work presented in this paper highlights the interest of Bardram's model of collective work to inspire design principles of interfaces supporting learners in making their organization explicit. Of particular importance are the facts that organization is somewhat reified (here, as an array), organization and execution interfaces are similar and connected, and learners are given flexibility in enacting partial organizations or adapting their constructions in context.", "paper_title": "Interfaces Leading Groups of Learners to Make Their Shared Problem-Solving Organization Explicit", "paper_id": "WOS:000308362400003"}
