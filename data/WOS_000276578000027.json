The design is a combination between a direct adaptive control algorithm and multiple model switching, and the mu-modification is introduced in the model reference control architecture. The main features of the proposed control strategy are the reliability and simplicity in tracking against actuator faults. By Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, the stability of overall system is guaranteed and the boundness of all signals is ensured. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant control scheme.", "paper_title": "DELAY-DEPENDENT ADAPTIVE RECONFIGURATION CONTROL IN THE PRESENCE OF INPUT SATURATION AND ACTUATOR FAULTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000027"}
