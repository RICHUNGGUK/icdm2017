They satisfy the property that, if a hypergraph is gamma-acyclic then it is beta-acyclic, and the reverse is false. We give some new properties concerning these notions. First we show that we can strictly insert another notion of acyclicity between them, namely the fact of having a join tree with disjoint branches. And if we add a condition on the existence of such a join tree, we obtain a notion equivalent to gamma-acyclicity. Then we present two characterizations, consisting in applying successively a small set of rules, deciding gamma and beta-acyclicity respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
