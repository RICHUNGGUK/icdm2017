The need for a faster schedulability tests becomes more prominent when it applies to online systems, where processor time is a sacred resource and it is of central importance to assign processor to execute tasks instead of determining system schedulability. Under fixed priority nonpreemptive real-time systems, current schedulability tests (in exact form) can be divided into: response time based tests, and scheduling points tests. To the best of our knowledge, no comparative study of these test to date has ever been presented. The aim of this work is to assist the system designers in the process of selecting a suitable technique from the existing literature after knowing the pros and cons associated with these tests. We highlight the mechanism behind the feasibility tests, theoretically and experimentally. Our experimental results show that response time based tests are faster than scheduling points tests, which make the response time based tests an excellent choice for online systems.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of rate monotonic schedulability tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000299509500016"}
