This algorithm uses Lanczos vectors to accurately approximate the major eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the original data. The major advantage of the proposed whitening approach is its low computational cost when compared with that of the truncated ED. This gain comes without sacrificing accuracy, as illustrated with an experiment of whitening a high-dimensional fMRI data set.", "paper_title": "Prewhitening High-Dimensional fMRI Data Sets Without Eigendecomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000334027800003"}
