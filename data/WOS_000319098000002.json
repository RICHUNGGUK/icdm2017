The developed method for estimating business process cycle time is based on M/Hn/1/infinity queuing model and the joint distribution theory of random variables. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by comparison with the existing methods with case studies. The results have shown that the proposed method can provide a more accurate estimation than conventional approaches. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
