Methods: Design research, formal logic. Results: The method suggests five steps: analyze the prevailing documentation infrastructure, provide terminology management system (TMS), provide documentation management system (DMS), plan the logical architecture, provide all necessary tools. Conclusions: The era of eHealth enables cooperative care and collaborative documentation. This can only be efficient if a multiple use and shared entry of data is realized. The task of the medical informatics community is to plan these environments systematically especially in complex environments which are enabled by emerging technologies.
