Traditional ad-hoc routing protocols have been proposed to find the shortest path for communication between a source and a destination, but they cannot effectively adapt to time-varying radio links and network environment of MANETs. In this paper, by considering radio propagation effect on signal strength, wireless radio link reliability is incorporated with hop count to discover multiple short and reliable source-destination paths. Here, the received signal strength between adjacent nodes is predicted by a measurement-based mobile-to-mobile radio propagation model. Moreover, the packets are dynamically routed over the most reliable path by using an up-to-date link-state collection mechanism. The resulting protocol is referred to as Ad-hoc On-demand Multipath Distance and Link-Reliability Vector (AOMDRV) routing protocol. The performance of AOMDRV protocol is compared with the well-known Ad-hoc On-demand Multi path Distance Vector (AOMDV) routing protocol and other related works. Simulation shows that AOMDRV has better results in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay and packet delivery rate.", "paper_title": "Ad-Hoc On-demand Multipath Distance and Link Reliability Vector Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000306150100010"}
