This paper presents a frame-based recovery technique of a corrupted video file using the specifications of a codec used to encode the video data. A video frame is the minimum meaningful unit of video data. Many existing approaches attempt to recover a video file using file structure rather than frame structure. In case a target video file is severely fragmented or even has a portion of video overwritten by other video content, however, video file recovery of existing approaches may fail. The proposed approach addresses how to extract video frames from a portion of video to be restored as well as how to connect extracted video frames together according to the codec specifications. Experiment results show that the proposed technique successfully restores fragmented video files regardless of the amount of fragmentations. For a corrupted video file containing overwritten segments, the proposed technique can recover most of the video content in non-overwritten segments of the video file.", "paper_title": "Frame-Based Recovery of Corrupted Video Files Using Video Codec Specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000329581800003"}
