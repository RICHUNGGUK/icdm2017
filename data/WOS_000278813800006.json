In the first phase, suitable noise detectors are used for identifying image pixels contaminated by noise. Then, in the second phase, based upon the information on the location of noise-free pixels, images are deblurred and denoised simultaneously. For efficiency reasons, in the second phase a superlinearly convergent algorithm based upon Fenchel-duality and inexact semismooth Newton techniques is utilized for solving the associated variational problem. Numerical results prove the new method to be a significantly advance over several state-of-the-art techniques with respect to restoration capability and computational efficiency.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Two-Phase L-1-TV Method for Restoring Blurred Images with Impulse Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000278813800006"}
