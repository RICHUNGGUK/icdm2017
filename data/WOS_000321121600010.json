In 2007, Yuen et al. proposed a convertible undeniable signature without random oracles in pairings. However, it is recently shown that Yuen et al.'s scheme is not invisible for the standard definition of invisibility. In this paper, we propose a new improvement by using extended Euclidean algorithm that can overcome the visibility attack. The proposed scheme has been evaluated based on computation and communication complexities and the performance comparisons of Yuen et al.'s scheme and various convertible undeniable signature schemes are provided. Moreover, it has been observed that the proposed algorithm reduces the computation and communication times significantly.", "paper_title": "Secure Convertible Undeniable Signature Scheme Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm without Random Oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000321121600010"}
