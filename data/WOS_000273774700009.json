Furthermore, for most internal nets of state-of-the-art ICs, external speed testing is not possible for the newest technologies. In this paper, on-chip testing for SI faults in digital interconnect signals, using built-in high speed monitors, is proposed. A coherent sampling scheme is used to capture the signal information. Two monitors to test SI violations are proposed: one for undershoots at the high logic level and the other for overshoots at the low logic level. The monitors are capable of detecting small noise pulses and have been extended to test sequentially more than one signal. The cost of the proposed strategy is analyzed in terms of area, delay penalization, and test time. The effects of clock jitter and process variations are analyzed. Experimental results obtained in designed and fabricated circuits show the feasibility of the proposed testing strategy. A good agreement appears between the theoretical analysis, simulation results, and the experimental measurements.", "paper_title": "Built-In Sensor for Signal Integrity Faults in Digital Interconnect Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000273774700009"}
