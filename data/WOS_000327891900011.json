One of our results says that there is a convex body such that the set of radii of all circles holding has infinitely many components. Another result says that the circle is unique in the sense that every frame different from the circle holds a convex body (actually a tetrahedron) so that every nontrivial rigid motion of intersects the frame.", "paper_title": "Holding Circles and Fixing Frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000327891900011"}
