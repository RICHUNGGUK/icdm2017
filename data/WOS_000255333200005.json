It provides many of the functions available in MPI, including point-to-point and global communication. The main restriction of the library is that it was designed to work over Bluetooth piconets. Piconet based networks provide for a maximum of eight devices connected together simultaneously. This limits the libraries usefulness for parallel computing. A solution to solve this problem is presented that provides the same functionality as the original Mobile MPI library, but implemented over a Bluetooth scatternet. A scatternet may be defined as a number of piconets interconnected by common node(s). An outline of the scatternet design is explained and its major components discussed.", "paper_title": "Mobile message passing using a scatternet framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333200005"}
