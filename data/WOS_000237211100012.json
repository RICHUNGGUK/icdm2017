Trust management, although still in its first steps, seems capable of dealing with such problems. In this paper we present an integrated trust management framework for self-organized networks. In addition, starting from our experience with the presented framework, we indicate and discuss important research challenges (among them interoperability and integration issues) for the future evolution of the trust-based autonomic computing paradigm. We argue that ontologies can address many of these issues through the semantics they convey.", "paper_title": "Trust management issues for ad hoe and self-organized networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237211100012"}
