This approach estimates the likelihood of each fault in the faults set and removes these faults with less likelihood. By this approach we also can determine whether an event is spurious or not. Simulation shows that this approach can get a high accuracy and fast speed of correlation even if the network has a high event loss and spuriousness.", "paper_title": "A network event correlation algorithm based on fault filtration", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500096"}
