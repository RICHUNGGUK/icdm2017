These representations comprise several million triangles and capture skin detail down to the pores. Despite their high level of realism, their size makes visualization difficult and real-time mesh manipulation infeasible. The premise of our methodology is to first remove the detail to obtain low resolution shape information, then perform shape-based exaggeration on a low resolution model and finally reapply the detail onto the exaggeration to recover the original resolution. We also present the results of applying this methodology to a small set of faces.", "paper_title": "Shape-based detail-preserving exaggeration of extremely accurate 3D faces", "paper_id": "WOS:000239839300004"}
