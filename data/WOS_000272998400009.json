We introduce the concept of time-frequency description of circuit currents using wavelets, and use that to set up an optimization framework that finds the worst-case supply/ground voltage fluctuations. This framework allows for the quick determination of the impact of either the package or the die on the worst-case behavior, which enables their codesign. This approach has been applied to an industrial microprocessor design, resulting in realistic and nonobvious worst-case waveforms.", "paper_title": "Verification and Codesign of the Package and Die Power Delivery System Using Wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000272998400009"}
