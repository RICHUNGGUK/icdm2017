It is found that under some invariant assumptions, for many structural optimization problems that can be formulated as convex programs, there exists at least one symmetric global optimal solution if the prescribed loading and support conditions are symmetric. Furthermore, for some specific non-convex cases, a weaker result is also presented.", "paper_title": "Some symmetry results for optimal solutions in structural optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000310426800002"}
