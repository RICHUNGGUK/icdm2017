BGF is Turing universal as it supports a finite precise encoding of Random Access Machines, which comprise a well-known Turing powerful formalism Then we prove that the Turing universality of BGF derives from the interplay between the molecular primitives of association and dissociation In fact, the elimination from BGF of the primitives already present in CGF does not reduce the computational strength of the process algebra, but if either association or dissociation is removed, BGF ceases to be Turing complete", "paper_title": "Turing universality of the Biochemical Ground Form", "paper_id": "WOS:000276134200003"}
