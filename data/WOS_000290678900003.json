The aim of this article is to present an approach for teaching the concept of electric machines laboratory using specially designed exercises that can be done using MATLAB-SIMULINK. This article present a MATLAB based technology to simulate Ward Leonard test set to analyze performance characteristics of induction motor. Evaluation of the simulation with more than 40 students is very positive in terms of their developing confidence in and understanding the test and theoretical concepts. By using the simulator, four groups of students are tested via designed question sheets to determine the effectiveness of the method for teaching induction motor performance concept.
