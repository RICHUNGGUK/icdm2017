This paper proposes a color recognition method which is robust to illumination change. A color space of Cb/Y and Cr/Y is introduced where Cb and Cr are color difference and Y is intensity of YCbCr color space. This color space is not affected by the change of the brightness of illumination. And a method to update clusters of color table is proposed. The method can cope with the change of the color of illumination. Experiments show that the proposed method can recognize color more robustly for illumination change. RoboCup four legged robot league is chosen as the research platform.", "paper_title": "Improvement of color recognition using colored objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100051"}
