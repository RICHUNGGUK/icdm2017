By the utilization of ground actions variable binding constraints can be eliminated from partial plans, then all the constraints needed to be handled are temporal constraints, which are maintained in a revised simple temporal constraint network (r-STN) structure. The exact scheduling of plan returned by planning phase is calculated by a linear programming module. By exploiting incremental algorithms the efficiency of LP-TPOP can be further improved. LP-TPOP is proved to be sound and complete.", "paper_title": "LP-TPOP: Integrating planning and scheduling through constraint programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500092"}
