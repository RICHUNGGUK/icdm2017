In this case, the design space to be considered is infinite, even when the solution is restricted to software that meets the requirements. In this paper we propose the use of model checking (MC) techniques to automatically synthesize controllers. Given a goal in the evolution of a plant, MC can be used to search for acceptable software controllers that enable the plant to evolve as desired. We also develop a realistic application in the context of a joint project with a major water reservoir management company. This application generates controllers for dam management during flood seasons. The controllers give the proper orders (open or close the outflow elements) at precise times in order to avoid disasters and to preserve the water level in the dam.
