Fluid-Structure Interaction problems and free-surface flows solved by a front-tracking approach are two such examples. Objective: In this paper, we address the numerical solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on deforming domains using the finite-element (FE) method and an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation. Method: The proposed formulation incorporates the ALE mapping into the finite-element method in a natural and straightforward manner. It allows the use of any time integrator that can be expressed as a finite-difference in time and maintains the integrators fixed grid convergence rate on ALE deforming grids. Hence, popular time integrators (implicit backward Euler, Gear, BDF, Runge-Kutta, etc.) can be applied directly to moving grid simulations without necessitating any modification or adjustment to the code. Results: Using a manufactured solution, we present thorough time stepsize refinement studies. Results are reported for two families of time-stepping procedures: the implicit Backward Differentiation Formulas (multi-step methods of order 1-5) and the Implicit (Radau IIA) Runge-Kutta methods (one-step methods of order 1,3 and 5). Conclusion: The proposed FE/ALE formulation preserves the fixed-grid orders of accuracy of time-stepping procedures on 3D moving grids. Hence, three-dimensional FE/ALE simulations can be performed with highly accurate time integrators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
