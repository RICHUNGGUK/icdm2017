When the regressors and errors of the models are serially and contemporaneously correlated, our test compares favourably with the Sup LM test proposed by Gonzalo and Pitarakis. Indeed, shortcomings of the former motivated the development of our test. The small sample performance of the bootstrap test is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations, and the results show that the test performs better than the Sup LM test. (C) 2007 IMACS.
