Faced with a growing concern about the server energy expenditure and the climate change, both industry and academia start to show high interest in computing systems powered by renewable energy sources. Existing proposals on this issue mainly focus on optimizing resource utilization or workload performance. The key supporting hardware structures for cross-layer power management and emergency handling mechanisms are often left unexplored. This paper presents GreenPod, a research framework for exploring scalable and dependable renewable power management in datacenters. An important feature of GreenPod is that it enables joint management of server power supplies and virtualized server workloads. Its interactive communication portal between servers and power supplies allows datacenter operators to perform real-time renewable energy driven load migration and power emergency handling. Based on our system prototype, we discuss an important topic: virtual machine (VM) workloads survival when facing extended utility outage and insufficient onsite renewable power budget. We show that whether a VM can survive depends on the operating frequencies and workload characteristics. The proposed framework can greatly encourage and facilitate innovative research in dependable green computing.", "paper_title": "Towards Automated Provisioning and Emergency Handling in Renewable Energy Powered Datacenters", "paper_id": "WOS:000339302600007"}
