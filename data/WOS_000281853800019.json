We formulate the problem of assigning colours in the rendered image as an energy minimization, computed using graph cut on the image grid. The terms of this energy come from two sources: appearance (shading) and geometry (depth and curvature). Our contributions are in the use of geometric information in determining colours, and how this information is incorporated into a graph cut approach. This optimization yields boundaries between black and white regions that tend towards being shorter and to run along geometric features like creases. We show a range of results, and demonstrate that this approach produces more coherent images than simpler approaches that make local decisions when assigning colours, or that do not use geometry.", "paper_title": "Binary Shading Using Appearance and Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000281853800019"}
