The formulation is based on the least-squares variational principle, which is an alternative approach to the mixed weak form finite element models. The mixed least-squares finite element model considers the first-order shear deformation theory with generalized displacements and stress resultants as independent variables. Specifically, the mixed model is developed using equal-order C-0 Lagrange interpolation functions of high p-levels along with full integration. This mixed least-squares-based discrete model yields a symmetric and positive-definite system of algebraic equations. The predictive capability of the proposed model is demonstrated by numerical examples of the static analysis of four laminated composite plates, with different boundary conditions and various side-to-thickness ratios. Particularly, the mixed least-squares model with high-order interpolation functions is shown to be insensitive to shear-locking. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
