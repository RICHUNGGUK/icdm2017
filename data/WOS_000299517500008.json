The final simulation results verify that the symbol error probability (SEP) performance, the immunity to channel estimation errors and the algorithm convergence rate are superior to that of the conventional V-BLAST detection algorithm when channel estimation errors exist.", "paper_title": "A novel adaptive V-BLAST algorithm based on subspace tracking and Hermitian matrix perturbation theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000299517500008"}
