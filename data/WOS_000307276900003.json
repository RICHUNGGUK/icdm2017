The results show that the -N-3 or -NHNH2 group plays a very important role in increasing the HOF values of the derivatives. Among these series, the SFS derivatives have lower energy gaps, while the TFT derivatives have higher ones. Incorporation of the -NH2 group into the FSF, SFS, STS, or FTF ring is favorable for enhancing its thermal stability, whereas the substitution of the -NHNH2 group could increase the thermal stability of the TST, SFS, STS, or FTF ring. The calculated detonation properties indicate that the -NO2 or -NF2 is very helpful for enhancing the detonation performance for these derivatives. Considering the detonation performance and thermal stability, six derivatives may be regarded as promising candidates of high-energy density materials (HEDMs). These results provide basic information for the molecular design of novel HEDMs.", "paper_title": "Characterization of nitrogen-bridged 1,2,4,5-tetrazine-, furazan-, and 1H-tetrazole-based polyheterocyclic compounds: heats of formation, thermal stability, and detonation properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000307276900003"}
