The hierarchical decomposition as a pervasive method to deal with undesirable computation allows for reduced computation, and provides solutions for larger and more complicated problems. However, there is a necessity for research efforts in the arrangement of local operational performance criteria to optimize the overall performance of a whole system. This paper uses the method described in our previous works on decision making based on simulated computed policy functions in a multiagent system. We propose that a multiagent system design for efficient control with hierarchical representation is closely related to agent modeling features. Considering the individual and social criteria while retaining the benefits of hierarchical coordination among agents, is the main challenge of this paper. An experimental study with a game model shows that systems, which is more sensitive in terms of computational resources, can take advantages of hierarchical control design, where individual and social criteria play significant role in the system design mechanism.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL CONTROL IN A MULTIAGENT SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000261409800002"}
