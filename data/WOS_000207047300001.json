In this article, we take Shield's vision to a new domain, inspecting and cleansing not just static content, but also dynamic content. The dynamic content we target is the dynamic HTML in Web pages, which have become a popular vector for attacks. The key challenge in filtering dynamic HTML is that it is undecidable to statically determine whether an embedded script will exploit the browser at runtime. We avoid this undecidability problem by rewriting web pages and any embedded scripts into safe equivalents, inserting checks so that the filtering is done at runtime. The rewritten pages contain logic for recursively applying runtime checks to dynamically generated or modified web content, based on known vulnerabilities. We have built and evaluated BrowserShield, a general framework that performs this dynamic instrumentation of embedded scripts, and that admits policies for customized runtime actions like vulnerability-driven filtering. We also explore other applications on top of BrowserShield.", "paper_title": "BrowserShield: Vulnerability-Driven Filtering of Dynamic HTML", "paper_id": "WOS:000207047300001"}
