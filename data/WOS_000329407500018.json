In the past years, the authors have investigated several different fuzzy t-norms, among others, algebraic and trigonometric ones, and the Hamacher product by substituting the standard \"min\" t-norm operation, in order to achieve better model fitting. In the present paper, the focus is on examining the general parametric Hamacher t-norm, where the free parameter quite essentially influences the quality of modeling and the learning capability of the model identification system. Based on a wide scope of simulation experiments, a quasi-optimal interval for the value of the Hamacher operator is proposed.", "paper_title": "Learning the optimal parameter of the Hamacher t-norm applied for fuzzy-rule-based model extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500018"}
