Currently, there is no available simulator that targets the specific generation of PacBio libraries. Results: Our analysis of 13 PacBio datasets showed characteristic features of PacBio reads (e.g. the read length of PacBio reads follows a log-normal distribution). We have developed a read simulator, PBSIM, that captures these features using either a model-based or sampling-based method. Using PBSIM, we conducted several hybrid error correction and assembly tests for PacBio reads, suggesting that a continuous long reads coverage depth of at least 15 in combination with a circular consensus sequencing coverage depth of at least 30 achieved extensive assembly results.", "paper_title": "PBSIM: PacBio reads simulator-toward accurate genome assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000312654600018"}
