QCLA was originally designed for an abstract, concurrent architecture supporting long-distance communication, but most realistic architectures heavily constrain communication distances. The quantum carry-lookahead adder is faster than a quantum ripple-carry adder; QCLA has logarithmic depth while ripple adders have linear depth. MBQCLA utilizes MBQC's ability to transfer quantum states in unit time to accelerate addition. MBQCLA breaks the latency limit of addition circuits in nearest neighbor-only architectures: compared to the Theta(n) limit on circuit depth for linear nearest-neighbor architectures, it can reach Theta(log n) depth. MBQCLA is an order of magnitude faster than a ripple-carry adder when adding registers longer than 100 qubits, but requires a cluster state that is an order of magnitude larger. The cluster state resources can be classified as computation and communication; for the unoptimized form, approximate to 88% of the resources are used for communication. Hand optimization of horizontal communication costs results in a approximate to 12% reduction in spatial resources for the in-place MBQCLA circuit. For comparison, a graph state quantum carry-lookahead adder (GSQCLA) uses only approximate to 9% of the spatial resources of the MBQCLA.", "paper_title": "CIRCUIT DESIGN FOR A MEASUREMENT-BASED QUANTUM CARRY-LOOKAHEAD ADDER", "paper_id": "WOS:000282436200009"}
