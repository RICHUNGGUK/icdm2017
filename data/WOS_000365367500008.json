An overview of the numerical methods and the methodology used to verify the simulation is presented with special emphasis to determine the proper domain size and time-integration period. Then, the time-averaged flow results and turbulent statistics are discussed together with available experimental data showing a fairly good agreement. Finally, frequency analysis of velocity samples is used to analyze both the Kelvin-Helmholtz vortical structures produced by the flow separation at the leading edge of the cylinder and the Von Karman vortex shedding in the wake region. The former are observed more downstream compared with the experiments suggesting that transition to turbulence may occur later. However, comparison of the turbulent statistics in the near wall region indicates that transition is being well captured. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
