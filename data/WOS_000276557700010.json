In some applications, such as an Internet video distance education system, there are multiple media sources which work alternately. A fundamental problem in designing such kind of P2P streaming system is how to achieve fast source switching so that the startup delay of the new source can be minimized. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to this problem. We model the source switch process, formulate it into an optimization problem and derive its theoretical optimal solution. Then we propose a practical greedy algorithm, named fast source switch algorithm, which approximates the optimal solution by properly interleaving the data delivery of different media sources. The algorithm can adapt to the dynamics and heterogeneity of real Internet environments. We have carried out extensive simulations on various real-trace P2P overlay topologies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the normal source switch algorithm by reducing the source switch time by 20%-30% without bringing extra communication overhead. The reduction in source switching time is more obvious as the network scale increases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
