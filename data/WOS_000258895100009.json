We prove the following results: (1) There is a polynomial-time approximation scheme for planar graphs; (2) there is a polynomial-time 3/5-approximation algorithm for graphs; (3) it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within ratio 259/260+epsilon for graphs; (4) there is a linear-time algorithm to compute the maximum star forest of a weighted tree; (5) there is a polynomial-time 1/2-approximation algorithm for weighted graphs. We also show how to apply this spanning star forest model to aligning multiple genomic sequences over a tandem duplication region.", "paper_title": "Approximating the spanning star forest problem and its application to genomic sequence alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000258895100009"}
