In the control design, the intermittent data loss existing in the closed-loop system is taken into account. The parameter uncertainties can be represented and captured effectively via the membership functions described by lower and upper membership functions and relative weighting functions. A novel fuzzy state-feedback controller is designed to guarantee the resulting closed-loop system to be stochastically stable with an optimal performance. Furthermore, to make the controller design more flexible, the designed controller does not need to share membership functions and amount of fuzzy rules with the model. Some simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Control of Nonlinear Networked Systems With Packet Dropouts: Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Model-Based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000363233000001"}
