In consideration of the alternative processes and alternative machines for the production of each part, the actual selection of the schedule and allocation of manufacturing resources is achieved through negotiation among the part and machine agents which represent the parts and manufacturing resources, respectively. The agents are to negotiate on a fictitious cost with the adoption of a currency function. Two MAS architectures are evaluated in this paper. One is a simple MAS architecture comprises part agents and machine agents only; the other one involves the addition of a supervisor agent to establish a hybrid-based MAS architecture. A hybrid contract net protocol is developed in the paper to support both types of MAS architectures. This new negotiation protocol enables multi-task many-to-many negotiations, it also incorporates global control into the decentralized negotiation. Simulation runs are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed MAS-based IPPS approaches and that of an evolutionary algorithm. It also shows that the hybrid-based MAS, with the introduction of supervisory control, is able to provide integrated process plan and job shop scheduling solutions with a better global performance.
