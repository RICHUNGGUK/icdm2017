Motivated by the notion of texture as a largely local phenomenon, we warp and blend small image neighborhoods prior to patch-based texture synthesis. In addition, interpolating and enforcing characteristic image statistics faithfully handles high frequency detail. We are able to create both intermediate textures as well as continuous transitions. In contrast to previous techniques computing a global morphing transformation on the entire input exemplar images, our localized and patch-based approach allows us to successfully interpolate between textures with considerable differences in feature topology for which no smooth global warping field exists.", "paper_title": "Patch-based Texture Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000281286100020"}
