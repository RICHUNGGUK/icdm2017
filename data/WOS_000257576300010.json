A low-resolution (LR) image is first magnified to form a high-resolution (HR) image using a fractal-based method, namely the multiple partitioned iterated function system (MPIFS). The quality of this magnified HR image is then improved by means of a block-wise adaptive MRF model using the Bayesian 'maximum a posteriori' (MAP) approach. We propose an efficient parameter estimation method for the MRF model such that the staircase artifact will be reduced in the HR image. Experimental results show that, when compared to the conventional MRF model, which uses a fixed set of parameters for a whole image, our algorithm can provide a magnified image with the well-preserved edges and texture, and can achieve a better PSNR and visual quality.
