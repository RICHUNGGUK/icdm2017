However, prior optimal cost and data placement approaches for processing range queries over two-dimensional datasets do not consider this property. In particular, these techniques do not consider the issue of sequential data placement when multiple I/O blocks need to be retrieved from a single device. In this paper, we reevaluate the optimal cost of range queries by declustering two-dimensional datasets over multiple devices, and prove that, in general, it is impossible to achieve the new optimal cost. This is because disks cannot facilitate two-dimensional sequential access which is required by the new optimal cost. Then we revisit the existing data allocation schemes under the new optimal cost, and show that none of them can achieve the new optimal cost. Fortunately, MEMS-based storage is being developed to reduce I/O cost. We first show that the two-dimensional sequential access requirement can not be satisfied by simply modeling MEMS-based storage as conventional disks. Then we propose a new placement scheme that exploits the physical properties of MEMS-based storage to solve this problem. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the new scheme achieves almost optimal I/O costs.", "paper_title": "Exploiting sequential access when declustering data over disks and MEMS-based storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000237864400005"}
