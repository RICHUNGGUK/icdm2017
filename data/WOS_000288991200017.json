Oscillating patterns are modeled with functionals that constrain the local Fourier decomposition of the texture. We first introduce a texture functional which is a weighted Hilbert norm. The weights on the local Fourier atoms are optimized to match the local orientation and frequency of the texture. This adaptive model is used to solve image processing inverse problems, such as image decomposition and inpainting. The local orientation and frequency of the texture component are adaptively estimated during the minimization process. To improve inpainting performances over large missing regions, we introduce a highly nonconvex generalization of our texture model. This new model constrains the amplitude of the texture and allows one to impose an arbitrary oscillation profile. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "Locally Parallel Texture Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000288991200017"}
