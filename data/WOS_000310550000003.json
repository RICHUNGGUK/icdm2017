In this article, we present the results of a preliminary study of cyberlearning projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that address these issues. Our work demonstrates that text-mining tools can be used to partially automate the process of finding NSF's cyberlearning awards and characterizing the fine-grained topics implicit in award abstracts. The methodology we have established to assess NSF's cyberlearning investments should generalize to other areas of research and other repositories of public-access documents.", "paper_title": "Understanding public-access cyberlearning projects using text mining and topic analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000310550000003"}
