The generalized Black-Scholes operator is discretized on a Cartesian structured but non-equidistant grid in space. The space- and time-discretizations are adjusted such that a predefined tolerance level on the local discretization error is met. An operator splitting technique is used to separately handle the early exercise constraint and the solution of linear systems of equations from the finite difference discretization of the linear complementarity problem. In numerical experiments three variants of the adaptive time-stepping algorithm with and without local time-stepping are compared. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
