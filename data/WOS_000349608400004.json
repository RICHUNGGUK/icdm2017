Generally, the popular methods have good classification accuracy but slow speed, and vice versa. This paper proposes a novel approach for fast text categorization, in which a collaborative work framework based on a linear classifier and an extreme learning machine (ELM) is constructed. The linear classifier, obtained by a modified non-negative matrix factorization algorithm, maps all documents from the original term space into the class space directly such that it performs classification very fast. The ELM, with good classification accuracy via some nonlinear and linear transformations, classifies a few of documents according to some given criteria to improve the classification quality of the total system. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only achieves good accuracy but also performs classification very fast, which improves the averaged speed by 180 % compared with its corresponding method.", "paper_title": "Collaborative work with linear classifier and extreme learning machine for fast text categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000349608400004"}
