An alternative class of tests appropriate for testing not only bivariate, but also multivariate independence is developed, and their small-sample performance is studied. The test statistics employ the familiar equation between the joint characteristic function and the product of component characteristic functions, and may be written in a closed form convenient for computer implementation. Simulations on a distribution-free version of the new test statistic show that the proposed method compares well to standard methods of testing independence via the empirical distribution function. The methods are applied to multivariate observations incorporating data from several major stock-market indices. Issues pertaining to the theoretical properties of the new test are also addressed.
