We propose in this paper a method that relaxes this constraint. The proposed methodology relies on a two-dimensional dynamic programming (2D-DP) technique allowing symbol hypothesis generation, which can correctly segment and recognize interspersed symbols. In addition, as discriminative classifiers usually have limited capability to reject outliers, some domain specific knowledge is included to circumvent those errors due to untrained patterns corresponding to erroneous segmentation hypotheses. With a point-level measurement, the experiment shows that the proposed novel approach is able to achieve an accuracy of more than 90 percent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
