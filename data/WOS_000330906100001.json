Firstly, it provides formulas defining first-order or second-order conditions on frames. Secondly, it proves that all formulas corresponding to compatible first-order conditions on frames are canonical.", "paper_title": "Definability and Canonicity for Boolean Logic with a Binary Relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330906100001"}
