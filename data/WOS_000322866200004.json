Thus, analyzing weight sensitivity is an important work for a multi-attribute evaluation or decision. A measuring method based on the inclined angle of two vectors is proposed in this paper in order to solve the weight sensitivity of a multi-attribute evaluation with isotonicity characteristic. This method uses the cosine of the inclined angle to measure the weight sensitivity based on preferences or preference combinations. Concepts of sensitivity space, degree, and angle are given, and the relevant measurement method is discussed and proved. Also, this method is used for the choice of the water environment protection projects in Heyuan City.", "paper_title": "Weight sensitivity measurement, analysis, and application in multi-attribute evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000322866200004"}
