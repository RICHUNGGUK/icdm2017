Design/methodology/approach - The positions and the orientations of the magnetic sensors are optimized. The objective function is defined according to D-optimality theory and the optimization problem solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Findings - PSO is shown to be efficient for the optimization problem and that, following the D-optimality approach, a significant improvement in the measurement accuracy is obtained in terms of the errors typically used to classify current transducers. Research limitations/implications - The paper does not take into account the effects of external magnetic fields. Practical implications - A criterion and a methodology are suggested in order to design more accurate current transducers based on magnetic sensors. Originality/value - A new methodology to optimize magnetic sensor arrays for current measurement.", "paper_title": "Optimization of magnetic sensor arrays for current measurement based on swarm intelligence and D-optimality", "paper_id": "WOS:000270210500008"}
