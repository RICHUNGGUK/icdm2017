We focus on how adaptive systems can provide adaptive services through web service technologies. In particular, we concentrate on adding semantic information to enrich the service discovery phase. We present a recommender system, UbiquiTO-S, which exploits the technology of Web Services (WS) and Semantic Web to allow software agents to discover its services and use its adaptive services.", "paper_title": "UbiquiTo-S: A preliminary step toward Semantic adaptive Web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300027"}
