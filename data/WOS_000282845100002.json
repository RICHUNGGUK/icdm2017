This is demonstrated for the approximation problem defined over Korobov spaces and for the approximation problem of certain diagonal operators. For these two problems we show necessary and sufficient conditions on the smoothness parameters of the univariate problems to obtain strong polynomial tractability. We prove that polynomial tractability is equivalent to strong polynomial tractability, and that weak tractability always holds for these problems. Under a mild assumption, the Korobov space consists of periodic functions. Periodicity is crucial since the approximation problem defined over Sobolev spaces of non-periodic functions with a special choice of the norm is not polynomially tractable for all smoothness parameters no matter how fast they go to infinity. Furthermore, depending on the choice of the norm we can even lose weak tractability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
