To define the simulations we combine constraints that formalize the background knowledge concerned with qualitative reasoning with appropriate inter-state constraints that are formulated using linear temporal logic. We implemented this approach in a constraint programming system ((ECLPSe)-P-i) by drawing on the ideas from bounded model checking. The implementation became realistic only after several rounds of optimizations and experimentation with various heuristics. The resulting system allows us to test and modify the problem specifications in a straightforward way and to combine various knowledge aspects. To demonstrate the expressiveness and simplicity of this approach we discuss in detail two examples: a navigation problem and a simulation of juggling.", "paper_title": "Infinite qualitative simulations by means of constraint programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400004"}
