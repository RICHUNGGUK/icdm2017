Although many miRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, a small subset have differential expression patterns that may give rise to tissue- specific complexes. Motivation: This work studies gene targeting patterns amongst miRNAs with differential expression profiles, and links this to control and regulation of protein complexes. Results: We find that, when a pair of miRNAs are not expressed in the same tissues, there is a higher tendency for them to target the direct partners of the same hub proteins. At the same time, they also avoid targeting the same set of hub-spokes. Moreover, the complexes corresponding to these hub-spokes tend to be specific and nonoverlapping. This suggests that the effect of miRNAs on the formation of complexes is specific.", "paper_title": "The role of miRNAs in complex formation and control", "paper_id": "WOS:000300490500001"}
