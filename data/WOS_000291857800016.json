The system under consideration not only contains Ito-type stochastic disturbances and time-varying delays, but also involves uncertainties both in the system matrices and in the mode transition rate matrix. Our aim is to design an H-infinity filter such that, for all admissible parameter uncertainties and time-delays, the filtering error system can be guaranteed to be robustly stochastically stable, and achieve a prescribed H-infinity disturbance rejection attenuation level. By constructing a proper stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing the free-weighting matrix technique, sufficient conditions for the existence of the desired filters are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be readily solved by standard numerical software. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the utility of the developed approaches.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity filtering of Markovian jump stochastic systems with uncertain transition probabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000291857800016"}
