The design is performed in a probabilistic framework where the uncertain parameters are treated as random variables and the design specification is met with a given probability level. In particular, a sequential algorithm based on gradient iteration is employed to find a probabilistic robust feasible solution to the formulated problem. The design procedure is computationally tractable and its computational complexity does not depend on the number of uncertain parameters. Our case study allows natural frequency and damping ratio to vary within 8% and 10% from their nominal values for rigid body and all resonance modes. The designed controller achieves robustness in the presence of these uncertainties. Furthermore, the designed controller is implemented in real time on a commercial HDD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
