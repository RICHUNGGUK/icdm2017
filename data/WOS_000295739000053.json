The source knows the channel statistics but is oblivious to the actual channel state realization. Herein, it is established that a distortion constraint for channel state estimation can be reduced to an additional cost constraint on the source input distribution, in the limit of large coding block length. A newly defined capacity-distortion function thus characterizes the fundamental tradeoff between transmission rate and state estimation distortion. It is also shown that noncoherent communication coupled with channel state estimation conditioned on treating the decoded message as training symbols achieves the capacity-distortion function. Among the various examples considered, the capacity-distortion function for a memoryless Rayleigh fading channel is characterized to within 1.443 bits at high signal-to-noise ratio. The constrained channel coding approach is also extended to multiple access channels, leading to a coupled cost constraint on the input distributions for the transmitting sources.", "paper_title": "Joint Transmission and State Estimation: A Constrained Channel Coding Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000053"}
