In the field of text mining, the purity measure is developed to detect unusual regions of a string without any domain knowledge. It is reported in that work that only RNAs and transposons are shown to have high purity values. In this work, the purity values of regions of various bacterial genome sequences are computed, and those regions are analyzed extensively. It is found that mobile elements and phages as well as RNAs and transposons have high purity values. It is interesting that they are all classified into a group of horizontally transferred genes. This means that the purity measure is useful to predict horizontally transferred genes.", "paper_title": "THE PURITY MEASURE FOR GENOMIC REGIONS LEADS TO HORIZONTALLY TRANSFERRED GENES", "paper_id": "WOS:000329998600003"}
