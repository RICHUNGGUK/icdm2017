Quantum-dot cellular automata has a simple cell as the basic element. The cell is used as a building block to construct gates and wires. Previously, adder designs based on conventional designs were examined for implementation with QCA technology. That work demonstrated that the design trade-offs are very different in QCA. This paper utilizes the unique QCA characteristics to design a carry flow adder that is fast and efficient. Simulations indicate very attractive performance (i.e., complexity, area, and delay). This paper also explores the design of serial parallel multipliers. A serial parallel multiplier is designed and simulated with several different operand sizes.", "paper_title": "Adder and Multiplier Design in Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000265412200001"}
