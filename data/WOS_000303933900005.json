Considering the varied characteristics of these sites, risks within the same type of work can differ. Furthermore, the established safety management performed in other industries does not necessarily apply to construction. To suggest an assessment system considering risk influence factors on construction sites, this study examines the factors through literature reviews and surveys, and builds a weighting system for their classification. The risks for each type of work are estimated based on their frequency and severity. With the understanding that perceiving a specific type of risk on a construction site increases the effectiveness of safety management, the study suggests an assessment system integrating associated risks and risk influence factors. A risk assessment system is proposed that considers influence factors and addresses the characteristics of construction sites. The system is intended for use with regard to the safety of construction workers. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000146.
