Emission substances like NOX, SOX, COX, Power demand equality constraint and operating limit constraint are considered here. Differential evolution (DE) is one of the very fast and robust, accurate evolutionary algorithms for global optimization and solution of EELD problems. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is another new biogeography inspired algorithm. Biogeography deals with the geographical distribution of different biological species. This algorithm searches for the global optimum mainly through two steps: migration and mutation. In this paper combination of DE and BBO (DE/BBO) is proposed to accelerate the convergence speed of both the algorithm and to improve solution quality. To show the advantages of the proposed algorithm, it has been applied for solving multi-objective EELD problems in a 3-generator system with NOX and SOX emission, in a 6-generators system considering NOX emission, in a 6-generator system addressing both valve-point loading and NOX emission. The current proposal is found better in terms of quality of the compromising and individual solution obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
