In this paper, a computational framework is presented for automatic detection and recognition of important facial feature regions, from scanned head and shoulder polyhedral models. A noise tolerant methodology is proposed using discrete curvature computations, band-pass filtering, and morphological operations for isolation of the primary feature regions of the face, namely, the eyes, nose, and mouth. Spatial disposition of the critical points of these isolated feature regions is analyzed for the recognition of these critical points as the standard landmarks associated with the primary facial features. A number of clinically identified landmarks lie on the facial midline. An efficient algorithm for detection and processing of the midline, using a point sampling technique, is also presented. The results obtained using data of more than 20 subjects are verified through visualization and physical measurements. A color based and triangle skewness based schemes for isolation of geometrically nonprominent features and ear region are also presented.
