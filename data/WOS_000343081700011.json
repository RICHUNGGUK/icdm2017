In most of the cases, CLF is locally designed, and the region of attraction is limited, especially when under control constraints. In this article, the stability and the region of attraction of constrained MPC that is applied to the discrete-time nonlinear system are explicitly analyzed. The region of feasibility is proposed to substitute the region of attraction, which greatly reduces the calculation burden of terminal constraints inequalities and guarantees the stability of the MPC algorithm. Also, the time-variant terminal weighted factor is proposed to improve the dynamic performance of the close-loop system. Explicit experiments verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the relative conclusions, which provide practically feasible ways to stabilize the unstable and/or fast-dynamic systems.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of constrained MPC with CLF applied to discrete-time nonlinear system", "paper_id": "WOS:000343081700011"}
