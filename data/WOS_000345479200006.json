The current study reports four experiments testing how questionnaire layout and national culture affect people's responses to online questionnaires. Flow- and the disorientation scales for web navigation had good psychometric quality overall and across experimental manipulations of questionnaire layout, field dependence, national culture, response correction and question grouping. However, single-item layout (presenting one question at a time) had the advantage of faster completion than whole-form layout (presenting each page filled with items). Support was also found for the idea that whole form divides and thereby requires more attention to respond. Future research should be directed at online psychometrics on small and large displays.
