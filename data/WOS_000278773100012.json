One of their most outstanding features is that they may help classical local search-based metaheuristics to improve their behavior. This paper focuses on experimentally investigating the role of a recent approach, the binary-coded local genetic algorithm (BLGA), as context-independent local search operator for three local search-based metaheuristics: random multi-start local search, iterated local search, and variable neighborhood search. These general-purpose models treat the objective function as a black box, allowing the search process to be context-independent. The results show that BLGA may provide an effective and efficient intensification, not only allowing these three metaheuristics to be enhanced, but also predicting successful applications in other local search-based algorithms. In addition, the empirical results reported here reveal relevant insights on the behavior of classical local search methods when they are performed as context-independent optimizers in these three well-known metaheuristics.", "paper_title": "Evaluating a local genetic algorithm as context-independent local search operator for metaheuristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000278773100012"}
