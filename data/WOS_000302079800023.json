Moreover, time duplex constraints may entail that receiving feedback may be costly. In this work, we consider tailoring feedback and coding jointly in such settings to reduce the expected delay for successful in order reception of packets. We find that, in certain applications, judicious choices provide results that are close to those that would be obtained with a full-duplex system. We study two cases of data transmission: one-to-all broadcast and all-to-all broadcast. We also analyze important practical considerations weighing the trade off between performance and complexity in applications that rely on random linear network coding. Finally, we study the problem of transmission of information under the large latency and time duplexing constraints in the presence of random packet arrivals. In particular, we analyze the problem of using a batch by batch approach and an online network coding approach with Poisson arrivals. We present numerical results to illustrate the performance under a variety of scenarios and show the benefits of the proposed schemes as compared to typical ARQ and scheduling schemes.", "paper_title": "On Coding for Delay-Network Coding for Time-Division Duplexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000302079800023"}
