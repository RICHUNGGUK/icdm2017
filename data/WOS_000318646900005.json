The success of these models is strongly related to their capacity to represent and handle dependence relations. Some forms of Bayesian networks have been successfully applied in many classification tasks. In particular, naive Bayes classifiers have been used for intrusion detection and alerts correlation. This paper analyses the advantage of adding expert knowledge to probabilistic classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alerts correlation. As examples of probabilistic classifiers, we will consider the well-known Naive Bayes, Tree Augmented Na < ve Bayes (TAN), Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) and decision tree classifiers. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where the outcome is a probability distribution over a set of classes (or decisions). In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as \"it is expected that 80 % of traffic will be normal\" can be integrated in classification tasks. Our aim is to revise probabilistic classifiers' outputs in order to fit expert knowledge. Experimental results show that our approach improves existing results on different benchmarks from intrusion detection and alert correlation areas.", "paper_title": "An intrusion detection and alert correlation approach based on revising probabilistic classifiers using expert knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000318646900005"}
