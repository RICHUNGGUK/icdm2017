As a first step of this argument, a polyhedral subset of the lattice-free convex set that is used to generate the intersection cut is constructed. We call this subset the restricted lattice-free set. It is then shown that [log(2)(l)] is a lower bound on the split rank of the intersection cut, where l is the number of integer points lying on the boundary of the restricted lattice-free set satisfying the condition that no two points lie on the same facet of the restricted lattice-free set. The use of this result is illustrated by obtaining a lower bound of [log2(n + 1)] on the split rank of n-row mixing inequalities.", "paper_title": "A note on the split rank of intersection cuts", "paper_id": "WOS:000295785100005"}
