T-S fuzzy strategy is utilized on the approximation of nonlinear model of APF caused by nonlinear characteristics, variable parameters and external disturbances. Adaptive fuzzy control of the APF system consists of T-S fuzzy control item and sliding mode control item, which can enhance the robust performance of the system. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller and comparisons with APF system using model reference adaptive control (MRAC) demonstrate that MRAFC method is capable of reducing the modeling error and tracking reference current signal accurately. Moreover, APF using the proposed method shows the dynamic and static control performance of stronger robustness, better suitability and higher accuracy than the one using MRAC modus.", "paper_title": "Model reference adaptive fuzzy control of a shunt active power filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800044"}
