In an IDB, the KDD application can express both queries capable of accessing and manipulating data, and queries capable of generating, manipulating, and applying patterns allowing to formalize the notion of mining process. The feature that makes them different from other data mining applications is exactly the idea of looking at the support for knowledge discovery as an extension of the query process. This paper draws a list of desirable properties to be taken into account in the definition of an IDB framework. They involve several dimensions, such as the expressiveness of the language in representing data and models, the closure principle, the capability to provide a support for an efficient algorithm programming. These requirements are a basis for a comparative study that highlights strengths and weaknesses of existing IDB approaches. The paper focuses on the SQL-based ATLaS language/system, on the logic-based LDL++ language/system, and on the XML-based KDDML language/system.", "paper_title": "Inductive database languages: requirements and examples", "paper_id": "WOS:000287251500001"}
