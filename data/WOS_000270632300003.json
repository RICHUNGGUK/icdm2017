One can investigate the representation of vertex locations relative to a local coordinate frame (LCF) in the compression of dynamic 3D meshes. Unlike the world coordinates, which scatter in a wide range and show non-linear behavior of the vertices, the local coordinates exhibit a large clustering behavior of the vertex over time. This property is very useful for exploiting a large coherence over the vertex trajectory and between neighboring vertices. In this paper, we discuss the use of the LCF in static and animated mesh encoding and we introduce a new connectivity-guided predictive scheme for single-rate compression for animated meshes. The proposed geometry encoding strategy is based on a region growing encoding order, and only the differences between original and predicted locations are encoded in a local coordinate system, which splits into two tangential and one normal components. The approach is simple, efficient, and well-suited for real time applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
