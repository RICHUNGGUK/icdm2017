We first analyze one tour operator in Thailand as well as its specific requirements for enterprise computations. In the decision processes for enterprise computation, several experts are invited to evaluate the alternatives based on a multi-tier electronic business architecture. This study designs two models for evaluating the information systems investments in international tourism. The first model maximizes the overall utility for each criterion, and the other model maximizes the utility for every expert. Because each alternative for enterprise computation involves approximate costs and efforts, we represent the cost data with fuzzy sets and possibility distributions.", "paper_title": "Decision on enterprise computing solutions for an international tourism", "paper_id": "WOS:000253476200008"}
