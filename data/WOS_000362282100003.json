Such devices are generally equipped with extremely low RAM and large Flash storage capacity. To tackle these conflicting hardware constraints, conventional search engines privilege either insertion or query scalability but cannot meet both requirements at the same time. Moreover, very few solutions support document deletions and updates in this context. In this paper, we introduce three design principles, namely Write-Once Partitioning, Linear Pipelining and Background Linear Merging, and show how they can be combined to produce an embedded search engine reconciling high insert/delete/update rate and query scalability. We have implemented our search engine on a development board having a hardware configuration representative for smart objects and have conducted extensive experiments using two representative datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the scalability of the approach and its superiority compared to state of the art methods.", "paper_title": "A Scalable Search Engine for Mass Storage Smart Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000362282100003"}
