An evaluation of the unification method, the obtained statechart model of the domain, the method's and model's feedback on the UCs themselves, and how the method is used in requirements engineering practice was carried out by examining 58 software requirements specifications produced by 189 upper-year undergraduate and graduate students. The results of these studies independently confirm some of the benefits of building a unified SC mentioned in the works of Glinz; Whittle and Schumann; and Harel, Kugler, and Pnueli.", "paper_title": "Unified use case statecharts: case studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000250071100005"}
