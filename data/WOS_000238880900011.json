Based on the conditional likelihood function, two new receiver structures, namely ML symbol-by-symbol receiver and ML sequence receiver, are proposed. For the symbol-by-symbol detection, the conventional DAPSK detector is shown to be sub-optimum due to the complete separation in the phase and amplitude detection, but it results in very close performance to the NIL detector provided that its circular amplitude decision thresholds are optimized. For the sequence detection, a simple Viterbi algorithm with only two states are adopted to provide an SNR gain around 1 dB on the amplitude bit detection compared with the conventional detector.", "paper_title": "Maximum likelihood receivers for DAPSK signaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000238880900011"}
