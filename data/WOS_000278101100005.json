It is also known that the direction of the energy flux from the noise sources affects the estimation of the travel time. Using the stationary phase method, we show here that the travel time can be effectively estimated when the ray joining the two sensors continues into the noise source region. We extend this analysis to passive sensor imaging of reflectors with different ambient noise source configurations by suitably migrating the cross correlations. If in addition there is multiple scattering in the medium, then reflectors can be imaged with passive sensor networks or arrays by migrating suitable fourth-order cross correlations. Fourth-order cross correlations can also be used with auxiliary passive sensors in order to enhance travel time estimation in a scattering medium.", "paper_title": "Passive Sensor Imaging Using Cross Correlations of Noisy Signals in a Scattering Medium", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101100005"}
