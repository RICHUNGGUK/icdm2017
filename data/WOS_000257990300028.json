The proposed algorithm is based on the Toeplitz matrix-vector representation, which obtains the scalable and systolic Montgomery multiplier in a flexible manner, and can adapt to the required precision. Analytical results indicate that the proposed multiplier over the generic field of GF(2) has a latency of d + n(2n + 1), where n = [m/d], and d denotes the selected digital size. The latency is reduced to d + n(n + 1) clock cycles when the field is constructed from generalized equally-spaced polynomials. Since the selected digital size is d >= 5 bits, the proposed architectures have lower time-space complexity than traditional digit-serial multipliers. Moreover, the proposed architectures have regularity, modularity and local interconnect ability, making them very suitable for VLSI implementation.", "paper_title": "Scalable and systolic Montgomery multipliers over GF(2(m))", "paper_id": "WOS:000257990300028"}
