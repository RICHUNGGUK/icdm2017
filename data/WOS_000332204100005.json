In this paper, we further study the same problem under switching network topology. We propose a distributed adaptive control law that can solve the problem under a switching network satisfying jointly connected condition. Under this condition, our results do not require the network to be undirected and allow the network to be disconnected at any time instant. Moreover, by introducing an exosystem to generate various reference signals, our control law can handle a class of reference signals such as sinusoidal signals with arbitrary amplitudes and initial phases or ramp signals with arbitrary slopes.", "paper_title": "Leader-following consensus of multiple uncertain Euler-Lagrange systems under switching network topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000332204100005"}
