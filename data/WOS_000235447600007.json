First, a novel switch configuration is designed with an included antithermal mechanism. Then, parametric programs are developed to automatically generate the solid model and to analyze thermal behavior of the switch. From the analysis of the initial design, it revealed that the amount of transverse offset between fiber tips failed in satisfying the Bellcore specifications. Finally, an integrated program combining CAD software, genetic algorithms, and finite element software was developed for optimum design of optical switches. With the capability of continuously changing critical design parameters of the switch in the integrated design program, the final optimum design satisfying the design constraints and specifications can be found.", "paper_title": "Optimum design of a 1x2 mechanical optical switch", "paper_id": "WOS:000235447600007"}
