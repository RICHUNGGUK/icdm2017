It has recently been shown that the 1.5-dimensional terrain guarding problem is approximable to within a constant factor [3, 7], though no attempt has been made to minimize the approximation factor. We give a 4-approximation algorithm for the 1.5D terrain guarding problem that runs in quadratic time. Our algorithm is faster, simpler, and has a better worst-case approximation factor than previous algorithms.", "paper_title": "A 4-approximation algorithm for guarding 1.5-dimensional terrains", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100058"}
