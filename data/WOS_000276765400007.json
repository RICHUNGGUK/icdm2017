To make near-duplicate detection module resist to noisy features, three filtering approaches, i.e., point-based, region-based, and probabilistic latent semantic (pLSA), are developed to categorize feature points. For the photos taken in travels, we construct a support vector machine classifier to model matching patterns between photos and determine whether photos are near-duplicate pairs. Relationships between photos are then described as a graph, and the most central photo that best represents a photo cluster is selected according to centrality values. Because matched feature points are often located in the interior or at the contour of important objects, the region that compactly covers the matched feature points is determined as the ROI. We compare the proposed approaches with conventional ones and demonstrate their effectiveness. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
