Within these areas, the truncation error of the underlying difference schemes strongly affects the solution. Therefore, a significant gain in computational efficiency is possible if the truncation error functions as physically consistent, i.e. reproducing the correct evolution of resolved scales, subgrid-scale (SGS) model. The truncation error of high-order WENO-based schemes can be exploited to function as an implicit subgrid-scale (SGS) model. A recently developed sixth-order adaptive central-upwind weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme with implicit scale-separation has been demonstrated to incorporate a physically consistent implicit SGS model for compressible turbulent flows. We consider the implicit SGS modeling capabilities of an improved version of this scheme simultaneously for underresolved turbulent and non-turbulent incompressible flows, thus extending previous works on this subject to a more general scope. With this model we are able to reach very long integration times for the incompressible Taylor-Green vortex at infinite Reynolds number, and recover in particular a low-mode transition to isotropy. Inviscid shear-layer instabilities are resolved to highly nonlinear stages, which is shown by considering the doubly periodic two-dimensional shear layer as test configuration. Proper resolved-scale prediction is also obtained for viscous-inviscid interactions and fully confined viscous flows. These properties are demonstrated by applying the model to a vortex-wall interaction problem and lid-driven cavity flow. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
