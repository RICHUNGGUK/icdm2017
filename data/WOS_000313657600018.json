The uncertainties under consideration are norm-bounded, and the delay is assumed to be time-varying and belongs to a given interval. By using the Lyapunov-Krasovskill functional method and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, the novel stability criteria are derived in terms of LMI. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.", "paper_title": "Robust stability criteria for uncertain stochastic neural networks of neutral-type with interval time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600018"}
