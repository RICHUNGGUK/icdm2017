Our method consists of three phases. Firstly, a Radial Basis Function (RBF) based global warping function is applied to deform a feature-template to a shape interpolating the features points on the scanned model. A surface fitting process is then adopted to refine the feature-template to approximate the given model. The surface fitting process is a hybrid of the closest point scheme and the region propagation based scheme, which leads to an excellent result even if large size holes are introduced on the scanned data or the warped template mesh is apart from the scanned model. Finally, with the template fitting results, we introduce a method to transform the complex geometry to 3D character models by using the Compactly Supported Radial Basis Function (CSRBF).", "paper_title": "Mesh fitting based 3D character modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300102"}
