We investigate the use of caching to solve the scalability issues of several existing VoD providers. We propose metrics and goals that define the requirements of a caching framework for CDNs of VoD systems. Using data logs collected from Motorola equipment from Comcast VoD deployments we show that several classic caching solutions do not satisfy the proposed goals. We address this issue by developing novel techniques for predicting future values of several metrics of interest. We rely on computed predictions to define the penalty imposed on the system, both network and caching sites, when not storing individual items. We use item penalties to devise novel caching and static content placement strategies. We use the previously mentioned data logs to validate our solutions and show that they satisfy all the defined goals.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Network Aware Caching for Video on Demand Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000323501800008"}
