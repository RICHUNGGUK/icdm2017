The theory of interval type-2 fuzzy sets provides an intuitive and computationally feasible way of addressing uncertain and ambiguous information in decision-making fields. Many studies have developed multiple criteria decision analysis methods in the context of interval type-2 fuzzy sets; most of these methods can be characterized as scoring or compromising models. Nevertheless, the extended versions of outranking methods have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper establishes interval type-2 fuzzy PROMETHEE methods for ranking alternative actions among multiple criteria based on the concepts of signed distance-based generalized criteria and comprehensive preference indices. We develop interval type-2 fuzzy PROMETHEE I and interval type-2 fuzzy PROMETHEE II procedures for partial and complete ranking, respectively, of the alternatives. Finally, the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated by a practical problem of landfill site selection. A comparative analysis is also performed with ordinary fuzzy PROMETHEE methods to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "A PROMETHEE-based outranking method for multiple criteria decision analysis with interval type-2 fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000334522300007"}
