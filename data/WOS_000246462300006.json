Moreover, it is difficult to effectively utilise them because of the explicit data movement between different memory levels. Also, the effectiveness of traditional cache in NPs needs to be improved. A memory hierarchy component, called split control cache, is presented that employs two independent low-latency memory stores to temporarily hold the flow-based and application-relevant information, exploiting the different locality behaviours exhibited by these two types of data. Just like conventional cache, data movement is manipulated by specially designed hardware so as to relieve the programmers from the details of memory management. Software simulation shows that compared with conventional cache, a performance improvement of up to 90% can be achieved by this scheme for OC-3c and OC-12c links.", "paper_title": "Hybrid cache architecture for high-speed packet processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000246462300006"}
