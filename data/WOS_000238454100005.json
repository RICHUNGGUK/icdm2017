As a corollary, we obtain a characteristic property of non-crossing closed paths, generalizing in this way a result of Daurat and Nivat (2003) on the boundary properties of polyominoes concerning salient and reentrant points. Moreover we obtain a similar result for hexagonal lattices and show that there is no other regular lattice having that property.", "paper_title": "Properties of the contour path of discrete sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000238454100005"}
