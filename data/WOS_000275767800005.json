This control method works well when free Speed is iteration-varying, which is the most common situation for the freeway traffic system. With rigorous analysis, the proposed control scheme guarantees the asymptotic convergences along the iteration axis. In order to make the strategy practical, estimation methods of compensation coefficient are proposed as well Intensive simulations show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy with iteration-varying free speed, as compared with. the pine iterative learning control method", "paper_title": "ITERATIVE LEARNING CONTROL BASED FREEWAY RAMP METERING WITH ITERATION-VARYING PARAMETER", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800005"}
