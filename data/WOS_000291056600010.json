An adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) is proposed as optimization algorithm. Four methods: cross-section size optimization (CSSO) method, shape combination optimization (SCO) method, the TCO method and the LCO method, are utilized to optimize the transmission steel tower, respectively. The topology optimization rules are presented for the TCO method, and the layering optimization rules are presented for the LCO method. A high-voltage steel tower is analyzed as a numerical example to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods. The simulation results demonstrate that the calculated results of both the proposed TCO method and the LCO method are obviously better than those of the CSSO method and the SCO method.", "paper_title": "Structural topology optimization of high-voltage transmission tower with discrete variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000291056600010"}
