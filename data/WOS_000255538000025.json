In the current paper, we extend this pre-emptive scheduling problem with setup times between activity interruptions and the possibility to schedule pre-emptive sub-parts of activities in parallel. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we briefly show that an efficient exact branch-and-bound procedure from the literature to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem can be easily adapted to cope with our problem extensions. Second, we extensively test the impact of these pre-emptive extensions to the quality of the schedule from a makespan point-of-view. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
