For infinite impulse response (IIR) filter designs, the proposed approach fulfills all types of filters by minimizing the order of the filter and the absolute error of both passband and stopband. Both system structure and parametric variables are simultaneously optimized via the proposed chromosome scheme. The approach has also been extended to deal with robust control design problems. The approach offers an effective method for designing an optimal controller with robust stability. Simulation and experimental results conveys the excellence of the proposed algorithm over traditional approaches in convergence speed, performance, cost effectiveness, and attains simpler structure.
