Numerical simulations were carried out based on volume of fluid (VOF) techniques with arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation which adopts the displacement of solid, the pressure and displacement in the fluid as variables to model the coupled system. The response of the coupled system is obtained by using the well-known software ADINA, which offers efficient fully coupled fluid-structure interaction capabilities by finite element method. The results obtained are compared with the available experimental data to demonstrate the reduction of sloshing effects in fluid model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
