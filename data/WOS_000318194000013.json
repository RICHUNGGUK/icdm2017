Calculated, predicted and/or known experimental line parameters are loaded alongside experimentally observed spectral line profiles for easy comparison between new experimental data and existing results. Many such line profiles, which could span numerous spectra, may be viewed simultaneously to help the user detect problems from line blending or self-absorption. Once the user has determined that their experimental line profile fits are good, a key feature of FAST is the ability to calculate atomic branching fractions, transition probabilities, and oscillator strengths - and their uncertainties - which is not provided by existing analysis packages.", "paper_title": "The FTS atomic spectrum tool (FAST) for rapid analysis of line spectra", "paper_id": "WOS:000318194000013"}
