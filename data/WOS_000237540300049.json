Although the popular IEEE 802.11 DCF mechanism still works under multi-hop scenarios, its efficiency is unacceptable. Many efforts have been made to enhance the mechanism in various aspects. In this paper, a novel MAC protocol, called MAC with Voluntary Waiting (VWMAC), is proposed to solve the intra-flow contention problem in multi-hop ad hoc networks. Through voluntary waiting by mobile hosts according to the length of DATA packet transmitted, VWMAC uses a very simple strategy to achieve great performance enhancement. Our simulation results show that VWMAC outperforms IEEE 802.11 and existing approaches in terms of throughput, transmission delay and energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "VWMAC: An efficient MAC protocol for resolving intra-flow contention in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300049"}
