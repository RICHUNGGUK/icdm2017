The selected protocols are compared on the basis of multiple parameters, which include packet delivery ratio, packet loss, network lifetime, and control overhead using variable number of nodes and speeds. The extensive simulation and analysis of results show that position-based routing protocols incur less packet loss as compared to the non position based protocols. However, position-based protocols require localization mechanism or a GPS for the location information, which consumes energy and affects the network lifetime. Alternatively, non position-based protocols are more energy efficient and provide extended network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Routing protocols for mobile sensor networks: a comparative study", "paper_id": "WOS:000339141200004"}
