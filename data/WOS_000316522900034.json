Dedicated tools to measure its performance under such an environment are not found in the literature. This paper aims to fill this void by proposing a hybrid model based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Monte Carlo simulation is incorporated into the model to handle stochastic data. In addition, to improve the model's accuracy, the Ant Colony System (ACS) metaheuristic is blended with Monte Carlo simulation and DEA. The model is named ACS-DEA and is found to be able to increase the accuracy and reliability of the results. Although this model aims to assess knowledge sharing performance, it could also be used in other relevant fields in dynamic settings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
