Our model of interaction games generalizes a variety of recently studied games in game theory and distributed computing. In a local interaction games each agent is a node embedded in a graph and plays the same 2-player game with each neighbor. He can choose his strategy only once and must apply his choice in each 2-player game he is involved in. This represents a fundamental model of decision making with local interaction and distributed control. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization called 2-type interaction games, in which one 2-player game is played on edges and possibly another game is played on non-edges. For the popular case with symmetric 2 x 2 games, we show that several dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time. This includes arbitrary sequential better-response dynamics, as well as concurrent dynamics resulting from a distributed protocol that does not rely on global knowledge. We supplement these results with an experimental comparison of sequential and concurrent dynamics.", "paper_title": "Dynamics in network interaction games", "paper_id": "WOS:000309212600002"}
