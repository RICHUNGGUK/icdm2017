However, the resource constraints and vulnerable deployment environments challenge the application of this technique in terms of security and efficiency. A compromised node may forge arbitrary aggregation value and mislead the base station into trusting a false reading. In this paper, we present RAHIM, a reactive defense to secure data aggregation scheme in cluster-based wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme is based on a novel application of adaptive hierarchical level of monitoring providing accuracy of data aggregation result in lightweight manner, even if all aggregator nodes and a part of sensors are compromised in the network.", "paper_title": "RAHIM: Robust Adaptive Approach Based on Hierarchical Monitoring Providing Trust Aggregation for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298050700003"}
