The empirical Bayes approach for discovering whether results have been replicated across studies was shown to be a reliable method, and close to optimal in terms of power. Results: The R package repfdr provides a flexible implementation of the empirical Bayes approach for replicability analysis and meta-analysis, to be used when several studies examine the same set of null hypotheses. The usefulness of the package for the GWAS community is discussed.", "paper_title": "repfdr: a tool for replicability analysis for genome-wide association studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000343083600020"}
