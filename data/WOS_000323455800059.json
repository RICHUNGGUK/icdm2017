It has previously been proved that the maximum offpeak (aperiodic) autocorrelation (in absolute value) of the Chu sequence of length n is asymptotically equal to 0.480261 root n. It has also been empirically observed that the merit factor of Chu sequences appears to grow like a constant times root n. In this note, we provide an analytic proof that the merit factor of the Chu sequence of length n is bounded below by a constant multiple of root n for all n. To the author's knowledge, this is the first time a family of polyphase sequences of all lengths has been proved to have merit factor growing at least like order root n.", "paper_title": "Merit Factor of Chu Sequences and Best Merit Factor of Polyphase Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800059"}
