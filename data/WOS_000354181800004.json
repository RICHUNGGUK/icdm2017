This improvement can be achieved by introducing a policy that gives the useful cooperative regions and defines a switching threshold signal-to-noise ratio that guarantees the bit error rate (BER) of cooperative transmission is below the target. We model all links as independent non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels. We then derive closed-form expressions for the average spectral efficiency, average BER, and outage probability when an upper bound for the signal-to-noise ratio of the end-to-end relay path is applied and adaptive discrete rate is considered. Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme, compared with the outage-based AF incremental relaying, AF fixed relaying, and the conventional direct transmission, can achieve the maximum average spectral efficiency while maintaining the average BER and outage probability.
