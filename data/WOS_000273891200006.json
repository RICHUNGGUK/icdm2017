For this purpose, a model is developed based on a bulk model presented by Gambarotta and Lagomarsino, which takes the damage to the mortar joint into account. A quasi-fragile damage interface model is introduced using an asymptotic technique. This model memorizes some of the geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the interface, such as the thickness, elastic coefficients, normal and tangential stress, and the damage variable. Numerical simulations are performed using the Gyptis finite element software: academic cases involving traction and shear loads are presented. (C) 2008 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
