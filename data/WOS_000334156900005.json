The governing equations are reduced to an ordinary equation by using suitable similar transformations. Homotopy analysis method is used to obtain the expression for velocity fields. The analytical solutions are influenced by the permeation Reynolds number Re, the wall expansion ratio alpha and viscoelastic parameter omega. Graphs are sketched and the effects of some values of parameters, especially the expansion ratio and viscoelastic parameter, on the velocity fields are discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Asymmetric viscoelastic flow through a porous channel with expanding or contracting walls: a model for transport of biological fluids through vessels", "paper_id": "WOS:000334156900005"}
