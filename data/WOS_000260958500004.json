To precisely approximate alignment score significance, we draw random samples directly from a well chosen, importance-sampling probability distribution. We apply our technique to pairwise local sequence alignment of nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of length up to 1000. For instance, using a BLOSUM62 scoring system for local sequence alignment, we compute that the p-value of a score of 6000 for the alignment of two sequences of length 1000 is (3.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(-1314). Further, we show that the extreme value significance statistic for the local alignment model that we examine does not follow a Gumbel distribution.
