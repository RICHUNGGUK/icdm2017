The shared networking environment, in particular, dictates the need for mechanisms to partition network resources among virtual machines. At the same time, the performance of applications deployed over these virtual machines may be heavily impacted by the performance of the underlying network, and therefore by such mechanisms. Nevertheless, due to security and commercial reasons, providers rarely provide detailed information on network organization, performance, and mechanisms employed to regulate it. In addition, the scientific literature only provides a blurred image of the network performance inside the cloud. The few available pioneer works marginally focus on this aspect, use different methodologies, operate in few limited scenarios, or report conflicting results. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the performance of the internal network of Amazon EC2, performed by adopting a non-cooperative experimental evaluation approach (i.e. not relying on provider support). Our aim is to provide a quantitative assessment of the networking performance as a function of the several variables available, such as geographic region, resource price or size. We propose a detailed methodology to perform this kind of analysis, which we believe is essential in a such complex and dynamic environment. During this analysis we have discovered and analyzed the limitations enforced by Amazon over customer traffic in terms of maximum throughput allowed. Thanks to our work it is possible to understand how the complex mechanisms enforced by the provider in order to manage its infrastructure impact the performance perceived by the cloud customers and potentially tamper with monitoring and controlling approaches previously proposed in literature. Leveraging our knowledge of the bandwidth-limiting mechanisms, we then present a clear picture of the maximum throughput achievable in Amazon EC2 network, shedding light on when and how such maximum throughput can be achieved and at which cost.
