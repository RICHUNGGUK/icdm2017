Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is a new software development paradigm where software is generated by a series of model transformations. By combing essential features of CBD and MDA, both benefits of software reusability and development automation can be achieved in a single framework. In this paper, we propose a UML profile for specifying component-based design in MDA framework. The profile consists of UML extensions, notations, and related instructions to specify elements of CBD in MDA constructs. Once components are specified with our profile at the level of PIM, they can be automatically transformed into PSM and eventually source code implementation.", "paper_title": "A technique to represent and generate components in MDA/PIM for automation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236901100022"}
