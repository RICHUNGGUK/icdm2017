Theoretical analysis and computer simulation indicate that the improved algorithm can completely resist the two kinds of forgery attacks and also shows other better performance than the original one, such as better message and key sensitivity, statistical properties, which can satisfy the performance requirements of a more secure hash function.", "paper_title": "Improvement and performance analysis of a novel hash function based on chaotic neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600022"}
