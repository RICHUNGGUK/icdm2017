A perturbation method is employed and the primitive variables are expanded in a series with the wall amplitude as the perturbation parameter. The boundary conditions are applied at the mean surface of the channel and the first-order perturbation quantities are numerically determined by solving the governing system of ordinary differential equations by shooting technique. The present approach does not impose any restriction on the Reynolds number of the flow and the wave number and frequency of the wavy-walled channel, although it is limited by the linear analysis. The wall shear stress and the positions of flow separation and reattachment points are computed and the influence of the volume fraction density of the particles is examined. The variations of velocity and pressure of the particulate suspension flow with frequency of excitation are also presented.
