Various requirements elicitation methods have been proposed. However, existing methods still have the limitations such as a limited number of target customers, limited expression of customers' opinions, and difficulty in collecting the customers' opinions continuously. A novel method for eliciting customer requirements is proposed by utilizing a social network service (SNS), which is a shared source of raw information of the customers' needs and opinions. The proposed method is validated to show its effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of existing methods.", "paper_title": "Customer Requirements Elicitation based on Social Network Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000296698900003"}
