Examples include the online voting systems and the electronic cash systems. Since the first identity-based blind signature scheme was proposed by Zhang et al., many identity-based blind signature schemes using bilinear pairings have been proposed. But the relative computation cost of the pairing is approximately 20 times higher than that of the scalar multiplication over elliptic curve group. In order to save the running time and the size of the signature, we propose an identity based blind signature scheme without bilinear pairings. With both the running time and the size of the signature being saved greatly, our scheme is more practical than the related schemes in application. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
