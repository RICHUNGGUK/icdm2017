In fact, a lot of \"digitized\" and \"ready-to-use\" learning and teaching resources are already available online; nevertheless, we must not confuse quantity and quality, as these resources may just continue to perpetuate teacher-centred approaches, rather than student-centred approaches. The present research aimed to compare the educational values, learning effectiveness, students and teachers' perceptions of a new online educational paradigm - Situated Game-based Learning with Traditional Web-based Learning in secondary education in Hong Kong. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods were employed for data collection and analysis. Results showed that, under the present research settings, although no significant difference of students' learning outcome with respect to these two approaches was found, the participating students and teachers were quite positive towards the educational paradigm of Situated Came-based Learning. This provides vital insights and a basis for further investigating the paradigm's application and development for learning and teaching.", "paper_title": "Learning online: A comparative study of a situated game-based approach and a traditional web-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300061"}
