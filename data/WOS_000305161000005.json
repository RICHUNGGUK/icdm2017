However, patients always do not possess or comprehend professional drug facts. Many drug recognition systems offer keyword searches based on drug names, which may vary from product to product. A more robust form of search would enable users to describe the features of drugs based on their appearance. In this paper, we propose an automatic drug image identification system (ADIIS) based on multiple image features. ADIIS is able to reduce drug identification errors as well as provide more accurate drug information. In our primary experiments, by using an image, the system is able to retrieve the top ten similar drugs, enabling the user to identify the specific one. Experimental results show that the first drug of the ten identified by ADIIS was the correct drug in 92.6% of tests.", "paper_title": "AN AUTOMATIC DRUG IMAGE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM BASED ON MULTIPLE IMAGE FEATURES AND DYNAMIC WEIGHTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000005"}
