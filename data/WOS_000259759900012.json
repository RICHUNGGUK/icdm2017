Nowadays it is a lot easier to create, share and retrieve multimedia contents on the Web. However, with the increasing amount in contents retrieval becomes more challenging and often leads to inadequate search results. One main reason is that image clustering and retrieval approaches usually stick either solely to the images' low-level features or their user-generated tags (high-level features). However, this is frequently inappropriate since the \"real\" semantics of an image can only be derived from the combination of low-level and high-level features. Consequently, we investigated a more holistic view on image semantics based on a system called Imagesemantics. This system combines MPEG-7 descriptions for low-level content-based retrieval features and MPEG-7 keywords by a machine learning approach producing joined OWL rules. The rule base is used in Imagesemantics to improve retrieval results.", "paper_title": "Imagesemantics: User-generated metadata, content based retrieval & beyond", "paper_id": "WOS:000259759900012"}
