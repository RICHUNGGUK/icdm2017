In this paper, a low cost mapping system composed of a web camera with structured light and sonar sensors is presented. We propose a novel exploration strategy based on the frontier concept using the low cost mapping system. Based on the complementary characteristics of a web camera with structured light and sonar sensors, two different sensors are fused to make a mobile robot explore an unknown environment with efficient mapping. Sonar sensors are used to roughly find obstacles, and the structured light vision system is used to increase the occupancy probability of obstacles or walls detected by sonar sensors. To overcome the inaccuracy of the frontier-based exploration, we propose an exploration strategy that would both define obstacles and reveal new regions using the mapping system. Since the processing cost of the vision module is high, we resolve the vision sensing placement problem to minimize the number of vision sensing in analyzing the geometry of the proposed sonar and vision probability models. Through simulations and indoor experiments, the efficiency of the proposed exploration strategy is proved and compared to other exploration strategies.", "paper_title": "A mobile robot exploration strategy with low cost sonar and tungsten-halogen structured light", "paper_id": "WOS:000251655300005"}
