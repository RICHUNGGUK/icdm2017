Among them, the method proposed by Boldi and Vigna is known as the most efficient one. In the paper, we propose a new method to compress a Web graph. Our method is more efficient than theirs with respect to the size of the compressed data. For example, our method needs only 1.99 bits per link to compress a Web graph containing 3,216,152 links connecting 325,557 pages, while the method of Boldi and Vigna needs 2.84 bits per link to compress the same Web graph.", "paper_title": "Efficient Compression of Web Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394500009"}
