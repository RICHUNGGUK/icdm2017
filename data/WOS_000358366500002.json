The respective models are the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and the nonlinear heat equation. A partitioned coupling approach via a Dirichlet-Neumann method and a fixed point iteration is employed. As a reference solver, a previously developed efficient time-adaptive higher-order time integration scheme is used. To improve on this, we work on reducing the number of fixed point coupling iterations. Using the idea of extrapolation based on data given from the time integration by deriving such methods for SDIRK2, it is possible to reduce the number of fixed point iterations further by up to a factor of two with linear extrapolation performing better than quadratic. This leads to schemes that can use less than two iterations per time step. Furthermore, widely used vector extrapolation methods for convergence acceleration of the fixed point iteration are tested, namely Aitken relaxation, minimal polynomial extrapolation and reduced rank extrapolation. These have no beneficial effects. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Fast solvers for unsteady thermal fluid structure interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000358366500002"}
