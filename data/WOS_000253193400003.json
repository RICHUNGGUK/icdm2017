It is shown that the Markov parameters of a TTS distribution can be approximated in terms of the Markov parameters of its fast distribution only. This is an O(epsilon(1-i)) approximation, which deteriorates by a factor of 1/epsilon at each step as higher order Markov parameters are computed. In order to use the Markov parameters of the slow distribution in the approximation scheme, an inversion map is introduced by which a TTS distribution and its slow distribution are mapped into two new distributions. It is then shown that every Markov parameter of the inverted distribution approximates that of the inverted slow distribution with an O(epsilon) accuracy. An approximate expression for the Hankel matrix of the Markov parameters of a TTS distribution is also obtained. This expression is in the form of a telescopic series and involves the Markov parameters of the fast distribution only.", "paper_title": "Realization theory for two-time-scale distributions through approximation of Markov parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000253193400003"}
