Design/methodology/approach - A parametric method of establishing deterministic solutions for energy and momentum on the basis of quantized energy limits (instead of HUP) if developed in the non-infinite non-zero quantized energy limits where hidden deterministic solutions can be obtained for micro/nano structures. Findings - The philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics as developed by Max Planck, Neils Bohrz, Werner Heisenburg, Dirac and Edwein Schrodinger is based on a duality concept of complimentarity notions. In most general logical sense for any physical reality qualitative dualism have to have a quantitative dualism may be hidden or virtual. The upper and lower limits of the dynamical quantum mechanical observables are determined based on the dimensional considerations for the physical constants H, C, G and H-0. The conceptual basis and mathematical framework of the paper in based Norbert Wiener's work on theory of cybernetics and D. Dutta Majumdars' unified cybernetic and general dynamical systems theory. Research limitations/implications - The testability of the theory needs to be established. Originality/value - Without challenging HUP this is a contribution of tremendous practical implications.", "paper_title": "A new look at the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle - A cybernetics and general dynamical systems approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000247988900017"}
