The model is an expansion of the traditional flexural fibre beam formulations to cases where multiaxial behaviour exists, being an alternative to plane and solid FE models for the nonlinear analysis of entire frame structures. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Shear is taken into account at different levels of the numerical model: at the material level RC is simulated through a smeared cracked approach with rotating cracks; at the fibre level, an iterative procedure guarantees equilibrium between concrete and transversal reinforcement, allowing to compute the biaxial stress-strain state of each fibre; at the section level, a uniform shear stress pattern is assumed in order to estimate the internal shear stress-strain distribution; and at the element level, the Timoshenko beam theory takes into account an average rotation due to shear. Findings - The proposed model is validated through experimental tests available in the literature, as well as through an experimental campaign carried out by the authors. The results on the response of RC elements critical to shear include displacements, strains and crack patterns and show the capabilities of the model to efficiently deal with shear effects in beam elements. Originality/value - A formulation for the nonlinear shear-bending interaction based on the fixed stress approach is implemented in a fibre beam model. Shear effects are accurately accounted during all the nonlinear path of the structure in a computationally efficient manner.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear analysis of RC beams using a hybrid shear-flexural fibre beam model", "paper_id": "WOS:000343322300015"}
