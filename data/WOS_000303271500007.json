Knowledge based systems can, in combination with automated sensor measurements, improve the patients' ability to review their state of health and make informed decisions. The Arden Syntax as a standardized language to represent medical knowledge can be used to express the corresponding decision rules. In this paper we introduce ARDEN2BYTECODE, a newly developed open source compiler for the Arden Syntax. ARDEN2BYTECODE runs on Java Virtual Machines (JVM) and translates Arden Syntax directly to Java Bytecode (JBC) executable on JVMs. ARDEN2BYTECODE easily integrates into service oriented architectures, like the Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) platform. Apart from an evaluation of compilation performance and execution times, ARDEN2BYTECODE was integrated into an existing knowledge supported exercise training system and recorded training sessions have been used to check the implementation.
