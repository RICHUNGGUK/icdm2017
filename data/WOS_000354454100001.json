In this article, we will prove that t-fold perfect splitting authentication codes with equal deception probabilities can be characterized in terms of orthogonal multiarrays. We will also investigate the existence of orthogonal multi-arrays, and show that the existence of orthogonal multi-arrays OMA(t, k x c, n)s is equivalent to the existence of transversal splitting t-designs splitting TD(t, kxc, n)s. Further, we obtain some new infinite classes of t-fold perfect splitting authentication codes with equal deception probabilities.", "paper_title": "A construction of t-fold perfect splitting authentication codes with equal deception probabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000354454100001"}
