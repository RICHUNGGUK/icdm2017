Several findings previously reported at low dimensions do not apply in high dimensions. For example, none of the FS methods investigated improved SVM accuracy, indicating that the SVM built-in regularization is sufficient. These results were also validated using microarray data. Moreover, all FS methods tend to discard many relevant features. This is a problem for applications such as microarray data analysis, where identifying all biologically important features is a major objective.", "paper_title": "Evaluating feature selection for SVMs in high dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000067"}
