Following a power capture model, with incoherent addition of interfering signals, upper bounds and lower bounds on the throughput performance are derived analytically. Comparing the upper and lower bounds, it is seen that for propagation delays (normalized by the transmission period) less than one, the bounds are tight on the stable side of the throughput curves, i.e., for mean offered traffic rate G less than G* (the mean offered traffic for which maximum throughput is achieved). In particular, the maximum point on the upper bound is seen to be very close to that on the lower bound, hence providing very tight bounds for the maximum throughput.", "paper_title": "Bounds on Throughput of CSMA in Weibull Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100016"}
