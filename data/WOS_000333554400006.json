These algorithms are collected from recent literature and include heuristic, evolutionary, and statistical methods. To provide a fair comparison, the algorithms are classified according to the approach used and examined against a large set of metrics. In particular, the effectiveness of each algorithm was evaluated for the optimization of a multiprocessor platform, considering initial setup effort, rate of convergence, scalability, and quality of the resulting optimization. Our experiments are performed with statistical rigor, using a set of very diverse benchmark applications (a video converter, a parallel compression algorithm, and a fast Fourier transformation algorithm) to take a large spectrum of realistic workloads into account. Our results provide insights on the effort required to apply each algorithm to a target design space, the number of simulations it requires, its accuracy, and its precision. These insights are used to draw guidelines for the choice of DSE algorithms according to the type and size of design space to be optimized.", "paper_title": "A Comparative Evaluation of Multi-Objective Exploration Algorithms for High-Level Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000333554400006"}
