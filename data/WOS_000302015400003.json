A survey of 131 Chief Information Officers and 103 senior non-IS managers of U.S. manufacturing firms found that more situation analysis, less strategy conception, and less strategy implementation planning predicted greater IS contribution to the organization. These findings suggest that planners consider conducting situational analysis with greater meticulousness, and strategy conception and strategy implementation planning with greater agility than they currently do.", "paper_title": "Less is More: Information Systems Planning in an Uncertain Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000302015400003"}
