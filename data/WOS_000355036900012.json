A wide set of economic indicators is used to derive two-level approach: micro and macro topologies. We use the methodology of the optimized spiral spherical self-organizing map, a version of Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps, which overcomes some of the major deficiencies found in standard methods. In dynamic analysis we recover the path of the integration process itself by calculating the dynamics of the countries around the sphere and by examining the measure of dispersion. The simultaneous comparison of the micro and macro levels provides deeper insights into the banking sector integration process. Both models, the micro and macro, unveil the formation of two banking clusters, which, with the exception for Greece, coincides with a division between new and old member states. Both clusters intensify integration within their cluster. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
