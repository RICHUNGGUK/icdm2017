We decorate proofs with terms and introduce various term-reduction systems representing proof transformations. In contrast to previous papers which gave different arguments for Cut-admissibility suggesting weakly normalising procedures for Cut-elimination, our main reduction system and all its variations are strongly normalising, with the variations corresponding to different optimisations, some of them with good properties such as confluence.", "paper_title": "Strong cut-elimination systems for Hudelmaier's depth-bounded sequent calculus for implicational logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085600031"}
