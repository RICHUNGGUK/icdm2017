This system uses a combination of asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) and pulse amplitude modulated discrete multitone (PAM-DMT) techniques, which can be used in intensity modulated direct detection (IM/DD) optical wireless (OW) systems. In this hybrid scheme, ACO-OFDM and PAM-DMT signals are transmitted together. Clipping noise is estimated at the receiver and canceled to recover the PAM-DMT symbols. This scheme does not require any DC bias for transmission, which makes the transmitter less complex and very power efficient. With this system, we can increase the data rate of the ACO-OFDM system by almost twice. In addition, no bandwidth penalty is incurred. Extensive computer simulations show that the bit-error rate (BER) performance of ACO-OFDM in the additive white Gaussian noise environment is not affected by any kind of interference, but only due to half of the available transmit power, we see a 3 dB degradation. However, the BER performance of PAM-DMT shows some degradation at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but is identical to the conventional scheme at higher SNR. We also see a slight improvement in peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the output combined signal. Therefore, advantages such as increased data rate, DC-bias elimination, no bandwidth, and PAPR penalty make this scheme very attractive for OW systems using IM/DD.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Asymmetrically Clipped OFDM-Based IM/DD Optical Wireless System", "paper_id": "WOS:000334507900004"}
