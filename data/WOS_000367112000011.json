Two crystal structures of ligand-free PR20 with the D25N mutation of the catalytic aspartate (PR20(D25N)) revealed three dimers with different flap conformations. The diverse conformations of PR20(D25N) included a dimer with one flap in a unique \"tucked\" conformation; directed into the active site. Analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the ligand-free PR20 and wild-type enzymes showed that the mutations in PR20 alter the correlated interactions between two monomers in the dimer. The two flaps tend to fluctuate more independently in PR20 than in the wild type enzyme. Combining the results of structural analysis by X-ray crystallography and MD simulations; unusual flap conformations and weakly correlated inter-subunit motions may contribute to the high level resistance of PR20.
