Because of the low power design constraint, both the input and output impedances of the embedded current buffer are included for regulator stability analysis. A damping factor control technique is employed to ensure stability for the regulator with a small on-chip capacitor. Our analysis shows that the regulator provides a phase margin of greater than 45 degrees over the full load current variation from 1 to 500 mu A. Measurements show that the output voltage variation is less than 110 mV when the input voltage changes from 2.5 to 4 V under the same conditions of load current change, which indicates that the performance of the regulator is suitable for the RFID tag IC. The regulator consumes 10 mu A of current and generates a nominal output of 1.8 V. The regulator design technique was successfully implemented in a fully-integrated HF-band passive RFID tag IC that satisfies the ISO-14443 type-B protocol. The tag chip is fabricated in a 1-poly 6-metal low-power 0.18 mu m CMOS technology with a CoSi2-Schottky diode and EEPROM process.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design of a low power regulator for a fully integrated HF-band passive RFID tag IC", "paper_id": "WOS:000301376100008"}
