An essential part of macroprudential oversight concerns the tasks of early identification and assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. Yet, while risk identification and assessment oftentimes makes use of analytical tools, the analytical literature lacks a focus on a third task of risk communication. This article aims at summarizing key contributions of a PhD thesis that concerns models for the tasks of risk identification, assessment and communication. To integrate the three tasks, the thesis makes use of methods from the fields of data mining and knowledge discovery, not the least those for exploratory data analysis. The aim of the thesis is not only to apply methods for macroprudential oversight, but also to develop and extend methods according to the needs for the task.", "paper_title": "Mapping financial stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000336524000006"}
