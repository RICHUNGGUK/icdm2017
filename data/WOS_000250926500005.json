This results in unacceptable response times. Parallel processing using a cluster of workstations has of late emerged as a practical solution to many compute and data intensive problems. In this article, we present parallel algorithms for some of the OLAP operators. We have implemented these parallel solutions for a data warehouse implemented on Oracle hosted in a cluster of workstations. Our performance studies show that encouraging speedups are achieved.", "paper_title": "Parallel processing of olap queries using a cluster of workstations", "paper_id": "WOS:000250926500005"}
