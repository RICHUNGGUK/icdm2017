By introducing the server-storage terminals and implementing the multilevel security access control mechanism based on the Bell-LaPadula model, process creation supervision, and an auditing mechanism, the CPCE/MLS system is able to provide the security guarantee of the whole computing environment. As such, each terminal is controlled under an integrated security policy. The performance test results show that the CPCE/MLS system, without optimization, generates great overhead but achieves significantly better performance after the cache mechanism is added in the monitor agent and in the hook driver. The system with the hook driver cache mechanism is able to achieve the 95.9% throughput of the native system with 8 K and 16 K requested data blocksize.", "paper_title": "Implementation and performance analysis of multilevel security system in pervasive computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000326805000008"}
