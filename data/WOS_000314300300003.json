The arrival processes are independent Poisson processes, and the repair times are independent and identically exponentially distributed. The item types are exchangeable, and a failed item from base 1 could just as well be returned to base 2, and vice versa. The rule according to which backorders are satisfied by repaired items is the longest queue rule: At the completion of a service (repair), the repaired item is delivered to the base that has the largest number of failed items. We point out a direct relation between our model and the classical longer queue model. We obtain simple expressions for several probabilities of interest, and show how all two-dimensional queue length probabilities may be obtained. Finally, we derive the sojourn time distributions.", "paper_title": "Repair systems with exchangeable items and the longest queue mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000314300300003"}
