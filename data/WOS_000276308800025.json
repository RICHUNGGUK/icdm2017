Two 5D sensors can be combined to obtain a 6D transformation similar to the ones provided by the point-based registration in optical tracking. However, estimates of the tool tip uncertainty, which we have called the target tracking error (TTE) since no registration is explicitly performed, are not available in the same manner as their optical counterpart. If the systematic bias error can be corrected and estimates of the 5D or 6D fiducial localizer error (FLE) are provided in the form of zero mean normally distributed random variables in and R(6), respectively, then the TTE can be modeled. In this paper, the required expressions that model the TTE as a function of the systematic bias, FLE and target location are derived and then validated using Monte Carlo simulations. We also show that the first order approximation is sufficient beyond the range of errors typically observed during an image-guided surgery (IGS) procedure. Applications of the models are described for a minimally invasive intracardiac surgical guidance system and needle-based therapy systems. Together with the target registration error (TRE) statistical models for point-based registration, the models presented in this article provide the basic framework for estimating the total system measurement uncertainty for an IGS system. Future work includes developing TRE models for commonly used registration methods that do not already have them.", "paper_title": "Target Tracking Errors for 5D and 6D Spatial Measurement Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000276308800025"}
