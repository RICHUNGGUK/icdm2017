In this paper, using the theoretical analysis, we mainly study the self-shrinking sequence based on the 1-sequence, and the theoretical results reflect its good cryptography properties accurately, such that it has the last period T = p(e)(p - 1)/2 when T is an odd number, and the expected value of its autocorrelation belongs to {0, 1/T} and the variance is O(T / ln(4) T). Furthermore, we find that the 2-adic complexity of the self-shrinking sequence based on the I-sequence is large enough to resist the Rational Approximation attack.", "paper_title": "The Properties of the FCSR-Based Self-Shrinking Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000315244800027"}
