We propose a multi-channel MAC protocol for data channel competition. Theoretical and simulation results show that this protocol resolves all channel collisions in only a few iterations. Moreover, the collision resolution time is dominated by the number of channels, rather than the number of D2D transmitters. Thus, even in scenarios with densely-distributed D2D devices, the proposed protocol can guarantee short collision resolution time.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Multi-Channel Feedbackless MAC Protocol for D2D Broadcast Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000373738600026"}
