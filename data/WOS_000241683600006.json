To verify goals given in natural language, a translation of those goals to the formalism of the verification tool is required. The main concern is to assure equivalence of the final translation and the original. A structured method is required to assure equivalence in every case. This article proposes a goal formalisation method in five steps, in which the domain expert is involved in such a way that the correctness of the result can be assured. The contribution of this article is a conceptual goal model, a formal expression language for this model, and a structured method which transforms any input goal to a fully formalised goal in the required target formalism. The proposed formalisation method guarantees essential properties like correctness, traceability, reduced variability and reusability.", "paper_title": "From natural language to formal proof goal - Structured goal formalisation applied to medical guidelines", "paper_id": "WOS:000241683600006"}
