Taking advantage of the inner iterative structures of crypto-cores, test facilities are easily set-up for circular self-test of the crypto-cores, built-in pseudorandom test generation and response analysis for other cores in the host device. Main advantages of the proposed test implementation are an architecture with no visible scan chain, 100% fault coverage on crypto-cores with negligible area overhead, availability of pseudorandom test sources, and very low aliasing response compaction for other cores.", "paper_title": "Self-Test Techniques for Crypto-Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000273774700017"}
