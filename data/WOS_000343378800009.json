In a fuzzy communication structure the membership of the players and the relations among them are leveled. Now we study a Banzhaf value for these situations. The Myerson model is followed to define the fuzzy graph Banzhaf value taking as base point the Choquet integral. We propose an axiomatization for this value introducing leveled amalgamation of players. An algorithm to calculate this value is provided and its complexity is studied. Finally we show an applied example computing by this fuzzy value the power of the groups in the European Parliament. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
