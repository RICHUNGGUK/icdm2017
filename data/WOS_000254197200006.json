Common criticisms that we have encountered are described, and for each one we attempt to give a balanced perspective of the criticism. A model of intra-state conflict is used to help demonstrate these points. We conclude that multi-agent models for social systems are most useful when (1) the connection between micro-behaviors and macro-behaviors are not well-understood and (2) when data collection from the real-world system is prohibitively expensive in terms of time or money or if it puts human lives at risk.
