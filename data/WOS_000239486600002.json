Our algorithm uses multilayered Photomosaics with database enrichment by element rotation. The benefit of this algorithm is that an artist can not only produce a digital mosaic with a relatively small database without degrading the quality of the mosaic, but that the Multi-layered Stack Mosaic also generates unique and strong artistic expressions which gives an illusion of piled stackable objects. Since the result has a unique visual style, we intend to exhibit our mosaic images at galleries such as the Epson Color Imaging Contest and the CAU Art Center(1).", "paper_title": "Multi-layered stack mosaic with rotatable objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600002"}
