However, the efficiency depends on the computational complexity of the algorithm. This paper optimizes the two main aspects of the reconciliation process of the continuous key distribution: the partition of interval and the estimation of bit. We use Gaussian approximation to effectively speed up the convergence of algorithm. We design the estimation function as the estimator of the SEC (sliced error correction) algorithm. Therefore, we lower the computational complexity and simplify the core problem of the reconciliation algorithm. Thus we increase the efficiency of the reconciliation process in the continuous key distribution and then the ratio of the secret key distribution is also increased.", "paper_title": "Realization of error correction and reconciliation of continuous quantum key distribution in detail", "paper_id": "WOS:000269899800006"}
