To cope with this problem, in this paper we propose a technique that allows to transform the measurement data in a representation format meeting two main objectives at the same time. Firstly, it allows to perform a number of operations directly on the transformed data with a controlled loss of accuracy, thanks to the mathematical framework it is based on. Secondly, the new representation has a small memory footprint, allowing to reduce the space needed for data storage and the time needed for data transfer. To validate our technique, we perform an analysis of its performance in terms of accuracy and memory footprint. The results show that the transformed data closely approximates the original data (within 5% relative error) while achieving a compression ratio of 20%; storage footprint can also be gradually reduced towards the one of the state-of-the-art compression tools, such as bzip2, if higher approximation is allowed. Finally, a sensibility analysis show that technique allows to trade-off the accuracy on different input fields so to accommodate for specific application needs, while a scalability analysis indicates that the technique scales with input size spanning up to three orders of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Efficient Storage and Processing of High-Volume Network Monitoring Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000209724000005"}
