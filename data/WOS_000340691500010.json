Hence in any one of such categories, it is straightforward to consider spaces of continuous functions without bothering about ensuring that they be topological spaces. We test this fact with the notion of sober topological space, producing a synthetic characterization of those topological spaces which are sober in terms of a construction on equilogical spaces of functions.
