Then a concrete algorithm named autonomic particle swarm compensation algorithm (APSCA) is proposed to generate the compensation scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed APSCA is effective to resolve the coverage problems induced by the outage. In the simulation scenario, almost 98.3% users that would otherwise be dropped will be served by the surrounding cells, and the block probabilities of the compensating cells are still kept on the accepted levels.", "paper_title": "Centralized Management Mechanism for Cell Outage Compensation in LTE Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000311735500001"}
