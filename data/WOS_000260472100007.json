This case study deals with leading Chinese researchers in the field of plant molecular life sciences who returned to their home country. A correlation analysis of their mobility history, publication output, and international co-publication data, shows the relationship between scientific output, levels of international collaboration and various individual characteristics of returned researchers. The outcome of the analysis suggests that while host countries may loose human capital when Chinese scientists return home, the so-called \"return brain drain\", they may also gain in terms of scientific linkages within this rapidly emerging and globalizing research field.", "paper_title": "Chinese researchers returning home: Impacts of international mobility on research collaboration and scientific productivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000260472100007"}
