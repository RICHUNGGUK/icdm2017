The time domain of load is discretized and the local load is approximated by SFM under LSF. With this local domain moving, whole load is described. The response matrix is formed through assembling the responses of shape function loads in all local domains and the forward model is established. The regularization is adopted to overcome the ill-posedness of load reconstruction. Compared with Green's kernel function method (GKFM), SFM_MLSF approximates load more smoothly, so the ill-posedness is improved. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of SFM_MLSF.
