These characteristics add to the importance of making groups more cohesive in their goals, commitment, and ability to work toward completion of the new system Project. Such cohesiveness is built partly through the willingness of the learn members to participate and commitment to learning the new system. To determine if these relationships hold, a survey of users and managers in Taiwan was conducted to test a model derived from social capital theory. The data support the positive relationships between group cohesion and both willingness to participate and commitment to learning. Group cohesion is likewise positively related to meeting management goals. Resources within an organization should support the climate of learning and the building of team participation.
