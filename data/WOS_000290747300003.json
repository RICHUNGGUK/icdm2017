It is highly desirable to develop computational models that can predict the inhibitive effect of a compound against a specific CYP isoform. In this study, inhibitor predicting models were developed for five major CYP isoforms, namely 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, using a combined classifier algorithm on a large data set containing more than 24,700 unique compounds, extracted from PubChem. The combined classifiers algorithm is an ensemble of different independent machine learning classifiers including support vector machine, C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and naive Bayes, fused by a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). All developed models were validated by 5-fold cross-validation and a diverse validation set composed of about 9000 diverse unique compounds. The range of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the validation sets was 0.764 to 0.815 for CYP1A2, 0.837 to 0.861 for CYP2C9, 0.793 to 0.842 for CYP2C19, 0.839 to 0.886 for CYP2D6, and 0.754 to 0.790 for CYP3A4, respectively, using the new developed combined classifiers. The overall performance of the combined classifiers fused by BP-ANN was superior to that of three classic fusion techniques (Mean, Maximum, and Multiply). The chemical spaces of data sets were explored by multidimensional scaling plots, and the use of applicability domain improved the prediction accuracies of models. In addition, some representative substructure fragments differentiating CYP inhibitors and noninhibitors were characterized by the substructure fragment analysis. These classification models are applicable for virtual screening of the five major CYP isoforms inhibitors or can be used as simple filters of potential chemicals in drug discovery.", "paper_title": "Classification of Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors and Noninhibitors Using Combined Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000290747300003"}
