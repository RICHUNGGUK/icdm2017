Differential correlations are computed to remove common channel effects so that two sets of synchronization signals can be combined to obtain enhanced detection quality. To achieve low complexity, we further adopt one-bit quantization and exploit the properties of limited offset in the indices of the two maximal-length sequences. The arithmetic complexity of the proposed algorithm is significantly reduced while attaining similar detection performance comparable to the conventional schemes. Finally, hardware architecture of the proposed algorithm is presented to demonstrate feasibility and efficiency in the implementation.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Cell Search Algorithm for Interleaved Concatenation ML-Sequences in 3GPP-LTE Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200005"}
