The solution processes and the final solution forms are more simple and accurate than the current GFWM solution, which use samples of the alpha-cuts and get the final solutions approximately. Numerical examples illustrate the analytical solution computing processes for fuzzy weighted average (FWA), fuzzy weighted harmonic mean (FWHM), fuzzy weighted geometric mean (FWGM) and GFWM with exponential and power functions, respectively.", "paper_title": "AN ANALYTICAL SOLUTION METHOD FOR THE GENERALIZED FUZZY WEIGHTED AVERAGE PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000320617600007"}
