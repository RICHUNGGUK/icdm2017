For an ordered k-partition pi = {S-1, S-2...S-k} of V, the partition representation of v with respect to pi is the k-vector r(v vertical bar pi) = (d(v, Si), d(v, S-2)...d(v, S-k)). The k-partition pi is a resolving partition if the k-vectors r(v vertical bar pi), v is an element of V (G) are distinct. The minimum k for which there is a resolving k-partition of V is the partition dimension of G. Salman et al. [1] in their paper which appeared in Acta Mathematica Sinica, English Series proved that partition dimension of a class of circulant graph G(n,+/-{1, 2}), for all even n >= 6 is four. In this paper we prove that it is three. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "On the partition dimension of a class of circulant graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000334974100004"}
