We suppose that multi-class data points in high-dimensional space tend to move due to local intra-class attraction or inter-class repulsion and the optimal embedding from the point of view of classification is discovered consequently. After being embedded into a low-dimensional subspace, data points in the same class form compact submanifod whereas the gaps between submanifolds corresponding to different classes become wider than before. Experiments on the UMIST and MNIST databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
