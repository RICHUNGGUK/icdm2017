A federated filter is employed to fuse the data transmitted over the network, which plays an important role in the data-processing center. The stability of filters under the network is considered; an algorithm to deal with the delayed data is introduced, and the principle for data fusion is presented. Finally, two numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Networked Data Fusion With Packet Losses and Variable Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000267865400003"}
