In this paper, we present a formal fuzzy object-oriented database model. Based on the semantic measure of fuzzy data, we first identify two kinds of fuzzy object redundancies, which are inclusion redundancy and equivalence redundancy, and then define three kinds of merging operation for redundancy removal. On the basis, we define some fuzzy algebraic operations for fuzzy classes and fuzzy objects. Finally, in the paper, we discuss fuzzy querying strategies and give the form of SQL-like fuzzy querying for the fuzzy object-oriented databases.", "paper_title": "Algebraic operations in fuzzy object-oriented databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000341182600002"}
