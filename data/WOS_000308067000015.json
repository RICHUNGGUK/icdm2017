The resulting model is a 2D system of balance laws with a source term depending on the layering procedure and the choice of coupling fluxes, which is established in terms of upwind considerations. The \"2.5D\" system is discretized via a WENO-TVD scheme based in a flux-limiter approach. We study four tests cases related to atmospheric phenomena to analyze the physical validity of the model.
