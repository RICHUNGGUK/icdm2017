However, in MD simulations, the search for an optimal ligand-receptor complex geometry is frequently trapped in locally stable non-native binding geometries. A Hamiltonian replica-exchange (H-REMD)-based protocol has been designed to enhance the sampling of putative ligand-receptor complexes. It is based on softening nonbonded ligand-receptor interactions along the replicas and one reference replica under the control of the original force field. The efficiency of the method has been evaluated on two receptor-ligand systems and one protein-peptide complex. Starting from misplaced initial docking geometries, the H-REMD method reached in each case the known binding geometry significantly faster than a standard MD simulation. The approach could also be useful to identify and evaluate alternative binding geometries in a given binding region with small relative differences in binding free energy.", "paper_title": "Protein-Ligand Docking Using Hamiltonian Replica Exchange Simulations with Soft Core Potentials", "paper_id": "WOS:000337937100013"}
