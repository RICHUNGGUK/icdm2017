We introduce a notion of rule interesting-ness that measures the level of the interest of the topic within a context, and provide an algorithm to compute concise representations of interesting context-topic rules. Finally, we present the results of applying the methodology proposed to a large data log of a search engine.", "paper_title": "Discovering context-topic rules in search engine logs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241594700029"}
