In this article, we pm posed a new batch verifying multiple RSA digital signatures scheme. The main contribution of the proposed scheme is that it can easily discover where the signature-verification fault is located without re-verifying all individual signatures separately.", "paper_title": "A BATCH VERIFYING AND DETECTING THE ILLEGAL SIGNATURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700001"}
