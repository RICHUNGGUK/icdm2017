In this paper an algorithm is developed that, for a given benzenoid system G with m edges, computes the edge-Wiener index of G in O(m) time. The key to the algorithm is a reduction of the problem to three different weighted trees. In addition to the previously used weighted vertex- and edge-Wiener indices, the so-called weighted vertex-edge-Wiener index is introduced and essentially used in the algorithm.", "paper_title": "The Edge-Wiener Index of Benzenoid Systems in Linear Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000365373800005"}
