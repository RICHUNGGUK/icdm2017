Thus, most of these systems are not adapted to inter-enterprise cooperation. As we are interested in workflow processes, we aim, through this paper, to present a model supporting dynamic heterogeneous workflow process interconnection. We consider the interconnection of enterprise workflow processes as the management of a \"workflow of workflows\" in which several heterogeneous workflow systems coexist. This paper introduces our process interconnection model, its implementation, and its validation through experimentation. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
