Based on the GM(1, 1) model, the CCPSO algorithm is adopted to solve the values of parameters a and b in GM(1, 1) model. This is how the way we come up with the CCPSO algorithm-based GM. As can be seenfrom experimental results of case simulation on the power consumption in three regions, the CCPSO-GM model is better than the other four forecasting models, which attests its wide applicability and high forecasting accuracy.", "paper_title": "A Fast and Stable Forecasting Model to Forecast Power Load", "paper_id": "WOS:000353551500012"}
