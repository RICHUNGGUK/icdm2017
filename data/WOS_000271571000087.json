The system involves body dimension collection, clothing pattern generation and fabric cutting. First, body dimensions can be collected by analyzing the 3D scanning images or 2D photographs. Further, the clothing patterns can be generated by using computer-aided design (CAD) techniques based on the collected dimensions. By presenting the generated clothing patterns in DXF (Drawing Exchange Format), the CNC laser-cutting machine can then cut the fabric into pattern pieces automatically, Finally, by integrating the system with the processes of garment sewing, fitting test and final adjustment, the concept of customized clothing making can be realized. It can not only assure good fitness of the customized clothing but also reduce human efforts, costs, and production time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
