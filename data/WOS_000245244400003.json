Munro and Raman stated this problem in J. Algorithms (13, 1992) and gave an in-place but unstable sorting algorithm that performs O(n) data moves and O(n(1+epsilon)) comparisons. Subsequently (Algorithmica, 16, 1996) they presented a stable algorithm with these same bounds. Recently, Franceschini and Geffert (FOCS 2003) presented an unstable sorting algorithm that matches the asymptotic lower bounds on all computational resources.", "paper_title": "Sorting stably, in place, with O (n log n) comparisons and O(n) moves", "paper_id": "WOS:000245244400003"}
