Specifically, based on the NGFZF, infinitely many ZFs (as error functions) can be readily generated by successively selecting the different values of its parameters. Besides, by employing the NGFZF, a novel general-form Zhang neural net (NGFZNN) is proposed and studied for real-time solution of a time-varying matrix inverse (also termed, Zhang matrix inverse, ZMI). Moreover, a link between ZMI and Drazin inverse is discovered and further generalized to solve for the time-varying Drazin inverse (TVDI). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
