Human body parts are first recognized from a human depth silhouette via trained random forests (RFs). PDA is applied to each recognized body part, which is presented as a set of points in 3D, to estimate its principal direction. Finally, a 3D human pose is recovered by mapping the principal direction to each body part of a 3D synthetic human model. We perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our proposed 3D human pose recovering methodology. We show that our proposed approach has a low average reconstruction error of 7.07 degrees for four key joint angles and performs more reliably on a sequence of unconstrained poses than conventional methods. In addition, our methodology runs at a speed of 20 FPS on a standard PC, indicating that our system is suitable for real-time applications. Our 3D pose recovery methodology is applicable to applications ranging from human computer interactions to human activity recognition.", "paper_title": "Real-time 3D human pose recovery from a single depth image using principal direction analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000341094000010"}
