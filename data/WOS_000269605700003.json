The Semantic Web Service has shown promise for automatic chaining of Web services. This paper addresses semi-automatic geospatial service chaining through Semantic Web Services-based process planning. Process planning includes three phases: process modeling, process model instantiation and workflow execution. Ontologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning methods are employed in process planning to help a user dynamically create an executable workflow for earth science applications. In particular, the approach was implemented in a common data and service environment enabled by interoperable standards from OGC and W3C. A case study of the chaining process for wildfire prediction illustrates the applicability of this approach.", "paper_title": "Semantic Web Services-based process planning for earth science applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000269605700003"}
