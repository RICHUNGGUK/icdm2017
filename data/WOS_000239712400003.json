Using recently-developed techniques, we construct the Evans function characterising the stability of both stationary and travelling wave solutions, under the assumption that the firing rate function is the Heaviside step. We find that these differences in timing for the two populations can cause instabilities of these solutions, leading to, for example, stationary breathers. We also analyse \"anti-pulses\", a novel type of pattern for which all but a small interval of the domain (in moving coordinates) is active. These results extend previous work on neural fields with space-dependent delays, and demonstrate the importance of considering the effects of the different time-courses of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity.", "paper_title": "The importance of different timings of excitatory and inhibitory pathways in neural field models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239712400003"}
