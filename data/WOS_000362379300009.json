This approach is based on the temporal discretization using continuous Runge-Kutta-type methods, and the spatial discretization using pseudospectral methods or Gauss-Legendre collocation methods. The local energy conservation law of our new schemes is analyzed in detail. The effectiveness of the novel local energy-preserving integrators is demonstrated by coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations and 2D nonlinear Schrodinger equations with external fields. Our new schemes are compared with some classical multi-symplectic and symplectic schemes in numerical experiments. The numerical results show the remarkable long-term behaviour of our new schemes.
