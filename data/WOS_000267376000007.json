At the same time contrast ratio enhancement is necessary for improving the image quality of display devices. The histogram equalization (HE) is an important contrast ratio enhancement method. But sometimes HE can produce unrealistic effects in images. In this paper, a new method of combining dynamic contrast ratio enhancement and inverse gamma correction for AC PDP is proposed. The dynamic contrast ratio enhancement and the inverse gamma correction are realized simultaneously in the proposed method. Furthermore the over-enhancement caused by the traditional HE can be avoided. A real-time image processor with the proposed method was designed and implemented. Simulations and experimental results on a 50-in. AC PDP show that the image quality of AC PDP can be improved obviously. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
