Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) do exactly the same. However, RBFs solve an exact interpolation problem - expensive but accurate - while vortex methods sacrifice accuracy through quasi-interpolation for the absence of a matrix inversion. We show that vortex-RBF algorithms with spectral accuracy are stable for flows on the sphere. The version in Eulerian coordinates is fast; the fully-Lagrangian variant is much slower for a given basis size N, but is highly adaptive for advection-dominated flows. Both versions are excellent for small-to-medium-N problems - N up to 10,000, say, where N is the number of RBF grid points/vortex blobs. Neither is good for large N problems because the cost of the Eulerian model scales as N-2 per timestep while the Lagrangian vortex-RBF method scales as N-3. The slow-Lagrangian scheme is unique among vortex methods in being genuinely (like its Eulerian sibling) a spectrally-accurate method: for laminar flows the error falls exponentially fast with N.
