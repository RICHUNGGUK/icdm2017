It returns trustworthy topologies by searching across a space of thousands of possible topologies defined by hierarchically organized analog structural building blocks. \"Structural homotopy\" conducts search at several objective-function tightening levels (numbers of process corners) simultaneously. Multiobjective evolutionary search returns sized topologies which trade off power, area, performances, and yield. An experimental validation run returned 78 643 Pareto-optimal designs, having 982 sized topologies with various specification/yield combinations. A decision tree is extracted to visualize the performance-topology relationship.", "paper_title": "Variation-Aware Structural Synthesis of Analog Circuits via Hierarchical Building Blocks and Structural Homotopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000269155200001"}
