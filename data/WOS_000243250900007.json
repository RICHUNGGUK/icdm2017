It is significantly deteriorated if one tries to achieve high embedding rate keeping other parameters unaltered. In literatures, typically various transformations like DFT, DCT, Fourier-Mellin and wavelet are used for SS multimedia watermarking but little studies have been attempted so far to see what are the possible factors which can improve robustness. The current paper has critically analyzed few such factors namely design of code pattern, proper signal decomposition suitable for data embedding, direction of decomposition, selection of regions for data embedding, signaling scheme, choice of modulation functions and embedding strength. Based on the observation, wavelet based SS watermarking scheme is proposed and improvement in robustness performance is verified through experimental results as well by mathematical analysis.
