This paper illustrates an interactive visual tool, based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), to study the morphological and metabolic changes of brain structures in a patient with unipolar depression. In particular, this application provides a comprehensive representation of structures and neurotransmission changes involved in the pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorders. The ICT tool may be helpful to learn complex brain changes associated with depression. Some advantages of this approach in relation to conventional techniques are discussed.", "paper_title": "Understanding Major Depression in a Digital Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000209590100003"}
