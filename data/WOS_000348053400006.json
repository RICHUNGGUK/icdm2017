Associative processor combines data storage and data processing, and functions as a massively parallel SIMD processor and a memory at the same time. An analytic performance model of this computer architecture is introduced. Comparative analysis supported by cycle-accurate simulation and emulation shows that this architecture may outperform a conventional computer architecture comprising a SIMD coprocessor and a shared last-level cache while consuming less power.", "paper_title": "Computer Architecture with Associative Processor Replacing Last-Level Cache and SIMD Accelerator", "paper_id": "WOS:000348053400006"}
