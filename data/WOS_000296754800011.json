The proposed method firstly uses the sensor characteristics to model the observation process of both MS and Pan images. Then, the cost function with respect to the estimated high-resolution MS images is constructed based on the ML estimation. Finally, the fused images are obtained using a steepest descent optimization algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can have better spectral result compared with the WT fusion method and perform as well as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) fusion method with a lower computational cost.", "paper_title": "FUSION OF IKONOS IMAGERY BASED ON MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754800011"}
