Within this model, matroids arise from a natural subclass and can be characterized by the optimality of the greedy algorithm. This model includes and extends many of the models for generalized matroid-type greedy algorithms proposed in the literature and, in particular, integral polymatroids. We discuss the relationship between these general matroids and classical matroids and provide a Dilworth embedding that allows us to represent matroids with underlying partial order structures within classical matroids. Whether a similar representation is possible for matroids on convex geometries is an open question.", "paper_title": "A general model for matroids and the greedy algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000264103300007"}
