In this study, traffic matrix estimation is investigated in IP networks and an Elman neural network-based traffic matrix inference (ENNTMI) method is proposed. In ENNTMI, the conventional Elman neural network is modified to capture the spatio-temporal correlations and the time-varying property, and certain side information is introduced to help estimate traffic matrix in a network accurately. The regular parameter is further introduced into the optimal equation. Thus, the highly ill-posed nature of traffic matrix estimation is overcome effectively and efficiently.", "paper_title": "An Accurate Method to Estimate Traffic Matrices from Link Loads for QoS Provision", "paper_id": "WOS:000286292500013"}
