In particular, we find exact formulas for the numbers of matchings and independent sets of given cardinalities in three types of uniform chains. Further, we show that two of those three types are extremal with respect to the number of considered structures among all chains of a given length. The paper also presents some results on polyphenylene dendrimers.", "paper_title": "Matchings and Independent Sets in Polyphenylene Chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000301817800003"}
