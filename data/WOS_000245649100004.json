This new criterion takes in as a parameter the class of opponents. We then provide a modular approach for achieving effective agent-centric learning; the approach consists of a number of basic algorithmic building blocks, which can be instantiated and composed differently depending on the environment setting (for example, 2- versus n-player games) as well as the target class of opponents. We then provide several specific instances of the approach: an algorithm for stationary opponents, and two algorithms for adaptive opponents with bounded memory, one algorithm for the n-player case and another optimized for the 2-player case. We prove our algorithms correct with respect to the formal criterion, and furthermore show the algorithms to be experimentally effective via comprehensive computer testing.", "paper_title": "A general criterion and an algorithmic framework for learning in multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000245649100004"}
