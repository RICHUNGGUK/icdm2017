This paper proposes a five-step methodology to model and control whole hospital occupancy. The hospital system is viewed using a continuous-time, fluid tank analogy. The system is subsequently discretized and a framework using control theory and Model Predictive Control (MPC) is developed to assist in tactical decision making, while maintaining occupancy targets. The result is a customizable modeling approach that represents interactions between different hospital areas, and interactions between the hospital and the outside world, or the population seeking hospital services.
