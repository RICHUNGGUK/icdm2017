GE results are presented using images. Each image contains several vertical lanes. Each lane consists of several horizontal bands. Two lanes are identical if the relative positions of the bands are the same. We present a computer method designed to compare the lanes and identify identical lanes. This method, developed using many image-processing techniques, is applied to segment the lanes and bands in GE images. The lanes are then converted into \"position vectors\" that describe the positions of the bands. Comparing lanes becomes equivalent to comparing the position vectors. This method can accurately identify identical lanes, helping biologists to identify the identical lanes from many lanes with much less effort.", "paper_title": "Automatic method to compare the lanes in gel electrophoresis images", "paper_id": "WOS:000245158600007"}
