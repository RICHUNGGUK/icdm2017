Since environment protection has been of concern to public in recent years, and the traditional supplier selection did not consider about this factor; therefore, this paper introduced green criteria into the framework of supplier selection criteria. The aim of this research was to develop an optimum mathematical planning model for green partner selection, which involved four objectives such as cost, time, product quality and green appraisal score. In order to solve these conflicting objectives, we adopted two multi-objective genetic algorithms to find the set of Pareto-optimal solutions, which utilized the weighted sum approach that can generate more number of solutions. In experimental analysis, we introduced a {4,4,4,4} supply chain network structure, and compared average number Pareto-optimal solutions and CPU times of two algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
