We created a formal model to support the design of distributed video servers that adapt dynamically and automatically to the changing client demands, network and host parameters. The model makes giving estimations about the available throughput possible, and defines evaluation criteria for VoD services relating to utilization and load balance, video usage, client satisfaction and costs. The dynamism of the frame model originates from the possible state transitions which have to be defined in a core model. The core model is responsible for configuration recommendation which determines how clients are served depending on the properties of their requests, system configuration and system load. Furthermore, it decides on the optimal placement of the server components in the network. The usability of the model is illustrated on examples.", "paper_title": "Designing and scaling distributed VoD servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000261953400003"}
