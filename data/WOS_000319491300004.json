We propose and computationally compare three Mixed-Integer Programming models for the 2DCSP developing formulations from the literature. The first two models have a polynomial and pseudo-polynomial number of variables, respectively, and can be solved with a general-purpose MIP solver. The third model, having an exponential number of variables, is solved via branch-and-price techniques. We conclude the paper describing the results of extensive computational experiments on a set of benchmark instances from the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
