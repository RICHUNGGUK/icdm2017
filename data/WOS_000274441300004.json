It provides protection from denial by one of the entities involved in a communication of parties participating in all or part of communication. In practice, a non-repudiation property is an important evidence for accounting for or tracking a system or tracking to illegal connections. However, a password-based communication system does not provide the non-repudiation property for connection evidence. In this paper, a dynamic session key policy (DSKP) with a non-repudiation signature scheme for secure mobile networks authentication is proposed. The proposed non-repudiation signature scheme is a mixed method which combines a one-way hash function and a traditional digital signature technique. Since computational cost usually is an important issue in a mobile environment, the proposed scheme can provide additional non-repudiation properties satisfying the future needs of electronic evidences such as accounting, auditing, logging, and tracking of connections to a mobile network system at the expense of a small additional computing load for the mobile devices. Besides, it can also achieve the same security services from a security and performance analysis point of view.
