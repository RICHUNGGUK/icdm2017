It is seen that, in order to remove the effects of the input disturbances and reduce both the structural and empirical risks of the SLFN, the input weights of the SLFN are assigned such that the hidden layer of the SLFN performs as a pre-processor, and the output weights are then trained to minimize the weighted sum of the output error squares as well as the weighted sum of the output weight squares. The performance of an SLFN-based signal classifier trained with the proposed robust algorithm is studied in the simulation section to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the new scheme.
