Models for traffic, emissions, atmospheric dispersion, and stormwater contamination are studied with particular emphasis on their couplings to create a modelling chain. The models must be carefully selected according to the requirements and level of detail of the integrated modelling chain. Although a fair amount of research has been conducted to link air pollution and road traffic, many questions related to spatio-temporal scales, domains of validity, consistency among models, uncertainties of model simulation results, and interfaces between models remain open. The aim of this work is to review the current status of the relationships between traffic, emissions, air quality, and water quality models, to recommend modelling approaches and to propose some directions for improving the state of the science. The difficulties and challenges associated with model coupling are illustrated with specific examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
