A Nitadori-like formula is discovered for an optimal quantizer when rho(Delta= sigma(p)/sigma(q)) = 1/2. Also it is shown that the distortion expressions derived rigorously for asymptotically optimal quantile quantizers essentially confirm the heuristically obtained previous result that the distortion decreases as 1/N(3)/p for the heavy mismatch of rho = 3/2, and as 1/N(2) for the critical mismatch of rho < 3/2, and as for the mild mismatch of, where N is the number of quantization points. These asymptotic behaviors agree surprisingly well with Bennett's integral even in the critical and heavy mismatched cases. Thus, in the case of nonuniform quantizers, the long-conjectured convergence of the MSE distortion to zero at a rate other than 1/N(2) is confirmed rigorously. In addition, optimal uniform quantizers are found to be heavily mismatched when rho > 1 and the resulting distortion decreases as (In N/N(2))(1/rho).", "paper_title": "Variance-Mismatched Fixed-Rate Scalar Quantization of Laplacian Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500037"}
