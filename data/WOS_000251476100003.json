Kinetic parameters for the peritoneal function were determined by the simultaneous numerical optimization techniques (SNOT). Furthermore dialysis outcome and ultrafiltration volume were estimated and predicted by using the kinetic model with a set of optimal kinetic parameters, which were in agreement with measured data (r(2) > 0.82). The clinical implementation of the SNOT is very useful to explore the better prescriptions for each patient's clinical condition. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
