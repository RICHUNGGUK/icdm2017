This necessitates extensive simulation of controllers to ensure stability and performance. However, simulations cannot capture all aspects of a flight control, such as sensor noise and actuator lag. For these reasons. hardware in the loop simulation (HILS) platforms are used. In this paper, a novel HILS platform is presented for vision-based control of UAV's. This HILS platform consists of virtual reality software to produce realistic scenes projected onto a screen and viewed by a camera. Flight hardware includes an UAV with onboard autopilot interfaced to the virtual reality software. This UAV can be mounted in a wind tunnel, allowing attitude regulation through servoing the airfoils. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
