This addition allows the assessment of: (1) context-stimulus competition, by treating contextual cues as ordinary background stimuli present throughout the whole experimental session; (2) summation, by computing compound stimuli with contextual cues as an integrating feature, with and without the addition of specific configural cues; and (3) contingency effects in causal learning. These new functionalities broaden the range of experimental designs that the simulator is able to replicate, such as some recovery from extinction phenomena (e.g., renewal effects). In addition, the new version permits specifying probe trials among standard trials and extracting their values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
