The proposed approach combines a robust optimization with corner analysis, machine learning techniques and distributed processing capability able to deal with multi-objective and constrained optimization problems. The resulting optimization tool and the improvement in design productivity is demonstrated for the design of CMOS operational amplifiers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
