Our approach fully utilizes the distributed computing and rendering capabilities of visualization clusters that are driving tiled display walls. A seamless and unified workspace spanning across the entire wall is provided, while view dependent resource management strategies support smooth and fully interactive data analysis of a collection of images. Interactive image filtering and graphing techniques are presented, allowing features in individual images and patterns in image sets to be visualized on the fly. The provided case studies show that the presented approach can scale well beyond terapixel-scale visualization while providing highly responsive interactive environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
