Usually, with the aim to increase the efficiency, a geothermal heat exchanger is added to the installation. This component shows a disturbing effect on the ground where it is placed. On this research a bioinspired system was developed to test the ground temperature behavior where there is a heat exchanger. The novel approach has been implemented and tested under a real dataset. One year temperature measurements were recorded. The final approach is based on clustering and regression techniques. Then, the model was validated and tested with a dataset from a real installation with a good performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
