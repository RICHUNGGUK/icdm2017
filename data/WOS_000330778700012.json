Moreover, since the 1980s grammars have been used in computer vision and related areas. Some factors accountable for this increasing use regard its relatively simple understanding and its ability to represent some semantic pattern models found in images, both spatially and temporally. The objective of this article is to present an overview regarding the use of syntactic pattern recognition methods in image representations in several applications. To achieve this purpose, we used a systematic review process to investigate the main digital libraries in the area and to document the phases of the study in order to allow the auditing and further investigation. The results indicated that in some of the studies retrieved, manually created grammars were used to comply with a particular purpose. Other studies performed a learning process of the grammatical rules. In addition, this article also points out still unexplored research opportunities in the literature.", "paper_title": "Using Grammars for Pattern Recognition in Images: A Systematic Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000330778700012"}
