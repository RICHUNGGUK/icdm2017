This paper deals with the qualitative analysis of a prey-dependent predator-prey system in which a disease is spreading among the prey species only. We have analysed the behaviour of the system around each equilibrium and obtained conditions for global stability of the system around an equilibrium by using suitable Lypunov functions. We have also worked out the region of parametric space under which the system enters a Hopf bifurcation and a transcritical bifurcation but does not experience either saddle-node bifurcations or pitchfork bifurcations around the disease-free equilibrium E-2. Finally, we have given an example of a real ecological situation with experimental data simulations.", "paper_title": "Role of transmissible disease in an infected prey-dependent predator-prey system", "paper_id": "WOS:000246154200004"}
