In H we may write (there exists ab)alpha and (for all ab)alpha, which is semantically equivalent to alpha(a, b) V alpha(b, a) and alpha(a, b) boolean AND alpha(b, a), respectively. We show that H with cuts restricted to Sigma(1) formulas (we denote this system H-1) simulates efficiently the Hajos calculus (HC) for constructing graphs which are non-3-colorable. This shows that short proofs over formulas that assert the existence of permutations can capture polynomial time reasoning (as by [9], HC is equivalent in strength to EF, which in turn captures polytime reasoning). We also show that EF simulates efficiently H*(1), which is H-1 with proofs restricted to being tree-like. In short, we show that H*(1) <= p EF <= p H-1.", "paper_title": "A propositional proof system with quantification over permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000250383000005"}
