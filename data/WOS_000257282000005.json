The study is based on a formulation that call be easily employed for a preliminary design of multi-suspended roofs subjected to seismic loads. Specifically, applying Lagrange's equations, the corresponding set of equations of motion for discrete models of multiple suspension roofs is obtained and numerical integration of the equations of motion is performed via the Runge-Kutta scheme. For representative realistic combinations of geometric, stiffness and damping parameters, a non-linear analysis is employed to study the behavior of suspended roofs for near-source and far-field seismic motions. The analysis demonstrates that: (i) code-specified design loads could dramatically underestimate the response of suspended roofs subjected to near-source ground motions and (ii) flexible rooting systems are greatly affected by near-source ground motions, a behavior that is not observed for stiff systems.
