Our numerical simulations are conducted using the deterministic discrete velocity method, for Knudsen numbers (Kn) ranging from 0.05 to 10. While we provide numerically accurate data, our aim is to assess the accuracy of the ES-BGK model for these flows. By comparing with data from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and the Boltzmann equation, the ES-BGK model is found to be able to predict accurate velocity and temperature profiles in the slip flow regime (0.01 < Kn <= 0.1), for both low-speed and high-speed flows. In the transition flow regime (0.1 < Kn <= 10), however, the model does not quantitatively capture the viscous heating effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
