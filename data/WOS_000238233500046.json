In accordance with, this paper proposes a novel resource allocation scheme improving both the capability of QoS-provisioning for multiple users and the overall data throughput. Towards this, the modified resource allocation technique combined with the modified largest weighted delay first (M-LWDF) scheme will be exploited upon considering statistical channel behavior as well as real time queuing analysis connected to resource allocation. In order to verify the validity of the proposed resource allocation scheme, the time division multiple access (TDMA) system will be considered as a target application. The simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme gives rise to superior performance in a way of showing results of several performance measures under time-varying wireless fading channel.", "paper_title": "Multiuser temporal resource allocation scheme using link layer effective capacity for QoS provisioning systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500046"}
