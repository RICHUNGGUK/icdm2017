Although various approaches have been proposed to solve the problems, they either utilize numerous extra binary variables and constraints to reconstruct the problems for finding a global solution or are unable to obtain globally optimized solutions. This study proposes a novel linearization method that employs a logarithmic number of extra binary variables and constraints to reformulate a signomial term with discrete variables. The original nonlinear integer program is therefore converted into a mixed-integer linear program solvable to obtain a global optimum. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed methods in solving nonlinear integer problems, especially for treating signomial functions with large-interval variables or multiple variables.
