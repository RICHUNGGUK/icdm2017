Image disparity is used for improving the quality of the texture. The robot head switches dynamically, based on robot operation between the stereoscopic configuration and the panoramic configuration.", "paper_title": "A dynamically reconfigurable stereoscopic/panoramic vision mobile robot head controlled from a virtual environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000259961600003"}
