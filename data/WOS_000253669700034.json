Estimation of parameters in such situations is considered when the mean and variance of one variable is a linear and a positive function of the other variable. This is typically true of bivariate t distribution. The resulting estimators are found to be remarkably efficient. Hypothesis testing procedures are developed and shown to be robust and powerful. Real life examples are given. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
