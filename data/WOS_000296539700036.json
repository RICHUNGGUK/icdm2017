AISC 341-05 assumes that the beam-to-column connection would reach its critical limit state before the column splice does. Estimating seismic demands on column splices involves both ground motion and structural parameters, i.e., it is a high order nonlinear and complex problem. This study presents a Neural Network (NN) model to estimate the seismic demands on column splices in low-, medium-, and high-rise steel moment frames. Nine input parameters and 6 output parameters were used to construct the NN model. The effect of each input parameter on the output parameters (seismic demands on column splices and frame) was investigated through a sensitivity analysis based on the NN model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
