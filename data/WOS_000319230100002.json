Among them, the computational approach emerged on the stage with the development of computer science and computer vision focusing researchers interests in this area. However, computer scientists often face the difficulty of how to construct a computational model of selective attention working on their own purpose. Here, we critically review studies of selective attention from a multidisciplinary perspective to take lessons from psychological and biological studies of attention. We consider how constraints from those studies can be imposed on computational models of selective attention.", "paper_title": "A critical review of selective attention: an interdisciplinary perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000319230100002"}
