While the renewable energy can somehow alleviate this problem, the routing, flow rate, and power still have to be well investigated with the objective of minimizing energy consumption in multi-hop energy renewable wireless mesh networks (ER-WMNs). This paper formulates the problem of network-wide energy consumption minimization under the network throughput constraint as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem by jointly optimizing routing, rate control, and power allocation. Moreover, the min-max fairness model is applied to address the fairness issue because the uneven routing problem may incur the sharp reduction of network performance in multi-hop ER-WMNs. Due to the high computational complexity of the formulated mathematical programming problem, an energy-aware multi-path routing algorithm (EARA) is also proposed to deal with the joint control of routing, flow rate, and power allocation in practical multi-hop WMNs. To search the optimal routing, it applies a weighted Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, where the weight is defined as a function of the power consumption and residual energy of a node. Extensive simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed schemes and the effects of energy replenishment rate and network throughput on the network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Green Communication in Energy Renewable Wireless Mesh Networks: Routing, Rate Control, and Power Allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347015800016"}
