In the scheme, each class's CAC thresholds are solved through establishing a reward-penalty model which strives to maximize network's revenue. In order to lower Handoff Dropping Probability (HDP), the scheme joints packet and connection levels Quality of Service constraints, designing a bandwidth degradation algorithm to accept handoff calls by degrading existing calls bandwidth during network congestion. Analyses show that the CAC thresholds change adaptively with the average call arrival rate. The performance comparison shows that the proposed scheme outperforms the Mobile IP Reservation scheme.", "paper_title": "Adaptive call admission control based oil reward-penalty model in wireless/mobile network", "paper_id": "WOS:000248356900005"}
