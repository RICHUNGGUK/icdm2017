In many situations, there are machines in parallel and the skills of workers might be different due to their individual experience. In this paper, we study a uniform parallel machine problem in which the objective is to jointly find an optimal assignment of operators to machines and an optimal schedule to minimize the makespan. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed and computational experiments are conducted to evaluate their performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
