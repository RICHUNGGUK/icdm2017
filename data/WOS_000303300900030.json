The main idea of the presented method consists in the introduction of the fuzzy self-tuning mechanism for adaptation of the sliding mode control parameters - extended feedback and switching gains. Such modification reduces the well-known chattering problem in classical sliding mode control. In comparison with the other algorithms eliminating this problem the proposed method results in faster convergence and more transparent and interpretable design of self-tuning mechanism. Moreover, the proposed method guaranteing the asymptotic reference signal tracking with bounded system signals can be easily implemented to high order systems. The performance of the presented control design is demonstrated on control of a nonlinear electro-hydraulic servo mechanism. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
