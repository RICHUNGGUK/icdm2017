Consequently, it is difficult to make informed design decisions about technologies to support their intergenerational interactions. This paper investigates one particularly important type of intergenerational interaction, namely play. The paper presents research that examines grandparent-grandchildren interactions in preschool playgroups. Through the use of vignettes drawn from observation of playful activity, pertinent features of intergenerational play are identified, focussing on the roles grandparents and grandchildren use when playing together. The results are relevant to researchers wishing to understand intergenerational play and to technology designers wanting to support it.", "paper_title": "Come play with me: designing technologies for intergenerational play", "paper_id": "WOS:000300778300003"}
