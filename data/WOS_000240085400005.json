The CSP model is transformed into a discrete optimization problem with boundary constraints and is solved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) in this paper. To improve the performance of the proposed PSO algorithm, ERA(Environment, Reactive rules, Agent) model is used to proceed with local search after the process of boundary constraints. Further improvement including nohope and tabu list are also combined with PSO. When particles can not explore more search space, nohope is introduced to improve the activities of particles. Tabu list is used to avoid cycling in the global best particle. We experiment with random constraint satisfaction problem instances based on phase transition theory. Experimental results indicate that the hybrid algorithm has advantages on the search capability and the iterative number.", "paper_title": "A hybrid particle swarm optimization for binary CSPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400005"}
