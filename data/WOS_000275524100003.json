Many results involving this constraint have been published in recent years. But there is no recent paper to summarize them. To be convenient for interested researchers, we make this survey. in this paper, complexity results, exact algorithms and approximation algorithms in single machine, parallel machine, flow shop, open shop, job shop scheduling environment with different criteria are Surveyed briefly.
