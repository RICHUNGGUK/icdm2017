Previous studies have focused mainly on enhancing the awareness of the current working status of teammates, such as web pages being viewed, or other web activities, and they seldom take into account past working/browsing information, such as web pages visited or past web activities. However, the awareness of this kind of historical information can be useful for group collaboration. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to sharing web page visitation information among teammates. We present the design and implementation of our prototype, named Shared Browsing History. We then describe two user studies in which three groups with eight participants each used the prototype. The results of these studies show that our approach was effective in enhancing participants' group awareness and improved group collaborative efficiency in programming and software development tasks.
