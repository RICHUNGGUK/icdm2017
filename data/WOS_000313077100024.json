The optimized results indicate that the lowest-energy structures of the anionic and neutral Al (n) S (m) clusters prefer the low spin multiplicities (singlet or doublet) except the Al(2)aEuro3/4, Al-2, S-2, Al-4 and Al2S4 clusters. A significant odd-even oscillation of the highest occupied-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) energy gaps for the Al (n) S (m) aEuro3/4 clusters is observed. Electron detachment energies (both vertical and adiabatic) are discussed and compared with the photoelectron spectra observations. Furthermore, a good agreement between experimental and theoretical results gives confidence in the most stable clusters considered in the present study and validates the chosen computational method. In addition, the variation trend of chemical hardness is in keeping with that of HOMO-LUMO energy gaps for the Al (n) S (m) clusters. Upon the interaction of oxygen with the stable AlS (m) aEuro3/4 clusters, the dissociative chemisorptions are favorable in energy. The binding energy and Gibbs free energy change show completely opposite oscillating behaviors as the cluster size increases.", "paper_title": "Probing the structural and electronic properties of aluminum-sulfur Al (n) S (m) (2 a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand n plus m a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 6) clusters and their oxides", "paper_id": "WOS:000313077100024"}
