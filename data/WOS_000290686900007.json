The oil flow visualization results reveal the characteristics of the flow pattern on the upper surface of the oblique plate, including the formation of separation, reattachment lines and the variation of these lines when the angle of attack changes. The smoke visualization results show the vortex structure above the oblique plate so as to demonstrate and interpret the flow pattern captured in the oil flow visualization.", "paper_title": "A visualization study of the near-wall behaviors of an oblique plate at different angles of attack", "paper_id": "WOS:000290686900007"}
