The proposed system has better stability characteristics compared to conventional shunt APF topologies and it is a natural filter for the non-linear load harmonic disturbances. The tuned passive filters are connected at the ac-side of the rectifier load, which are designed to provide fundamental reactive power compensation and eliminate majority of load harmonics in order to minimize the power rating and heat dissipation of the voltage source inverter (VSI). The control scheme is based on a decoupled state-space equations of the T-type APF using separate proportional-integral controllers in d-axis and q-axis of rotating reference frame synchronized with grid voltages, respectively. The fundamental components of load-side currents are feed-forwarded in the current control loop using two groups of synchronous frame adaptive linear neural networks (ADALINEs) to ensure a fast dynamic response. A proportional-integral controller is adopted in the outer voltage loop for balancing the active power flow of the dc-side capacitor of the VSI. The proposed power factor corrector topology is studied analytically and by simulation under various scenarios using Matlab/Simulink. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed topology as well as its control schemes are substantially confirmed by the simulation results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
