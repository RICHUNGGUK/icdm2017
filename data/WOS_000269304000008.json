Here it is shown that this automaton accurately represents the image of the represented two-dimensional shift of finite type under a block code. It is then shown that these automata can be used to check for a certain type of two-dimensional transitivity in the factor language of the corresponding shift space and how this relates to periodicity in the two-dimensional case. The paper closes with a notion of \"follower sets\" that are used to reduce the size of the automata representing two-dimensional sofic shifts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
