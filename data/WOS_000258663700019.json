Using a fixed point theorem for operators on a cone, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of at least three positive solutions to the above boundary value problem. The interesting point is that the nonlinear term f is involved with the first-order delta derivative explicitly. Meanwhile, an example is worked out to demonstrate the main results.
