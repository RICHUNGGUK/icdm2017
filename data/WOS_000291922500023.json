By recasting the problem, which is essentially a combinatorial counting problem, into a probabilistic setting, we are able to derive new lower and upper bounds on the capacity of (0, k)-RLL systems. These bounds are better than all previously-known analytical bounds for k >= 2, and are tight asymptotically. Thus, we settle the open question: what is the rate at which the capacity of (0, k)-RLL systems converges to 1 as k -> infinity? We also provide the first nontrivial upper bound on the capacity of general (d, k)-RLL systems.", "paper_title": "New Bounds on the Capacity of Multidimensional Run-Length Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500023"}
