To provide robust healthcare services, recognition of patient daily life activities is required. Context information in combination with user real-time daily life activities can help in the provision of more personalized services, service suggestions, and changes in system behavior based on user profile for better healthcare services. In this paper, we focus on the intelligent manipulation of activities using the Context-aware Activity Manipulation Engine (CAME) core of the Human Activity Recognition Engine (HARE). The activities are recognized using video-based, wearable sensor-based, and location-based activity recognition engines. An ontology-based activity fusion with subject profile information for personalized system response is achieved. CAME receives real-time low level activities and infers higher level activities, situation analysis, personalized service suggestions, and makes appropriate decisions. A two-phase filtering technique is applied for intelligent processing of information (represented in ontology) and making appropriate decisions based on rules (incorporating expert knowledge). The experimental results for intelligent processing of activity information showed relatively better accuracy. Moreover, CAME is extended with activity filters and T-Box inference that resulted in better accuracy and response time in comparison to initial results of CAME.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Healthcare Service Provisioning Using Ontology with Low-Level Sensory Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000300514600008"}
