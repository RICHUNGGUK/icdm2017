These protocols have significantly improved the performance of MAC layer in theory. However, two critical characteristics, low transmission rates and long preambles, found in the commercial modem-based real systems, severely degrade the performance of existing MAC protocols in the real world. Thus, a new practical MAC design is demanded. Toward an efficient approach, this paper analyzes the impact of these two modem characteristics on the random access-based MAC and handshake-based MAC, which are two major categories of MAC protocols for UANs. We further develop the nodal throughput and collision probability models for representative solutions of these two MAC protocol categories. Based on the analyses, we believe time sharing-based MAC is very promising. Along this line, we propose a time sharing-based MAC and analyze its nodal throughput. Both analytical and simulation results show that the time sharing-based solution can achieve significantly better performance.", "paper_title": "Toward Practical MAC Design for Underwater Acoustic Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352569000015"}
