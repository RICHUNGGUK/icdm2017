We test this approach for the shallow water equations in one and two spatial dimensions. We obtain interesting results for a shock tube, reflection of a shock wave and nonstationary two-dimensional propagation. This contribution shows the ability of vectorial lattice Boltzmann schemes to simulate strong nonlinear waves in nonstationary situations.", "paper_title": "Simulation of strong nonlinear waves with vectorial lattice Boltzmann schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000347229100015"}
