The model is aimed at the reconstruction of motion trajectories of the shank, thigh and HAT (Head-Arms-Trunk) segments in sit-to-stand-motion using low cost inertial sensors. For this purpose the Extended Kalman filter is applied for fusion of model data and data acquired through measurements. The simplifications, like motion constraint to sagittal plane, symmetry of movement and assumption of ideal joints are introduced in the model. Model validation was performed on simulated data and on measurements data acquired with the Optotrak optical motion analysis system. Obtained results are presented and discussed.
