Different from LRU-related caching or buffering studies, we are interested in prediction-based prefetching based on given execution traces of application executions. An implementation strategy is proposed for the storage of the prefetching information with limited SRAM and run-time overheads. An efficient prediction procedure is presented based on information extracted from application executions to reduce the performance gap between NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory in reads. With the behavior of a target application extracted from a set of collected traces, we show that data access to NOR flash memory can respond effectively over the proposed implementation.", "paper_title": "A Strategy to Emulate NOR Flash with NAND Flash", "paper_id": "WOS:000208424300002"}
