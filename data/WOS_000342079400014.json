The circuit is based on phase-tunable dividers and uses delay-locked loops, which provide phase accuracy for the quadrature signals as well as low-sensitivity of the phase error against temperature and power supply variations. Thanks to the adopted technique, the phase error can be further reduced by trimming the reference voltage of the delay-locked loops through a calibration digital word, which can be stored in a non-volatile memory during manufacturing. The I/Q generator exhibits an absolute phase error before calibration that is lower than 1.5A degrees. The I/Q phase drift due to temperature variations from -40 to 85 A degrees C and power supply variations from 1.1 to 1.3 V is 0.3A degrees and 0.2A degrees, respectively. By dividing the overall frequency range into four 165-MHz wide sub-bands and using only four 5-bit calibration words, the I/Q phase variation with respect to frequency, temperature, and power supply is lower than 1A degrees in the 300-960 MHz operating band. The I/Q generator is implemented in a 90-nm CMOS technology and exhibits a current consumption as low as 0.5 mA.", "paper_title": "Low-power broadband quadrature signal generator based on phase-tunable dividers", "paper_id": "WOS:000342079400014"}
