Feature extraction prior to predictive modeling is a common strategy in prediction from temporal data. A fundamental dilemma in this strategy, however, is the extent to which the extraction should be guided by domain knowledge, and to which extent it should be guided by the available data. The two temporal abstraction procedures compared in this case study differ in this respect. Methods and material: The first temporal abstraction procedure derives symbolic descriptions from the data that are predefined using existing concepts from the medical language. In the second procedure, a large space of numerical meta features is searched through to discover relevant features from the data. These procedures were applied to a prediction problem from intensive care monitoring data. The predictive value of the resulting meta features were compared, and based on each type of features, a class probability tree model was developed. Results: The numerical meta features extracted by the second procedure were found to be more informative than the symbolic meta features of the first procedure in the case study, and a superior predictive performance was observed for the associated tree model. Conclusion: The findings indicate that for prediction from monitoring data, induction of numerical meta features from data is preferable to extraction of symbolic meta features using existing clinical concepts.
