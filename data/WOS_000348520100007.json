The phenomenon of missing measurements occurs in a random way and the missing probability is governed by a set of stochastic variables obeying the given Bernoulli distribution. By exploiting the projection theory combined with stochastic analysis techniques, a Kalman-type receding horizon filter is put forward to facilitate the online applications. Furthermore, by utilizing the conditional expectation, a novel estimation scheme of state covariance matrices is proposed to guarantee the implementation of the filtering algorithm. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the established filtering scheme.", "paper_title": "Receding horizon filtering for a class of discrete time-varying nonlinear systems with multiple missing measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000348520100007"}
