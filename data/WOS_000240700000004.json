Our long-term research objective is to fully understand the extent to which relationships and constraints in ontology-based descriptions of problem domains, working together with description logic reasoning engines, can influence and improve system-level design procedures, particularly in the early stages of development where errors may have a significant long-term impact, but if detected early are cheap to correct. As a first step, we develop a port jack ontology for a home theater system and exercise rule sets for combinations of correct/incorrect connectivity. The model checking procedure begins with the formulation of a port jack ontology that will describe allowable constraining relationships in the port and jack connectivity. Allowable types of connections are expressed in the form of domain restrictions.
