In the current paper we build on that model, showing that certain queries and constraints correspond to lifting problems, as found in modern approaches to algebraic topology. In our formulation, each SPARQL graph pattern query corresponds to a category-theoretic lifting problem, whereby the set of solutions to the query is precisely the set of lifts. We interpret constraints within the same formalism, and then investigate some basic properties of queries and constraints. In particular, to any database pi, we can associate a certain derived database Qry(pi) of queries on pi. As an application, we explain how giving users access to certain parts of Qry(pi), rather than direct access to pi, improves the ability to manage the impact of schema evolution.", "paper_title": "Database queries and constraints via lifting problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344392000002"}
