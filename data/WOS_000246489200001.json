With this choice, spurious reflections are avoided, even though the thickness of the layer is finite. We show that such choice is easy to implement in a finite element method and overcomes the dependency of parameters for the discrete problem. Finally, its efficiency and accuracy are illustrated with some numerical tests. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
