The finite field multiplication over GF(2(m)) is the most important arithmetic for performing the ECC. Portable devices usually have restricted computation power and memory resources. This work will present a simple method for designing a Gaussian normal basis (GNB) multiplier over GF(2(m)) needing only fewer computation power whereas keeping lower cost. The proposed Gaussian NB multiplier saves similar to 57% space complexity as compared with existing GNB multiplier.", "paper_title": "Low-complexity Gaussian normal basis multiplier over GF(2(m))", "paper_id": "WOS:000312962100009"}
