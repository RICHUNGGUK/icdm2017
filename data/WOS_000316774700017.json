We consider the alpha-cuts of an IF-set A as crisp sets consisting of those elements x for which the truth value (in fuzzy logic) of the statement \"x belongs to A and it is not true that x does not belong to A\" is at least a. We describe properties of such cuts depending on the chosen type of conjunction and negation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
