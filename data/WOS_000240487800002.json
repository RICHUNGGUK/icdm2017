It discovers interesting associations or correlation relationships among a large set of data items, showing attribute values that occur frequently together in a given dataset. Despite their great potential benefit, current association rules modeling tools are far from optimal. This article studies how visualization techniques can be applied to facilitate the association rules modeling process, particularly what visualization elements should be incorporated and how they can be displayed. Original designs for visualization of rules, integration of data and rule visualizations, and visualization of rule derivation process for supporting interactive visual association rules modeling are proposed in this research. Experimental results indicated that, compared to an automatic association rules modeling process, the proposed interactive visual association rules modeling can significantly improve the effectiveness of modeling, enhance understanding of the applied algorithm, and bring users greater safisfaction with the task. The proposed integration of data and rule visualizations can significantly facilitate understanding rules compared to their nonintegrated counterpart.", "paper_title": "Design and evaluation of visualization support to facilitate association rules modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000240487800002"}
