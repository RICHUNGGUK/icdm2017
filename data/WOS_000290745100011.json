A common procedure involves two independent phases: reducing the dimensionality of local features and then performing clustering. Since the two phases are disconnected, dimensionality reduction does not necessarily capture the dimensions that are greatly helpful for codebook creation. What's more, some dimensionality reduction techniques such as the principal component analysis do not take class separability into account and thus may not help build an effective codebook. In this paper, we propose the weighted adaptive metric learning (WAML) which integrates the two independent phases into a unified optimization framework. This framework enables to select indispensable and crucial dimensions for building a discriminative codebook. The dimensionality reduction phase in the WAML is optimized for class separability and adaptively adjusts the distance metric to improve the separability of data. In addition, the video word weighting is smoothly incorporated into the WAML to accurately generate video words. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach builds a highly discriminative codebook and achieves comparable results to other state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
