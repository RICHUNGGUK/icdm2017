The system integrates an external computer equipped with a graphic processing unit card into the magnetic resonance scanner's image reconstruction pipeline. The system promotes fast online reconstruction for computationally intensive algorithms making them feasible in a busy clinical service. Analysis and improvement of execution time of the complex, iterative reconstruction algorithm is presented. Specifically, optimizations were examined that allowed fast reconstruction of data that were acquired in an arbitrary manner. The system was successfully used in research and clinical studies requiring high data throughput.
