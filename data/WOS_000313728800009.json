In order to do so, three steps are taken. The first step is to characterize the achievable rate of the QF scheme over a discrete memoryless half-duplex relay channel. Then, the achievable rate over a corresponding additive white Gaussian noise channel is obtained (the specific assumption regarding the CSI in this paper makes this step nontrivial). With the results from the first two steps, performance measures such as outage probability, expected rate, and diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) over slow fading channels are evaluated. It is shown that the QF scheme can significantly out-perform the compress-and-forward scheme at finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and it can achieve the optimal DMT at asymptotically high SNR. Moreover, it is shown that simple feedback from the destination node to the relay node can further improve the performance of the QF scheme.", "paper_title": "Half-Duplex Relaying Over Slow Fading Channels Based on Quantize-and-Forward", "paper_id": "WOS:000313728800009"}
