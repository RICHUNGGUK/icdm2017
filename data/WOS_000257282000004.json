When a beam is considered then the effects of the longitudinal restraints by the adjacent structure and the rotational restraint by the connections has to be taken into account. Because of structural interaction, the beam behaviour at elevated temperature is rather complex. This paper presents a numerical parametric study of a structural system consisting of an exposed steel beam restrained between a pair of fire protected steel columns. The structural sub-frame is modelled using 3D shell elements, thereby taking into account the effect of the local failure modes, and the realistic behaviour of the sub-frame exposed to natural fire. The numerical model accounts for the initial geometrical imperfections, nonlinear temperature gradient over the cross-section, geometrical and material nonlinearity and temperature dependent material properties. Results obtained using a general Finite Element software - LUSAS and a fire dedicated software - SAFIR, are compared. The influence of following variables: beam span/depth ratio, lateral restraint, gradient temperature within the cross-section and mechanical load level is presented in the paper. The failure modes, the development of the internal forces and displacements throughout the analysis are considered to exemplify the effects of the variables considered. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
