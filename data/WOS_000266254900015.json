In this paper, SOA (Service-oriented Architecture) is adopted to establish a Service-Oriented SBA supporting environment for effectively sharing and integrating different, heterogeneous acquisition resources as services. The SBA supporting environment is mainly for astronautics/aeronautics product acquisition process. Architecture of Service-Oriented SBA supporting environment is proposed and a prototype system is established to support collaborative acquisition process. The focus is put on the realization of a SBA collaborative environment, which is the core part of the SBA supporting environment. implementation and integration of four kinds of key services and related technologies in the SBA collaborative environment are introduced separately. The services are the collaborative management service, the meta-synthesis workshop service, the collaborative modeling/simulation platform service and the collaborative PDM service.
