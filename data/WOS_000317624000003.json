Later, a revised version of the R-K model was proposed by Grunau et al. [D. Grunau, S. Chen and K. Eggert, Phys. Fluids A: Fluid Dyn. 5, 2557 (1993).] and claimed it was able to simulate two-phase ows with high-density contrast. Some studies investigate high-density contrast two-phase ows using this revised R-K model but they are mainly focused on the stationary spherical droplet and bubble cases. Through theoretical analysis of the model, we found that in the recovered Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations which are derived from the R-K model, there are unwanted extra terms. These terms disappear for simulations of two-phase ows with identical densities, so the correct N-S equations are fully recovered. Hence, the R-K model is able to give accurate results for ows with identical densities. However, the unwanted terms may affect the accuracy of simulations significantly when the densities of the two uids are different. For the simulations of spherical bubbles and droplets immersed in another fluid ( where the densities of the two uids are different), the extra terms may not be important and hence, in terms of surface tension, accurate results can be obtained. However, generally speaking, the unwanted term may be significant in many ows and the R-K model is unable to obtain the correct results due to the effect of the extra terms. Through numerical simulations of parallel two-phase ows in a channel, we confirm that the R-K model is not appropriate for general two-phase ows with different densities. A scheme to eliminate the unwanted terms is also proposed and the scheme works well for cases of density ratios less than 10.", "paper_title": "ON SIMULATIONS OF HIGH-DENSITY RATIO FLOWS USING COLOR-GRADIENT MULTIPHASE LATTICE BOLTZMANN MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000317624000003"}
