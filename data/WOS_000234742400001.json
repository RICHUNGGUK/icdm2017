These tend to identify the largest subarray that is possible without concentrating on the power efficiency of the resulting subarray. In this paper, we propose new techniques, based on heuristic strategy and dynamic programming, to minimize the interconnect length in an attempt to reduce power dissipation without performance penalty. Our algorithms show that notable improvements in the reduction of the number of long interconnects could be realized in linear time and without sacrificing the size of the subarray. Our evaluations show that, for a VLSI array of size 256 x 256, the number of long interconnects in the subarray can be reduced by up to 95 percent for clustered faults and up to 50 percent and 73 percent for a random fault with density of 10 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively, when compared with the most efficient implementation cited in the literature. The interconnect power saving for a VLSI array of size 512 x 512 is by up to 11 percent for a random fault. We have also shown that interconnect power savings of up to 14 percent are possible for the cases investigated. Simulations based on several random and clustered fault scenarios clearly reveal the superiority of the proposed techniques for power efficient realizations. In addition, the lower bound of the performance has been proposed to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are nearly optimal for the cases considered in this paper.", "paper_title": "Reconfiguration algorithms for power efficient VLSI subarrays with four-port switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000234742400001"}
