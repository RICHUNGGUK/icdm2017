The state look-ahead path prepares the counting path's next counter state prior to the clock edge such that the clock edge triggers all modules simultaneously, thus concurrently updating the count state with a uniform delay at all counting path modules/stages with respect to the clock edge. The structure is scalable to arbitrary N-bit counter widths (2-to-2N range) using only the three module types and no fan-in or fan-out increase. The counter's delay is comprised of the initial module access time (a simple 2-bit counting stage), one three-input AND-gate delay, and a D-type flip-flop setup-hold time. We implemented our proposed counter using a 0.15-mu m TSMC digital cell library and verified maximum operating speeds of 2 and 1.8 GHz for 8- and 17-bit counters, respectively. Finally, the area of a sample 8-bit counter was 78 125 mu m(2) (510 transistors) and consumed 13.89mW at 2 GHz.", "paper_title": "A Digital CMOS Parallel Counter Architecture Based on State Look-Ahead Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000290998700009"}
