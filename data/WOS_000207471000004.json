In this paper, a new approach to decision-making with key constraint is introduced. First, four relevant fuzzy decision-making methods are reviewed. Then a novel and practical approach, composed of 10 stages, is proposed. The theoretical basis of the approach is made up of improved analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy set theory, fuzzy relationships between goals, ordered weighted averaging operators, and fuzzy mathematics from qualitative analysis to quantitative analysis. In addition, the concept of key constraint is discussed, which renders the derivation of the decision in the evaluation process faster and easier. Finally, a computer system for the evaluation and selection of technology is developed, and an illustrative example is given to show the application of the approach. The approach has several merits, such as simple and less computation in the process of evaluation and selection. By using this approach, the ambiguities involved in the evaluation can be effectively represented to assure more convincing and effective decision-making.", "paper_title": "A new approach to decision-making with key constraint and its application in enterprise information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000207471000004"}
