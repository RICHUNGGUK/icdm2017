Numerical methods used to calculate the arc length are time-consuming processes which make generating a feedrate profile with desired accelerations difficult in real-time. This paper introduces a look-ahead trajectory generation method which determines the deceleration stage according to the fast estimated arc length and the reverse interpolation of each curve at every sampling time. This results in a feedrate trajectory generation with jerk-limited acceleration profiles for the NURBS curves. The feedrate profile is adjusted dynamically according to the geometrical path constraint determined by chord error for the curved path. A NURBS curve by two different kinematics conditions was used as a means to test the feasibility of the developed interpolation scheme and command generator. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
