T might intersect A several times, and our aim is to detect whether T visits A with some regularity, e. g. what is the longest time span that a GPS-GSM equipped elephant visited a specific lake on a daily ( weekly or yearly) basis, where the elephant has to visit the lake most of the days ( weeks or years), but not necessarily on every day ( week or year). During the modelling of such applications, we encountered an elementary problem on bitstrings, that we call LDS (LONGESTDENSESUBSTRING). The bits of the bitstring correspond to a sequence of regular time points, in which a bit is set to 1 if and only if the trajectory T intersects the area A at the corresponding time point. For the LDS problem, we are given a string s as input and want to output a longest substring of s, such that the ratio of 1's in the substring is at least a certain threshold. In our model, LDS is a core problem for many applications that aim at detecting regularity of T intersecting A. We propose an optimal algorithm to solve LDS, and also for related problems that are closer to applications, we provide efficient algorithms for detecting regularity.", "paper_title": "Detecting Regular Visit Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000290267000007"}
