The input soil property for sandy soils only needs a relative density which can be easily estimated from in situ tests. The strain wedge depth is calculated by an iterative process and the subgrade reaction modulus below the strain wedge is assumed to increase linearly with depth, though it does not change with the lateral load applied to the pile. Seven case histories are used to verify the applicability of the proposed method. The results show the following: (1) good agreements are found between the predicted and the measured results of full scale tested piles; (2) the predicted deflections and moments using the Duncan-Chang model are almost the same as those using the Mohr-Coulomb model; and (3) the size effect of the pile diameter or width on the subgrade reaction modulus should be considered.
