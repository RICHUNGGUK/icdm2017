It demands mechanism for coherently satisfying agent goals depending on changing availability of resources one the fly. Leveraging context-aware techniques and agent-oriented approaches, the paper proposes a lightweight architecture to build adaptive but predictable goal-driven ubiquitous agent systems based on OSGi (Open Service Gateway initiative), an open standard service-oriented framework. The proposed platform not only supports context acquisition, discovery and reasoning, but also provides a centric goal resolution mechanism using goal-tree to automatically specify service components for the satisfaction of agent goals. A Context Pair Language and the production rule are used as semantic basis to model contextual information as well as the goals.", "paper_title": "A lightweight architecture to support context-aware ubiquitous agent system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100081"}
