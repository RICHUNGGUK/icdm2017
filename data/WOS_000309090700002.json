In recent years, more and more applications have been found for its use. However, there are still many security issues worth discussing. In this paper, we propose a mutual authentication scheme, which can solve problems such as privacy, replay attack, forward security, and user location privacy. In our scheme, we only use the tag for the purposes of being a storage media based on EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 (CIG2) standards. Analysis shows that the proposed scheme can resist known attacks and can be used in light-weight RFID systems of the current low-cost tags.", "paper_title": "A Novel Mutual Authentication Scheme for RFID Conforming EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 Standards", "paper_id": "WOS:000309090700002"}
