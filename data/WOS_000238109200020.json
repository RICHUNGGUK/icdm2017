We show that syntactic incremental branching programs capture previously studied structured models of computation for the problem GEN, namely marking machines [Co74] and Poon's extension [Po93] of jumping automata on graphs [CoRa80]. We then prove exponential size lower bounds for our syntactic incremental model, and for some other restricted branching program models as well. We further show that nondeterministic syntactic incremental branching programs are provably stronger than their deterministic counterpart when solving a natural NL-complete GEN subproblem. It remains open if syntactic incremental branching programs are as powerful as unrestricted branching programs for GEN problems.", "paper_title": "Incremental branching programs - Extended abstract", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200020"}
