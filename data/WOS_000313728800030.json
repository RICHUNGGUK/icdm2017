Properties of this opportunistic detection rule are discussed and its key asymptotic behavior in the large sample size limit is established. Specifically, a Chernoff-Stein lemma type of characterization of the exponential decay rate of the miss probability under the Neyman-Pearson criterion is established, and consequently, a performance metric of asymptotic exponential efficiency loss is proposed and discussed, which is exactly the ratio between the Kullback-Leibler distance and the Chernoff information of the two hypotheses. Analytical results are corroborated by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Opportunistic Detection Under a Fixed-Sample-Size Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000313728800030"}
