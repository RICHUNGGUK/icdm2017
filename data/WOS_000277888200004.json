Edge services allow clients to access Internet services via distributed edge servers that operate on a shared collection of underlying data. Although it is generally difficult to share data while providing high availability, good performance, and strong consistency, replication algorithms designed for specific access patterns can offer nearly ideal trade-offs among these metrics. In this paper, we focus on the key problem of sharing read/write data objects across a collection of edge servers when the references to each object 1) tend not to exhibit high concurrency across multiple nodes and 2) tend to exhibit bursts of read-dominated or write-dominated behavior. Dual-quorum replication combines volume leases and quorum-based techniques to achieve excellent availability, response time, and consistency for such workloads. In particular, through both analytical and experimental evaluations, we show that the dual-quorum protocol can (for the workloads of interest) approach the optimal performance and availability of Read-One/Write-All-Asynchronously (ROWA-A) epidemic algorithms without suffering the weak consistency guarantees and resulting design complexity inherent in ROWA-A systems.", "paper_title": "Dual-Quorum: A Highly Available and Consistent Replication System for Edge Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000277888200004"}
