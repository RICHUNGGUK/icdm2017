Our main results are: (i) If the objects are 3-dimensional balls that roll on a plane, then we can detect collisions with a KDS of size O(n log n) that can handle events in O(log(2) n) time. This structure processes O(n(2)) events in the worst case, assuming that the objects follow constant-degree algebraic trajectories. (ii) If the objects are convex fat 3-dimensional objects of constant complexity that are free-flying in R-3, then we can detect collisions with a KDS of O(n log(6) n) size that can handle events in O(log(7) n) time. This structure processes O(n(2)) events in the worst case, assuming that the objects follow constant-degree algebraic trajectories. If the objects have similar sizes then the size of the KDS becomes O(n) and events can be handled in O(log n) time.", "paper_title": "Kinetic Collision Detection for Convex Fat Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000264698900002"}
