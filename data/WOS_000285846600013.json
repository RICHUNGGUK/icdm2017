While significant progress has been made over the last decade, most of the techniques were developed and optimized based on the point-to-point communication model. Recently, the cooperative communication model has attracted a lot of attention due to the fact that it may achieve significantly better performance than the traditional wireless network models. In this article we develop a generic wireless network design framework based on physical layer network coding as a novel cooperation technique. In this framework several transmitters in a cooperative network may transmit signals simultaneously to the same receiver to improve overall performance. The topics addressed in this article include network capacity, modulation, channel coding, and security issues from a viewpoint fundamentally different from the traditional communication models.", "paper_title": "COOPERATIVE WIRELESS NETWORKS BASED ON PHYSICAL LAYER NETWORK CODING", "paper_id": "WOS:000285846600013"}
