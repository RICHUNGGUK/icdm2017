The analytical thesis backing the whole work consists in interpreting such statements as contextual classifications. This reading of counts-as is thoroughly investigated in two variants which we call the contextual classificatory reading and the proper contextual classificatory reading. The formal analysis of these readings, which we carry out making use of modal logic, disentangles two possible senses in which counts-as statements can be interpreted within a classificatory perspective, and clarifies the logical relations holding between them. The proposal is then compared in detail with previous work on the topic, in order to shed light on similarities, differences and their grounds.", "paper_title": "Classificatory aspects of counts-as: An analysis in modal logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000241783100005"}
