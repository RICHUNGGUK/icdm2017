In this algorithm, the edge-to-edge contacts are simply transformed to be vertex-to-face ones, which are the basic 3-D contact pattern in discrete element analysis. The contact transformation reduces the complexity of the 3-D contact calculations and improves the efficiency of calculation procedure, in comparison with the conventional edge-to-edge contact algorithm. The algorithm has been successfully programmed in C. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
