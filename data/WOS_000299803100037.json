To train and test the fuzzy system, numerical data obtained from the finite element analyses is utilized. For this aim, a degenerate-continuum shell element which accounts for material and geometric nonlinearity is employed. Also, a least squares algorithm has been applied to determine the parameters of the fuzzy system such that the resulting fuzzy system accomplishes the desired performance. The proposed fuzzy system is capable of tracing the complete load-shortening relation and provides a tool for faster analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
