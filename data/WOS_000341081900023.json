Because these two optimization criteria conflict with each other, a compromise needs to be made between them according to the given task type. This paper proposes a new cost function to evaluate the static task assignments and a heuristic algorithm for solving the transformed problem explicitly describing the tradeoff between the two goals. The simulation results showed that this approach outperforms the existing representative approach for a range of tasks and processing systems.", "paper_title": "On tradeoff between the two compromise factors in assigning tasks on a cluster computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341081900023"}
