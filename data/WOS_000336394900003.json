This paper introduces band-pass white noise patterns designed specifically to reduce the effects of indirect illumination, and still be robust to standard challenges in scanning systems such as scene depth discontinuities, defocus and low camera-projector pixel ratio. While this approach uses unstructured light patterns that increase the number of required projected images, it is up to our knowledge the first method that is able to recover scene disparities in the presence of both indirect illumination and scene discontinuities. Furthermore, the method does not require calibration (geometric nor photometric) or post-processing such as phase unwrapping or interpolation from sparse correspondences. We show results for a few challenging scenes and compare them to correspondences obtained with the Phase-shift method and the recently introduced method by Gupta et al., designed specifically to handle indirect illumination.", "paper_title": "Unstructured Light Scanning Robust to Indirect Illumination and Depth Discontinuities", "paper_id": "WOS:000336394900003"}
