Misuse case modeling is a technique that stems from traditional use case modeling, which facilitates the elicitation and modeling functional security requirements at the requirements phase. Misuse case modeling is an effective vehicle to potentially identify a large subset of these threats. It is therefore crucial to develop high quality misuse case models otherwise end system developed will be vulnerable to security threats. Templates to describe misuse cases are populated with syntax-free natural language content. The inherent ambiguity of syntax-free natural language coupled with the crucial role of misuse case models in development can have a very detrimental effect. This paper proposes a structure that will guide misuse case authors towards developing consistent misuse case models. This paper also presents a process that utilizes this structure to ensure the consistency of misuse case models as they evolve, eliminating potential damages caused by inconsistencies. A tool was developed to provide automation support for the proposed structure and process. The feasibility and application of this approach were demonstrated using two real-world case studies.
