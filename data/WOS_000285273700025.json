In this paper, we propose a unified framework for 3D fragmented object patching, and the contributions lies in: 1) a unified framework for 3D fragmented object patching consisting of 3D shape feature extraction, 3D surface region segmentation and 3D surface matching is proposed; 2) a novel geometry projection based 3D histogram model is proposed to extract the shape feature of 3D fragmented object robust to noise and sampling of 3D model; 3) a surface segmentation based on region dilation method is presented with the enough considering of the influence of surface coarseness on 3D surface region segmentation instead of handling the debris with regular shape, flat surface and few broken surfaces using the current algorithms; 4) a 3D surface matching based on height-map using 3D shape features directly instead of using curves of debris as match features as the current algorithms. The experiments are implemented on the simulation data and the real 3D scanning data of the fragmented object with a Roland LPX-250 3D laser scanner, and the results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible and effective.", "paper_title": "AN UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR 3D FRAGMENTED OBJECT PATCHING", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700025"}
