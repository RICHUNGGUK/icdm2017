However, in order for some DSDs in the literature to behave in an expected manner, the initial number of copies of some reagents is required to be fixed. In this paper we show that, when multiple copies of all initial molecules are present, general types of CRNs and DSDs fail to work correctly if the length of the shortest sequence of reactions needed to produce any given molecule exceeds a threshold that grows polynomially with attributes of the system.", "paper_title": "Reachability bounds for chemical reaction networks and strand displacement systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344922100007"}
