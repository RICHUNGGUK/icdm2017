In Eurocrypt'94, Li et al.. [Threshold-multisignature schemes where suspected forgery implies traceability of adversarial shareholders. In: Advances in Cryptotogy-Proceedings of EUROCRYPT 94; 1994. p. 413-9] proposed a threshold signature scheme with traceability, which allows us to trace back to find the signer without revealing the secret keys. And in 2001, Lee [Threshold signature scheme with multiple signing policies. IEE Proc Comput Digit Tech 2001;148(2):95-9) proposed a threshold signature scheme with multiple signing policies, which allows multiple secret keys to be shared among a group of users, and each secret key has its specific threshold value. In this paper, based on these schemes, we present a traceable threshold signature scheme with multiple signing policies, which not only inherits their properties, but also fixes their weaknesses.
