For large multidimensional arrays where dense and sparse chunks are stored differently, proper normalization can lead to improved storage efficiency. We show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal normalization even for 1 x 3 chunks, although we find an exact algorithm for 1 x 2 chunks. When dimensions are nearly statistically independent, we show that dimension-wise attribute frequency sorting is an optimal normalization and takes time O(dn log(n)) for data cubes of size n(d). When dimensions are not independent, we propose and evaluate a several heuristics. The hybrid OLAP (HOLAP), storage mechanism is already 19-30% more efficient than ROLAP, but normalization can improve it further by 9-13% for a total gain of 29-44% over ROLAP. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
