A challenge is the detection of threshold crossing of network-wide variables, which are computed from device counters across the network, using aggregation functions such as SUM, MAX and AVERAGE. This paper contains a detailed description and a comprehensive evaluation of TCA-GAP, a protocol for detecting threshold crossings of network-wide aggregates in a distributed way. Elements of its design include tree-based incremental aggregation for estimating the value of aggregates, a local hysteresis mechanism to reduce overhead and dynamic recomputation of local thresholds to ensure correctness. The protocol is evaluated through extensive simulation using real traces in scenarios with network sizes up to 5232 nodes. From the measurements, we conclude that the protocol is efficient in the sense that the overhead is negligible when the aggregate is far from the threshold. It is scalable as the protocol overhead is independent of the system size for the network sizes and scenario configurations considered. We demonstrate that the local hysteresis parameter can be used to control the tradeoff between protocol overhead and detection delay. We further report on results on how node failures impact overhead and detection quality of the protocol. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
