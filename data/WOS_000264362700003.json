However, it is not an easy task to know a priori the most appropriate fuzzy sets that cover the domains of quantitative attributes for mining fuzzy association rules. This paper thus presents a new fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting both fuzzy association rules and membership functions by means of a genetic learning of the membership functions and a basic method for mining fuzzy association rules. It is based on the 2-tuples linguistic representation model allowing us to adjust the context associated to the linguistic term membership functions. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the framework. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
