Community detection algorithms are then useful to reveal the sub-structures of a network and in particular interest groups. Identifying these users' communities and the interests that bind them can help us assist their life-cycle. Certain kinds of online communities such as question-and-answer (Q& A) sites, have no explicit social network structure. Therefore, many traditional community detection techniques do not apply directly. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for extracting topic from Q& A to detect communities of interest. Then we compare three detection methods we applied on a dataset extracted from the popular Q& A site StackOverflow. Our method based on topic modeling and user membership assignment is shown to be much simpler and faster while preserving the quality of the detection.", "paper_title": "Detecting topics and overlapping communities in question and answer sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000366196300002"}
