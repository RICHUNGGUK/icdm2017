Herein, proTF is constructed to serve as a comprehensive data resource and phylogenomics analysis platform for prokaryotic TFs. It has many prominent characteristics: (i) detailed annotation information, including basic sequence features, domain organization, sequence homolog and sequence composition, was extensively collected, and then visually displayed for each TF entry in all prokaryotic genomes; (ii) workset was employed as the basic frame to provide an efficient way to organize the retrieved data and save intermediate records; and (iii) a number of elaborated tools for phylogenomics analysis were implemented to investigate the evolutionary roles of specific TFs. In conclusion, proTF dedicates to the prokaryotic TFs with integrated multi-function, which will become a valuable resource for prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory network in the post-genomic era.", "paper_title": "proTF: a comprehensive data and phylogenomics resource for prokaryotic transcription factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000282170000031"}
