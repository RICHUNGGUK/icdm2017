The activation functions are assumed to be neither differentiable nor strict monotonic and the delays are time-varying. Furthermore, based on the approach of linear matrix inequality (LMI), a new inequality and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional are applied to derive the results of robust asymptotical stability. Also, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our results. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
