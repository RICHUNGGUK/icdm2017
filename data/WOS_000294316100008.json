The underlying technique is similar to the one used in previous work on reversible circuit synthesis methods based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs). Our method can be considered to be a generalization of the previous work in the sense that we can synthesis SCQCs which include reversible circuits as a special case. Moreover, we introduce some new ideas concerning how to consider the trade-off between the numbers of gates and qubits, and how to optimize the designed circuit by changing the variable order of the given DDMF.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Semi-Classical Quantum Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000294316100008"}
