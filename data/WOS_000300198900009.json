In the present method, the concept of the BTC-PF is used for faster decoding. Here, images are decomposed into a number of blocks based on smoothness criterion. The smooth blocks are encoded by block means and the others are by BTC-PF method. To encode a block by BTC-PF method, the codebook is organized like a full search progressive transmission tree which helps greatly in efficient progressive transmission. The present method provides good image quality at low bit-rate and faster decoding compared to other spatial domain progressive transmission methods. We extend this method for color images also. In color image coding, each color plane is encoded separately and then the encoded information of the planes are transmitted in interleaving manner to obtain color images right from the early stages.
