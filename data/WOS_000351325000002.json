SRC is essentially an L-0-norm minimization problem which can theoretically yield the sparsest representation and lead to the promising classification performance. We know that it is difficult to directly resolve L-0-norm minimization problem by applying usual optimization method. To effectively address this problem, we propose the L-0-norm based SRC by exploiting a modified genetic algorithm (GA), termed GASRC, in this paper. The basic idea of GASRC is that it modifies the traditional genetic algorithm and then uses the modified GA (MGA) to select a part of the training samples to represent a test sample. Compared with the conventional SRC based on L-1-norm optimization, GASRC can achieve better classification performance. Experiments on several popular real-world databases show the good classification effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
