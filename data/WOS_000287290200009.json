Quantitative remote-sensing retrieval is a complex computing process because of the terabytes or petabytes of data processed and the tight-coupling remote-sensing algorithms. In this paper, we intend to demonstrate the use of grid computing for quantitative remote-sensing retrieval applications with a workload estimation and task partition algorithm. Using a grid workflow for the quantitative remote-sensing retrieval service is an intuitive way to use the grid service for users without grid expertise. A case study showed that significant improvement in the system performance could be achieved with this implementation. The results of the case study also give a perspective on the potential of applying grid computing practices to remote-sensing problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
