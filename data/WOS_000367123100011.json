Going one step further, we also consider coordinated workplace charging integrating PV panels. The main focus of our work is to conduct a comparative study between a centralised benchmark algorithm, and the proposed decentralised and hybrid approaches from both communications and power perspectives. All algorithms are co-simulated over a converged fiber-wireless communication infrastructure of 342 residential customers. Power system results prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithms providing up to 19% peak shaving while meeting drivers' requirements. Communication results of the decentralised algorithm compared to a centralised benchmark scheme provided better performance, measuring an upstream traffic rate of 1.28 Mbps with a maximum delay of 0.629 ms. Compared to the decentralised algorithm, the hybrid algorithm showed a promising improvement for large fleets of PEVs accompanied with an overhead communication cost that is significantly less than that of the centralised algorithm.
