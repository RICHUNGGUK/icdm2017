The program is based on iterated sector decomposition. We improve the original algorithm of Binoth and Heinrich such that the program is guaranteed to terminate. The program can be used to compute numerically the Laurent expansion of divergent multi-loop integrals regulated by dimensional regularisation. The symbolic and the numerical steps of the algorithm are combined into one program.
