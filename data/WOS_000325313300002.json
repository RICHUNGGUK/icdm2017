So many problems in the real world such as project selection, supplier selection, location allocation problems etc, have uncertain nature which can be provided to formulate vagueness of real environment. In this paper a two phase decision making model is developed for ranking VSs in which VS's coordinate and scale of vagueness are considered as decision making criteria. At the end, two numerical examples are presented to provide more explanation of developed model and illustration of its efficiency.", "paper_title": "Ranking vague sets using TOPSIS method", "paper_id": "WOS:000325313300002"}
