Due to the lack of robustness of automatic voice source analysis methods we have tended to use labour intensive methods which require pulse-by-pulse manual optimisation. This has affected the feasibility of conducting analysis on large volumes of data. To address this, a new method is proposed for automatic parameterisation of the deterministic component of the voice source by simulating the strategies used in the manual optimisation approach. The method involves a combination of exhaustive search, dynamic programming and optimisation methods, with settings derived from analysis of previous manual voice source analysis. A quantitative evaluation demonstrated clearly closer model parameter values to our reference values, compared with a standard time domain-based approach and a phase minimisation method. A complementary qualitative analysis illustrated broadly similar findings, in terms of voice source dynamics in various placements of focus, when using the proposed algorithm compared with a previous study which employed the manual optimisation approach.
