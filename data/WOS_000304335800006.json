In this paper, we propose a reversible scheme based on mixed base notation and dissimilar pattern strategies for vector quantization (VQ) compressed images. The dissimilar patterns resulting from the declustering process make the proposed hiding method more efficient. Our experimental results show that the time required for the embedding process in the proposed method is much less than that in the side-matched VQ (SMVQ)-based reversible method. In addition, the use of declustering can reduce many more prediction errors than traditional clustering methods. The results also show that the number of declustered groups and the spatial characteristics of the cover image will affect the embedding capacity and the size of the stego VQ index table.
