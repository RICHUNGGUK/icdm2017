Voice over IP may replace voice circuits in the next generations of wireless networks, and it is the type of traffic that benefits most from header compression because its packets have small pay-loads, IEEE 802.11 is a technology that will play an important role in the next generations of wireless networks. The study reported in this article shows that the maximum gain of the RoHC's U-mode when applied to VoIP over IEEE 802.11. is about 23 percent for medium or better voice quality. Values for the RoHC U-mode parameters over IEEE 802.11 are also suggested.", "paper_title": "HEADER COMPRESSED VOIP IN IEEE 802.11", "paper_id": "WOS:000267268700011"}
