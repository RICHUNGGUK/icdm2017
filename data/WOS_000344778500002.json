In this contribution we deal with fuzzy versions of these rationality conditions and we study the connection between them. We recall results found in the literature and we prove that they are valid under weaker conditions. We also present new implications and counterexamples that show that our results cannot be obtained under weaker conditions.", "paper_title": "On Arrow-Sen style equivalences between rationality conditions for fuzzy choice functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000344778500002"}
