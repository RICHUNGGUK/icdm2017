Various IP paging architectures rely on multicast/broadcast to send their messages in wireless network. However. multicast/broadcast is unreliable and has limited bandwidth in power saving mode. This paper uses unicast to avoid exhaustion of the limited bandwidth and reliably page mobile nodes (MNs) by layer 2's supporting acknowledgment in nature. Furthermore. We successfully suppress the amount of BU by remembering and checking MN's ever attached on-link care of addresses (LCoAs) in the stack, which is maintained by least recently used (LRU) algorithm for efficiently paging while MNs moving, in a localized pattern. We simulate this mechanism to obtain the optimal stack size, which can dramatically reduce the signals of location update and paging.
