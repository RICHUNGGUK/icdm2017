As a result, this article adopts two mathematical approaches: data envelopment analysis (DEA) and analytical hierarchical process (AHP) to construct a stock selection framework using 31 listed US Internet companies. The empirical results from this study form the basis for discussion of the combined DEA and AHP approach for selecting Internet stocks. The findings confirm the usefulness of the combined approach that incorporates efficiency analysis and structural decision making. Implications of these findings are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Selecting Internet company stocks using a combined DEA and AHP approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000274636000007"}
