We show that on any finite alphabet, this estimator has an exponentially decaying bias and that it is consistent and asymptotically normal. To explain the importance of this estimator, we provide a thorough analysis of the more standard plug-in estimator. We show that it is consistent and asymptotically normal, but with an infinite bias. Moreover, if we modify the plug-in estimator to remove the rare events that cause the bias to become infinite, the bias still decays at a rate no faster than O(1/n). Further, we extend our results to estimating the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence. We conclude by providing simulation results, which show that the asymptotic properties of these estimators hold even for relatively small sample sizes.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric Estimation of Kullback-Leibler Divergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000343186700009"}
