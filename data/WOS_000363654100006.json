We explore the effectiveness of this mobile AR technology in the context of grocery shopping, in particular as a means to assist shoppers in making healthier decisions as they decide which grocery products to buy. We construct an AR-assisted mobile grocery-shopping application that makes real-time, customized recommendations of healthy products to users and also highlights products to avoid for various types of health concerns, such as allergies to milk or nut products, low-sodium or low-fat diets, and general caloric intake. We have implemented a prototype of this AR-assisted mobile grocery shopping application and evaluated its effectiveness in grocery store aisles. Our application's evaluation with typical grocery shoppers demonstrates that AR overlay tagging of products reduces the search time to find healthy food items, and that coloring the tags helps to improve the user's ability to quickly and easily identify recommended products, as well as products to avoid. We have evaluated our application's functionality by analyzing the data we collected from 15 in-person actual grocery-shopping subjects and 104 online application survey participants.", "paper_title": "Supporting Healthy Grocery Shopping via Mobile Augmented Reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000363654100006"}
