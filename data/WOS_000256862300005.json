The sufficient condition is proved by constructing a continued fraction that represents the lower and upper bound variations of the system trajectory along the current of time, and showing that the continued fraction converges to the equilibrium point of the system. The simulation results show the validity of the sufficient condition, and illustrate that the sufficient condition is a close approximation to the unknown necessary and sufficient condition for the global asymptotic stability.", "paper_title": "A global stability analysis of a class of nolinear time-delay systems using continued fraction property", "paper_id": "WOS:000256862300005"}
