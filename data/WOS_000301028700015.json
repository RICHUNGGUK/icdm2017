The model has been efficiently implemented in the LAMMPS code. In addition to existing models, adhesive forces and - gliding, rolling, and torsional - friction processes are implemented. The code scales linearly with grain number up to similar to 10(6) on a single processor and inherits the excellent parallelization features of the LAMMPS code on multi-processor machines. We validate the code by determining the velocity of sound of granular agglomerates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
