The emerging wireless communication technologies broaden the usage of software in mobile platforms, enabling the pervasive computing paradigm, where people can access information/service anytime and anywhere with portable devices. In the pervasive networking environment where mobile devices operate on the ad hoc mode and communicate with each other opportunistically without wireless infrastructures, distributing the evolving software updates to a set of mobile terminals is a challenging task. In this paper, we address the problem of distributing multiple software updates in pervasive networks with storage and bandwidth constraints, and propose age-based solutions to tackle this problem. The basic idea is to introduce different age-based priority mechanisms for propagation decision making in order to resolve the contention of wireless bandwidth and storage buffer. We investigate a number of update propagation strategies including random spread, youngest age, and golden age. Mathematical models are derived to analyse the performance of the proposed strategies. It is shown that the golden age strategy has the burst effect, which could be used to enhance the efficiency of software update distribution. The principles for choosing golden age values are proposed aiming to optimize different utility metrics. Extensive simulations under various network parameters show that the golden age strategy outperforms other strategies for multi-source software updates propagation.", "paper_title": "Golden age: on multi-source software update propagation in pervasive networking environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000323665900008"}
