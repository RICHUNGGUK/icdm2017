For a 3-letter alphabet, scattered substrings are shown to require at least 2(root 2n+30-6) states. A similar state complexity function for scattered superstrings is determined to be exactly 2(n-2) + 1 for an alphabet of at least n-2 letters, and strictly less for any smaller alphabet. For a 3-letter alphabet, the state complexity of scattered superstrings is at least 1/54(root n/2)n(-3/4).", "paper_title": "On the State Complexity of Scattered Substrings and Superstrings", "paper_id": "WOS:000279637900005"}
