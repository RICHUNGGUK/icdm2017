Word-level information is effective for analysis of known words, while character-level information is useful for analysis of unknown, words. A Hidden semi-CRF model is proposed for the unknown words detection. and POS tagging. The proposed Hidden semi-CRF has two state chains with unequal states which Can perform segmentation and POS tagging of unknown words simultaneously. The hybrid model was evaluated using the test data from SIGHAN-6 and achieved higher F-score than the stage-of-the-art models.", "paper_title": "CHINESE LEXICAL ANALYSIS BASED ON HYBRID MMSM MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800012"}
