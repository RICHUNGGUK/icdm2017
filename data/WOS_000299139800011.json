As an alternative, panorama-like views preserve the similarity between 3D scenes before and after the deformations while ensuring the visibility of interested features. In this paper, an automatic method for generating panoramic map-like views is proposed in mountainous areas. The created panorama-like views by moving up the view position as well as the terrain deformation can successfully avoid occlusions of the FOIs. The final views also ensure the resemblance in appearance for the FOIs and landscapes, and thus satisfy the demand for interactive occlusion-free navigation in 3D complex terrain environments.
