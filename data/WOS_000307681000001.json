The paper presents a knowledge-based and distributed framework that simulates the behaviour of an irrigation system and permits accurate determination of irrigation timing. Several agents, which represent the actors involved in this problem, coordinate their activities in order to evaluate different irrigation strategies. A common ontology shares the knowledge required in the agent-based framework, which can be tuned according to the particular circumstances of the field. The usefulness of the developed system is demonstrated in three case studies, in which the simulations performed by the system provide the answer to different questions (length of irrigation time, comparison of a fixed and a dynamic irrigation policy, and most efficient configuration of a garden). The system simulates the behaviour of the irrigation system for the possible solutions and finds the most efficient one in terms of water consumption. Although only at small areal scale, this paper shows how agent-based simulation techniques can be successfully used to solve agricultural problems. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
