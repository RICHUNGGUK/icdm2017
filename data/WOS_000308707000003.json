An imprecise point is given by a region and this point could lie anywhere within this region. By modelling imprecise points as balls in dimension d, we present an algorithm for this problem that returns in time 2(O(d2))m(2)n(2)log(2)(mn) the minimum Frechet distance between two imprecise polygonal curves with n and m vertices, respectively. We give an improved algorithm for the planar case with running time O(mn log(3)(mn) + (m(2)+n(2)) log(mn)). In the d-dimensional orthogonal case, where points are modelled as axis-parallel boxes, and we use the L-infinity distance, we give an O(dmn log(dmn))-time algorithm. We also give efficient O(dmn)-time algorithms to approximate the maximum Frechet distance, as well as the minimum and maximum Frechet distance under translation. These algorithms achieve constant factor approximation ratios in \"realistic\" settings (such as when the radii of the balls modelling the imprecise points are roughly of the same size).", "paper_title": "COMPUTING THE DISCRETE FRECHET DISTANCE WITH IMPRECISE INPUT", "paper_id": "WOS:000308707000003"}
