A cycle transversal (or feedback vertex set) of a graph G is a subset T subset of V (G) such that T boolean AND V (C) not equal empty set for every cycle C of G; if, in addition, T is a clique, then T is a clique cycle transversal (cct). Finding a cct in a graph G is equivalent to partitioning V (G) into subsets C and F such that C induces a complete subgraph and F an acyclic subgraph. This work considers the problem of characterizing extended P-4-laden graphs admitting a cct. We characterize such graphs by means of a finite family of forbidden induced subgraphs, and present a linear-time algorithm to recognize them.", "paper_title": "Clique cycle transversals in graphs with few P-4's", "paper_id": "WOS:000327036900002"}
