Yet, reasoning on LTSs and relations between their states can be difficult and elusive: very simple process algebra terms can give rise to a large (possibly infinite) number of intricate transitions and interactions. To ease this kind of study, we present LTSwb, a flexible and extensible LTS toolbox: this tutorial paper discusses its design and functionalities.", "paper_title": "The LTS WorkBench", "paper_id": "WOS:000367339200007"}
