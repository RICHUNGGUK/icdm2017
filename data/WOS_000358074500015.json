In particular, by considering the packet loss and time delay in the network, a discrete-time switched system is formulated. Moreover, the packet loss in the network is assumed to occur in a random way, which is described by introducing Bernoulli distributed white sequences. First, results for the exponential stabilization of discrete-time switched NCSs without random packet loss is derived by using the average dwell time approach and multiple Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Next, the attention is focused on designing an observer-based state feedback controller for NCSs with random packet loss which ensures that the resulting error system is exponentially stable. Further, the sufficient conditions for existence of control parameters are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved by using some standard numerical packages. Also, the observer and control gains can be calculated by using the solutions of a set of LMIs. Finally, a numerical example based on DC motor model is provided to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design procedure.", "paper_title": "Observer-based control for switched networked control systems with missing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000358074500015"}
