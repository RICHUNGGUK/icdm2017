One focus of knowledge discovery is knowledge reduction. Based on the reduction theory of classical formal context, this paper proposes the definition of decision formal context and its reduction theory, which extends the reduction theory of concept lattices. In this paper, strong consistence and weak consistence of decision formal context are defined respectively. For strongly consistent decision formal context, the judgment theorems of consistent sets are examined, and approaches to reduction are given. For weakly consistent decision formal context, implication mapping is defined, and its reduction is studied. Finally, the relation between reducts of weakly consistent decision formal context and reducts of implication mapping is discussed.", "paper_title": "Attribute reduction theory of concept lattice based on decision formal contexts", "paper_id": "WOS:000256529900006"}
