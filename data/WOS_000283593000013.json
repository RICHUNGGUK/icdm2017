Beginning with hydrated lithium ion, four or two water molecules have been conveniently introduced to these aqueous-phase halogen-exchange S(N)2 reactions. These water molecules coordinated with the center metal lithium ion, and also interacted with entering and leaving halogen anion via hydrogen bond in complexes and transition state, which to some extent compensated hydration of halogen anion. At 298 K the reaction profiles all involve central barriers Delta E (cent) which are found to decrease in the order F > Cl > Br > I. The same trend is also found for the overall barriers (Delta E (ovr) ) of the title reaction. In the S(N)2 reaction of sodium iodide and methyl iodide, the activation energy agrees well with the aqueous conductometric investigation.", "paper_title": "Theoretical studies on identity S(N)2 reactions of lithium halide and methyl halide: A microhydration model", "paper_id": "WOS:000283593000013"}
