It is based on current bleeding and noise cancellation. An amplifier employing the technique has been designed and simulated in a 90 nm standard CMOS process using a 1 V supply. It has been compared to designs using both basic and cross-coupled common-gate topologies. Simulation results confirm the improvements in gain and noise figure, yielding a superior figure of merit for the new technique.", "paper_title": "A technique for improving gain and noise figure of common-gate wideband LNAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000282224500007"}
