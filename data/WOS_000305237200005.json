Significant research effort has been devoted to determining the network design with optimal robustness. However, little attention has been paid to the problem of how to improve the robustness of existing networks. In this paper, we investigate how to optimize attack tolerance and communication efficiency of an existing network under the limited link addition. A survival fitness metric is defined to measure both the attack tolerance and the communication efficiency of the network. We show that network topology reconfiguration optimization with limited link addition (NTRLA) problem is NP-hard. Two approximate solution methods are developed. First, we present a degree-fitness parameter to guide degree-based link addition method. Second, a preferential configuration node-protecting cycle (PCNC) method is developed to do trade-off between network robustness and efficiency. The performance of PCNC method is demonstrated by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Enhancing the Robustness and Efficiency of Scale-free Network with Limited Link Addition", "paper_id": "WOS:000305237200005"}
