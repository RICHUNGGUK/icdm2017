First, the view-angle of spatial data mining is defined. In its context, the essentials of spatial data mining are further developed. And the view-angle based algorithms are also presented. Second, the view-angles of Baota landslide-monitoring data mining, and their pan-hierarchical relationships, are given. Finally, view-angle III is taken as a case study to discover quantitative, qualitative and visualized knowledge from Baota landslide-monitoring databases. The results indicate that the view-angle based data mining is practical, and the discovered knowledge with various granularities may satisfy spatial decision-making at different hierarchies.", "paper_title": "View-angle of spatial data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200116"}
