Over the years, this process has been dependent on robust applications of data mining and machine learning techniques, which are known to have scalability issues when being applied for recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a k-means clustering-based recommendation algorithm, which addresses the scalability issues associated with traditional recommender systems. An issue with traditional k-means clustering algorithms is that they choose the initial k centroid randomly, which leads to inaccurate recommendations and increased cost for offline training of clusters. The work in this paper highlights how centroid selection in k-means based recommender systems can improve performance as well as being cost saving. The proposed centroid selection method has the ability to exploit underlying data correlation structures, which has been proven to exhibit superior accuracy and performance in comparison to the traditional centroid selection strategies, which choose centroids randomly. The proposed approach has been validated with an extensive set of experiments based on five different datasets (from movies, books, and music domain). These experiments prove that the proposed approach provides a better quality cluster and converges quicker than existing approaches, which in turn improves accuracy of the recommendation provided.
