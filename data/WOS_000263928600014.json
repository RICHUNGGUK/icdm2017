One of the key steps in this technique is the determination of non-norm elements and a sufficient condition for the determination has been given by Kiran and Rajan lately based on algebraic number theory. In this paper, based on Kiran and Rajan's condition, we present a more elementary condition for non-norm elements when signals are QAM or HEX, which is easier to check. With this elementary condition, non-norm elements with smaller absolute values than the existing ones can be found.", "paper_title": "An Elementary Condition for Non-Norm Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000263928600014"}
