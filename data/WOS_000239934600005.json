Operating the grinding machinery, or \"finishing mills,\" requires a great deal of electrical power, which constitutes one of Inland's most significant expenses. This paper discusses a solution that provides Inland Edmonton with a tool to improve the cost-effectiveness of the grinding by directing the finishing mills' schedules, based on a variety of criteria and constraints. The project incorporates issues such as multiple products, varying power rates throughout each day and month, inconsistent productivity rates, inventory capacities, uncertain demand, and other considerations.", "paper_title": "Cost-effective and reliable grinding schedules for inland cement", "paper_id": "WOS:000239934600005"}
