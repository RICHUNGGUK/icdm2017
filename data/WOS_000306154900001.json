The new method consists of the three parts, namely the fuzzy Ratio System, the fuzzy Utopian Reference Point, and the fuzzy Full Multiplicative Form offering a robust comparison of alternatives against multiple objectives. In addition, MULTIMOORA-FG is designed to deal with triangular fuzzy numbers which, in turn, can resemble linguistic variables. MULTIMOORA-FG is a proper instrument for linguistic reasoning under fuzzy environment. In our study an application of personnel selection illustrates the group decision-making procedure according to MULTIMOORA-FG. Given the uncertainties peculiar of personnel selection, the application of multi-objective decision making (MODM) is required in this area. Fuzzy MULTIMOORA enables to aggregate subjective assessments of the decision-makers and thus offer an opportunity to perform a more robust personnel selection. The committee decided to consider eight qualitative characteristics expressed in linguistic variables. A numerical example exhibited possibilities for improvement of human resources management or any other business decision-making by applying MULTIMOORA-FG.", "paper_title": "MULTIMOORA-FG: A Multi-Objective Decision Making Method for Linguistic Reasoning with an Application to Personnel Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000306154900001"}
