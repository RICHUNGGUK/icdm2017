In this work, we first formulate the Black-Scholes equation with a tensor (or matrix) diffusion coefficient into a conservative form. We then present a finite volume method for the resulting equation, based on a fitting technique proposed for a one-dimensional Black-Scholes equation. We show that the method is monotone by proving that the system matrix of the discretized equation is an M-matrix. Numerical experiments, performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the method, will be presented.", "paper_title": "A fitted finite volume method for the valuation of options on assets with stochastic volatilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000237508900005"}
