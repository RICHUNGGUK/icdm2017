To improve the availability of each individual application in a Trust4All system, a runtime configurable fault management mechanism (FMM) is proposed, which detects deviations from given service specifications by intercepting interface calls. When repair is necessary, FMM picks a repair action that incurs the best tradeoff between the success rate and the cost of repair. Considering that it is rather difficult to obtain sufficient information about third party components during their early stage of usage, FMM is designed to be able to accumulate knowledge and adapts its capability accordingly.", "paper_title": "Adaptive runtime fault management for service instances in component-based software applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000249087700002"}
