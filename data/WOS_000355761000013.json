Apart from its educational nature, the app may point towards future ways of performing industrial design. Instead of the usual geometrize, then model and optimize approach, the geometry now automatically adapts to the varying boundary and loading conditions. The app is freely available for iOS at Apple's App Store and at http://www.topopt.dtu.dk/TopOpt3D for Windows and OSX.", "paper_title": "3D interactive topology optimization on hand-held devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000355761000013"}
