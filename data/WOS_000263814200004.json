In this article, we describe a method for characterizing structured objects representing graphs by means of information inequalities. For this, we deal with information inequalities that describe relations between information measures for graphs. Additionally, we sketch an approach for comparing such information measures qualitatively.", "paper_title": "CHARACTERIZING CLASSES OF STRUCTURED OBJECTS BY MEANS OF INFORMATION INEQUALITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000263814200004"}
