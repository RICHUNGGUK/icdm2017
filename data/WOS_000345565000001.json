In this paper, a dynamic graph-based tracker (DGT) is proposed to address these two challenges in a unified framework. In the dynamic target graph, nodes are the target local parts encoding appearance information, and edges are the interactions between nodes encoding inner geometric structure information. This graph representation provides much more information for tracking in the presence of deformation and occlusion. The target tracking is then formulated as tracking this dynamic undirected graph, which is also a matching problem between the target graph and the candidate graph. The local parts within the candidate graph are separated from the background with Markov random field, and spectral clustering is used to solve the graph matching. The final target state is determined through a weighted voting procedure according to the reliability of part correspondence, and refined with recourse to a foreground/background segmentation. An effective online updating mechanism is proposed to update the model, allowing DGT to robustly adapt to variations of target structure. Experimental results show improved performance over several state-of-the-art trackers, in various challenging scenarios.", "paper_title": "Robust Deformable and Occluded Object Tracking With Dynamic Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000345565000001"}
