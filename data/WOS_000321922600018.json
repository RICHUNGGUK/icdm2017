The most stable isomer 7H exhibits a mu value smaller than that of the 9H form by a factor of ca. 3.5. The beta (mu) value of the 9H tautomer is strongly dependent on the computational method employed, as it dramatically influences the beta (mu) (9H)/beta (mu) (7H) ratio, which at the highest correlated MP4/aug-cc-pVDZ level is predicted to be ca. 5. The Coulomb-attenuating hybrid exchange-correlation CAM-B3LYP method is superior to the conventional PBE1PBE, B3LYP, and B97-1 functionals in predicting the beta (mu) values. Differences between the largest diagonal hyperpolarizability components were clarified through hyperpolarizability density analyses. Dipole moment and first-order hyperpolarizability are molecular properties that are potentially useful for distinguishing the 7H from the 9H tautomer.", "paper_title": "Electron correlation effects and density analysis of the first-order hyperpolarizability of neutral guanine tautomers", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600018"}
