Our framework, called limited flooding ODMRP, improves multicasting mechanism by efficiently managing flooding mechanism based on delay characteristics of the contributing nodes. In our model, only the nodes that satisfy the delay requirements can flood the Join-Query messages. We model the contributing nodes as M/M/1 queuing systems. Our framework considers the significant parameters in delay analysis, including random packet arrival, service process, and random channel access in the relying nodes, and exhibits its best performance results under high traffic load. Simulation results reveal that limited flooding ODMRP drastically reduces the packet overhead under various simulation scenarios as compared to original ODMRP.
