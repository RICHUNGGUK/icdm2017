Efficient communication in NoC is critical to the overall SoC performance. Although local congestion has an important impact on communication delay, it is barely taken into account when designing routing algorithms. In this paper, we propose an offline methodology of designing routing algorithm based on channel pressure model to address the local congestion issue. Specifically, the proposed methodology uses divide-conquer with the aim of generating high performance routing algorithms, which are able to balance the load over the network with a consequent reduction of local congestion. By using the proposed methodology, the obtained routing could achieve up to 37% performance improvement (in terms of average communication delay) as compared to the well-known odd-even routing algorithm for 15 x 15 network.", "paper_title": "An Offline Method for Designing Adaptive Routing Based on Pressure Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000348229600012"}
