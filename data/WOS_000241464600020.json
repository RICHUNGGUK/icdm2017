Partial Transmit Sequences (PTS) approach is a distortionless PAPR-reduction scheme which imposes low additional complexity to the overall system. This paper introduces a new version of the PTS algorithm which selects weighting factors from a different set than the ones commonly used. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new PAPR estimation method that reduces the implementation complexity. The proposed architecture reduces the power consumption of the complete transmitter by up to 22% in comparison to OFDM systems where no PAPR reduction method is employed, depending on the power consumption of the power amplifier.", "paper_title": "Low-power maximum magnitude computation for PAPR reduction in OFDM transmitters", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600020"}
