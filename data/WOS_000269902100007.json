In this system paper, we present a framework for interactive video editing. Our focus is on footage from a single, conventional video camera. By relying on spatio-temporal editing techniques operating on the video cube, we do not need to recover 3D scene geometry. Our framework is capable of removing and inserting objects, object motion editing, non-rigid object deformations, keyframe interpolation, as well as emulating camera motion. We demonstrate how movie shots with moderate complexity can be persuasively modified during post-processing.", "paper_title": "Editing Object Behaviour in Video Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000269902100007"}
