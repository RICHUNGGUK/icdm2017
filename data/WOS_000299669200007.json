To date, researchers have proposed various protocols to minimize tag collisions and idle slots - key factors that determine a reader's read rate and energy expenditure. Most of these protocols, however, are designed for single reader systems. To this end, we propose E(2)MAC, an energy efficient, distributed Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for identifying and monitoring tags in RFID-enhanced wireless sensor networks. E(2)MAC exploits the low power capability of a ultra-wideband transceiver and distinct pulses to address the reader collision problem. In addition, it uses ResMon, an enhanced dynamic frame slotted Aloha protocol to read and monitor tags. Lastly, E(2)MAC uses a novel load balancing algorithm to amortize the cost of reading and monitoring tags to multiple readers. These E(2)MAC features ensure that the contention level at each reader is kept at a minimum and distributed fairly. As a result, E(2)MAC has a high reading rate and low energy consumption. In addition, E(2)MAC helps in minimizing the impact of the tag orientation problem, where a tag becomes unreadable if its antenna is parallel to a reader's field lines. In particular, the use of multiple readers increases spatial diversity and hence increases the likelihood that a tag is readable by at least one reader. Our simulation results show E(2)MAC to have very low energy consumption, reading delay and per-reader collision. More importantly, system designers have the flexibility to lower these metrics further with additional readers, bigger frame sizes, or by dividing tags into small groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
