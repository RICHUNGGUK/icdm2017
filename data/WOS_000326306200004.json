For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new method to enable effective fuzzy keyword search in a multi-user system over encrypted cloud data while maintaining keyword privacy. In this new system, differential searching privileges are supported, which is achieved with the technique of attribute-based encryption. Edit distance is utilized to quantify keywords similarity and develop fuzzy keyword search technique, which achieve optimized storage and representation overheads. We further propose a symbol-based trie-traverse searching scheme to improve the search efficiency. Through rigorous security analysis, we show that our proposed solution is secure and privacy-preserving, while correctly realizing the goal of fuzzy keyword search with multiple users.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT MULTI-USER KEYWORD SEARCH OVER ENCRYPTED DATA IN CLOUD COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000326306200004"}
